An '''amorphous metal''' (also known as '''metallic glass''' or '''glassy metal''') is a solid [[metal]]lic material, usually an [[alloy]], with disordered atomic-scale structure. Most metals are [[crystal]]line in their solid state, which means they have a highly ordered arrangement of [[atom]]s. Amorphous metals are non-crystalline, and have a [[structure of liquids and glasses|glass-like structure]]. But unlike common glasses, such as window glass, which are typically electrical [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s, amorphous metals have good [[electrical conductivity]]. There are several ways in which amorphous metals can be produced, including [[extremely rapid cooling]], [[physical vapor deposition]], [[solid-state reaction]], [[ion irradiation]], and [[mechanical alloying]].&lt;ref&gt;Some scientists only consider amorphous metals produced by rapid cooling from a liquid state to be glasses. However, [[materials science|materials scientists]] commonly consider a glass to be any solid non-crystalline material, regardless of how it is produced.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ojovan |first1=M. I. |last2=Lee |first2=W. B. E. |doi=10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2010.05.012 |title=Connectivity and glass transition in disordered oxide systems |journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids |volume=356 |issue=44–49 |pages=2534 |year=2010 |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode=2010JNCS..356.2534O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, small batches of amorphous metals have been produced through a variety of quick-cooling methods. For instance, amorphous metal ribbons have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk ([[melt spinning]]). The rapid cooling, on the order of millions of degrees Celsius a second, is too fast for crystals to form and the material is "locked" in a glassy state. More recently a number of alloys with critical cooling rates low enough to allow formation of amorphous structure in thick layers (over 1 millimeter) have been produced; these are known as '''bulk metallic glasses''' ('''BMG''').  More recently, batches of amorphous steel with three times the strength of conventional steel alloys have been produced.

==History==
{{refimprove|date=April 2012}}
The first reported metallic glass was an [[alloy]] (Au&lt;sub&gt;75&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;) produced at [[Caltech]] by W. Klement (Jr.), Willens and [[Pol Duwez|Duwez]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Non-crystalline Structure in Solidified Gold-Silicon Alloys |doi=10.1038/187869b0 |journal=Nature |date=1960 |pages=869–870 |volume=187 |last1=Klement |first1=W. |last2=Willens |first2=R. H. |last3=Duwez |first3=POL |issue=4740 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..869K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other early glass-forming alloys had to be cooled extremely rapidly (on the order of one [[Mega-|mega]][[kelvin]] per second, 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K/s) to avoid crystallization. An important consequence of this was that metallic glasses could only be produced in a limited number of forms (typically ribbons, foils, or wires) in which one dimension was small so that heat could be extracted quickly enough to achieve the necessary cooling rate. As a result, metallic glass specimens (with a few exceptions) were limited to thicknesses of less than one hundred [[micrometre|micrometers]].

In 1969, an alloy of 77.5% [[palladium]], 6% copper, and 16.5% silicon was found to have [[critical cooling rate]] between 100 and 1000 K/s.

In 1976, H. Liebermann and C. Graham developed a new method of manufacturing thin ribbons of amorphous metal on a [[melt spinning|supercooled fast-spinning wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TMAG.1976.1059201 |author=Libermann H. |author2=Graham C.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Production Of Amorphous Alloy Ribbons And Effects Of Apparatus Parameters On Ribbon Dimensions |journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics |issue=6 |date=1976 |page=921 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=22822&amp;arnumber=1059201&amp;count=158&amp;index=111 |volume=12 |bibcode=1976ITM....12..921L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an alloy of [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[phosphorus]] and [[boron]]. The material, known as ''[[Metglas]]'', was commercialized in the early 1980s and is used for low-loss power distribution transformers ([[Amorphous metal transformer]]). Metglas-2605 is composed of 80% iron and 20% boron, has [[Curie temperature]] of {{nowrap|373 °C}} and a room temperature saturation magnetization of 1.56 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thermomagnetic and transport properties of metglas 2605 SC and 2605 |author=Roya, R |author2=Majumdara, A.K.|last-author-amp=yes |journal=Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials |date=1981 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=83–89 |doi=10.1016/0304-8853(81)90150-5 |bibcode=1981JMMM...25...83R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, glassy ingots with {{nowrap|5 mm}} diameter were produced from the alloy of 55% palladium, 22.5% lead, and 22.5% antimony, by surface etching followed with heating-cooling cycles. Using [[boron oxide]] [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]], the achievable thickness was increased to a centimeter.{{clarify|date=April 2012|reason=makes no sense what does etching have to do with it}}

Research in [[Tohoku University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Inoue |first1=A. |doi=10.1016/S1359-6454(99)00300-6 |title=Stabilization of metallic supercooled liquid and bulk amorphous alloys |journal=Acta Materialia |volume=48 |pages=279–306 |year=2000 |pmid= |pmc=|citeseerx=10.1.1.590.5472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Caltech]] yielded multicomponent alloys based on lanthanum, magnesium, zirconium, palladium, iron, copper, and titanium, with critical cooling rate between 1 K/s to 100 K/s, comparable to oxide glasses.{{clarify|date=April 2012|reason=in what way comparable}}

In 1988, alloys of lanthanum, aluminium, and copper ore were found to be highly glass-forming. Al-based metallic glasses containing  [[Scandium]] exhibited a record-type tensile mechanical strength of about 1500 MPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Inoue |first1=A. |last2=Sobu |first2=S. |last3=Louzguine |first3=D.

In the 1990s new alloys were developed that form glasses at cooling rates as low as one kelvin per second. These cooling rates can be achieved by simple casting into metallic molds. These "bulk" amorphous alloys can be cast into parts of up to several centimeters in thickness (the maximum thickness depending on the alloy) while retaining an amorphous structure. The best glass-forming alloys are based on [[zirconium]] and [[palladium]], but alloys based on [[iron]], [[titanium]], [[copper]], [[magnesium]], and other metals are also known. Many amorphous alloys are formed by exploiting a phenomenon called the "confusion" effect. Such alloys contain so many different elements (often four or more) that upon cooling at sufficiently fast rates, the constituent atoms simply cannot coordinate themselves into the equilibrium crystalline state before their mobility is stopped. In this way, the random disordered state of the atoms is "locked in".

In 1992, the commercial amorphous alloy, [[Vitreloy]] 1 (41.2% Zr, 13.8% Ti, 12.5% Cu, 10% Ni, and 22.5% Be), was developed at Caltech, as a part of [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and [[NASA]] research of new aerospace materials. More variants followed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2004, bulk amorphous steel was successfully produced by two groups: one at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], who refers to their product as "glassy steel", and the other at the [[University of Virginia]], calling theirs "DARVA-Glass 101".&lt;ref&gt;U.Va.

In 2018 a team at SLAC [[National Accelerator Laboratory]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and [[Northwestern University]] reported the use of [[artificial intelligence]] to predict and evaluate samples of 20,000 different likely metallic glass alloys in a year.

==Properties==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
Amorphous metal is usually an [[alloy]] rather than a pure metal. The alloys contain atoms of significantly different sizes, leading to low free volume (and therefore up to orders of magnitude higher viscosity than other metals and alloys) in molten state. The viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form an ordered lattice. The material structure also results in low shrinkage during cooling, and resistance to plastic deformation. The absence of [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]], the weak spots of crystalline materials, leads to better resistance to [[wear]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gloriant|first=Thierry|title=Microhardness and abrasive wear resistance of metallic glasses and nanostructured composite materials|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|language=en|volume=316|issue=1|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/s0022-3093(02)01941-5|bibcode=2003JNCS..316...96G|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;and [[corrosion]]. Amorphous metals, while technically glasses, are also much [[toughness|tougher]] and less brittle than oxide glasses and ceramics.

Thermal conductivity of amorphous materials is lower than that of crystalline metal. As formation of amorphous structure relies on fast cooling, this limits the maximum achievable thickness of amorphous structures.

To achieve formation of amorphous structure even during slower cooling, the alloy has to be made of three or more components, leading to complex crystal units with higher potential energy and lower chance of formation. The [[atomic radius]] of the components has to be significantly different (over 12%), to achieve high packing density and low free volume. The combination of components should have negative heat of mixing, inhibiting crystal nucleation and prolonging the time the molten metal stays in [[supercooled]] state.

The alloys of [[boron]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other glass formers with magnetic metals ([[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]]) have high [[magnetic susceptibility]], with low [[coercivity]] and high [[electrical resistance]]. Usually the conductivity of a metallic glass is of the same low order of magnitude as of a molten metal just above the melting point. The high resistance leads to low losses by [[eddy current]]s when subjected to alternating magnetic fields, a property useful for e.g. [[transformer]] [[magnetic core]]s. Their low coercivity also contributes to low loss.

Amorphous metals have higher tensile yield strengths and higher elastic strain limits than polycrystalline metal alloys, but their ductilities and fatigue strengths are lower.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book |author=Russell, Alan |author2=Lee, Kok Loong|last-author-amp=yes |date=2005 |title=Structure-Property Relations in Nonferrous Metals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |pages=92 |isbn=9780471708537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amorphous alloys have a variety of potentially useful properties. In particular, they tend to be stronger than crystalline alloys of similar chemical composition, and they can sustain larger reversible ("elastic") deformations than crystalline alloys. Amorphous metals derive their strength directly from their non-crystalline structure, which does not have any of the defects (such as [[dislocations]]) that limit the strength of crystalline alloys. One modern amorphous metal, known as [[Vitreloy]], has a tensile strength that is almost twice that of high-grade [[titanium]]. However, metallic glasses at room temperature are not [[ductile]] and tend to fail suddenly when loaded in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], which limits the material applicability in reliability-critical applications, as the impending failure is not evident. Therefore, there is considerable interest in producing [[metal matrix composite]]s consisting of a metallic glass matrix containing dendritic particles or fibers of a ductile crystalline metal.

Perhaps the most useful property of bulk amorphous alloys is that they are true glasses, which means that they soften and flow upon heating. This allows for easy processing, such as by [[injection molding]], in much the same way as [[polymers]]. As a result, amorphous alloys have been commercialized for use in sports equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2004/ch_7.html|title=Amorphous Alloy Surpasses Steel And Titanium|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical devices, and as cases for electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(04)00124-5|title=The case for bulk metallic glass|journal=Materials Today|volume=7|issue=3|pages=36–43|year=2004|last1=Telford|first1=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin films of amorphous metals can be deposited via [[high velocity oxygen fuel]] technique as protective coatings.

==Applications==
Currently the most important application is due to the special magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses. The low magnetization loss is used in high efficiency transformers ([[amorphous metal transformer]]) at line frequency and some higher frequency transformers. Amorphous steel is a very brittle material which makes it difficult to punch into motor laminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ning |first1=S. R. |last2=Gao |first2=J. |last3=Wang |first3=Y. G. |title=Review on Applications of Low Loss Amorphous Metals in Motors |doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.129-131.1366 |journal=Advanced Materials Research |volume=129-131 |pages=1366–1371 |year=2010 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[electronic article surveillance]] (such as theft control passive ID tags,) often uses metallic glasses because of these magnetic properties.

Amorphous metals exhibit unique softening behavior above their glass transition and this softening has been increasingly explored for thermoplastic forming of metallic glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Saotome |first1=Y. |last2=Iwazaki |first2=H. |doi=10.1007/s005420050180 |title=Superplastic extrusion of microgear shaft of 10 μm in module |journal=Microsystem Technologies |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=126 |year=2000 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such low softening temperature allows for developing simple methods for making composites of nanoparticles (e.g. [[carbon nanotubes]]) and BMGs. It has been shown that metallic glasses can be patterned on extremely small length scales ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;nm to several millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=G. |last2=Tang |first2=H. X. |last3=Schroers |first3=J. |doi=10.1038/nature07718 |title=Nanomoulding with amorphous metals |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=868–872 |year=2009 |pmid=19212407 |pmc= |bibcode=2009Natur.457..868K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may solve the problems of [[nanoimprint lithography]] where expensive nano-molds made of silicon break easily. Nano-molds made from metallic glasses are easy to fabricate and more durable than silicon molds. The superior electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of BMGs compared to polymers make them a good option for developing nanocomposites for electronic application such as [[field electron emission]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3659898 |title=High performance bulk metallic glass/carbon nanotube composite cathodes for electron field emission |journal=Applied Physics Letters |date=2011 |volume=99 |issue=19 |pages=194104 |first=Pejman |last=Hojati-Talemi |bibcode=2011ApPhL..99s4104H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a high [[wear resistance]] and does not produce abrasion powder. The alloy does not undergo [[shrinkage (casting)|shrinkage]] on solidification. A surface structure can be generated that is biologically attachable by surface modification using laser pulses, allowing better joining with bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090610/171551/?P=1 |title=Japanese Universities Develop Ti-based Metallic Glass for Artificial Finger Joint |date=June 11, 2009 |publisher=Tech-on |author=Maruyama, Masaaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mg&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, rapidly cooled to achieve amorphous structure, is being investigated, at Lehigh University, as a [[biomaterial]] for implantation into [[bone]]s as screws, pins, or plates, to fix fractures. Unlike traditional steel or titanium, this material dissolves in organisms at a rate of roughly 1 millimeter per month and is replaced with bone tissue. This speed can be adjusted by varying the content of zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/40573 |title=Fixing bones with dissolvable glass |date=October 1, 2009 |publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling and theory==
Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have now been modeled using atomic scale simulations (within the [[density functional theory]] framework) in a similar manner to [[high entropy alloys]].&lt;ref name="KingAm2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=King |first=D.M. |last2=Middleburgh |first2=S.C. |last3=Liu |first3=A.C.Y. |last4=Tahini |first4=H.A. |last5=Lumpkin |first5=G.R. |last6=Cortie |first6=M. |title=Formation and structure of V–Zr amorphous alloy thin films |journal=Acta Materialia |date=January 2014 |volume=83 |pages=269–275 |doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2014.10.016|hdl=10453/41214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleburghAmU2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Middleburgh |first=S.C. |last2=Burr |first2=P.A. |last3=King |first3=D.M. |last4=Edwards |first4=L. |last5=Lumpkin |first5=G.R. |last6=Grimes |first6=R.W. |title=Structural stability and fission product behaviour in U3Si |journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials |date=November 2015 |volume=466 |pages=739–744 |doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2015.04.052|bibcode = 2015JNuM..466..739M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed predictions to be made about their behavior, stability and many more properties. As such, new BMG systems can be tested, and tailored systems; fit for a specific purpose (e.g. [[bone]] replacement or [[Aircraft engine|aero-engine]] component) without as much [[empirical]] searching of the [[phase space]] and [[experimental]] trial and error.

'''Artificial gravity''' (sometimes referred to as '''pseudogravity''') is the creation of an [[inertial force]] that mimics the effects of a [[Gravity|gravitational]] force, usually by [[Circular motion|rotation]].&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"&gt;https://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific%20Activity/Study%20Groups/SG%20Commission%202/sg22/sg22finalreportr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artificial gravity, or '''rotational gravity''', is thus the appearance of a [[centrifugal force]] in a [[rotating frame of reference]] (the transmission of [[centripetal acceleration]] via [[normal force]] in the non-rotating frame of reference), as opposed to the force experienced in [[linear acceleration]], which by the [[equivalence principle]] is indistinguishable from gravity.
In a more general sense, "artificial gravity" may also refer to the effect of linear acceleration, e.g. by means of a [[rocket engine]]..&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt; 

Rotational simulated gravity has been used in simulations to help astronauts train for extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18619137 | volume=79 | title=Space medicine at the NASA-JSC, neutral buoyancy laboratory | date=July 2008 | journal=Aviat Space Environ Med | pages=732–3 | author=Strauss S}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rotational simulated gravity  has been proposed as a solution in [[manned spaceflight]] to the adverse [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|health effects caused by prolonged weightlessness]]. 
However, there are no current practical outer space applications of artificial gravity for humans due to concerns about the size and cost of a spacecraft necessary to produce a useful [[centripetal acceleration]] comparable to the gravitational field strength on Earth (g).&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a8965/why-dont-we-have-artificial-gravity-15425569/|title=Why Don't We Have Artificial Gravity?|author=|date=May 3, 2013|website=popularmechanics.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centrifugal==
{{see|Absolute rotation|Bucket argument}}
[[File:Artificial Gravity Space Station - GPN-2003-00104.jpg|thumb|Artificial gravity space station. 1969 NASA concept. This design is flawed because the astronauts would be walking back and forth between gravity and weightlessness.]]
Artificial gravity can be created using a [[centripetal force]]. A centripetal force directed towards the center of the turn is required for any object to move in a circular path.  
In the context of a rotating space station it is the [[normal force]] provided by spacecraft's hull that acts as centripetal force. Thus, the "gravity" force felt by an object the [[centrifugal force]] perceived in the [[rotating frame of reference]] as pointing "downwards" towards the hull.
In accordance with [[Newton's Third Law]] the value of [[Little g|little ''g'']] (the perceived "downward" acceleration) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
to the centripetal acceleration.

===Mechanism===
[[Image:ArtificialGravity.gif|right|thumb|Balls in a rotating spacecraft]]
From the [[rotating reference frame|point of view of people rotating with the habitat]], artificial gravity by rotation behaves in some ways similarly to normal gravity but with the following differences:
* [[Centripetal force]]: Unlike real gravity, which pulls towards a center of the planet, the centripetal force pushes towards the axis of rotation. For a given angular velocity the amount of artificial gravity depends linearly on the radius. With a small radius of rotation, the amount of gravity felt at one's head would be significantly different from the amount felt at one's feet. This could make movement and changing body position awkward. In accordance with the [[Centripetal force#Formula|physics involved]], slower rotations or larger rotational radii would reduce or eliminate this problem. Similarly the linear velocity of the habitat should be significantly higher than the relative velocities with which an astronaut will change position within it. Otherwise moving in the direction of the rotation will increase the felt gravity (while moving in the opposite direction will decrease it) to the point that it should cause problems.
* The [[Coriolis effect]] gives an apparent force that acts on objects that move relative to a rotating reference frame. This apparent force acts at right angles to the motion and the rotation axis and tends to curve the motion in the opposite sense to the habitat's spin. If an [[astronaut]] inside a rotating artificial gravity environment moves towards or away from the axis of rotation, he or she will feel a force pushing him or her towards or away from the direction of spin. These forces act on the inner ear and can cause [[dizziness]], [[nausea]] and disorientation. Lengthening the period of rotation (slower spin rate) reduces the Coriolis force and its effects. It is generally believed that at 2 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] or less, no adverse effects from the Coriolis forces will occur, although humans have been shown to adapt to rates as high as 23 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].&lt;ref name=hecht2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002ESASP.501..151H |title=Adapting to artificial gravity (AG) at high rotational speeds |author=Hecht, H. |author2=Brown, E. L. |author3=Young, L. R. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Proceedings of "Life in space for life on Earth". 8th European Symposium on Life Sciences Research in Space. 23rd Annual International Gravitational Physiology Meeting |date=June 2–7, 2002 |accessdate=2011-02-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not yet known whether very long exposures to high levels of Coriolis forces can increase the likelihood of becoming accustomed. The nausea-inducing effects of Coriolis forces can also be mitigated by restraining movement of the head.

This form of artificial gravity has additional engineering issues:
* Kinetic energy and [[angular momentum]]: Spinning up (or down) parts or all of the habitat requires energy, while angular momentum must be conserved. This would require a propulsion system and expendable propellant, or could be achieved without expending mass, by an [[electric motor]] and a counterweight, such as a [[reaction wheel]] or possibly another living area spinning in the opposite direction.
* Extra strength is needed in the structure to keep it from flying apart because of the rotation. However, the amount of structure needed over and above that to hold a breathable atmosphere (10 tons force per square meter at 1 atmosphere) is relatively modest for most structures.
* If parts of the structure are intentionally not spinning, [[friction]] and similar [[torque]]s will cause the rates of spin to converge (as well as causing the otherwise stationary parts to spin), requiring motors and power to be used to compensate for the losses due to friction.
* A traversable interface between parts of the station spinning relative to each other requires large vacuum-tight axial seals.

===Manned spaceflight===
The engineering challenges of creating a rotating spacecraft are comparatively modest to any other proposed approach.{{original research inline|date=February 2016}} Theoretical spacecraft designs using artificial gravity have a great number of variants with intrinsic problems and advantages. The formula for the [[centripetal force#Formula|centripetal force]] implies that the radius of rotation grows with the square of the rotating spacecraft period, so a doubling of the period requires a fourfold increase in the radius of rotation. For example, to produce [[standard gravity]], {{math|''ɡ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}} with a rotating spacecraft period of 15&amp;nbsp;s, the radius of rotation would have to be {{convert|56|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while a period of 30&amp;nbsp;s would require it to be {{convert|224|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To reduce mass, the support along the diameter could consist of nothing but a cable connecting two sections of the spaceship. Among the possible solutions include a habitat module and a counterweight consisting of every other part of the spacecraft, alternatively two habitatable modules of similar weight could be attached to one another.

Whatever design is chosen, it would be necessary for the spacecraft to possess some means to quickly transfer [[ballast]] from one section to another, otherwise even small shifts in mass could cause a substantial shift in the spacecraft's axis, which would result in a dangerous "wobble." One possible solution would be to engineer the spacecraft's plumbing system to serve this purpose, using drinking [[water]] and/or waste water as the ballast. 

It is not yet known whether exposure to high gravity for short periods of time is as beneficial to health as continuous exposure to normal gravity. It is also not known how effective low levels of gravity would be at countering the adverse effects on health of weightlessness. Artificial gravity at 0.1''g'' and a rotating spacecraft period of 30&amp;nbsp;s would require a radius of only {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Likewise, at a radius of 10&amp;nbsp;m, a period of just over 6&amp;nbsp;s would be required to produce standard gravity (at the hips; gravity would be 11% higher at the feet), while 4.5&amp;nbsp;s would produce 2''g''. If brief exposure to high gravity can negate the harmful effects of weightlessness, then a small centrifuge could be used as an exercise area.

====Gemini missions====
The [[Gemini 11]] mission attempted to produce artificial gravity by rotating the capsule around the [[Agena Target Vehicle]] to which it was attached by a 36-meter tether. They were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 g, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of [[bolas]].&lt;ref name="Gatland1976"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Kenneth|last=Gatland|title=Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision|place=New York, NY, USA|publisher=MacMillan|year=1976|pages=180–182|isbn=0-02-542820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resultant force was too small to be felt by either astronaut, but objects were observed moving towards the "floor" of the capsule.&lt;ref name="Clément G 2007"&gt;Clément G, Bukley A (2007) Artificial Gravity. Springer: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be pointed out that the [[Gemini 8]] mission achieved artificial gravity for a few minutes. This, however, was due to an accident. The acceleration forces upon the crew were so high (~ 4g's) that the mission had to be urgently terminated.

==== Health benefits ====
[[File:Jsc2004e18862.jpg|thumb|Artificial gravity has been suggested for interplanetary journey to Mars]]
Artificial gravity has been suggested as a solution to the various health risks associated with spaceflight.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/26136665/|title=Artificial Gravity as a Countermeasure for Mitigating Physiological Deconditioning During Long-Duration Space Missions|author=|date= June 17, 2015|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the [[Soviet]] space program believed that a human could not survive more than 14 days in space due to a fear that the [[heart]] and [[blood vessels]] would be unable to adapt to the weightless conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3947769|title=Weightlessness Obstacle to Space Survival|author=|date=April 4, 1964|publisher=|journal=The Science News-Letter|volume=86|issue=7|pages=103–103|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear was eventually discovered to be unfounded as spaceflights have now lasted up to 438 consecutive days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/24/525374569/astronaut-peggy-whitson-sets-new-nasa-record-for-most-days-in-space|title=Astronaut Peggy Whitson Sets NASA Record For Most Days In Space|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with missions aboard the international space station commonly lasting 6 months. However, the question of human safety in space did launch an investigation into the physical effects of prolonged exposure to weightlessness. In June 1991, a [[NASA|Spacelab Life Sciences]] 1 flight performed 18 experiments on two men and two women over a period of nine days. In an environment without gravity, it was concluded that the response of [[white blood cells]] and [[muscle]] mass decreased. Additionally, within the first 24 hours spent in a weightless environment, [[blood volume]] decreased by 10%.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1311819|title=Artificial Gravity and Space Travel|first=Leonard|last=David|date=April 4, 1992|publisher=|journal=BioScience|volume=42|issue=3|pages=155–159|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1311819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt; Upon return to earth, the effects of prolonged weightlessness continue to affect the human body as fluids pool back to the lower body, the [[heart rate]] rises, a drop in [[blood pressure]] occurs and there is a reduced ability to [[exercise]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Artificial gravity, due to its ability to [[mimic]] the behavior of gravity on the human body has been suggested as one of the most encompassing manners of combating the [[physical effects]] inherent with weightless environments. Other measures that have been suggested as symptomatic treatments include exercise, diet and [[Pingvin exercise suit|penguin suits]]. However, criticism of those methods lays in the fact that they do not fully eliminate the health problems and require a variety of solutions to address all issues. Artificial gravity, in contrast, would remove the weightlessness inherent with space travel. By implementing artificial gravity, space travelers would never have to experience weightlessness or the associated side effects.&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt; Especially in a modern-day six-month journey to [[Mars]], exposure to artificial gravity is suggested in either a continuous or intermittent form to prevent extreme debilitation to the astronauts during travel.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

The "Mars Habitat Unit", which would carry astronauts to Mars to join the previously-launched "Earth Return Vehicle", would have had artificial gravity generated during flight by tying the spent upper stage of the booster to the Habitat Unit, and setting them both rotating about a common axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nss.org/resources/books/non_fiction/NF_037_caseformars.html|title=NSS Review:  The Case for Mars|author=|date=|website=www.nss.org|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Issues with implementation ====
Some of the reasons that artificial gravity remains unused today in [[spaceflight]] trace back to the problems inherent in [[implementation]]. One of the realistic methods of creating artificial gravity is a [[centripetal force]] pulling a person towards a relative floor. In that model, however, issues arise in the size of the spacecraft. As expressed by John Page and Matthew Francis, the smaller a spacecraft, the more rapid the rotation that is required. As such, to simulate gravity, it would be more ideal to utilize a larger spacecraft that rotates very slowly. The requirements on size in comparison to rotation are due to the different magnitude of forces the body can experience if the rotation is too tight. Additionally, questions remain as to what the best way to initially set the rotating motion in place without disturbing the stability of the whole spacecraft's orbit. At the moment, there is not a ship massive enough to meet the rotation requirements, and the costs associated with building, maintaining, and [[launching]] such a craft are extensive.&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com"/&gt;

In general, with the limited health effects present in shorter spaceflights, as well as the high cost of [[research]], application of artificial gravity is often stunted and [[sporadic]].&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

====In science fiction====
{{main|Artificial_gravity_(fiction)#Rotational_gravity}}
Several science fiction novels, films and series have featured artificial gravity production. In the movie [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']], a rotating centrifuge in the ''Discovery'' spacecraft provides artificial gravity. 
In the novel [[The Martian (Weir novel)|''The Martian'']], the ''Hermes'' spacecraft achieves artificial gravity by design; it employs a ringed structure, at whose periphery forces around 40% of Earth's gravity are experienced, similar to Mars's gravity. The movie [[Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'']] features a spacecraft called the ''Endurance'' that can rotate on its center axis to create artificial gravity, controlled by retro thrusters on the ship.

===Centrifuges===
{{main|Centrifuge|g-force|High-G training}}
[[High-G training]] is done by aviators and astronauts who are subject to high levels of acceleration ('G') in large-radius centrifuges. It is designed to prevent a ''g-induced loss Of consciousness'' (abbreviated [[G-LOC]]), a situation when [[g-force#Human g-force experience|''g''-forces]] move the blood away from the brain to the extent that [[consciousness]] is lost. Incidents of acceleration-induced loss of consciousness have caused fatal accidents in aircraft capable of sustaining high-''g'' for considerable periods.

In [[amusement park]]s, [[pendulum ride]]s and [[centrifuge]]s provide rotational force. [[Roller coaster]]s also do, whenever they go over dips, humps, or loops. When going over a hill, time in which zero or negative gravity is felt is called [[air time (rides)|air time]], or "airtime", which can be divided into "floater air time" (for zero gravity) and "ejector air time" (for negative gravity).{{original research inline|date=January 2016}}

==Linear acceleration==
{{see|Equivalence principle}}
Linear acceleration, even at a low level, can provide sufficient [[g-force]] to provide useful benefits. A spacecraft under constant acceleration in a straight line would give the appearance of a gravitational pull in the direction opposite of the acceleration. This "pull" that would cause a loose object to "fall" towards the hull of the spacecraft is actually a manifestation of the inertia of the objects inside the spacecraft, in accordance with [[Newton's first law]]. 
Further, the "gravity" felt by an object pressed against the hull of the spacecraft is simply the reaction force of the object on the hull reacting to the acceleration force of the hull on the object, in accordance with Newton's Third Law and somewhat similar to the effect on an object pressed against the hull of a spacecraft rotating as outlined above. Unlike an artificial gravity based on rotation, linear acceleration gives the appearance of a gravity field which is both uniform throughout the spacecraft and without the disadvantage of additional fictitious forces.

Some [[Rocket engine#Chemically powered|chemical]] [[Spacecraft propulsion#Reaction engines|reaction rockets]] can at least temporarily provide enough acceleration to overcome Earth's gravity and could thus provide linear acceleration to emulate Earth's g-force. However, since all such rockets provide this acceleration by expelling [[reaction mass]] such an acceleration would only be temporary, until the limited supply of rocket fuel had been spent.

Nevertheless, constant linear acceleration is desirable since in addition to providing artificial gravity it could theoretically provide relatively short flight times around the solar system. For example, if a propulsion technique able to support 1''g'' of acceleration continuously were available, a spaceship accelerating (and then decelerating for the second half of the journey) at 1''g'' would reach [[Mars]] within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Gravity|first1=Gilles|last1=Clément|first2=Angelia P.|last2=Bukley|publisher=Springer New York|year=2007|isbn=0-387-70712-3|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUcjOsG0hi0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YUcjOsG0hi0C&amp;pg=PA35 Extract of page 35]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a hypothetical [[space travel using constant acceleration]] of 1''g'' for one year would reach [[relativistic speed]]s and allow for a round trip to the nearest star, [[Proxima Centauri]].

As such, low-impulse but long-term linear acceleration has been proposed for various interplanetary missions. For example, even heavy (100 [[ton]]) cargo payloads to Mars could be transported to Mars in {{nowrap|27 months}} and retain approximately 55 percent of the [[low Earth orbit|LEO]] vehicle mass upon arrival into a Mars orbit, providing a low-gravity gradient to the spacecraft during the entire journey.&lt;ref name=fiso20110119&gt;[http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Glover_1-19-11/Glover_1-19-11.pdf VASIMR VX-200 Performance and Near-term SEP Capability for Unmanned Mars Flight], Tim Glover, Future in Space Operations (FISO) Colloquium, pp. 22, 25, 2011-01-19.

A propulsion system with a very high [[specific impulse]] (that is, good efficiency in the use of [[reaction mass]] that must be carried along and used for propulsion on the journey) could accelerate more slowly producing useful levels of artificial gravity for long periods of time. A variety of [[Spacecraft propulsion#Electromagnetic propulsion|electric propulsion]] systems provide examples. Two examples of this long-duration, [[thrust-to-weight ratio|low-thrust]], high-impulse propulsion that have either been practically used on spacecraft or are planned in for near-term in-space use are [[Hall effect thruster]]s and [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]]s (VASIMR). Both provide very high [[specific impulse]] but relatively low thrust, compared to the more typical chemical reaction rockets. They are thus ideally suited for long-duration firings which would provide limited amounts of, but long-term, milli-g levels of artificial gravity in spacecraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In a number of science fiction plots, acceleration is used to produce artificial gravity for [[Interstellar travel|interstellar]] spacecraft, propelled by as yet [[theoretical]] or [[Spacecraft propulsion#Hypothetical methods|hypothetical]] means.

This effect of linear acceleration is well understood, and is routinely used for 0''g'' cryogenic fluid management for post-launch (subsequent) in-space firings of [[upper stage]] rockets.&lt;ref name=goff2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf|title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots|author=Jon Goff|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|year=2009|accessdate=2011-02-07|quote=''Developing techniques for manipulating fluids in microgravity, which typically fall into the category known as settled propellant handling. Research for cryogenic upper stages dating back to the Saturn S-IVB and Centaur found that providing a slight acceleration (as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; g of acceleration) to the tank can make the propellants assume a desired configuration, which allows many of the main cryogenic fluid handling tasks to be performed in a similar fashion to terrestrial operations. The simplest and most mature settling technique is to apply thrust to the spacecraft, forcing the liquid to settle against one end of the tank.''|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roller coaster]]s, especially [[launched roller coasters]] or those that rely on [[electromagnetic propulsion]], can provide linear acceleration "gravity", and so can relatively high acceleration vehicles, such as [[sports car]]s. Linear acceleration can be used to provide [[air-time]] on roller coasters and other thrill rides.

===Diamagnetism===
[[File:Frog diamagnetic levitation.jpg|thumb|A live frog levitates inside a 32 mm [[diameter]] vertical bore of a [[Bitter solenoid]] in a magnetic field of about 16 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]].]]
A similar effect to gravity can be created through [[diamagnetism]]. It requires magnets with extremely powerful magnetic fields. Such devices have been able to levitate at most a small mouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE58A02G20090911|work=Reuters|title=U.S. scientists levitate mice to study low gravity|date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a 1 ''g'' field to cancel that of the Earth's. 

Sufficiently powerful magnets require either expensive [[cryogenics]] to keep them [[Superconductivity|superconductive]] or several megawatts of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfml.ru.nl/20t-magnet.html |title=20 tesla Bitter solenoid – Archived link |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320120553/http://www.hfml.ru.nl/20t-magnet.html |archivedate=March 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With such extremely strong magnetic fields, safety for use with humans is unclear.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In addition, it would involve avoiding any [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] materials near the strong magnetic field that is required for diamagnetism to be evident.

Facilities using diamagnetism may prove workable for laboratories simulating low gravity conditions here on Earth.{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} A mouse has been levitated against Earth's gravity, creating a condition similar to [[microgravity]]. Lower forces may also be generated to simulate a condition similar to lunar or Martian gravity with small [[model organism]]s.

===Parabolic flight===
{{main|Vomit Comet}}
''Weightless Wonder'' is the nickname for the NASA aircraft that flies parabolic trajectories and briefly provides a nearly weightless environment in which to train [[astronaut]]s, conduct research, and film motion pictures. The parabolic trajectory creates a vertical linear acceleration which matches that of gravity, giving [[zero-g]] for a short time, usually 20–30 seconds, followed by approximately 1.8g for a similar period. The nickname [[Vomit Comet]] is also used to refer to motion sickness that is often experienced by the aircraft passengers during these parabolic trajectories. Such [[reduced gravity aircraft]] are nowadays operated by several organizations worldwide.

===Neutral buoyancy===
{{main|Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory}}
A '''Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory''' (NBL) is an [[astronaut]] training facility, such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility at the [[NASA Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strauss, S.|title=Space medicine at the NASA-JSC, neutral buoyancy laboratory|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=79|issue=7|pages=732–3|date=July 2008|pmid=18619137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBL is a large indoor pool of water, the largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/training/nbl/facilities.html|title=Behind the scenes training|publisher=NASA|date=30 May 2003|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which astronauts may perform simulated [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] tasks in preparation for space missions. The NBL contains full-sized mock-ups of the [[Space Shuttle]] cargo bay, flight payloads, and the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name="pmid15892545"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strauss, S.|author2=Krog, R.L.|author3=Feiveson, A.H.|title=Extravehicular mobility unit training and astronaut injuries|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=76|issue=5|pages=469–74|date=May 2005|pmid=15892545|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2005/00000076/00000005/art00008|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of [[neutral buoyancy]] is used to simulate the weightless environment of space.&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"/&gt; The suited astronauts are lowered into the pool using an [[overhead crane]] and their weight is adjusted by support divers so that they experience no [[buoyancy|buoyant]] force and no [[Moment (physics)|rotational moment]] about their [[center of mass]].&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"/&gt; The suits worn in the NBL are down-rated from fully flight-rated [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]] suits like those in use on the space shuttle and International Space Station.

The NBL tank is {{convert|202|ft|m}} in length, {{convert|102|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|40|ft|6|in|m}} deep, and contains 6.2 million gallons (23.5 million litres) of water.&lt;ref name="pmid15892545"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBL Characteristics |work=About the NBL |publisher=NASA |date=June 23, 2005 |url=http://dx12.jsc.nasa.gov/about/index.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626165503/http://dx12.jsc.nasa.gov/about/index.shtml |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Divers breathe [[nitrox]] while working in the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fitzpatrick DT, Conkin J |title=Improved pulmonary function in working divers breathing nitrox at shallow depths|journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=30|issue=Supplement|year=2003|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/1273|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fitzpatrick DT, Conkin J |title=Improved pulmonary function in working divers breathing nitrox at shallow depths|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=74|issue=7|pages=763–7|date=July 2003|pmid=12862332|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000007/art00011|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutral buoyancy in a pool is not [[weightlessness]], since the balance organs in the inner ear still sense the up-down direction of gravity. Also, there is a significant amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]] presented by water.&lt;ref name="pmid15796314"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pendergast D, Mollendorf J, Zamparo P, Termin A, Bushnell D, Paschke D |title=The influence of drag on human locomotion in water|journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=32|issue=1|pages=45–57|year=2005|pmid=15796314|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4037|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, drag effects are minimized by doing tasks slowly in the water. Another difference between neutral buoyancy simulation in a pool and actual EVA during spaceflight is that the temperature of the pool and the lighting conditions are maintained constant.

==Speculative or fictional mechanisms==
{{Main|Artificial gravity (fiction)|Gravitational shielding|Anti-gravity}}

In science fiction, artificial gravity (or cancellation of gravity) or "paragravity"&lt;ref&gt;''Collision Orbit'', 1942 by [[Jack Williamson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]: A Vision of the Human Future in Space'' by [[Carl Sagan]], Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes present in spacecraft that are neither rotating nor accelerating. At present, there is no confirmed technique that can simulate gravity other than actual mass or acceleration. There have been many claims over the years of such a device. [[Eugene Podkletnov]], a Russian engineer, has claimed since the early 1990s to have made such a device consisting of a spinning superconductor producing a powerful "[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] field", but there has been no verification or even negative results from third parties. In 2006, a research group funded by [[European Space Agency|ESA]] claimed to have created a similar device that demonstrated positive results for the production of gravitomagnetism, although it produced only 0.0001''g''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gsp.esa.int/article-view/-/wcl/Fd1ZihgaGrwB/10192/towards-a-new-test-of-general-relativity-|title=Toward a new test of general relativity?|publisher=Esa.int|accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result has not been replicated. [[String theory]] predicts that gravity and electromagnetism unify in hidden dimensions and that extremely short photons can enter those dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Brian, ''[[The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main methods for replacing bladder function involve either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder ''in situ''.&lt;ref name=clevclin2009&gt;{{Citation
 |author=&lt;!--staff--&gt; |publication-date=&lt;!--2009-10-9--&gt; |year=2009 |title=Urinary Reconstruction and Diversion |chapter=Treatments &amp; Procedures |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]] |url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/urinary_reconstruction_and_diversion/hic_urinary_reconstruction_and_diversion.aspx |accessdate=2013-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Replacement can be done with an '''artificial urinary bladder''', an [[artificial organ]].

==Development==
On January 30, 1999, scientists announced that a lab-grown bladder had been successfully transplanted into dogs. These artificial bladders worked well for almost a year in the dogs. In 2000, a new procedure for creating artificial bladders for humans was developed. This procedure is called an orthotopic neobladder procedure. This procedure involves shaping a part (usually 35 to 40&amp;nbsp;inches) of a patient's [[small intestine]] to form a new bladder; however, these bladders made of intestinal tissues produced unpleasant side-effects.

In 2006, the first publication of experimental transplantation of bioengineered bladders appeared in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name=atala2006&gt;{{Citation

==Benefits==
Bioengineered organs which rely on a patient's own cells, [[autologous]] constructs, are not subject to [[transplant rejection]], unlike transplants from human or animal donors.

The current standard for repairing a damaged [[urinary bladder]] involves partial or complete replacement using tissue from the small intestine.&lt;ref name=clevclin2009/&gt;

'''Berlyn B. Brixner''' (May 21, 1911 – August 1, 2009) was an American photographer. He was the head photographer for the [[Trinity test]], the first detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]] in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://larrycalloway.com/historic.html?_recordnum=105  |title=The Trinity Test: Eyewitnesses |quote=His buddy on some of the explorations was Berlyn Brixner, a boy from a poor family who loved photography.

==Early years==
He was born in [[El Paso, Texas]] on May 21, 1911. His mother had graduated from [[Western New Mexico University]] in 1898 and taught school in various small southern New Mexico communities.  His father was a power systems engineer for a mining company, and had worked in Chile, Mexico and the Fanny Mine in [[Mogollon, New Mexico]] until the Army commandeered its boxcar-size generators at the beginning of [[World War II]] turning Mogollon into a ghost town.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Biography; Brixner family archives, New Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 1932, he fell into [[Kilbourne Hole]] near [[Lanark, New Mexico]] and broke his ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Broken Rope Dashed Student Into Carter.

M. He fell ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 1932 |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Brixner attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]] for four years without earning a degree, then worked and studied photography under Willis W. Waite, who operated a pathology laboratory in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]].  In 1936, Brixner worked as a regional photographer with the [[Soil Conservation Service]] at its four-state headquarters in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. He married his first wife, Betty, around 1940. His two daughters, Annette (born 1942) and Kathleen (born 1943) were born in Albuquerque.  During [[World War II]], he was hired at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to work on photography problems connected with the Manhattan Project in the Optics Engineering and High Speed Photography Group in Los Alamos under the direction of Professor Julian Mack, the group invented and constructed extremely high speed cameras.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Atom Blast Films Taken 15 Million to the Second |url= |quote=The camera that "stops" an atom bomb explosion has been speeded up to take pictures at the rate of 15,000,000 a second.

The new one, Model 8, was produced ...  |work=[[Associated Press]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=May 24, 1954  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trinity==
Brixner was assigned to shoot movies in [[16-millimeter]] [[black-and-white film]], from every angle and distance and at every available speed, of an unknown event beginning with the brightest flash ever produced on Earth. "The theoretical people had calculated a some 10-sun brightness. So that was easy," said Brixner. "All I had to do was go out and point my camera at the sun and take some pictures. Ten times that was easy to calculate."&lt;ref name=lc/&gt;

At ignition, Brixner remembers "The whole filter seemed to light up as bright as the sun. I was temporarily blinded. I looked to the side. The [[Oscura mountains]] were as bright as day. I saw this tremendous ball of fire, and it was rising. I was just spellbound! I followed it as it rose. Then it dawned on me. I'm the photographer! I've gotta get that ball of fire." He jogged the camera up. He said: "There was no sound! It all took place in absolute silence."&lt;ref name=lc&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Calloway  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Nuclear Age's Blinding Dawn  |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/trinity/trinity1.htm |quote= |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |date= |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After the war, he stayed on at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] until retirement as head of the optical group.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 1956 he married Audrey Chew (1915–1996) who was from [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Audrey Chew Brixner |url=|quote=Survivors include her husband, Berlyn Brixner of Los Alamos; a sister, Ruth Chew Silver of Brooklyn, N.Y.; and two brothers, Geoffrey F.

He donated his body to UNM Medical School and, at his request, wished no funeral nor memorial arrangements be made. Hailing from El Paso, TX, he attended the University of Texas, worked &amp; studied photography under Willis W. White, MD, who operated a pathology laboratory in El Paso. He moved to Albuquerque during the Dust Bowl &amp; Great Depression era to work for the US Conservation Department as a regional photographer, documenting the ravages of drought on New Mexico, pictures &amp; notes on file at the US National Archives. He was an enthusiastic amateur photographer, much of his photography resides at the Los Alamos Historical Society, Museum of Santa Fe &amp; the National Hispanic Cultural Center. When World War II began, he joined the secret Los Alamos National Laboratory's Manhattan Project in 1942, designing &amp; engineering extremely high speed cameras under Professor Julian Mack. Berlyn Brixner took photos of the first atomic bomb test at Trinity, NM in 1945. After the war, he stayed on at LANL, heading the Optical Engineering Group until his retirement. He contributed a chapter to the book Behind Tall Fences about the war years, authored &amp; coauthored some 45 papers describing major developments in camera engineering, optical instrumentation and fabrication techniques. His scientific work &amp; photography are on file at LANL Historic Archives. His optical lens design was used to construct a high resolution telescope mounted on the Mariner 1969 &amp; 1970 spacecraft to Mars.

{{about|biasing in '''electronics'''||Biasing (disambiguation)}}
'''Biasing''' in [[electronics]] means establishing predetermined [[voltage]]s or [[electric current|currents]] at various points of an [[electronic circuit]] for the purpose of establishing proper operating conditions in [[electronic component]]s.  Many electronic devices such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s, whose function is [[signal processing|processing]] time-varying ([[alternating current|AC]]) [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] also require a steady (DC) current or voltage to operate correctly — a ''bias''. The AC signal applied to them is [[Superposition theorem|superposed]] on this DC bias current or voltage. The [[operating point]] of a device, also known as bias point, '''quiescent point''', or '''Q-point''', is the DC voltage or current at a specified terminal of an active device (a transistor or vacuum tube) with no input signal applied. A '''bias circuit''' is a portion of the device's circuit which supplies this steady current or voltage.

==Overview==
In electronics, ''bias'' usually refers to a fixed DC voltage or current applied to a terminal of an [[electronic component]] such as a [[diode]], [[transistor]] or [[vacuum tube]] in a [[electrical network|circuit]] in which [[alternating current]] (AC) signals are also present, in order to establish proper operating conditions for the component. For example, a bias voltage is applied to a [[transistor]] in an [[electronic amplifier]] to allow the transistor to operate in a particular region of its [[transconductance]] curve. For [[vacuum tube]]s, a [[grid bias]] voltage is often applied to the grid electrodes for the same reason.

In [[electronic engineering]], the term ''bias'' has the following meanings:{{cn|date=July 2018}}
# A systematic deviation of a value from a reference value
# The amount by which the average of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of values departs from a reference value
# [[Electrical force|Electrical]], mechanical, [[magnetic force|magnetic]], or other force applied to a device to establish a reference level to operate the device
# In [[telegraph]] [[signaling (telecommunication)|signaling]] systems, the development of a positive or negative [[DC voltage]] at a point on a [[telephone line]] that should remain at a specified reference level, e.g. zero.{{cn|reason=can't find support for this in [[telegraph]] or [[telephone line]]|date=October 2018}}

In [[magnetic tape recording]], the term ''bias'' is also used for a high-frequency signal added to the [[audio signal]] and applied to the [[recording head]], to improve the quality of the recording on the tape. This is called [[tape bias]].

==Importance in linear circuits==
Linear circuits involving [[transistor]]s typically require specific DC voltages and currents for correct operation, which can be achieved using a biasing circuit. As an example of the need for careful biasing, consider a transistor amplifier. In linear [[amplifier]]s, a small input signal gives larger output signal without any change in shape (low distortion): the input signal causes the output signal to vary up and down about the Q-point in a manner strictly proportional to the input. However, because the relationship between input and output for a transistor is not linear across its full operating range, the transistor amplifier only approximates linear operation. For low [[distortion]], the transistor must be biased so the output signal swing does not drive the transistor into a region of extremely nonlinear operation. For a bipolar junction transistor amplifier, this requirement means that the transistor must stay in the [[bipolar junction transistor#Regions of operation|active mode]], and avoid cut-off or saturation. The same requirement applies to a MOSFET amplifier, although the terminology differs a little: the MOSFET must stay in the [[MOSFET#Modes of operation|active mode]], and avoid cutoff or ohmic operation.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==Bipolar junction transistors==
{{main|Bipolar transistor biasing}}
For [[bipolar junction transistor]]s the bias point is chosen to keep the transistor operating in the active mode, using a variety of [[bipolar transistor biasing|circuit techniques]], establishing the Q-point DC voltage and current. A small signal is then applied on top of the Q-point bias voltage, thereby either [[modulation|modulating]] or switching the current, depending on the purpose of the circuit.

The quiescent point of operation is typically near the middle of the DC [[load line (electronics)|load line]], so as to obtain the maximum available peak-to-peak signal amplitude without distortion due to [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]]. The process of obtaining an appropriate DC collector current at a certain DC collector voltage by setting up the operating point is called biasing.

After establishing the operating point, when an input signal is applied, the output signal should not move the transistor either to saturation or to cut-off. However, this unwanted shift still might occur, due to the following reasons:

# Parameters of transistors depend on junction temperature. As junction temperature increases, [[leakage current]] due to minority charge carriers (I&lt;sub&gt;CBO&lt;/sub&gt;)(collector base current with emitter open) increases. As I&lt;sub&gt;CBO&lt;/sub&gt; increases, I&lt;sub&gt;CEO&lt;/sub&gt;(collector emitter current with base open) also increases, causing an increase in collector current I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. This produces heat at the collector junction. This process repeats, and, finally, the Q-point may shift into the saturation region. Sometimes, the excess heat produced at the junction may even burn the transistor due to [[thermal runaway]].
# When a transistor is replaced by another of the same type, the Q-point may shift, due to changes in parameters of the transistor, such as ''[[current gain]]'' (&lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt;) which varies slightly for each unique transistor.

To avoid a shift of Q-point, bias-stabilization is necessary. Various [[bipolar transistor biasing|biasing circuits]] can be used for this purpose.

=={{anchor|Grid bias|Fixed bias|Cathode bias|Grid leak bias|Bleeder bias|Contact bias}}Vacuum tubes (thermionic valves)==
''Grid bias'' is the DC voltage provided at the control grid of an electron tube relative to the cathode for the purpose of establishing the zero input signal or steady state operating condition of the tube.&lt;ref name="veley01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landee"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Designers_Handbook_Robert_Landee_Donovan_Davis_Albert_Albrecht_1957#page/n61  Landee, Davis, Albrecht, ''Electronic Designers' Handbook'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1957, p. 2-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a typical [[Class A amplifier|Class A]] [[Amplifier#Ideal|voltage amplifier]], and class A and AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; power stages of [[audio power amplifier]]s, the DC bias voltage is negative relative to the cathode potential. The instantaneous grid voltage (sum of DC bias and [[alternating current|AC]] input signal) does not reach the point where grid current begins.
* [[Class B amplifier]]s using general purpose tubes are biased negatively to the projected plate current cutoff point. The bias voltage source must have low resistance and be able to supply the grid current.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Designers_Handbook_Robert_Landee_Donovan_Davis_Albert_Albrecht_1957#page/n221 Landee et al, 1957, p. 4-19]&lt;/ref&gt; When tubes designed for class B are employed, the bias can be as little as zero.
* [[Class C amplifier]]s are biased negatively at a point well beyond plate current cutoff. Grid current occurs during significantly less than 180 degrees of the input frequency cycle.

Methods of obtaining grid bias:
* ''Fixed bias'' - The DC grid potential is determined by connection to an appropriate impedance that will pass DC from an appropriate voltage source.&lt;ref name="Landee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orr_1962"/&gt;
* ''[[Cathode bias]]'' (''self-bias'', ''automatic bias'') - The voltage drop across a resistor in series with the cathode is utilized. The grid circuit DC return is connected to the other end of the resistor, causing the DC grid voltage to be negative relative to the cathode.&lt;ref name="Orr_1962"/&gt;
* ''Grid leak bias'' - When the grid is driven positive during part of the input frequency cycle, such as in class C operation, rectification in the grid circuit in conjunction with capacitive coupling of the input signal to the grid produces negative DC voltage at the grid. A resistor (the ''grid leak'') permits discharge of the coupling capacitor and passes the DC grid current. The resultant bias voltage is equal to the product of the DC grid current and the grid leak resistance.&lt;ref name="Radio Transmitters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orr_1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everitt_1937"/&gt;
* ''Bleeder bias'' - The voltage drop across a portion of a resistance across the plate voltage supply determines the grid bias. The cathode is connected to a tap on the resistance. The grid is connected to an appropriate impedance that provides a DC path either to the negative side of the plate voltage supply or to another tap on the same resistance.&lt;ref name="veley01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RCA_1940"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghirardi_1932"/&gt;
* ''Initial velocity bias'' (''contact bias'') - DC voltage is developed across a grid to cathode resistor, usually in the range of 1 to 10 megohms, due to electrons entering the grid.&lt;ref name="Giacoletto_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomer_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Designers_Handbook_Robert_Landee_Donovan_Davis_Albert_Albrecht_1957#page/n63 Landee et al, 1957, p. 2-28]&lt;/ref&gt;

Combinations of bias methods may be used on the same tube.

==Microphones==
[[Electret microphone]] elements typically include a [[JFET|junction field-effect transistor]] as an impedance converter to drive other electronics within a few meters of the microphone. The operating current of this JFET is typically 0.1 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mA and is often referred to as bias,&lt;ref name="Phantom"/&gt; which is different from the [[phantom power]] interface which supplies 48 volts to operate the backplate of a traditional condenser microphone. Electret microphone bias is sometimes supplied on a separate conductor.&lt;ref name="IEC_61938"/&gt;

== Premise ==
The series follows the Reagan family of police officers with the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD). Francis Xavier "Frank" Reagan is the [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner]]. Frank's oldest son Danny is an NYPD detective, his youngest son Jamie is an NYPD police officer (later sergeant), and his daughter Erin is an [[New York County District Attorney|assistant district attorney]]. Frank's second-oldest son Joe was murdered by a crooked cop in the line of duty in events that pre-date the series, when he was involved with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigating a group of corrupt NYPD cops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5176120/ |title="Blue Bloods" Cursed (TV Episode 2016) - IMDb |date=January 15, 2016 |accessdate=June 21, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank's father Henry is a former NYPD beat cop who rose through the ranks to Police Commissioner. Each member of the family represents a different aspect of police work or the legal process: Frank as the commissioner, Danny as the detective, Jamie as the beat cop and Erin as the prosecutor. Additionally, while each person's story might occasionally interweave with another's, the show also follows the relationships with their respective partners and colleagues. Frank with Garrett Moore, the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information and ''de facto'' Chief of Staff, Detective 1st Grade Abigail Baker, the Primary Aide to the Commissioner, and later Lieutenant Sidney Gormley, the Special Assistant to the Commissioner and ''de facto'' Chief of Department; Danny with Detective Maria Baez; Jamie with Officer Edit "Eddie" Janko; and Erin with Detective Anthony Abetemarco in the DA's office.

Both Henry's and Frank's wives are deceased. Erin is divorced and has one college student daughter, Nicky, who lives with her. Danny is a widower with two sons named Jack and Sean; he was married to Linda, a nurse who was killed offscreen between seasons 7 and 8. Jamie is unmarried, though romantic feelings develop between him and his current partner, Eddie Janko; they acknowledge their mutual attraction during season 7 and get engaged at the end of season 8.

A running plot feature of the show entails Sunday dinner around the table in Frank Reagan's [[Bay Ridge]] home at 8070 Harbor View Terrace. Four generations gather here to eat and discuss their week, and the rule is that no one can take a first bite before every last family member is present and seated, and grace is said. Discussion of the week's events then ensues, often including the adults' current work cases, and controversies therefrom are often discussed and hashed out by the entire family. The grandchildren have questions which adults answer sometimes to humor them, sometimes to give their viewpoints. At times the dialogue becomes heated and emotionally charged, but the family always remains loving and united in spite of any differences they encounter. The Sunday dinner has been a Reagan family tradition for more than a century, and is well known to their friends and neighbors.

A '''bond-out processor''' is an [[emulator|emulation]] processor that takes the place of the [[microcontroller]] or [[microprocessor]] in the target board while an application is being developed.&lt;ref&gt;Embedded Systems - September 19, 1994 - Issue 815, page 63 by Lisa Evans
&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond-out processors have internal signals and bus brought out to external pins. The term bond-out derives from connecting (or bonding) the emulation circuitry to these external pins. These devices are designed to be used within an [[in-circuit emulator]] and are not typically used in any other kind of system.

Bond-out pins were marked as no-connects in the first devices produced by [[Intel]], and were usually not connected to anything on the ordinary production silicon. Later bond-out versions of the microprocessor were produced in a bigger package to provide more signals and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;How the Microprocessor Evolved Over Time - By Robert R. Collins - Dr. Dobb's - Undocumented Corner September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond-out processors provides capabilities far beyond those of a simple ROM monitor. A ROM monitor is a firmware program that runs instead of the application code and provides a connection to a host computer to carry out debugging functions. In general the ROM monitor uses part of the processor resources and shares the memory with the user code. 

Bond-out processors  can handle complex [[breakpoints]] (even in ROM), real-time traces of processor activity, and no use of target resources. But this extra functionality comes at a high cost, as bond-outs have to be produced for [[in-circuit emulator]]s only.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to On-Chip Debug - by Arnold Berger and Michael Barr - Embedded Systems Magazine - February 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, sometimes solutions similar to bond-outs are implemented with an ASIC or FPGA or a faster RISC processor that imitates the core processor code execution and peripherals.&lt;ref&gt;Debugging Embedded Systems Using In-Circuit Debuggers - Nikkei Business Publications, Inc. December 2002 Issue&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially confined to single-tasking on [[8-bit processor]]s and no more than 64 [[kilobyte]]s of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations and were migrated to [[16-bit processor]]s.

The combination of CP/M and [[S-100 bus]] computers was loosely patterned on the [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]], an early standard in the microcomputer industry. This [[computer platform]] was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=651&amp;st=1 |title=OLDCOMPUTERS.COM Compupro 8/16 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103062455/http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=651# |archive-date=2016-01-03 |access-date=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software by greatly reducing the amount of programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld May 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Cole |author-first=Maggie |title=Gary Kildall and the Digital Research Success Story |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=52–53 |location=Palo Alto, CA |date=1981-05-25 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3j4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InfoWorld July 1982"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Freiberger |author-first=Paul |author-link=Paul Freiberger |title=History of microcomputing, part 3: software genesis |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |volume=4 |issue=26 |page=41 |location=Palo Alto, CA |date=1982-07-05 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MjAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 |issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important driver of software innovation was the advent of (comparatively) low-cost microcomputers running CP/M, as independent programmers and [[hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]]s bought them and shared their creations in [[user group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Since CP/M was one of the first operating systems, a large number of hobbyists, hackers, and esoteric programmers purchased CP/M computers and began to write programs for themselves...

==Hardware model==
A minimal 8-bit CP/M system would contain the following components:
* A [[computer terminal]] using the [[ASCII]] character set
* An Intel 8080 (and later the 8085) or [[Zilog Z80]] microprocessor
** The [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30|V30]] processors support an 8080-emulation mode that can run 8-bit CP/M on a PC&amp;nbsp;DOS/MS-DOS computer so equipped, though any PC can also run the 16-bit CP/M-86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CP/M emulators for DOS |url=http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/cdrom/ENTERPRS/CPM/TEXT/MAR93.TXT |website=www.retroarchive.org/cpm |publisher=Luis Basto |access-date=2016-07-06 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709085840/http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/cdrom/ENTERPRS/CPM/TEXT/MAR93.TXT |archive-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least 16 kilobytes of [[Random access memory|RAM]], beginning at address 0
* A means to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the first sector of the diskette
* At least one [[floppy disk]] drive

The only hardware system that CP/M, as sold by Digital Research, would support was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems customized portions of the operating system for their own combination of installed memory, disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.

On most machines the bootstrap was a minimal [[bootloader]] in [[Read only memory|ROM]] combined with some means of minimal [[bank switching]] or a means of injecting code on the bus (since the 8080 needs to see boot code at Address 0 for start-up, while CP/M needs RAM there); for others, this bootstrap had to be entered into memory using [[front panel|front-panel]] controls each time the system was started.

CP/M used the 7-bit ASCII set. The other 128 characters made possible by the 8-bit byte were not standardized. For example, one [[Kaypro]] used them for Greek characters, and Osborne machines used the 8th bit set to indicate an underlined character. [[WordStar]] used the 8th bit as an end-of-word marker. International CP/M systems most commonly used the [[ISO 646]] norm for localized character sets, replacing certain ASCII characters with localized characters rather than adding them beyond the 7-bit boundary.

==Components of the operating system==
In the 8-bit versions, while running, the CP/M operating system loaded into memory had three components:
* ''Basic Input/Output System'' or [[BIOS]],
* ''Basic Disk Operating System'' or BDOS,
* ''Console Command Processor'' or CCP.
The BIOS and BDOS were memory-resident, while the CCP was memory-resident unless overwritten by an application, in which case it was automatically reloaded after the application finished running. A number of transient commands for standard utilities were also provided. The transient commands resided in [[Computer file|file]]s with the [[filename extension|extension]] .COM on disk.

The BIOS directly controlled hardware components other than the CPU and main memory. It contained functions such as character input and output and the reading and writing of disk sectors. The BDOS implemented the CP/M [[file system]] and some input/output abstractions (such as redirection) on top of the BIOS. The CCP took user commands and either executed them directly (internal commands such as DIR to show a directory or ERA to delete a file) or loaded and started an executable file of the given name (transient commands such as PIP.COM to copy files or STAT.COM to show various file and system information). Third-party applications for CP/M were also essentially transient commands.

The BDOS, CCP and standard transient commands were (ideally) the same in all installations of a particular revision of CP/M, but the BIOS portion was always adapted to the particular hardware. Adding memory to a computer, for example, meant that the CP/M system had to be reinstalled with an updated BIOS capable of addressing the additional memory. A utility was provided to patch the supplied BIOS, BDOS and CCP to allow them to be run from higher memory. Once installed, the operating system (BIOS, BDOS and CCP) was stored in reserved areas at the beginning of any disk which would be used to boot the system. On start-up, the bootloader (usually contained in a ROM firmware chip) would load the operating system from the disk in drive &lt;code&gt;A:&lt;/code&gt;.

By modern standards CP/M was primitive, owing to the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. From version 1.1 or 1.2 onwards, changing a disk then trying to write to it before its directory was read would cause a fatal error to be signalled. This avoided overwriting the disk but required a reboot and loss of the data that was to be stored on disk.

The majority of the complexity in CP/M was isolated in the BDOS, and to a lesser extent, the CCP and transient commands. This meant that by porting the limited number of simple routines in the BIOS to a particular hardware platform, the entire OS would work. This significantly reduced the development time needed to support new machines, and was one of the main reasons for CP/M's widespread use. Today this sort of abstraction is common to most OSs (a [[hardware abstraction layer]]), but at the time of CP/M's birth, OSs were typically intended to run on only one machine platform, and multilayer designs were considered unnecessary.

===Console Command Processor{{anchor|CCP}}===
&lt;!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The Console Command Processor, or CCP, accepted input from the keyboard and conveyed results to the terminal. CP/M itself would work with either a printing terminal or a video terminal. All CP/M commands had to be typed in on the [[command line]]. The console would most often display the &lt;code&gt;A&gt;&lt;/code&gt; prompt, to indicate the current default disk drive. When used with a video terminal, this would usually be followed by a blinking [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] supplied by the terminal. The CCP would await input from the user.

A CCP internal command, of the form drive letter followed by a colon, could be used to select the default drive. For example, typing &lt;code&gt;B:&lt;/code&gt; and pressing enter at the command prompt would change the default drive to B, and the command prompt would then become &lt;code&gt;B&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to indicate this change.

CP/M's [[command-line interface]] was patterned after the operating systems from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment]], such as [[RT-11]] for the [[PDP-11]] and [[OS/8]] for the [[PDP-8]].

Commands took the form of a keyword followed by a list of parameters separated by spaces or special characters. Similar to a Unix [[shell builtin]], if an internal command was recognized, it was carried out by the CCP itself. Otherwise it would attempt to find an executable file on the currently logged disk drive and (in later versions) user area, load it, and pass it any additional parameters from the command line. These were referred to as "transient" programs. On completion, CP/M would reload the part of the CCP that had been overwritten by application programs — this allowed transient programs a larger memory space.

The commands themselves could sometimes be obscure. For instance, the command to duplicate files was named &lt;code&gt;[[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]]&lt;/code&gt; (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), the name of the old [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, so that there was no single option character that differentiated options from file names. Different programs could and did use different characters.

===Basic Disk Operating System{{anchor|BDOS}}===
&lt;!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The Basic Disk Operating System,&lt;ref name="Kildall_1975_BDOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kildall_1980_CPM"/&gt; or BDOS,&lt;ref name="Kildall_1975_BDOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kildall_1980_CPM"/&gt; provided access to such operations as opening a file, output to the console, or printing. Application programs would load processor registers with a function code for the operation, and addresses for parameters or memory buffers, and call a fixed address in memory. Since the address was the same independent of the amount of memory in the system, application programs would run the same way for any type or configuration of hardware.

===Basic Input Output System{{anchor|BIOS}}===
[[File:CP⁄M Ad, Dec 11, 1978.png|thumbnail|right|CP/M advertisement in the December 11, 1978, issue of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine]]
&lt;!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
&lt;!-- These two sources are not currently used inhere, but may become useful in the future:&lt;ref name="Fischer_2001_Ewing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraley_2007_Killian"/&gt; --&gt;
The Basic Input Output System,&lt;ref name="Kildall_1975_BDOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kildall_1980_CPM"/&gt; or BIOS,&lt;ref name="Kildall_1975_BDOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kildall_1980_CPM"/&gt; provided the lowest level functions required by the operating system.

These included reading or writing single characters to the system console and reading or writing a sector of data from the disk. The BDOS handled some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M 3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on [[single-density]] 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area was handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.

Customization was required because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used a separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use different types of [[UART]] chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.

===File system{{anchor|FDOS|2.2}}===
File names were specified as a string of up to eight characters, followed by a period, followed by a file name extension of up to three characters ([[8.3 filename|"8.3" filename format]]). The extension usually identified the type of the file. For example, &lt;code&gt;.COM&lt;/code&gt; indicated an executable program file, and &lt;code&gt;.TXT&lt;/code&gt; indicated a file containing [[ASCII]] text.

Each disk drive was identified by a [[drive letter]], for example drive &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and drive &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. To refer to a file on a specific drive, the drive letter was prefixed to the file name, separated by a colon, e.g. &lt;code&gt;A:FILE.TXT&lt;/code&gt;. With no drive letter prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.&lt;ref name="px4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discordia.org.uk/px4/cpm.html |title=CP/M Builtin Commands |work=discordia.org.uk |access-date=2009-01-28 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412044820/http://discordia.org.uk/px4/cpm.html |archive-date=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "8.3" filename format and the drive letter + colon combination survived into MS-DOS. The drive letter + colon convention has survived in [[Microsoft Windows]] and is still used today. In addition, file extensions (for example, &lt;code&gt;[[.txt]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[COM file|.com]]&lt;/code&gt; (a [[compiled]] file), or &lt;code&gt;[[.exe]]&lt;/code&gt; (an [[executable]] file)) are still used to identify file types on many operating systems.

File size was specified as the number of 128 byte ''records'' (directly corresponding to disk sectors on 8-inch drives) occupied by a file on the disk. There was no generally supported way of specifying byte-exact file sizes. The current size of a file was maintained in the file's [[File Control Block]] (FCB) by the operating system. Since many application programs (such as [[text editors]]) prefer to deal with files as sequences of characters rather than as sequences of records, by convention text files were terminated with a [[control-Z]] character ([[ASCII]] [[Substitute character|SUB]], [[hexadecimal]] 1A). Determining the [[End-of-file|end]] of a [[text file]] therefore involved examining the last record of the file to locate the terminating control-Z. This also meant that inserting a control-Z character into the middle of a file usually had the effect of truncating the text contents of the file.

With the advent of larger removable and fixed disk drives, disk de-blocking formulas were employed which resulted in more disk blocks per logical file allocation block. While this allowed for larger file sizes, it also meant that the smallest file which could be allocated increased in size from 1KB (on single-density drives) to 2KB (on double-density drives) and so on, up to 32KB for a file containing only a single byte. This made for inefficient use of disk space if the disk contained a large number of small files.

File modification [[system time|time stamps]] were not supported in releases up to CP/M 2.2, but were an optional feature in [[MP/M]] and CP/M 3.0.

CP/M 2.2 had no subdirectories in the file structure, but provided 16 numbered user areas to organize files on a disk. To change user one had to simply type "User X" at the command prompt, X being the number of the user wanted; security was non-existent and not believed to be necessary. The user area concept was to make the single-user version of CP/M somewhat compatible with multi-user MP/M systems. A common patch for the CP/M and derivative operating systems was to make one user area accessible to the user independent of the currently set user area. A USER command allowed the user area to be changed to any area from 0 to 15. User 0 was the default. If one changed to another user, such as USER 1, the material saved on the disk for this user would only be available to USER 1; USER 2 would not be able to see it or access it. However, files stored in the USER 0 area were accessible to all other users; their location was specified with a prefatory [[Path (computing)|path]], since the files of USER 0 were only visible to someone logged in as USER 0. The user area feature arguably had little utility on small floppy disks, but it was useful for organizing files on machines with [[hard drive]]s. The intent of the feature was to ease use of the same computer for different tasks. For example, a secretary could do [[data entry clerk|data entry]], then, after switching USER areas, another employee could use the machine to do [[Invoice|billing]] without their files intermixing.

===Transient Program Area{{anchor|TPA}}===
The read/write memory between address 0100 hexadecimal and the lowest address of the BDOS was the ''Transient Program Area'' (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending on the design of the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.

===Debugging application===
CP/M came with a Dynamic Debugging Tool, nicknamed [[Dynamic debugging technique|DDT]] (after the insecticide, i.e. a [[Software bug|bug]]-killer), which allowed memory and program modules to be examined and manipulated, and allowed a program to be executed one step at a time.&lt;ref&gt;"CP/M Dynamic Debugging Tool", {{cite web |url=http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch4.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-29 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617174713/http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch4.htm |archive-date=2015-06-17}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.cpm.z80.de/randyfiles/DRI/DDT.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-29 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028015406/http://www.cpm.z80.de/randyfiles/DRI/DDT.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-28}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.shaels.net/index.php/cpm80-22-documents/using-cpm/7-ddt-utility |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-29 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208100106/http://www.shaels.net/index.php/cpm80-22-documents/using-cpm/7-ddt-utility |archive-date=2015-12-08}}, all retrieved 2014-08-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|RSX}}Resident programs===
CP/M originally did not support the equivalent of [[terminate and stay resident program]] as under DOS.  Programmers could write software that could intercept certain operating system calls and extend or alter their functionality. Using this capability, programmers developed and sold auxiliary [[desk accessory]] programs, such as [[SmartKey]], a keyboard utility to assign any string of bytes to any key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt |title=Whole Earth Software Catalog |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704110357/https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt |archive-date=2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CP/M&amp;nbsp;3, however, added support for dynamically loadable Resident System Extensions (RSX),&lt;ref name="CPM3_1983_PG"&gt;{{cite book |title=CP/M Plus (CP/M Version 3) Operating System Programmers Guide |edition=2 |date=April 1983 |orig-year=January 1983 |publisher=[[Digital Research]] |url=http://www.cpm.z80.de/manuals/cpm3-pgr.pdf |access-date=2016-11-25 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125024058/http://www.cpm.z80.de/manuals/cpm3-pgr.pdf |archive-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar solutions (like RSM&lt;!-- for Resident System Modules --&gt;&lt;ref name="ct_1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=CP/M 2 lernt dazu.

===Installation===
Although CP/M provided some [[hardware abstraction]] to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, typically application programs still required installation to make use of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by [[escape sequence]]s which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select bold face on a printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer's range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no central operating system service provided for these devices.

The initializing codes for each model of printer had to be written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast dot matrix printer or a slower but presentation-quality [[daisy wheel]] printer), a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).

====The name====
CP/M originally stood for "Control Program/Monitor", a name which implies a [[resident monitor]]—a primitive precursor to the operating system. However, during the conversion of CP/M to a commercial product, trademark registration documents filed in November 1977 gave the product's name as "Control Program for Microcomputers"{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. The CP/M name follows a prevailing naming scheme of the time, as in Kildall's PL/M language, and Prime Computer's [[PL/P]] (''Programming Language for Prime''), both suggesting IBM's [[PL/I]]; and IBM's [[CP/CMS]] operating system, which Kildall had used when working at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]].

This renaming of CP/M was part of a larger effort by Kildall and his wife/business partner to convert Kildall's personal project of CP/M and the Intel-contracted PL/M compiler into a commercial enterprise. The Kildalls intended to establish the Digital Research brand and its product lines as synonymous with "microcomputer" in the consumer's mind, similar to what IBM and Microsoft together later successfully accomplished in making "personal computer" synonymous with their product offerings. Intergalactic Digital Research, Inc. was later renamed via a corporation change-of-name filing to Digital Research, Inc.

====Portability====
Companies chose to support CP/M because of its large library of software. The [[Xerox 820]] ran the operating system because "where there are literally thousands of programs written for it, it would be unwise not to take advantage of it", Xerox said.&lt;ref name="wise19820510"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Mainframe makers court third-party vendors for micro software |work=InfoWorld |date=1982-05-10 |access-date=2015-01-25 |author-last=Wise |author-first=Deborah |pages=21–22 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318064450/https://books.google.com/books?id=bDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;pg=PA21 |archive-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984 [[Columbia University]] used the same source code to build [[Kermit (protocol)|Kermit]] binaries for more than a dozen different CP/M systems, plus a generic version.&lt;ref name="dacruz19840427"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/e/mail.84a |title=New release of KERMIT for CP/M-80 |publisher=Kermit Project, Columbia University |mailinglist=Info-Kermit Digest |date=1984-04-27 |access-date=2016-02-23 |author-last=da Cruz |author-first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system was described as a "software bus", allowing multiple programs to interact with different hardware in a standardized way.&lt;ref name="Swaine_1997_Entrepreneurship"/&gt; Programs written for CP/M were typically portable among different machines, usually requiring only the specification of the [[escape sequence]]s for control of the [[computer terminal|screen]] and printer. This portability made CP/M popular, and much more software was written for CP/M than for operating systems that ran on only one brand of hardware. One restriction on portability was that certain programs used the extended instruction set of the Z80 processor and would not operate on an 8080 or 8085 processor. Another was graphics routines, especially in games and graphics programs, which were generally machine-specific as they used direct hardware access for speed, bypassing the OS and BIOS (this was also a common problem in early DOS machines).{{cn|date=August 2017|reason=Certainly a common problem for DOS programs, but CP/M programs typically were more configurable and thus less machine-specific. Therefore this needs to be sourced by a RS.}}

[[Bill Gates]] claimed that the [[Apple II family]] with a [[Z-80 SoftCard]] was the single most-popular CP/M hardware platform.&lt;ref name="bunnell19820203"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16 |title=The Man Behind The Machine? / A PC Exclusive Interview With Software Guru Bill Gates |work=[[PC Magazine]] |date=February 1982 |access-date=2012-02-17 |author-last=Bunnell |author-first=David |page=16 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509162040/http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16 |archive-date=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the [[Altair 8800]], the [[IMSAI 8080]], the [[Osborne 1]] and Kaypro [[luggable]]s, and [[MSX]] computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the [[Amstrad PCW]]. In the UK, CP/M was also available on [[Research Machines]] educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the [[BBC Micro]] when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]] series, the [[Commodore 128]], [[TRS-80]], and later models of the [[ZX Spectrum]]. CP/M 3 was also used on the [[NIAT]], a custom handheld computer designed for [[A.C. Nielsen]]'s internal use with 1&amp;nbsp;Mbytes of SSD memory.

====Applications====
[[WordStar]], one of the first widely used [[word processor]]s, and [[dBase]], an early and popular database program for microcomputers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early [[outliner]]s, [[Kamas (program)|KAMAS]] (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. [[Turbo Pascal]], the ancestor of [[Borland Delphi]], and [[Multiplan]], the ancestor of [[Microsoft Excel]], also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. [[Visicalc]], the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, [[Sorcim]], created its [[SuperCalc]] spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. [[AutoCAD]], a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular [[programming language]]s of the time (such as [[BASIC]], [[Borland]]'s [[Turbo Pascal]] and [[FORTRAN]]) were available, among them several of the earliest [[Microsoft]] products.

CP/M software often came with [[installer]]s that adapted it to a wide variety of computers.&lt;ref name="mace19840109_16"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ey4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=qxysACmBMb&amp;pg=PA79 |title=IBM PC clone makers shun total compatibility |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1984-01-09 |access-date=2015-02-04 |author-last=Mace |author-first=Scott |pages=79–81 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316182214/https://books.google.com/books?id=ey4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=qxysACmBMb&amp;pg=PA79 |archive-date=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of [[copy protection]] were ineffective on the operating system, and the source code for BASIC programs was easily accessible.&lt;ref name="pournelle198306"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up |title=Zenith Z-100, Epson QX-10, Software Licensing, and the Software Piracy Problem |work=[[BYTE]] |date=June 1983 |access-date=2013-10-20 |author-last=Pournelle |author-first=Jerry |author-link=Jerry Pournelle |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=411 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609081942/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up |archive-date=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of standardized graphics support limited [[video games]], but various character and text-based games were [[ported]], such as ''[[Telengard]]'',&lt;ref name="loguidice20120728"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/4851 |title=More on Avalon Hill Computer Games on Heath/Zenith platforms |work=Armchair Arcade |date=2012-07-28 |access-date=2015-07-22 |author-last=Loguidice |author-first=Bill |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723044908/http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/4851 |archive-date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gorillas (video game)]]'',&lt;ref name="githubgorilla001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/sblendorio/gorilla-cpm |title=Gorillas for CP/M |date=2015-12-01 |access-date=2015-07-22 |author-last=Sblendorio |author-first=Francesco |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205052002/https://github.com/sblendorio/gorilla-cpm |archive-date=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hamurabi]]'', ''[[Lunar Lander (video game series)|Lunar Lander]]'', along with early [[interactive fiction]] including the [[Zork]] series and ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''.

[[Lifeboat Associates]] started collecting and distributing user-written "free" software. One of the first was [[XMODEM]], which allowed reliable file transfers via [[modem]] and phone line. The last significant program native to CP/M was the [[outline processor]] [[KAMAS (program)|KAMAS]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

====Disk formats====
No standard 5 1/4-inch CP/M disk format existed.&lt;ref name="pournelle198204"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering |title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited |work=BYTE |date=April 1982 |access-date=2013-10-19 |author-last=Pournelle |author-first=Jerry |author-link=Jerry Pournelle |pages=212 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026185358/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering |archive-date=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 8-inch single-density [[floppy disk]] format (so-called "distribution format") was standardized, various 5 1/4-inch formats were used depending on the characteristics of particular systems and to some degree the choices of the designers. CP/M supported options to control the size of reserved and directory areas on the disk, and the mapping between logical disk sectors (as seen by CP/M programs) and physical sectors as allocated on the disk. There were many ways to customize these parameters for every system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Johnson-Laird |author-first=Andy |author-link=Andy Johnson-Laird |title=The programmer's CP/M handbook |year=1983 |publisher=Osborne/McGraw-Hill |location=Berkeley, CA |isbn=0-88134-103-7 |chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but once they had been set, no standardized way existed for a system to load parameters from a disk formatted on another system.

[[JRT Pascal]], for example, provided versions on {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch disk for [[North Star Computers|North Star]], Osborne, Apple, [[Zenith Data Systems|Heath]] [[hard sector]] and [[soft sector]], and [[Superbrain]], and a single 8-inch version.&lt;ref name="byte198212"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982 |title=Now: A Complete CP/M Pascal for Only $29.95! |work=[[BYTE]] |date=December 1982 |access-date=2016-10-01 |pages=11 |type=advertisement |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721132531/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982 |archive-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain disk formats were more popular than others. The Xerox 820's became widely supported, for example; much software was available on it, and other computers such as the Kaypro II were compatible with the format.&lt;ref name="derfler19821018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;pg=PA59 |title=Kaypro II—a low-priced, 26-pound portable micro |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1982-10-18 |access-date=2013-10-22 |author-last=Derfler |author-first=Frank J. |pages=59 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101062305/http://books.google.com/books?id=CjAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;pg=PA59 |archive-date=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="byte198309"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-09/1983_09_BYTE_08-09_Portable_Computers_in_Depth#page/n221/mode/2up |title=The Kaypro II |work=[[BYTE]] |date=September 1983 |access-date=2013-10-20 |author-last1=Fager |author-first1=Roger |author-last2=Bohr |author-first2=John |pages=212 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302195830/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-09/1983_09_BYTE_08-09_Portable_Computers_in_Depth#page/n221/mode/2up |archive-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; No single manufacturer, however, prevailed in the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch era of CP/M use, and disk formats were often not portable between hardware manufacturers. A software manufacturer had to prepare a separate version of the program for each brand of hardware on which it was to run. With some manufacturers (Kaypro is an example), there was not even standardization across the company's different models. Because of this situation, disk format translation programs, which allowed a machine to read many different formats, became popular and reduced the confusion, as did programs like Kermit which allowed transfer of data and programs from one machine to another using the [[RS-232|serial]] ports that most CP/M machines had.

The degree of portability between different CP/M machines depended on the type of disk drive and controller used since many different floppy types existed in the CP/M era in both 8" and 5.25" format. Disks could be hard or soft sectored, single or double density, single or double sided, 35 track, 40 track, 77 track, or 80 track, and the sector layout and size could vary widely as well. Although translation programs could allow the user to read disk types from different machines, it also depended on the drive type and controller. By 1982, soft sector, single sided, 40 track 5.25" disks had become the most popular format to distribute CP/M software on as they were used by the most common consumer-level machines of that time such as the Apple II, TRS-80, Osborne 1, [[Kaypro II]], and IBM PC. A translation program allowed the user to read any disks on his machine that had a similar format--for example, the Kaypro II could read [[TRS-80]], [[Osborne 1|Osborne]], [[IBM PC]], and [[Epson QX-10|Epson]] disks. Other disk types such as 80 track or hard sectored were completely impossible to read. The first half of double sided disks (like the Epson QX-10's) could be read because CP/M accessed disk tracks sequentially with track 0 being the first (outermost) track of side 1 and track 79 (on a 40 track disk) being the last (innermost) track of side 2. Apple II users could not use anything but Apple's GCR format and so had to obtain CP/M software on Apple format disks or else transfer it via serial link.

The fragmented CP/M market, requiring distributors either to stock multiple formats of disks or to invest in multiformat duplication equipment, compared with the more standardized [[IBM PC]] disk formats, was a contributing factor to the rapid obsolescence of CP/M after 1981.

One of the last notable CP/M capable machines to appear was the [[Commodore 128]] in 1985, which had a Z80 for CP/M support in addition to its native mode using a 6502-derivative CPU. Using CP/M required either a [[Commodore 1571|1571]] or [[Commodore 1581|1581]] disk drive which could read soft sector 40 track MFM format disks.

The C128 and [[MSX]] were the only machines that supported the use of CP/M with 3.5" floppy disks.

====Graphics====
Although graphics-capable S-100 systems existed from the commercialization of the [[S-100 bus]], CP/M did not provide any standardized graphics support until 1982 with [[Graphics System Extension|GSX]] (Graphics System Extension). Owing to the small memory available, graphics was never a common feature associated with 8-bit CP/M operating systems. Most systems could only display rudimentary [[ASCII art]] charts and diagrams in [[text mode]] or by using a custom [[character set]].

===Multi-user===
{{main|MP/M}}
In 1979, a multi-user compatible derivative of CP/M was released. [[MP/M]] allowed multiple users to connect to a single computer, using multiple [[computer terminal|terminals]] to provide each user with a screen and keyboard.  Later versions ran on 16-bit processors.

===CP/M Plus{{anchor|3.0}}===
The last 8-bit version of CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M Plus, released in 1983. It incorporated the bank switching memory management of [[MP/M]] in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M 2.2 applications. CP/M 3 could therefore use more than 64 kB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The system could be configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker.&lt;ref name="Mann83"/&gt; CP/M 3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the [[Amstrad PCW]], the [[ZX Spectrum +3]], the [[Commodore 128]], and the [[Radio Shack]] [[TRS-80 Model 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-12 page 28 |url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1985_rsc-12/h028.html |website=www.radioshackcomputercatalogs.com |publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack |access-date=2016-07-06 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013055333/http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1985_rsc-12/h028.html |archive-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were versions of CP/M for some [[16-bit]] CPUs as well.

The first version in the 16-bit family was [[CP/M-86]] for the [[Intel 8086]], which was soon followed by '''CP/M-68K''' for the [[Motorola 68000]]. The original version of CP/M-68K in 1982 was written in [[Pascal/MT+68k]], but it was ported to C later on.
At this point the original [[8-bit]] CP/M became known by the [[retronym]] '''CP/M-80''' to avoid confusion. In ca. 1982/1983 there was also a port to the [[Zilog Z8000]] for the [[Olivetti M20]], written in [[C (language)|C]], named '''CP/M-8000'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Research Source Code |author-first1=Tim |author-last1=Olmstead |author-first2=Gaby |author-last2=Chaudry |url=http://www.cpm.z80.de/source.html |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205000740/http://www.cpm.z80.de/source.html |archive-date=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CP/M-86 was expected to be the standard operating system of the new [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]s, but DRI and [[IBM]] were unable to negotiate development and licensing terms. IBM turned to Microsoft instead, and Microsoft delivered [[PC DOS]] based on a CP/M clone, [[86-DOS]]. Although CP/M-86 became an option for the IBM PC after DRI threatened legal action, it never overtook Microsoft's system.

When [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) put out the [[Rainbow 100]] to compete with IBM, it came with CP/M-80 using a Z80 chip, CP/M-86 or MS-DOS using an 8088 microprocessor, or CP/M-86/80 using both. The Z80 and 8088 CPUs ran concurrently.&lt;ref name="Kildall_1982_8-bit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snyder198306"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n105/mode/2up |title=A DEC on Every Desk? |work=[[BYTE]] |date=June 1983 |access-date=2015-02-05 |author-last=Snyder |author-first=John J. |pages=104–106 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102123537/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n105/mode/2up |archive-date=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benefit of the Rainbow was that it could continue to run 8-bit CP/M software, preserving a user's possibly sizable investment as they moved into the 16-bit world of MS-DOS.&lt;ref name="Kildall_1982_8-bit"/&gt;

CP/M-68K, already running on the Motorola [[EXORmacs]] systems, was initially to be used in the [[Atari ST]] computer, but Atari decided to go with a newer disk operating system called [[GEMDOS]]. CP/M-68K was also used on the SORD M68 and M68MX computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=218 |title=M 68 / M 68 MX |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194951/http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=218&amp;st=1 |archive-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These 16-bit versions of CP/M required application programs to be re-compiled for the new CPUs or if they were written in [[assembly language]], to be translated using tools like Digital Research's [[XLT86]], a program written by Gary Kildall in 1981, which translated .ASM source code for the Intel 8080 processor into .A86 source code for the Intel 8086. Using global data flow analysis on 8080 register usage, the translator would also optimize the output for code size and take care of calling conventions, so that [[CP/M-80]] and [[MP/M-80]] programs could be ported to the [[CP/M-86]] and [[MP/M-86]] platforms automatically. [[XLAT86]] itself was written in [[PL/I|PL/I-80]] and was available for CP/M-80 platforms as well as for DEC VMS (for VAX 11/750 or 11/780).&lt;ref&gt;Digital Research (1981): [http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Assembler%20Collection/Digital%20Research%20XLT86%20Manual.pdf ''XLT86 - 8080 to 8086 Assembly Language Translator - User's Guide''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118230700/http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Assembler%20Collection/Digital%20Research%20XLT86%20Manual.pdf |date=2016-11-18}} Digital Research Inc, Pacific Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

===MS-DOS takes over===
Many expected that CP/M would be the standard operating system for 16-bit computers.&lt;ref name="pournelle198403"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-03/1984_03_BYTE_09-03_Simulation#page/n47/mode/2up |title=New Machines, Networks, and Sundry Software |work=[[BYTE]] |date=March 1984 |access-date=2013-10-22 |author-last=Pournelle |author-first=Jerry |author-link=Jerry Pournelle |pages=46 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202232111/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-03/1984_03_BYTE_09-03_Simulation#page/n47/mode/2up |archive-date=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, at [[Bill Gates]]' suggestion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Isaacson]], ''[[The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution]]'' (2014, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-1476708690}}), page 358&lt;/ref&gt; to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the [[IBM Personal Computer]]. Upon the failure to obtain a signed [[non-disclosure agreement]], the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Bellis, Inventors of the Modern Computer Series, [http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm The History of the MS-DOS Operating Systems, Microsoft, Tim Paterson, and Gary Kildall] (accessed Sept 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting product, [[MS-DOS]], soon began outselling CP/M.

Many of the basic concepts and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (&lt;code&gt;A:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;B:&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] [[file system]]. This similarity made it easier to port popular CP/M software like WordStar and [[dBase]]. However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64 [[Kilobyte|KB]] of memory, while CP/M could run in 16 KB if necessary), more commands were built into the [[command.com|command-line shell]], making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.

Although one of the first peripherals for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like expansion card that let it run 8-bit CP/M software,&lt;ref name="magid1982febmar"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA50&amp;ots=cWqvhfFKjb&amp;pg=RA2-PA49 |title=Baby Blue |work=PC |date=February 1982 |access-date=2015-01-04 |author-last=Magid |author-first=Lawrence J. |pages=49 |author-link=Larry Magid |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318054554/https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA50&amp;ots=cWqvhfFKjb&amp;pg=RA2-PA49 |archive-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; CP/M rapidly lost market share as the microcomputing market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine, at the time one of the leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S-100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine. A 1984 article in ''InfoWorld'' stated that efforts to introduce CP/M to the home market had been largely unsuccessful and most CP/M software was too expensive for home users,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Mace, ''CP/M Eludes Home Market'', ''InfoWorld'', June 11, 1984 page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1986 stated that Kaypro had stopped production of their 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Groth, ''Kaypro is retreating on CP/M'', ''[[InfoWorld]]'' February 10, 1986, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Later versions of CP/M-86 made significant strides in performance and usability and were made compatible with MS-DOS. To reflect this compatibility the name was changed, and CP/M-86 became [[DOS Plus]], which in turn became [[DR-DOS]].

===ZCPR===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
ZCPR (the Z80 Command Processor Replacement) was introduced on February 2, 1982 as a drop-in replacement for the standard Digital Research console command processor (CCP) and was initially written by a group of computer hobbyists who called themselves "The CCP Group". They were Frank Wancho, Keith Petersen (the archivist behind [[Simtel]] at the time), Ron Fowler, Charlie Strom, Bob Mathias, and Richard Conn. Richard was, in fact, the driving force in this group (all of whom maintained contact through email).

ZCPR1 was released on a disk put out by SIG/M (Special Interest Group/Microcomputers), a part of the Amateur Computer Club of [[New Jersey]].

ZCPR2 was released on February 14, 1983. It was released as a set of ten disks from SIG/M. ZCPR2 was upgraded to 2.3, and also was released in 8080 code, permitting the use of ZCPR2 on 8080 and 8085 systems.

ZCPR3 was released on [[Bastille Day]], July 14, 1984, as a set of nine disks from SIG/M. The code for ZCPR3 could also be compiled (with reduced features) for the 8080 and would run on systems that did not have the requisite [[Z80]] microprocessor.

In January 1987, Richard Conn stopped developing ZCPR, and Echelon asked Jay Sage (who already had a privately enhanced ZCPR 3.1) to continue work on it. Thus, ZCPR 3.3 was developed and released. ZCPR 3.3 no longer supported the 8080 series of microprocessors, and added the most features of any upgrade in the ZCPR line.

Features of ZCPR as of version 3 included:

* shells
* aliases
* I/O redirection
* flow control
* named directories
* search paths
* custom menus
* passwords
* on line help

ZCPR3.3 also included a full complement of utilities with considerably extended capabilities. While enthusiastically supported by the CP/M user base of the time, ZCPR alone was insufficient to slow the demise of CP/M.

==Legacy==
A number of behaviors exhibited by [[Microsoft Windows]] are a result of [[backward compatibility]] with MS-DOS, which in turn attempted some backward compatibility with CP/M. The [[drive letter]] and [[8.3 filename]] conventions in MS-DOS (and early Windows versions) were originally adopted from CP/M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/10/9718865.aspx |title=Why does MS-DOS use 8.3 filenames instead of, say, 11.2 or 16.16? |author-last=Chen |author-first=Raymond |author-link=Raymond Chen (Microsoft) |work=The Old New Thing |access-date=2010-12-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922053341/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/10/9718865.aspx |archive-date=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Wildcard character|wildcard]] matching characters used by Windows (? and *) are based on those of CP/M,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/17/6785519.aspx |title=How did wildcards work in MS-DOS? |author-last=Chen |author-first=Raymond |author-link=Raymond Chen (Microsoft) |work=The Old New Thing |access-date=2010-12-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508010315/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/17/6785519.aspx |archive-date=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the reserved filenames used to [[Redirection (computing)|redirect]] output to a [[printer (computing)|printer]] ("PRN:"), and the [[System console|console]] ("CON:"). The drive names A and B were used to designate the two floppy disk drives that CP/M systems typically used; when hard drives appeared they were designated C, which survived into MS-DOS as the &lt;code&gt;C:\&gt;&lt;/code&gt; command prompt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/22/55388.aspx |title=What's the deal with those reserved filenames like NUL and CON? |author-last=Chen |author-first=Raymond |author-link=Raymond Chen (Microsoft) |work=The Old New Thing |access-date=2010-12-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802040600/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/22/55388.aspx |archive-date=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the control character &lt;tt&gt;^Z&lt;/tt&gt; marking the [[End-of-file|end of some text files]] can also be attributed to CP/M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/16/90448.aspx |title=Why do text files end in Ctrl+Z? |author-last=Chen |author-first=Raymond |author-link=Raymond Chen (Microsoft) |work=The Old New Thing |access-date=2010-12-17 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206100213/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/16/90448.aspx |archive-date=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positive Voltage Clamping V2.svg|frame|Positive unbiased voltage clamping vertically translates the input waveform so that all parts of it are approximately greater than 0&amp;nbsp;V.

A '''clamper''' is an [[electronic circuit]] that fixes either the positive or the negative peak excursions of a signal to a defined value by shifting its DC value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953450203|title=Practical electrical engineering|last=Makarov|first=Sergey N.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Reinhold|last3=Bitar|first3=Stephen J.|publisher=Springer International|others=|year=|isbn=9783319211732|location=Switzerland|pages=827|oclc=953450203}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level. A '''diode clamp''' (a simple, common type) consists of a [[diode]], which conducts electric current in only one direction and prevents the signal exceeding the reference value; and a [[capacitor]], which provides a DC offset from the stored charge. The capacitor forms a [[time constant]] with the [[resistor]] load, which determines the range of frequencies over which the clamper will be effective.

==General function==
A clamping circuit (also known as a clamper) will bind the upper or lower extreme of a waveform to a fixed DC voltage level. These circuits are also known as DC voltage restorers. Clampers can be constructed in both positive and negative polarities. When unbiased, clamping circuits will fix the voltage lower limit (or upper limit, in the case of negative clampers) to 0 volts. These circuits clamp a peak of a waveform to a specific DC level compared with a capacitively-coupled signal, which swings about its average DC level.

The clamping network is one that will "clamp" a signal to a different dc level. The network must have a capacitor, a diode, and a resistive element, but it can also employ an independent dc supply to introduce an additional shift. The magnitude of R and C must be chosen such that the time constant RC is large enough to ensure that the voltage across the capacitor does not discharge significantly during the interval the diode is nonconducting.

==Types==
Clamp circuits are categorised by their operation; negative or positive, and biased or unbiased. A positive clamp circuit(negative peak clamper) outputs a purely positive waveform from an input signal; it offsets the input signal so that all of the waveform is greater than 0&amp;nbsp;V. A negative clamp is the opposite of this—this clamp outputs a purely negative waveform from an input signal. A bias voltage between the diode and ground offsets the output voltage by that amount.

For example, an input signal of peak value 5&amp;nbsp;V (V&lt;sub&gt;INpeak&lt;/sub&gt; = 5&amp;nbsp;V) is applied to a positive clamp with a bias of 3&amp;nbsp;V (V&lt;sub&gt;BIAS&lt;/sub&gt; = 3&amp;nbsp;V), the peak output voltage will be:

:V&lt;sub&gt;OUTpeak&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 × V&lt;sub&gt;INpeak&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;BIAS&lt;/sub&gt;
:V&lt;sub&gt;OUTpeak&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 × 5&amp;nbsp;V + 3&amp;nbsp;V
:V&lt;sub&gt;OUTpeak&lt;/sub&gt; = 13&amp;nbsp;V

Note that the peak to peak excursion remains at 2{{nbsp}}V

===Positive unbiased===
[[File:Positive Voltage Clamping Circuit (simulated).svg|300px|thumb|A positive unbiased clamp.]]
In the negative cycle of the input AC signal, the diode is forward biased and conducts, charging the capacitor to the peak negative value of V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. During the positive cycle, the diode is reverse biased and thus does not conduct. The output voltage is therefore equal to the voltage stored in the capacitor plus the input voltage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Paul |last2=Winfield |first2=Hill |title=The Art of Electronics Third Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780521809269 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;INpeak&lt;/sub&gt;. This is also called a [[Villard circuit]].
{{Clear}}

===Negative unbiased===
[[File:Negative Voltage Clamping Circuit (simulated).svg|300px|thumb|A negative unbiased clamp]]
A negative unbiased clamp is the opposite of the equivalent positive clamp. In the positive cycle of the input AC signal, the diode is forward biased and conducts, charging the capacitor to the peak positive value of V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. During the negative cycle, the diode is reverse biased and thus does not conduct. The output voltage is therefore equal to the voltage stored in the capacitor plus the input voltage again, so V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;INpeak&lt;/sub&gt;.
{{Clear}}

===Positive biased===
[[File:Positive Biased Voltage Clamping Circuit (simulated).svg|300px|thumb|A positive biased clamp]]
A positive biased voltage clamp is identical to an equivalent unbiased clamp but with the output voltage offset by the bias amount V&lt;sub&gt;BIAS&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + (V&lt;sub&gt;INpeak&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;BIAS&lt;/sub&gt;).
{{Clear}}

===Negative biased===
[[File:Negative Biased Voltage Clamping Circuit (simulated).svg|300px|thumb|A negative biased clamp]]
A negative biased voltage clamp is likewise identical to an equivalent unbiased clamp but with the output voltage offset in the negative direction by the bias amount V&lt;sub&gt;BIAS&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; − (V&lt;sub&gt;INpeak&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;BIAS&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Op-amp circuit===
[[File:Precision op-amp clamp.svg|thumb|Precision op-amp clamp circuit&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Bali, ''Linear Integrated Circuits'', p.279, Tata McGraw-Hill, 2008 {{ISBN|0-07-064807-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The figure shows an op-amp clamp circuit with a non-zero reference clamping voltage. The advantage here is that the clamping level is at precisely the reference voltage. There is no need to take into account the forward volt drop of the diode (which is necessary in the preceding simple circuits as this adds to the reference voltage). The effect of the diode volt drop on the circuit output will be divided down by the gain of the amplifier, resulting in an insignificant error. The circuit also has a great improvement in linearity at small input signals in comparison to the simple diode circuit and is largely unaffected by changes in the load.

==Clamping for input protection==
Clamping can be used to adapt an input signal to a device that cannot make use of or may be damaged by the signal range of the original input.

==Principles of operation==
During the first negative phase of the AC input voltage, the capacitor in a positive clamper circuit charges rapidly. As ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; becomes positive, the capacitor serves as a voltage doubler; since it has stored the equivalent of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; during the negative cycle, it provides nearly that voltage during the positive cycle. This essentially doubles the voltage seen by the load. As ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; becomes negative, the capacitor acts as a battery of the same voltage of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. The voltage source and the capacitor counteract each other, resulting in a net voltage of zero as seen by the load.

===Loading===
For passive type clampers with a capacitor, followed by a diode in parallel with the load, the load can significantly affect perfomance. The magnitude of ''R'' and ''C'' are chosen so that the time constant, &lt;math&gt;\tau = RC &lt;/math&gt;, is large enough to ensure that the voltage across the capacitor does not discharge significantly during the diode's non-conducting interval. A load resistance that is too low (heavy load) will partially discharge the capacitor and cause the waveform peaks to drift off the intended clamp voltage.  This effect is greatest at low frequecies.  At a higher frequency, there is less time between cycles for the capacitor to discharge.

The capacitor cannot be made arbitrarily large to overcome load discharge.  During the conducting interval, the capacitor must be recharged.  The time taken to do this is governed by a different time constant, this time set by the capacitance and the internal impedance of the driving circuit.  Since the peak voltage is reached in one quarter cycle and then starts to fall again, the capacitor must be recharged in a quarter cycle.  This requirement calls for a low value of capacitance.

The two conflicting requirements for capacitance value may be irreconcilable in applications with a high driving impedance and low load impedance.  In such cases, an active circuit must be used such as the op-amp circuit described above.

==Biased versus non-biased==
By using a voltage source and resistor, the clamper can be biased to bind the output voltage to a different value. The voltage supplied to the potentiometer will be equal to the offset from zero (assuming an ideal diode) in the case of either a positive or negative clamper (the clamper type will determine the direction of the offset). If a negative voltage is supplied to either positive or negative, the waveform will cross the x-axis and be bound to a value of this magnitude on the opposite side. Zener diodes can also be used in place of a voltage source and potentiometer, hence setting the offset at the Zener voltage.

==Examples==

Clamping circuits were common in [[analog television]] receivers. These sets have a DC restorer circuit, which returns the voltage of the video signal during the 'back porch' of the line blanking (retrace) period to 0&amp;nbsp;V. Low frequency interference, especially power line hum, induced onto the signal spoils the rendering of the image, and in extreme cases causes the set to lose [[analog television#Synchronization|synchronization]]. This interference can be effectively removed via this method.

==History==

===Funding &amp; early history===
Clover was incorporated in October 15, 2010 and raised $5.5M on November 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517885/000151788511000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml | title=Sec Form D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead investor was [[Sutter Hill Ventures]] with participation from [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and a number of angel investors.  The company was founded by John Beatty, Leonard Speiser, and Kelvin Zheng.  The company secured an additional $3M convertible note from Sutter Hill Ventures in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517885/000151788512000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml | title=Sec Form D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First hardware product ===
Clover launched its first hardware solution, the Clover Station, in 2013 and began shipping it in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gigaom.com/2013/10/09/after-a-quiet-year-clover-emerges-with-a-sexy-cash-register-a-new-owner/ | title=After a quiet year, Clover emerges with a sexy cash register &amp; a new owner| date=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clover opened its App Marketplace to third party developers in 2014.

Clover announced its second hardware product, the Clover Mobile, at the Money 20/20 conference in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/first-data-debuts-clover-mobile-a-wireless-tablet-based-point-of-sale/ | title=First Data Debuts Clover Mobile, A Wireless, Tablet-Based Point-Of-Sale}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2015, Clover Mobile won the Gold medal for the Best POS innovation at the PYMNTS.com Innovator Awards ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/all-features/clover-mobile-wins-gold.html | title=All Small Business Payment Solutions &amp;#124; First Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clover Mobile features a complete EMVCo compliant payments solution with an on-screen pin-pad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mobile | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is fully PCI PTS 4.0 compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/popups/pts_device.php?appnum=4-40156&lt;/ref&gt; It also features an EMVCo compliant Contactless payment interface which enables it to support Apple Pay among other contactless payment modes. The device has an ergonomic handle with an integrated barcode scanner&lt;ref&gt; https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/marketing-merchant/FD_Solutions_with_Clover_Mobile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - with an external wireless mobile printer accessory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/accessories?accessoriesTypeGroup=mobile | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to keep the device lightweight and reduce fatigue.

=== Third hardware product ===
Clover's third hardware product, the Clover Mini was launched by First Data on June 16, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150616006141/en/Data-Launches-Clover%C2%AE-Mini-Future-Payment-Terminals | title=First Data Launches Clover® Mini, the Future of Payment Terminals| date=2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Clover Mobile, Clover Mini&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mini | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a PCI PTS 4.0 approved,&lt;ref&gt; https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/popups/pts_device.php?appnum=4-40158&lt;/ref&gt; EMVCo compliant contact and contactless next generation payment device. Clover Mini has a built-in receipt printer and is designed to be a terminal replacement with the support for advanced payments interfaces, while also allowing Merchants to install apps from the Clover App Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/appmarket/ | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clover Mini also features an USB hub allowing easy interface of peripherals such as external barcode scanners, cash drawer &lt;ref&gt;https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/marketing-merchant/FD_Solutions_with_Clover_Mini.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a Merchant keypad (for cases where the Mini is Customer-facing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/accessories?accessoriesTypeGroup=mini | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
On December 28, 2012, Clover entered into a merger agreement with First Data Corporation.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/740112/000104746913011139/a2217468zs-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview with Wharton professor Rahul Kapoor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innonavi.com/recent-guests/ | title=Recent Guests}}&lt;/ref&gt; the structure of the acquisition was explained.  An operating agreement was put into place whereby Clover would receive $100M in funding to run independently.  First Data would be responsible for sales and support, while Clover built all new payment hardware/software for the company.  The deal utilized a "Founder's Clause" that would trigger a very large penalty payment if the parent company interfered with operations of Clover.  Thirty two months after the acquisition Clover was mentioned 88 times in the S-1 filed by First Data Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883980/000119312515256975/d31022ds1.htm | title=Form S-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''dBc''' ('''decibels relative to the [[Carrier wave|carrier]]''') is the power ratio of a signal to a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] signal, expressed in [[decibels]]. For example, [[phase noise]] is expressed in dBc/[[Hertz|Hz]] at a given [[frequency]] offset from the carrier. dBc can also be used as a measurement of Spurious-Free Dynamic Range ([[Spurious-Free Dynamic Range|SFDR]]) between the desired signal and unwanted spurious outputs resulting from the use of signal converters such as a [[digital-to-analog converter]] or a [[frequency mixer]]. 

If the dBc figure is positive, then the relative signal strength is greater than the carrier signal strength.  If the dBc figure is negative, then the relative signal strength is less than carrier signal strength.

Although the [[decibel]] (dB) is permitted for use alongside [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the dBc is not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor 1995, Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI), NIST Special Publication SP811]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12268">'''Engineering psychology''', also known as Human Factors Engineering, is the science of [[human behavior]] and capability, applied to the design and operation of systems and technology.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;
As an applied field of [[psychology]] and an interdisciplinary part of [[ergonomics]], it aims to improve the [[Human–machine system|relationships between people and machines]] by redesigning equipment, interactions, or the environment in which they take place. The work of an engineering psychologist is often described as making the relationship more "user-friendly."

== History ==
Engineering psychology was created from within [[experimental psychology]].&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; Engineering psychology started during World War I (1914).&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz"/&gt; The reason why this subject was developed during this time was because many of America’s weapons were failing;  bombs not falling in the right place to weapons attacking normal marine life.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; The fault was traced back to human errors.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; One of the first designs to be built to restrain human error was the use of [[psychoacoustics]] by S.S. Stevens and L.L. Beranek were two of the first American psychologists called upon to help change how people and machinery worked together.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; One of their first assignments was to try and reduce noise levels in military aircraft. The work was directed at improving intelligibility of military communication systems and appeared to have been very successful. However it was not until after August 1945 that levels of research in engineering psychology began to increase significantly.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; This occurred because the research that started in 1940 now began to show.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt;

[[Lillian Gilbreth]] combined the talents of an [[engineer]], [[psychologist]] and mother of twelve.  Her appreciation of [[human factor]]s made her successful in the implementation of [[time and motion]] studies and [[scientific management]].  She went on to pioneer [[ergonomic]]s in the kitchen, inventing the [[pedal bin]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A brief history of modern psychology |author=Ludy T. Benjamin |page=105 |chapter=Lillian Gilbreth's Engineering Psychology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the two world wars generated much formal study of human factors which affected the efficiency of munitions output and warfare.  In World War I, the Health of Munitions Workers Committee was created in 1915.  This made recommendations based upon studies of the effects of overwork on efficiency which resulted in policies of providing breaks and limiting hours of work, including avoidance of work on Sunday.  The [[Industrial Fatigue Research Board]] was created in 1918 to take this work forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Employers, the government, and industrial fatigue in Britain, 1890-1918 |first=A.J. |last=McIvor |journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine |year=1987 |volume=44 |pages=724–732 |doi=10.1136/oem.44.11.724|pmc=1007909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In WW2, researchers at Cambridge University such as [[Frederic Bartlett]] and [[Kenneth Craik]] started work on the operation of equipment in 1939 and this resulted in the creation of the [[Unit for Research in Applied Psychology]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/history/legacyconference/briefingnotes.html |title=Notes on the work of the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit 1944-1997 |chapter=Formation of the APU |publisher=MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Cognitive ergonomics]] &amp; [[cognitive engineering]] - studies cognition in work settings, in order to optimize ''human well-being and system performance''.  It is a subset of the larger field of [[human factors]] and [[ergonomics]].
* [[Applied psychology]] - The use of psychological principles to overcome problems in other domains.  It has been argued that engineering psychology is separate from applied (cognitive) psychology because advances in cognitive psychology have infrequently informed engineering psychology research.  Surprisingly, work in engineering psychology often seems to inform developments in cognitive psychology.  For example, engineering psychology research has enabled cognitive psychologists to explain why [[GUI]]s seem easier to use than character-based computer interfaces (such as [[DOS]]).&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=N.|title=Engineering Psychology: Another Science of Common Sense?|journal=The Psychologist|year=1996|volume=9|issue=7|pages=300–303|url=http://www.katiandgraham.com/eng_psy.htm|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering Psychology, Ergonomics, &amp; Human Factors ===
Although the comparability of these terms and many others have been a topic of debate, the differences of these fields can be seen in the applications of the respective fields.

Engineering psychology is concerned with the adaptation of the equipment and environment to people, based upon their psychological capacities and limitations with the objective of improving overall system performance, involving human and machine elements&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; Engineering psychologists strive to match equipment requirements with the capabilities of human operators by changing the design of the equipment.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schultz| first = D| authorlink = |author2=Schultz, E.| title = Psychology and work today | publisher = Pearson |location=New Jersey | year = 2010| url = | isbn = 978-0-205-68358-1 | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this matching was the redesign of the mailbags used by letter carriers. Engineering psychologists discovered that mailbag with a waist-support strap, and a double bag that requires the use of both shoulders, reduces muscle fatigue.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz" /&gt; Another example involves the cumulative trauma disorders grocery checkout workers suffered as the result of repetitive wrist movements using electronic scanners. Engineering psychologists found that the optimal checkout station design would allow for workers to easily use either hand to distribute the workload between both wrists.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz" /&gt;

The field of [[ergonomics]] is based on scientific studies of ordinary people in work situations and is applied to the design of processes and machines, to the layout of work places, to methods of work, and to the control of the physical environment, in order to achieve greater efficiency of both men and machines&lt;ref name="Human Factors"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Licht, | first = D| authorlink = |author2=D.

Boff| title =Human factors, ergonomics, and human factors engineering: An analysis of deinitions| work = | publisher =| url = http://www.hfes.org/Web/EducationalResources/HFDefinitions.pdf| format = | doi = | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of an ergonomics study is the evaluation of the effects of screwdriver handle shape, surface material and workpiece orientation on torque performance, finger force distribution and muscle activity in a maximum screwdriving torque task.&lt;ref name="Kong"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kong| first = Y.

At one point in time, the term [[human factors]] was used in place of ergonomics in Europe.&lt;ref name="Grether"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Grether| first = F| authorlink = | title = Engineering psychology in the United States| journal = American Psychologist |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=743–751| publisher = | year = 1962| url = | format = | doi = 10.1037/h0026850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human factors involve interdisciplinary scientific research and studies to seek to realize greater recognition and understanding of the worker's characteristics, needs, abilities, and limitations when the procedures and products of technology are being designed.&lt;ref name="Human Factors" /&gt; This field utilizes knowledge from several fields such as mechanical engineering, psychology, and industrial engineering&lt;ref name="Human Factors" /&gt; to design instruments.

[[Human factors]] is broader than engineering psychology, which is focused specifically on designing systems that accommodate the information-processing capabilities of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Wickens, C. and Hollands, J. (1999), ''Engineering Psychology and Human Performance'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-321-04711-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the work in the respective fields differ, there are some similarities between these. These fields share the same objectives which are to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency with which human activities are conducted as well as to improve the general quality of life through increased safety, reduced fatigue and stress, increased comfort, and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;

===Importance of Engineering Psychologists===

Engineering psychologists contribute to the design of a variety of products, including dental and surgical tools, cameras, toothbrushes and car-seats. They have been involved in the re-design of the mailbags used by letter carriers. More than 20% of letter carriers suffer from [[musculoskeletal injury]] such as lower back pain from carrying mailbags slung over their shoulders. A mailbag with a waist-support strap, and a double bag that requires the use of both shoulders, has been shown to reduce muscle fatigue.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Research by engineering psychologists has demonstrated that using cell-phones while driving degrades performance by increasing driver reaction time, particularly among older drivers, and can lead to higher accident risk among drivers of all ages. Research findings such as these have supported governmental regulation of cell-phone use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P.

'''Fernanda Bertini Viégas''' (born 1971) is a [[Brazil]]ian scientist and designer, whose work focuses on the social, collaborative and artistic aspects of information visualization.

== Biography ==
Viégas received a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences from the [[MIT Media Lab]] in 2005. The same year she began work at the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts location of IBM's [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] as part of the Visual Communication Lab.

In April 2010, she and [[Martin M. Wattenberg]] started a new venture called Flowing Media, Inc., to focus on visualization aimed at consumers and mass audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hint.fm/blog/2010/04/08/a-new-chapter/ |title=A New Chapter — Visual Hint |publisher=Hint.fm |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, both of them joined Google as the co-leaders of the Google's "Big Picture" data visualization group in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hint.fm/blog/2010/08/05/that-was-fast/ |title=That was fast! — Visual Hint |publisher=Hint.fm |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fernandaviegas.com/bio.html |title=Fernanda B. Viégas |publisher=Fernandaviegas.com |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Social visualization ===
Viégas began her research while at the [[MIT Media Lab]], focusing on [[graphical interface]]s for [[online communication]]. Her Chat Circles system introduced ideas such as [[proximity-based filtering]] of conversation and a visual archive of chat history displaying the overall rhythm and form of a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Chat Circles''. Fernanda B. Viégas and Judith Donath. ACM Conference on Computer-Human Interaction (CHI), 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[email]] visualization designs (including PostHistory and Themail) are the foundation for many other systems; her findings on how visualizations are often used for storytelling influenced subsequent work on the collaborative aspects of visualization.&lt;ref&gt;Baby Names, Visualization, and Social Data Analysis Martin Wattenberg. InfoVis 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While at MIT, she also studied usage of [[Usenet]] and [[blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rosen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/magazine/19PHENOM.html Your Blog or Mine?], ''New York Times Magazine'', December 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective intelligence and public visualization ===
[[File:Viegas-UserActivityonWikipedia.gif|thumb|Fernanda Viégas, "Chromogram," 2006]]

A second stream of work, in partnership with [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]], centers on collective intelligence and the public use of data visualization.

Her work with visualizations such as [[History Flow]] and [[Chromogram]] led to some of the earliest publications on the dynamics of Wikipedia, including the first scientific study of the repair of [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;2004: Studying Cooperation and Conflict between Authors with history flow Visualizations. Fernanda B. Viégas, Martin Wattenberg, and Kushal Dave. ACM Conference on Computer-Human Interaction (CHI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Viégas is one of the founders of IBM's experimental [[Many Eyes]] website, created in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Eisenberg, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/technology/31novel.html Lines and Bubbles and Bars, Oh My! New Ways to Sift Data], ''New York Times'', August 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folha de S.Paulo, [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/informatica/ult124u462872.shtml Many Eyes é criação de brasileira], November 1, 2008'.&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to make visualization technology accessible to the public. In addition to broad uptake from individuals, the technology from Many Eyes has been used by nonprofits and news outlets such as the New York Times Visualization Lab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizlab.nytimes.com/ New York Times Visualization Lab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214074006/http://vizlab.nytimes.com/ |date=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
Viégas is also known for her artistic work, which explores the medium of visualization for explorations of emotionally charged digital data. An early example is Artifacts of the Presence Era, an interactive installation at the Boston Center for the Arts in 2003, which featured a video-based timeline of visitor interactions with the museum. She often works with Martin Wattenberg to visualize emotionally charged information. An example of these works is their piece "Web Seer", which is a visualization of Google Suggest.&lt;ref&gt;http://fernandaviegas.com/art.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleshmap series (started in 2008) uses visualization to portray aspects of sensuality, and includes work on the web, video, and installations.&lt;ref&gt;Cate McQuaid, [http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/04/29/inside_squash_art_and_sport_confined/ Inside squash: art and sport confined], ''Boston Globe'', April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she launched the [http://hint.fm/wind Wind Map project],&lt;ref&gt;"The Week In Ideas - On With The Wind", The Wall Street Journal, April 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which displays continuously updated forecasts of wind patterns across the United States.

[[Image:Modernfirescreen.jpg|thumb|Modern black metal and mesh fire screen]]
A '''fire screen sheet''' began as a form of [[furniture]] that acted as a shield between the occupants of a room and the [[fireplace]], and its primary function was to reduce the discomfort of excessive heat from a log fire. Early firescreens were generally shaped as flat panels standing on attached feet, or as adjustable shield-shaped panels mounted on tripod table legs.

Firescreens in the modern home have become decorative shields of [[sheet metal]], [[glass]], or [[wire mesh]] that can be placed in front of a [[fireplace]] opening to protect the room from open flames and flying embers that may be emitted by the fire.

Fire screens were used to cover the fireplace when nothing was burning inside it, and make it look more decorative.


==Types of fire screen==
The ''three-panel'' fire screen, which covers the fireplace almost completely, has two side panels angled away from the central panel. It is an effective way of providing decoration in a room.

The ''horse screen'', or ''cheval screen'' (cheval is the French word for horse) was in common use from the 18th century. It is a wide screen having two feet on each side, the arrangement of the feet giving the screen its name. Placed in front of the unused fireplace, the decorated screen improves the appearance of a room.&lt;ref name="buff"&gt;{{citation|url=http://buffaloah.com/f/glos/f/firescreen.html |title=Fire Screen|publisher=Buffalo Architecture and History|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screens are decorated with [[embroidery]], [[papier maché]], painted wood or perhaps [[stained glass]]; the frame and feet might be carved.&lt;ref name="chat"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.antiques-art-collectibles.com/collectible/firescreen.htm|title=The History of Fire Screens|publisher=Chatelaine's Antiques|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''pole screen'' also began to appear in the 18th century. It is a smaller screen placed on a vertical pole which is mounted on a tripod; placed between a lit fire and an occupant of the room, the screen can be adjusted up or down to shield the person's face from the heat. The screen might be rectangular or a more decorous shape, and is decorated perhaps with embroidery, lacquer or paint.&lt;ref name="buff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt;

The ''banner'' screen is similar to a pole screen; instead of a solid screen there is a loose piece of silk or embroidery, weighted with tassels on the lower edge;&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt; like a banner, it is supported from the top edge by a crossbar connected to a pole.

A '''flow graph''' is a form of [[Digraph (mathematics)|digraph]] associated with a set of linear algebraic or differential equations:&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;
:"A signal flow graph is a network of nodes (or points) interconnected by directed branches, representing a set of linear algebraic equations. The nodes in a flow graph are used to represent the variables, or parameters, and the connecting branches represent the coefficients relating these variables to one another. The flow graph is associated with a number of simple rules which enable every possible solution [related to the equations] to be obtained."&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;

Although this definition uses the terms "signal flow graph" and "flow graph" interchangeably, the term "signal flow graph" is most often used to designate the [[Mason graph|Mason signal-flow graph]], Mason being the originator of this terminology in his work on electrical networks.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason2/&gt; Likewise, some authors use the term "flow graph" to refer strictly to the [[Coates graph|Coates flow graph]].&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoskins/&gt; According to Henley &amp; Williams:&lt;ref name="Henley2"/&gt;
:"The nomenclature is far from standardized, and...no standardization can be expected in the foreseeable future."

A designation "flow graph" that includes both the Mason graph and the Coates graph, and a variety of other forms of such graphs&lt;ref name=Murota/&gt; appears useful, and agrees with Abrahams and Coverley's and with Henley and Williams' approach.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;

A '''directed network''' – also known as a [[flow network]] – is a particular type of flow graph. A ''network'' is a graph with real numbers associated with each of its edges, and if the graph is a digraph, the result is a ''directed network''.&lt;ref name=Chartrand/&gt; A flow graph is more general than a directed network, in that the edges may be associated with ''gains, branch gains'' or ''transmittances'', or even functions of the Laplace operator ''s'', in which case they are called ''transfer functions''.&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;

There is a close relationship between graphs and matrices and between digraphs and matrices.&lt;ref name=Harary/&gt; "The algebraic theory of matrices can be brought to bear on graph theory to obtain results elegantly", and conversely, graph-theoretic approaches based upon flow graphs are used for the solution of linear algebraic equations.&lt;ref name=Swamy/&gt;

== Deriving a flow graph from equations  ==
[[File:Signal flow graph example.png|thumb|200px|An example of a signal flow graph]]
[[File:Flow graph for three linear equations.png|300px|thumb|Flow graph for three simultaneous equations. The edges incident on each node are colored differently just for emphasis.]]
An example of a flow graph connected to some starting equations is presented.

The set of equations should be consistent and linearly independent. An example of such a set is:&lt;ref name="Henley2"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;0\\
0&amp;1&amp;1\\
5&amp;-1&amp;-1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}5\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Consistency and independence of the equations in the set is established because the determinant of coefficients is non-zero, so a solution can be found using [[Cramer's rule]].

Using the examples from the subsection [[Mason graph#Elements of signal flow graphs|Elements of signal flow graphs]], we construct the graph In the figure, a signal-flow graph in this case. To check that the graph does represent the equations given, go to node ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Look at the  arrows incoming to this node (colored green for emphasis) and the weights attached to them. The equation for ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is satisfied by equating it to the sum of the nodes attached to the incoming arrows multiplied by the weights attached to these arrows. Likewise, the red arrows and their weights provide the equation for ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the blue arrows for ''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Another example is the general case of three simultaneous equations with unspecified coefficients:&lt;ref name=Deo/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11}&amp;c_{12}&amp;c_{13}\\
c_{21}&amp;c_{22}&amp;c_{23}\\
c_{31}&amp;c_{32}&amp;c_{33}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\y_3\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
To set up the flow graph, the equations are recast so each identifies a single variable by adding it to each side. For example:
:&lt;math&gt; \left( c_{11}+1 \right) x_1+c_{12}x_2+c_{13}x_3-y_1 = x_1 \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Using the diagram and summing the incident branches into ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''  this equation is seen to be satisfied.

As all three variables enter these recast equations in a symmetrical fashion, the symmetry is retained in the graph by placing each variable at the corner of an equilateral triangle. Rotating the figure 120° simply permutes the indices. This construction can be extended to more variables by placing the node for each variable at the vertex of a regular polygon with as many vertices as there are variables.

Of course, to be meaningful the coefficients are restricted to values such that the equations are independent and consistent.

'''Spoilage''' is the process in which [[food]] deteriorates to the point in which it is not edible to humans or its quality of edibility becomes reduced. Various external forces are responsible for the spoilage of food. Food that is capable of spoiling is referred to as [[perishable food]].

==Reasons==
Harvested foods decompose from the moment they are harvested due to attacks from [[enzymes]], oxidation and [[microorganism]]s. These include [[bacteria]], [[mold]], [[yeast]], moisture, temperature and chemical reaction. 

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] can be responsible for the spoilage of food. When bacteria breaks down the food, [[acid]]s and other waste products are created in the process.&lt;ref name=Tull1997 &gt;{{citation | last=Tull | first=Anita | year=1997 | title=Food and nutrition | edition=3 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-832766-0  | page=154 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_s6Dn8HC8AC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=food+spoilage&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bASWTf7UBs-z8QOtz-AX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=food%20spoilage&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bacteria itself may or may not be harmful, the waste products may be unpleasant to taste or may even be harmful to one's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tricket|first=Jill|title=The prevention of food poisoning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW2gNgetJOcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=food+spoilage#v=onepage&amp;q=spoil&amp;f=false|page=8|isbn=978-0-7487-5893-7|date=2001-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeasts===
[[Yeast]]s can be responsible for the decomposition of food with a high sugar content. The same effect is useful in the production of various types of food and beverages, such as [[bread]], [[yogurt]], [[cider]], and [[alcoholic beverage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tricket|first=Jill|title=The prevention of food poisoning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW2gNgetJOcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=food+spoilage#v=onepage&amp;q=spoil&amp;f=false|page=9|isbn=978-0-7487-5893-7|date=2001-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs==
Signs of food spoilage may include an appearance different from the food in its fresh form, such as a change in color, a change in texture, an [[unpleasant odour]], or an undesirable [[taste]]. The item may become softer than normal. If mold occurs, it is often visible externally on the item.

==Consequences==
Spoilage bacteria do not normally cause "[[food poisoning]]"; typically, the microorganisms that cause [[foodborne illness]]es are odorless and flavourless, and otherwise undetectable outside the lab.&lt;ref&gt;Food spoilage and food pathogens, what’s the difference? October 22, 2015, Michelle Jarvie, Michigan State University [http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/food_spoilage_and_food_pathogens_whats_the_difference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeanroy|first1=Amelia|last2=Ward|first2=Karen|title=Canning &amp; Preserving for Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJxGjFQNU2AC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=spoiled+food&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uSiRTafwNdKgtgeEwYFj&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spoiled%20food&amp;f=false|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eating deteriorated food could not be considered safe due to [[mycotoxins]] or microbial wastes. Some pathogenic bacteria, such as ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' and ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'', are capable of causing spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/2016/02/what-is-food-spoilage.html |last=Magoulas |first=Argyris |title=What is Food Spoilage? |website=Foodsafety.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
A number of methods of prevention can be used that can either totally prevent, delay, or otherwise reduce food spoilage.

A [[food rotation system]] uses the first in first out method (FIFO), which ensures that the first item purchased is the first item consumed. 

[[Preservative]]s can expand the [[shelf life]] of food and can lengthen the time long enough for it to be harvested, processed, sold, and kept in the consumer's home for a reasonable length of time.

[[Refrigeration]] can increase the shelf life of certain foods and beverages, though with most items, it does not indefinitely expand it. Freezing can preserve food even longer, though even freezing has limitations.

A high-quality vacuum flask (thermos) will keep coffee, soup, and other boiling-hot foods above the danger zone (140F/58C), at which bacteria grow most rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/danger-zone-40-f-140-f/CT_Index |title="Danger Zone" (40 °F - 140 °F) |website=Food Safety and Inspection Service |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for over 24 hours.

[[Canned food|Canning]] of food can preserve food for a particularly long period of time, whether canned at home or commercially. Canned food is [[vacuum pack]]ed in order to keep oxygen out of the can that is needed to allow bacteria to break it down. Canning does have limitations, and does not preserve the food indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeanroy|first1=Amelia|last2=Ward|first2=Karen|title=Canning &amp; Preserving for Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJxGjFQNU2AC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=spoiled+food&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uSiRTafwNdKgtgeEwYFj&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spoiled%20food&amp;f=false|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lactic acid fermentation]] also preserves food and prevents spoilage.

== History ==
Traditional DTI uses six diffusivity characteristics to model how water molecules diffuse in brain tissues and makes axonal fiber tracking possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, DTI had a major limitation in resolving axons from different tracts intersected and crossed en route to their target. In 2009, Learning Research &amp; Development Center (LRDC) at University of Pittsburgh launched the 2009 Pittsburgh Brain Competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PBAIC2009|title=Old 2009 Pittsburgh Brain Connectivity Competition Overview|date=2009-02-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mv8FS3JPmM|accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to invite the best research team to work on this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2015/sept/16-broken-cables|title=Seeing the Brain's Broken Cables {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|work=Discover Magazine|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A price of $10,000 was offered to the team that could track optic radiations, and teams from 168 countries took part in the competition. A winning team from Taiwan revealed Meyer’s loop, which no other team had successfully tracked. The technique was further developed as HDFT between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==
HDFT has been applied to [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) to identify which brain connections have been broken and which are still intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shin|first=Samuel S.|last2=Pathak|first2=Sudhir|last3=Presson|first3=Nora|last4=Bird|first4=William|last5=Wagener|first5=Lauren|last6=Schneider|first6=Walter|last7=Okonkwo|first7=David O.|last8=Fernandez-Miranda|first8=Juan C.|date=2014|title=Detection of white matter injury in concussion using high-definition fiber tractography|journal=Progress in Neurological Surgery|volume=28|pages=86–93|doi=10.1159/000358767|issn=1662-3924|pmid=24923395|isbn=978-3-318-02648-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Samuel S.|last2=Verstynen|first2=Timothy|last3=Pathak|first3=Sudhir|last4=Jarbo|first4=Kevin|last5=Hricik|first5=Allison J.|last6=Maserati|first6=Megan|last7=Beers|first7=Sue R.|last8=Puccio|first8=Ava M.|last9=Boada|first9=Fernando E.|date=May 2012|title=High-definition fiber tracking for assessment of neurological deficit in a case of traumatic brain injury: finding, visualizing, and interpreting small sites of damage|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|volume=116|issue=5|pages=1062–1069|doi=10.3171/2012.1.JNS111282|issn=1933-0693|pmid=22381003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="upbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=20356|title=University Times ' Research Notes|date=2012-03-22|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDFT allows neurosurgeons to localize fiber breaks caused by traumatic brain injuries to provide better diagnoses and prognoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upmc.com/Services/neurosurgery/brain/treatments/brain-mapping/Pages/high-definition-fiber-tracking.aspx|title=High Definition Fiber Tracking {{!}} UPMC {{!}} Pittsburgh, PA|website=www.upmc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDFT can also be used to determine the optimal surgical approach for difficult-to-reach tumors and vascular malformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faraji|first=Amir H.|last2=Abhinav|first2=Kumar|last3=Jarbo|first3=Kevin|last4=Yeh|first4=Fang-Cheng|last5=Shin|first5=Samuel S.|last6=Pathak|first6=Sudhir|last7=Hirsch|first7=Barry E.|last8=Schneider|first8=Walter|last9=Fernandez-Miranda|first9=Juan C.|date=November 2015|title=Longitudinal evaluation of corticospinal tract in patients with resected brainstem cavernous malformations using high-definition fiber tractography and diffusion connectometry analysis: preliminary experience|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|volume=123|issue=5|pages=1133–1144|doi=10.3171/2014.12.JNS142169|issn=1933-0693|pmid=26047420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3625">[[File:Key-Relevance.jpg|thumb|right|Key Relevance Diagram]]In master [[locksmithing]], '''key relevance''' is the measurable difference between an original [[key (lock)|key]] and a copy made of that key, either from a wax impression or directly from the original, and how similar the two keys are in size and shape.&lt;ref&gt;

No two copies of keys are exactly the same, even if they were both made from [[key blank]]s that are struck from the same [[Mold (casting)|mould]] or cut from the same duplicating/[[milling machine]] with no changes to the [[Bit (key)|bitting]] settings in between. Even under these favorable circumstances, there will be minute differences between the two key shapes, though their key relevance is extremely high.

In all machining work, there are measurable amounts of difference between the design specification&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] engineering specification standards&lt;/ref&gt; of an object, and its actual manufactured size. In locksmithing, the allowable tolerance&lt;ref&gt;

Key relevance is the measure of similarity between the key and the optimal size needed to fit the lock, or it is the similarity between a duplicate key and the original it is seeking to replicate.

Key relevance cannot be deduced from a [[key code]], since the key code merely refers to a central authoritative source for designed shapes and sizes of keys.

Typical modern keys require a key relevance of approximately {{convert|0.03|mm|in}} to {{convert|0.07|mm|in}} (accuracy within 0.75% to 1.75%) in order to operate.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other applications==
"Key relevance" may also be applied to types of [[electronic lock]]s when used to refer to similarities in magnetic signatures or radio codes, though truly digital-coded radio signals do not have key relevance ratings because they must have precise unlocking codes, with no degree of difference whatsoever in order to operate.

The term has also occasionally been co-opted by broader [[mechanical engineering]] to refer to the similarity of fit between two interlocking machined parts, although "tolerance" or [[Backlash (engineering)|"backlash"]] has gained far wider adoption and acceptance in usage.

'''Klabin''' is the  biggest paper producer, exporter and recycler in Brazil. The Company is headquartered in Sao Paulo

It is the leading manufacturer of packaging paper and board, corrugated boxes, [[paper sack|industrial sacks]] and timber in logs. It has 17 industrial plants in [[Brazil]] and one in [[Argentina]]. Self-sufficient in wood, it has 218 thousand hectares of planted forests and 183 thousand hectares of preserved native woodlands. It was the first company from the pulp and paper sector in the Southern Hemisphere to have its forests certified by the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), attesting to the fact that the company runs its activities within the highest possible standards of environmental conservation and socioeconomic sustainability. The History of Klabin starts with the arrival of two families of Lithuanian immigrants to Brazil; Klabin and Lafer.

[[File:Limelight diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram of a limelight burner]]

'''Limelight ''' (also known as '''Drummond light''' or '''calcium light''')&lt;ref name=smith&gt;James R. Smith (2004) ''San Francisco's Lost Landmarks'', Quill Driver Books.&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[stage lighting]] once used in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]] and [[music hall]]s. An intense illumination is created when an [[Oxyhydrogen|oxyhydrogen flame]] is directed at a cylinder of quicklime ([[calcium oxide]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/CHEMWEEK/Lime/lime.html|title=Chemical of the Week -- Lime|website=scifun.chem.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be heated to {{convert|4662|F|C}} before melting.  The light is produced by a combination of [[incandescence]] and [[candoluminescence]]. Although it has long since been replaced by electric lighting, the term has nonetheless survived, as someone in the public eye is still said to be "in the limelight". The actual lights are called "limes", a term which has been transferred to electrical equivalents.

==History==
[[File:Homemade Limelight.JPG|thumb|Heating [[calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) in a stove burner causes it to glow, although this is not as bright as a real limelight.]]
The limelight effect was discovered in the 1820s by [[Goldsworthy Gurney]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.chem.leeds.ac.uk/delights/texts/Demonstration_19.htm Limelight - Leeds University], accessed 18 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iX194mHFAcYC&amp;pg=PA11 | page = 11 | title = The Correspondence of Michael Faraday | isbn = 978-0-86341-251-6 | author1 = Faraday, Michael | author2 = James, Frank A. J. L | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his work with the "oxy-hydrogen [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]]", credit for which is normally given to [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]].  In 1825, a [[Scotland|Scottish]] engineer, [[Thomas Drummond]] (1797–1840), saw a demonstration of the effect by [[Michael Faraday]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Craig M.|title=A history of English in its own words|date=1991|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-270013-8|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and realized that the light would be useful for surveying.  Drummond built a working version in 1826, and the device is sometimes called the ''Drummond light'' after him.

The earliest known use of limelight at a public performance was outdoors, over [[Herne Bay Pier]], Kent, on the night of 3 October 1836 to illuminate a juggling performance by magician [[Ching Lau Lauro]]. This performance was part of the celebrations following the laying of the [[cornerstone|foundation stone]] of the [[Clock Tower, Herne Bay|Clock Tower]]. The advertising leaflet called it ''koniaphostic'' light and announced that "the whole pier is overwhelmed with a flood of beautiful white light".{{sfn|Bundock|2000|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mechanic_and_Chemist.html?id=QRMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Mechanic and Chemist: A Magazine of the Arts and Sciences'', p. 354] confirms the usage of "koniaphostic light" to mean limelight.&lt;/ref&gt; Limelight was first used for indoor stage illumination in the [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden Theatre]] in [[London]] in 1837 and enjoyed widespread use in theatres around the world in the 1860s and 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Limelights were employed to highlight solo performers in the same manner as modern [[followspot]]s (spotlights).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Limelight was replaced by electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] in the late 19th century.

In [[metadata]], a '''match report''' is a report that compares two distinct [[data dictionary|data dictionaries]] and creates a list of the [[data element]]s that have been identified as [[Semantic equivalence|semantically equivalent]].

== Use of match reports ==

Match reports are critical for systems that wish to automatically exchange data such as intelligent software agents.  If one computer system is requesting a report from a remote system that uses a distinct data dictionary and all of the data elements on the report manifest are included in the '''match report''' the report request can be executed.

Match reports are useful if data dictionaries use a metadata tagging system such as the [[UDEF]].

'''Mechanosynthesis''' is a term for hypothetical [[chemical synthesis|chemical syntheses]] in which reaction outcomes are determined by the use of mechanical constraints to direct reactive molecules to specific molecular sites. There are presently no non-biological chemical syntheses which achieve this aim. Some atomic placement has been achieved with [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]s.

==Introduction==

[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
In conventional chemical synthesis or [[chemosynthesis]], reactive molecules encounter one another through random thermal motion in a liquid or vapor. In a hypothesized process of mechanosynthesis, reactive [[molecule]]s would be attached to molecular mechanical systems, and their encounters would result from mechanical motions bringing them together in planned sequences, positions, and orientations. It is envisioned that mechanosynthesis would avoid unwanted reactions by keeping potential reactants apart, and would strongly favor desired reactions by holding reactants together in optimal orientations for many molecular [[oscillation|vibration]] cycles. In biology, the [[ribosome]] provides an example of a programmable mechanosynthetic device.

A non-biological form of [[mechanochemistry]] has been performed at cryogenic temperatures using [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s. So far, such devices provide the closest approach to fabrication tools for [[molecular engineering]]. Broader exploitation of mechanosynthesis awaits more advanced technology for constructing [[molecular machine]] systems, with ribosome-like systems as an attractive early objective.

Much of the excitement regarding advanced mechanosynthesis regards its potential use in assembly of [[molecular nanotechnology|molecular-scale devices]]. Such techniques appear to have many applications in medicine, aviation, resource extraction, manufacturing and warfare.

Most theoretical explorations of advanced machines of this kind have focused on using [[carbon]], because of the many strong bonds it can form, the many types of chemistry these bonds permit, and utility of these bonds in medical and mechanical applications. Carbon forms diamond, for example, which if cheaply available, would be an excellent material for many machines.

It has been suggested, notably by [[K. Eric Drexler]], that mechanosynthesis will be fundamental to molecular manufacturing based on [[nanofactory|nanofactories]] capable of building macroscopic objects with atomic precision. The potential for these has been disputed, notably by [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Richard Smalley]] (who proposed and then critiqued an unworkable approach based on small fingers).

The Nanofactory Collaboration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory Nanofactory Collaboration]. Molecularassembler.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm Nanofactory Technical Challenges]. Molecularassembler.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at positionally controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development.

In practice, getting exactly one molecule to a known place on the microscope's tip is possible, but has proven difficult to automate. Since practical products require at least several hundred million atoms, this technique has not yet proven practical in forming a real product.

The goal of one line of mechanoassembly research focuses on overcoming these problems by calibration, and selection of appropriate synthesis reactions. Some suggest attempting to develop a specialized, very small (roughly 1,000 nanometers on a side) machine tool that can build copies of itself using mechanochemical means, under the control of an external computer. In the literature, such a tool is called an assembler or molecular assembler. Once assemblers exist, geometric growth (directing copies to make copies) could reduce the cost of assemblers rapidly. Control by an external computer should then permit large groups of assemblers to construct large, useful projects to atomic precision. One such project would combine molecular-level conveyor belts with permanently mounted assemblers to produce a factory.

In part to resolve this and related questions about the dangers of [[industrial accident]]s and popular fears of runaway events equivalent to [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal]] disasters, and the more remote issue of [[ecophagy]], [[grey goo]] and green goo (various potential disasters arising from runaway replicators, which could be built using mechanosynthesis) the [[Royal Society|UK Royal Society]] and UK [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in 2003 commissioned a study to deal with these issues and larger social and ecological implications, led by mechanical engineering professor Ann Dowling. This was anticipated by some to take a strong position on these problems and potentials —– and suggest any development path to a general theory of so-called mechanosynthesis. However, the [[Royal Society's nanotech report]] did not address molecular manufacturing at all, except to dismiss it along with grey goo.

Current technical proposals for nanofactories do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines would prohibit development of unconstrained self-replication capabilities in nanomachines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines].

Molecularassembler.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;). 
For example, the 2006 paper in this continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carbon [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] on a C(110) [[diamond]] surface at both 300 K (room temperature) and 80 K ([[liquid nitrogen]] temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80 K but not at 300 K. These tooltips are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in paper III—tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this study.

The DCB6Ge tooltip motif, initially described at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface. Although an early paper gives a predicted placement speed of 1 dimer per second for this tooltip, this limit was imposed by the slow speed of recharging the tool using an inefficient recharging method&lt;ref name="mechanosynthesis71"/&gt; and is not based on any inherent limitation in the speed of use of a charged tooltip. Additionally, no sensing means was proposed for discriminating among the three possible outcomes of an attempted dimer placement—deposition at the correct location, deposition at the wrong location, and failure to place the dimer at all—because the initial proposal was to position the tooltip by dead reckoning, with the proper reaction assured by designing appropriate chemical energetics and relative bond strengths for the tooltip-surface interaction.

More recent theoretical work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/MinToolset.pdf |title=A Minimal Toolset for Positional Diamond Mechanosynthesis|year=2008|last1=Freitas Jr.|first1=Robert A.|last2=Merkle|first2=Ralph C.|journal=Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience|volume=5|issue=7|pages=760–861}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzes a complete set of nine molecular tools made from hydrogen, carbon and germanium able to (a) synthesize all tools in the set (b) recharge all tools in the set from appropriate feedstock molecules and (c) synthesize a wide range of stiff hydrocarbons (diamond, graphite, fullerenes, and the like). All required reactions are analyzed using standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods.

Further research &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foresight.org/stage2/project1A.html Speeding the development of molecular nanotechnology]. www.foresight.org&lt;/ref&gt; to consider alternate tips will require time-consuming [[computational chemistry]] and difficult laboratory work.
In the early 2000s, a typical experimental arrangement was to attach a molecule to the tip of an [[atomic force microscope]], and then use the microscope's precise positioning abilities to push the molecule on the tip into another on a substrate. Since the angles and distances can be precisely controlled, and the reaction occurs in a vacuum, novel chemical compounds and arrangements are possible.

==History==
The technique of moving single atoms mechanically was proposed by [[Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book [[The Engines of Creation]].

In 1988, researchers at [[IBM]]'s Zürich Research Institute successfully spelled the letters "IBM" in xenon atoms on a cryogenic copper surface, grossly validating the approach. Since then, a number of research projects have undertaken to use similar techniques to store computer data in a compact fashion. More recently the technique has been used to explore novel physical chemistries, sometimes using lasers to excite the tips to particular energy states, or examine the quantum chemistry of particular chemical bonds.

In 1999, an experimentally proved methodology called [[feature-oriented scanning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=2004|title=Feature-oriented scanning methodology for probe microscopy and nanotechnology|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=15|issue=9|pages=1135–1151|publisher=IOP|location=UK|issn=0957-4484|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/9/006|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#feature2004|format=PDF|bibcode=2004Nanot..15.1135L}} ([http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#feature2004 Russian translation] is available).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=2011|contribution=Feature-oriented scanning probe microscopy|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology|editor=H. S. Nalwa|volume=14|pages=105–115|publisher=American Scientific Publishers|location=USA|isbn=1-58883-163-9|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#fospm2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS) was suggested. The feature-oriented scanning methodology allows precisely controlling the position of the probe of a [[scanning probe microscope]] (SPM) on an atomic surface at room temperature. The suggested methodology supports fully automatic control of single- and multiprobe instruments in solving tasks of mechanosynthesis and bottom-up [[nanofabrication]].

In 2003, Oyabu ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.176102|title=Mechanical Vertical Manipulation of Selected Single Atoms by Soft Nanoindentation Using Near Contact Atomic Force Microscopy|year=2003|last1=Oyabu|first1=Noriaki|last2=Custance|first2=ÓScar|last3=Yi|first3=Insook|last4=Sugawara|first4=Yasuhiro|last5=Morita|first5=Seizo|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=90|issue=17|bibcode = 2003PhRvL..90q6102O|pmid=12786084|page=176102}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported the first instance of purely mechanical-based covalent bond-making and bond-breaking, i.e., the first experimental demonstration of true mechanosynthesis—albeit with silicon rather than carbon atoms.

In 2005, the first patent application on diamond mechanosynthesis &lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., "A Simple Tool for Positional Diamond Mechanosynthesis, and its Method of Manufacture," {{US patent|7687146}}, issued 30 March 2010 [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/DMSToolbuildProvPat.htm html copy] Retrieved on 2011-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; was filed.

In 2008, a $3.1 million grant was proposed&lt;ref&gt;[http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G007837/1 Digital Matter?: Towards Mechanised Mechanosynthesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104152935/http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP%2FG007837%2F1 |date=2011-11-04 }}.

A '''modular data center''' system is a portable method of deploying [[data center]] capacity. A modular data center can be placed anywhere data capacity is needed.

Modular data center systems consist of purpose-engineered modules and components to offer scalable data center capacity with multiple power and cooling options. Modules can be shipped to be added, integrated or retrofitted into an existing data center or combined into a system of modules. Modular data centers typically consist of standardized components.&lt;ref&gt;Rath, John. “DCK Guide To Modular Data Centers: Why Modular?” DataCenterKnowledge.com, Oct. 20, 2011 [http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/10/20/dck-guide-to-modular-data-centers-why-modular/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular data centers are often marketed as [[converged infrastructure]],  promoting economies of scale and efficient energy usage, including considerations regarding the external environment. A module can be treated as a single unit for U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] compliance certification rather than all discrete systems.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, Ben. “Data Centers Boom,” The Wall Street Journal, April 19, 2011. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704336504576259180354987332]&lt;/ref&gt;
Patents have been taken out on variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Slessman|first = George|title = System and method of providing computer resources|date = May 7, 2013|url = http://www.google.com/patents/US8434804|accessdate = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Patent Search: Container Data Center|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Container+Data+Center&amp;gws_rd=ssl|website=Google Patents|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Modular data centers typically come in two types of form factors. The more common type, referred to as ''containerized data centers'' or ''portable modular data centers'', fits data center equipment (servers, storage and networking equipment) into a [[intermodal container|standard shipping container]], which is then transported to a desired location.&lt;ref&gt;Pitchaikani, Bala. “Strategies for the Containerized Data Center,” DataCenterKnowledge.com, Sept. 8, 2011. [http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/09/08/strategies-for-the-containerized-data-center/]&lt;/ref&gt; Containerized data centers typically come outfitted with their own cooling systems. Cisco makes an example of this type of data center, called the Cisco Containerized Data Center.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Nicole. “Cisco Unveils New Containerized Data Center Product,” Web Host Industry Review, May 2, 2011. [http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/050211_Cisco_Unveils_New_Containerized_Data_Center_Product]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of modular data center fits data center equipment into a facility composed of prefabricated components that can be quickly built on a site and added to as capacity is needed. For example, HP’s version of this type of modular data center is constructed of sheet metal components that are formed into four data center halls linked by a central operating building.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolai, James. “HP says prefab data center cuts costs in half,” InfoWorld, July 27, 2010. [http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/hp-says-prefab-data-center-cuts-costs-in-half-837?page=0,0]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IPCorder NVR with cameras.jpg|thumb|Simple NVR-based camera system]]
A '''network video recorder''' ('''NVR''') is a specialized computer system that includes a software program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kintronics.com/solutions/ip-camera-systems/video-recording-systems/network-video-recorder/|title=Network Video Recorder {{!}} NVR and Video Management Systems for IP Cameras|work=Kintronics|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that records video in a digital format to a [[disk drive]], [[USB flash drive]],  SD [[memory card]] or other [[mass storage]] device. An NVR contains no dedicated video capture hardware. However, the software is typically run on a dedicated device, usually with an [[embedded operating system]]. Alternatively, to help support increased functionality and serviceability, standard operating systems are used with standard  processors and video management software.  An NVR is typically deployed in an [[IP video]] surveillance system.

Network video recorders are distinct from [[digital video recorder]]s (DVR) as their input is from a network rather than a direct connection to a [[video capture]] card or [[TV tuner card|tuner]]. Video on a DVR is encoded and processed at the DVR, while video on an NVR is encoded and processed at the camera, then [[Video streaming|streamed]] to the NVR for storage or remote viewing.{{cn|date=September 2012}}
Additional processing may be done at the NVR, such as further compression or tagging with meta data.

Hybrid NVR/DVR surveillance systems exist which incorporate functions of both NVR and DVR; these are considered a form of NVR.{{cn|date=September 2013}} 

NVR home surveillance systems are generally wireless, tend to be easy to set up, can be accessed through a web browser, and allow the user to be notified by email if an alarm is triggered.

==Background==
===Nissan Motor Corporation===
Beginning in the late 1970s, [[Datsun]] began progressively fitting its cars with small ''"Nissan"'' and ''"Datsun by Nissan"'' badges. The company eventually changed its branding at 1,100 Datsun dealerships. In autumn 1981, Datsun announced that its name would be changed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, David A. ''Managing Brand Equity : Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name'', New York: The Free Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-02-900101-3}} Chapter 3, Pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1982 and 1986, the company transitioned from its ''"Datsun, We Are Driven!"'' to its ''"The Name is Nissan"'' campaign.&lt;ref name='ZCCA'&gt;[http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm What's in a name?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508085037/http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm |date=8 May 2006 }} - ZCCA&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the name change program was over, cars in some export markets continued to display badges bearing both names and ''Datsun'' still remained more familiar than ''Nissan''.&lt;ref name='ZCCA'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Aaker'&gt;Aaker, David A. ''Managing Brand Equity : Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name'', New York: The Free Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-02-900101-3}} Chapter 3, Pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uzi Nissan===
In 1980, Uzi Nissan founded Nissan Foreign Car, an automobile service, in Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;ref name='UN NFC'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.digest.com/Nissan_Foreign_Car.htm | title = Nissan Foreign Car | accessdate = 2014-02-11 | last = Nissan | first = Uzi | work = Digest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='UN main'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.digest.com/Big_Story.php | title = Nissan Motor vs. Nissan Computer | accessdate = 2014-02-11 | last = Nissan | first = Uzi | work = Digest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Uzi Nissan founded Nissan International, Ltd, an [[international trade|import/export]] company that traded primarily in heavy equipment and computers.&lt;ref name='UN NI'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.digest.com/NIL.htm | title = Nissan International | accessdate = 2014-02-11 | last = Nissan | first = Uzi | work = Digest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 1991, Uzi Nissan founded Nissan Computer Corporation, which provides sales and service of personal computers, servers, and computer parts, as well as internet hosting and development. Nissan Computer registered ''nissan.com'' for its use on 4 June 1994, five years prior to Nissan Motor Corporation's interest in the domain.&lt;ref name='UN main'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Anderson 2001-01-03'/&gt;

==Case==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

Nissan Motors considered Nissan Computer's use of the name to be [[trademark dilution]], and laid claim to the domain by alleging [[cyber squatting]]. However, Nissan Computer was named after its owner, Uzi Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nissan Motor vs. Nissan Computer |work=citizen.org |url=http://www.citizen.org/documents/CourtofAppealsRulingNissanMotorvNissanComputer.pdf |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='2011-04-09 Yale'&gt; {{cite news | first = Daniel | last = A. | title = Why Nissan.com Isn’t a Car Website | date = 2011-04-09 | url = https://yalelawtech.org/2011/04/09/why-nissan-com-isnt-a-car-website/ | work = Yale Law &amp; Technology | accessdate = 2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nissan Motor vs. Nissan Computer |work=Nissan Computer Corporation |url=http://www.nissan.com/Digest/The_Story.php |accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outcome of the case, Nissan Motors uses the name ''nissanusa.com'' for its U.S. website.&lt;ref name='Nissan USA'&gt; {{cite web | url = https://www.nissanusa.com/ | title = Nissan USA | accessdate = 2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2771">The '''Orbital Debris Co-ordination Working Group''' ('''ODCWG''') is one of the working groups of the [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s Technical Committee 20/Subcommittee 14 TC20/SC14 "Spacecraft Systems and Operations".

It was formed by unanimous agreement at the May 2003 Plenary meeting of TC20/SC14. The text of the resolution is as follows:{{cn|date=May 2013}}

:''Recognising that;''

:''• Mitigation of Orbital [[Space Debris]] is an issue of international concern and embraces many interests and areas of expertise.''

:''• [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is responsible for developing internationally recognised standards, on a consensus basis, for implementation through contractual agreement or National or International regulation.''

==History==
In the year 1958, the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, which would later be known as PAEC, was established following the Republic Act No. 2067.&lt;ref&gt;R.A. 2067, 1958. Section 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This R.A. is also known as the "Science Act of 1958." In the early 1960s, the PAEC built the [[Philippine Research Reactor-1]], the first nuclear reactor in the Philippines. The "Atomic Energy Regulatory and Liability Act of 1968"&lt;ref&gt;R.A. 5207, 1968. Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt; established the regulatory function and mandate of the PAEC whereas on December 13, 1974, Presidential Decree No. 606&lt;ref&gt;P.D. 606, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; established the PAEC as an independent and autonomous body. Three years later, the Presidential Decree 1206&lt;ref&gt;P.D. 1206, 1977. Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt; of October 6, 1977 created the Ministry of Energy (MOE). From the MoE, the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission was transferred back to the Office of the President Executive under Order No. 613&lt;ref&gt;E.O. 613, 1980. Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; on August 15, 1980 and transferred again to the Office of the Prime Minister under Executive Order No. 708&lt;ref&gt;E.O. 708, 1981. Section 16.&lt;/ref&gt; of July 2, 1981. In 1984, the PAEC was placed within the administrative administration of the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] under the Executive Order No. 784.&lt;ref&gt;E.O. 784, 1984. Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Atomic Energy Commission became the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) in 1987.

In 1995, the trial of the [[Sterile insect technique]] (SIT) held in Guimaras was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Manoto, E. et al., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the succeeding year, Dr. William G. Padolina, Secretary of the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]], served as the president of the 40th General Conference of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).&lt;ref&gt;APEC 2014 Programme and Speakers' Profiles&lt;/ref&gt; In celebration of the centennial of the discovery of radioactivity of 1997, the second Philippine Nuclear Congress was held in Manila.&lt;ref&gt;PNRI Annual Report 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, the PNRI's Radiological Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan was approved in the year 2000. In 2001, the first [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) was licensed by the PNRI at St. Luke's Medical Center. During the years 2001-2005, a PVP carrageenan hydrogel dressing for burns and wounds was developed by the PNRI&lt;ref&gt;Dela Rosa, A., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the development of the mutant ornamental plants Kamuning dwarf mutant (Murraya 'Ibarra Santos'), Dracaena 'Marea' and Cordyline 'Medina'.&lt;ref&gt;Philippine Science and Technology Abstracts 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the PNRI was designated as the collaborating center for Studies on Harmful Algal Blooms by the IAEA.&lt;ref&gt;Quevenco, R., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the Philippine Research Reactor at the PNRI was chosen by the IAEA to be the training platform to demonstrate the decommissioning process technique under the Research Reactor Decommissioning Demonstration Project (R2D2P).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-ns.iaea.org/projects/r2d2project/default.asp?s=8|title=The R2D2 Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th Forum for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia Ministerial Level Meeting was hosted in the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnca.mext.go.jp/english/mini/e_daijin.html Forum for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, the same year of the 50th Founding Anniversary of the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Machi, S., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines was named one of the three pilot countries for the IAEA Water Availability Enhancement Project (IWAVE) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA, "IWAVE." n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Nuclear Security Plan and the IAEA INSSP also became operational at this time.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Security Council, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Member States engaged in an RCA Regional project to study the disaster impact on the marine environment. The data was compiled in the Asia and Pacific Marine Radioactivity Database (ASPAMARD) which was managed by the Philippines through the PNRI.&lt;ref&gt;Sukasam and Kai, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This was made in response to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. In 2012, the [[Technetium-99m]] Generator Facility was commissioned. During 2013, the conditioning and storage of Spent High Activity Radioactive Sources (SHARS) was put to attention when the Philippines together with the IAEA and the South Africa Nuclear Energy Cooperation (NESCA) worked in a tripartite cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Potterton, L., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the PNRI Electron Beam Facility was inaugurated and the PNRI was able to conduct its first full exhibit of Filipino applications of nuclear science and technology at the 58th IAEA General Conference in Vienna, Austria&lt;ref&gt;IAEA, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atomic Research Division ===
;Agricultural Research Section

This division includes the Plant Mutation Breeding Facility, which aims for the improvement of mutation breeding of important crops. Data is gathered to compare mutants with original plants. Procedures are also undertaken for asexual propagation and testing the pre-germination of seeds.

The [[Plant tissue culture]] Laboratory aids projects in mutation induction for tissue propagation.

The Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Laboratory is for the research and development of technologies for soil, water, and crop management packages through the use of an isotope tracer and nuclear techniques. The goal is to enhance agricultural productivity while conserving natural resources for sustainable crop production.

;Applied Physics Research Section

The PNRI houses the [[Mossbauer Effect]] Spectrometry (MES) system, which studies nuclear structure with the absorption and re-emission of gamma rays. The other two systems are the [[X-ray fluorescence]] Spectrometry (XRF) and [[X-ray fluorescence]] Diffractometry (XRD). The XRF is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the composition of materials. On the other hand, the XRD, also an analytical technique, is used for phase identification of a crystalline material and provides information on the unit cell dimensions. It is more widely used for the identification of unknown crystalline materials such as minerals and inorganic compounds.

;Biomedical Research Section
For the [[Cytogenetics]] Research Laboratory, this facility monitors and calculates the accidental (or occupational) exposure of workers and/or researchers who have been exposed to ionizing radiation through the analyses of blood samples. The Microbiological Service Laboratory performs the bioburden and sterility testing of medical devices.

;Chemistry Research Section
The Radiation Crosslinking Laboratory practices covalent bonding with one or more polymers and imparting improved mechanical and functional properties in the result of cross-linking products. Next is the Radiation Degradation Laboratory. This facility analyzes degradation products through gel permeation chromatography and separates different molecular weight fractions by tangential flow filtration. Another facility is the Radiation-Induced Graft Polymerization Laboratory which specializes Graft polymerization as a method for the medification of a material's chemical and physical properties. Electron beam and gamma irradiation are utilized to create active sites for grafting.

For quantitative measurements, the Radioactivity Measurement Laboratory measures low level radioactivity in soil erosion studies and toxicity assay for red tide toxins by using detectors to identify and quantify alpha, beta and gamma spectrometries.

Another is the Radioassay Laboratory, which established the  Radiological and Receptor Binding Assay (RBA); a method used for measuring toxicity in red tide. The last laboratory for the Chemistry Research Section is the Radiometric Dating Laboratory. This facility is a sediment dating laboratory used to study both the history of pollution in a certain area and the sedimentation rate and processes in coastal areas, lakes, rivers, and dams.

;Health Physics Research Section

Stored in the Environmental Monitoring Laboratory are nuclear instruments used to measure low - level radioactivity collected from different types of environmental samples in various parts of the Philippines. Among the instruments stored here are the Co-Axial High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector which is a type of semiconductor detector used specifically for gamma spectroscopy as well as x-ray spectroscopy.

In case of emergencies that may lead to an extensive spread of radioactive materials, an On-line Environmental [[Radiation Monitoring]] System provides real-time data of the radiation levels nationwide is at work.

=== Nuclear Services Division ===
;Nuclear Materials Research Section

The Nuclear Materials Research Facility uses gamma ray spectrometers to observe particles found in a certain concentration or venue.

;Irradiation Services Section

The first facility is the Electron Beam Irradiation Facility. Through irradiation caused by Electron Beams, it is used for the sterilization of food and medical devices as well as for refining electrical components such as wires and semiconductors. Electron Beams emit radiation faster than gamma rays. An average gamma ray would take hours to irradiate an object while an electron beam may take only seconds. The next is the Gammacell-220, that is used for  irradiating small samples of objects and in regulating dosimeters. The last facility is the Multipurpose Irradiation Facility. It is multi-purpose gamma ray irradiator which may be used for various applications such as elimination of harmful bacteria, improvement of agriculture and sterilization of equipment.

;Isotope Techniques Section

The [[Technetium-99m]] (Tc-99m) Generator Facility domestically produces Technetium 99m (Tc-99m), a radioisotope necessary for the creation of radiopharmaceuticals. The domestic production of this isotope will allow it to be sold in the Philippines at a cheaper price and with a greater supply.

;Nuclear Analytical Techniques Application Section

The Isotope Radio [[Mass spectrometry|Mass Spectrometry]] Facility (IRMS) analyzes substances such as water and records the stable isotopes found in the substance. The other facility under this section is the Nuclear Analytical Techniques Laboratory which handles the research and development of topics revolving around nuclear and nuclear-related techniques.

==Services==
The PNRI offers several services related to nuclear energy for professionals and PNRI employees.

For their [[Irradiation]] Services, these are offered for food irradiation, for medical products sterilization and for research purposes.

;Radiation Projection Services
* ''Personnel [[Dosimetry]]'' - As part of the radiation protection program of the facility, this is to help ensure that the workers that are exposed to radiation in their workplace are within safety limits.

The Engineering Services of the PNRI offers Instrument Repair Diagnostics, Decommissioning of Cobalt-60 Teletheraphy Machine, and Radioactive Waste Management.

As for the Regulation of Nuclear Transportation,&lt;ref&gt;Parami, V.K. and T.G. de Jesus, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; this ensures certified parties follow nuclear transportation regulations as well as issuance of certificates for nuclear transportation both national and domestic.

Through the Nuclear Training Courses (NTC), the PNRI is able to conduct training sources for different agencies, companies, industries, institutions, academe, and public. These include provisions of training courses in the field of nuclear science and technology, radiation safety, and non-destructive testing techniques.
* Radiation Safety Courses
* Technology Diffusion Courses (TDC)
* Special Courses in cooperation with the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] (JAEA)
Furthermore, they offer On-the-Job Training Opportunities, students and technologies who would like to use nuclear apparatuses and working with researchers in the PNRI, different divisions offer training opportunities as requested.

Lastly, their Non-Destructive Training (NDT) Courses is the opportunity for practice of different nuclear-related courses. These are generally catered those who are willing to learn an in-depth knowledge on nuclear sciences.

== Research and development projects ==

===Food and agriculture===
The PNRI is experimenting on crop production with [[mutation breeding]]; wherein plant breeders use various techniques, and [[mutagens]] such as radiation or chemicals, to improve the crops' individual yields and develop new varieties of crop. Radiation can induce hereditary changes, or mutations, in irradiated planting materials.&lt;ref&gt;Lapade, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another development is the Carrageenan PGP as Plant Food Supplement where the radiation-induced degradation of natural polymers like Carrageenan PGP is performed to yield [[oligosaccharides]]: natural bioactive agents that act as Plant Food Supplements. Another technique is Radiation Processing, involving the exposure of materials to ionizing radiation by either gamma radiation or electron beam.&lt;ref&gt;Abad, "Radiation Processed Materials from Natural Polymers for Agricultural, Health and Other Applications." n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PNRI also practices "Irradiation for Food Safety and Quality": [[food irradiation]] prolongs the shelf-life of certain food and agricultural products, destroys counterproductive bacteria and microorganisms, and can disinfest grains such as rice and corn.&lt;ref&gt;De Guzman and Lanuza, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Precision Farming Methods with Stable Isotope Techniques," are done to improve soil test value and to provide fertilizer recommendations by using analyses based primarily on the N&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; isotopes and the Soil Moisture Neutron Probe.&lt;ref&gt;Obra, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PNRI helps with insect control in the Philippines through regulation or eradication. This was modeled after similar experiments done to pests in Kume Island and the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. The regulation/eradication is done by collecting the pests, such as fruit flies, and then exposing them to gamma radiation in order to sterilize them. These sterile pests are then released back into nature and help prevent reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Resilva and Obra, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human health and medicine ===
The PNRI developed a Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone (PVP) Carrageenan dressing: a fully permanent gel in a form of a sheet that is 3-4mm thick and containing over 90% water, used to treat burns, wounds, and bedsores. It is made from [[Polyvinylpyrrolidone]], a water-soluble polymer, and [[Carrageenan]], a seaweed polysaccharide by the means of Radiation Processing to effect cross-linking and to sterilize the product into a final form.&lt;ref&gt;Abad, "PVP-Carrageenan Hydrogel Dressing." 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the process of Radiation Processing, Radiation-Sterilized Honey Alginate Wound Dressing was also developed; which is for exudating burns and wounds. It is made from local honey and [[Sodium Alginate]].&lt;ref&gt;De Guzman, "Radiation-Sterilized Honey Alginate Wound Dressing for Exudating Wounds and Burns." n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental protection and management ===
The PNRI utilizes nuclear techniques in addressing problems in air pollution, [[algal bloom]], and water resources management through isotope-based techniques, analytical nuclear techniques, and nuclear-based techniques in algal bloom studies such as: Nuclear assay in red tide toxin analysis and [[Lead-210]] dating method.&lt;ref&gt;Castañeda and Sombrito, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The PNRI also took environmental radioactivity measurements following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in part of its radiological surveillance program for public protection and safety. The PNRI aims to assess the environmental impact of the radioactive discharges of the accident and their possible effects on human health through soil, sediment, and seawater analysis for [[Radionuclide|Anthropogenic Radionuclides]]—indicators of the nuclear power plant accident.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application of high technology materials ===
In the 1990s, the PNRI identified the occurrence of [[Rare-earth element]] (REE) deposits in the northwestern part of [[Palawan]] through earlier geo-chemical surveys and studies. Considered as strategic minerals, REEs are supportive elements in the production of electronics and in the renewable energy industry. From 2013-2016, The PNRI undertook a project that was a combined verification stream sediment and radiometric survey to identify and recommend a detailed evaluation of prospective sites. The collected samples were analyzed for REE and [[Thorium]] using [[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence (XRF)]] and Uranium determination using [[Fluorimetry]], including [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy]] for the other trace elements of economic value.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RealDoll''' is a life-size [[sex doll]] (also considered a [[mannequin]]) manufactured by Abyss Creations, LLC in [[San Marcos, California]], and sold worldwide.  It has a poseable [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] skeleton with steel joints and [[silicone]] flesh.

==Details and history==
The RealDolls are designed to recreate the appearance, texture, and weight of the human female and male form. Their primary function is to serve as [[sex partner]]s. This activity can be accompanied by certain preparations such as dressing them up in different types of clothing, changing wigs or makeup, and even adjusting body temperature by use of electric blankets or baths.

Early prototypes were made from solid [[latex]] with an [[Endoskeleton|interior]] [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], but construction of the outer material was later switched to [[silicone]]. In June 2009, Abyss Creations switched from tin cure silicone to platinum silicone, which resulted in dolls that are less prone to tears and compression marks than older RealDolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Street Journal |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804200602/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  

The current incarnation of the female RealDoll product was introduced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official RealDoll website|url=http://www.realdoll.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abyss introduced the "Face-X" system, allowing any face to be interchangeable with any body. Multiple faces can then be attached one at a time to a single doll by the owner.  As of 2011, there are nine female bodies and 16 female faces in the first product line. In 2009 the RealDoll&amp;nbsp;2 was introduced, which feature removable inserts for the [[Mouth#In humans|mouth]] and [[vagina]] and faces that attach by magnets instead of Velcro.  The line started with two female bodies and three female faces and as of 2013 offers ten faces and three bodies. Another female body is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Forum Announcement|url=http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=89&amp;t=37588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Charlie", the first male RealDoll, was retired in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss News Page |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331041052/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with two body types and three head types. "[[Transgender]]" dolls may also be purchased from the company, although these must be custom ordered. Abyss also sells silicone toys such as female torso products and dildos among other offerings.

For a time, the company also offered customizations such as robotic hip actuators, finger skeletons (instead of the usual finger wires) and computer-controlled speech feedback, but these expensive options are no longer available.

==In popular culture==
* On the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Boopa-dee Bappa-dee]]" the Griffins pose as RealDolls in order to re-enter the United States.{{fact|date=March 2017}} Additionally in the episode "[[Take a Letter (Family Guy)|Take a Letter]]" Cleveland reveals that a large empty warehouse at the post office is in preparation for the near future when RealDolls are a popular mail order item.
* The mainstream film ''[[Lars and the Real Girl]]'' features a RealDoll as second main character. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-10-08-lars-bianca_N.htm|title='Lars' star Bianca isn't just your average movie actress|publisher=USA Today|date=October 8, 2007|first=Susan|last=Wloszczyna|accessdate=November 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025074603/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-10-08-lars-bianca_N.htm|archivedate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glamour and high fashion photographer [[Helmut Newton]] photographed RealDolls. A sample can be found in his autobiography. ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine reportedly refused to publish Newton's RealDoll photo shoot, considering it too weird, according to his account.&lt;ref&gt;''Persephone Magazine'', 2011-08-25, [http://persephonemagazine.com/2011/08/real-dolls-guys-and-dolls-and-me/ Real Dolls, “Guys and Dolls,” and Me]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove |date=October 2013}}
A '''schematic''', or '''schematic diagram''', is a representation of the elements of a [[system]] using abstract, graphic [[symbol]]s rather than realistic pictures.  A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the information the schematic is intended to convey, and may add unrealistic elements that aid comprehension.  For example, a subway map intended for passengers may represent a subway station with a dot; the dot does not resemble the actual station at all but gives the viewer information  without unnecessary visual clutter. A schematic diagram of a chemical process uses symbols to represent the vessels, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment of the system, emphasizing their interconnection paths and suppressing physical details.  In an electronic [[circuit diagram]], the layout of the symbols may not resemble the layout in the circuit. In the schematic  diagram, the symbolic elements are arranged to be more easily interpreted by the viewer.

==Types==
'''Schematics''' and other types of diagrams, e.g.,
{|style="width:100%"
|style="vertical-align:top; width:25px;"|
|style="vertical-align:top;"|
&lt;gallery mode=packed style="text-align:left"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A '''semi-schematic''' diagram combines some of the abstraction of a purely schematic diagram with other elements displayed as realistically as possible, for various reasons. It is a compromise between a purely abstract diagram (e.g. the schematic of the Washington Metro) and an exclusively realistic representation (e.g. the corresponding aerial view of Washington).

[[File:Part of Tabula Peutingeriana.jpg|thumb|right|240|A semi-schematic map: [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]. While roads and features appear as abstract representations without resemblance to reality, their locations, orientations, and distances are as accurate as possible to make the map practical.]]

==Electrical and electronic industry==
{{Main|circuit diagram}}

In electrical and electronic industry, a schematic diagram is often used to describe the design of equipment. Schematic diagrams are often used for the maintenance and repair of electronic and electromechanical systems.&lt;ref name=FV75&gt;Thomas E. French, Charles J. Vierck (1975). ''Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology, Eleventh Edition''. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-022157-X}}.  pp. 621–624.&lt;/ref&gt; Original schematics were done by hand, using standardized templates or pre-printed adhesive symbols,  but today [[electronic design automation]] software (EDA or "electrical CAD") is often used.

In electronic design automation, until the 1980s schematics were virtually the only formal representation for circuits. More recently, with the progress of computer technology, other representations were introduced and specialized [[computer language]]s were developed, since with the explosive growth of the complexity of electronic circuits, traditional schematics are becoming less practical. For example, [[hardware description language]]s are indispensable for modern [[digital circuit]] design.

Schematics for electronic circuits are prepared by designers using EDA ([[electronic design automation]]) tools called [[schematic capture]] tools or [[schematic entry]] tools. These tools go beyond simple drawing of devices and connections. Usually they are integrated into the whole IC design flow and linked to other EDA tools for verification and simulation of the circuit under design.

In electric power systems design, a schematic drawing called a [[one-line diagram]] is frequently used to represent [[Electrical substation|substations]], distribution systems or even whole electrical power grids. These diagrams simplify and compress the details that would be repeated on each phase of a [[three-phase]] system, showing only one element instead of three. Electrical diagrams for switchgear often have common device functions designate by [[ANSI Device Numbers|standard function numbers]].

==Schematics in repair manuals==

Schematic diagrams are used extensively in repair manuals to help users understand the interconnections of parts, and to provide graphical instruction to assist in dismantling and rebuilding mechanical assemblies.  Many automotive and motorcycle [[Repairing|repair]] manuals devote a significant number of pages to schematic diagrams.

A '''semantic broker''' is a computer service that automatically provides [[semantic mapper]] services.  A semantic broker is frequently part of a semantic [[middleware]] system that leverage semantic equivalence statements. To qualify as a semantic broker product a system must be able to automatically extract data from a message and use semantic equvalance statements to transform this into another namespace.

A '''settle''' is a [[wood]]en [[Bench (furniture)|bench]], usually with arms and a high back, long enough to accommodate three or four sitters.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Description==
Settles are commonly movable, but occasionally fixed. The settle shares with the chest and the chair the distinction of great antiquity. Its high back was a protection from the draughts of medieval buildings, protection which was sometimes increased by the addition of winged ends or a wooden canopy. It was most frequently placed near the fire in the common sitting-room.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[File:Settle-seventeenth-century.jpg|thumb|Seventeenth-century oak settle
Dimensions: length {{convert|70|in|cm}}, height {{convert|41.5|in|cm}}, depth {{convert|23|in|cm}}.]]
Constructed of [[oak]] or other [[hardwood]], it was extremely heavy, solid, and durable. Few English examples of earlier date than the middle of the 16th century are extant; survivals from the [[Jacobean Era|Jacobean]] period are more numerous. Settles of the more expensive type were often elaborately carved or incised; others were divided into plain panels. They were commonly used in [[Farmhouse (building)|farmhouse]] [[kitchen]]s or [[manorial hall]]s. Its vogue did not long outlast the first half of the 18th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

{{anchor|Monks settle}}Elaborate specimens of oak settles with very tall backs, sometimes a cupboard built into them, or a box under the seat, are referred to as "monks settles", but Frederick Robinson writing in 1905 was of the opinion that none of them were of any great age. Two pre-reformation settles of which he was aware [[To be|are]] in Winchester Cathedral. Neither of them contain cupboards or boxes.{{sfn|Robinson|1905|p=115}}
[[File:Monks-bench-seventeenth-century.jpg|thumb|Seventeenth-century settle table combination.&lt;br /&gt;
Dimensions: length {{convert|54|in|cm}}, height as table {{convert|29.5|in|cm}}, width {{convert|28.75|in|cm|0}}.]]
Robinson also describes a specimen of a settle and table combination, with a chest in the seat that was made in the 17th century (see right). "The flanges in the back have a long slit in the lower half, into which fits a peg on the inside of the back of the arm. The back is raised and drawn forwards to serve as a table top as far as the play of the pegs in the slit allows".{{sfn|Robinson|1905|p=115}} This type of furniture is also called a [[monks bench]].

The English architect and designer [[William Burges]] designed the [[Zodiac settle]], made between 1869 and 1870. The settle is painted and illustrated with dancing [[Zodiac signs]], and adorned with inlaid pieces of glass crystal and vellum.&lt;ref name='ArtFund'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artfund.org/what-we-do/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/11584/zodiac-settle|title=Zodiac Settle by William Burges|publisher=Art Fund| accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shared transport'''  is a term for describing a demand-driven vehicle-sharing arrangement, in which travelers share a vehicle either simultaneously (e.g. ride-sharing) or over time (e.g. carsharing or bike sharing), and in the process share the cost of the journey, thereby creating a hybrid between private vehicle use and mass or [[public  transport]].

Shared transport  systems include [[carsharing]] (also called car clubs in the UK), [[Bicycle sharing system|bicycle sharing]] (also known as PBS or Public Bicycle Systems), [[carpool]]s and [[vanpool]]s (aka [[ride-sharing]] or [[lift-sharing]]), [[real-time ridesharing]], [[slugging]], [[casual carpooling]], [[community bus|community buses and vans]], [[demand responsive transit]] (DRT), [[paratransit]], a range of [[Taxicab|taxi]] projects and even [[hitchhiking]] and its numerous variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Shared transport is taking on increasing importance as a key strategy for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] and other [[exhaust gas|emissions]] from the transport sector in the face of the global [[climate]] emergency by finding ways of getting more intensive use of vehicles on the road.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A somewhat different form of shared transport is the "[[shared taxi]]", a vehicle which follows a predetermined route and takes anybody waiting for it, more like a [[bus]] than a [[taxicab|taxi]].

{{main article|Auto rickshaw}}
Auto rickshaws carry people and goods in many developing countries. Also known as a [[three-wheeler]], Samosa, tempo, tuk-tuk, trishaw, auto, rickshaw, autorick, bajaj, rick, [[tricycle]], mototaxi, baby taxi or lapa in popular parlance, they are motorized version of the traditional [[pulled rickshaw]] or [[cycle rickshaw]]. They are an essential form of urban transport, both as [[vehicles for hire]] and for private use, in many [[developing countries]], and a form of novelty transport in many [[Eastern countries]].

[[Image:stampedconcrete.JPG|thumb|275px|Brick textured stamped concrete]]
'''Stamped concrete''' is concrete that is patterned and/or textured or embossed to resemble [[brick]], [[slate]], [[flagstone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[tile]], [[wood]], and various other patterns and textures. Stamped concrete is commonly used for [[patio]]s, [[sidewalks]], [[driveway]]s, pool decks, and interior flooring. The ability of stamped concrete to resemble other building materials makes stamped concrete a less expensive alternative to using those other authentic materials such as stone, slate or brick.

There are three procedures used in stamped concrete which separate it from other concrete procedures; the addition of a base color, the addition of an accent color, and stamping a pattern into the concrete. These three procedures provide stamped concrete with a color and shape similar to the natural building material. It also is longer-lasting than paved stone, and still resembles the look.

==Procedures==
===Adding base color===
The base color is the primary color used in stamped concrete. The base color is chosen to reflect the color of the natural building material. The base color is produced by adding a color hardener to the concrete. Color hardener is a powder pigment used to dye the concrete.

The color hardener can be applied using one of two procedures; integral color or cast-on color. Integral color is the procedure where the entire volume of concrete is dyed the base color. The entire volume of concrete is colored by adding the color hardener to the concrete truck, and allowing all the concrete in the truck to be dyed. Cast-on color is the procedure where the surface of the concrete is dyed the base color. The surface of the concrete is colored by spreading the color hardener onto the surface of the wet concrete and floating the powder into the top layer of the wet concrete.

Concrete can be colored in many ways; color hardener, integral liquid or powder, acid stains to name a few. The process of integrally coloring the concrete offers the advantage of the entire volume being colored; however, the surface strength is not increased as with the use of color hardener. Dry shake color hardener is another popular way to color concrete. You broadcast the hardener on the concrete as soon as it is floated for the first time. After letting the bleed water soak into the hardener you float and trowel it in. This method only covers the surface about 3/16 of an inch but it gives the concrete surface a longer wear life.

===Adding accent color===
The accent color is the secondary color used in stamped concrete. The secondary color is used to produce texture and show additional building materials (e.g. grout) in the stamped concrete. The accent color is produced by applying color release to the concrete. Color release has two purposes - 1) It is a pigment used to color the concrete and 2) It is a non-adhesive used to prevent the concrete stamps from sticking to the concrete.

The color release can be applied in one of two procedures based on the two forms it is manufactured in: powdered (cast-on color release made up of calcium-releasing powders that repel water); or liquid - which is a light aromatic-based solvent, spray-on color release. Cast-on color release is a procedure where the powder color release is applied by spreading the color release on the surface of the concrete before the concrete is stamped. Spray-on color release is a procedure where liquid color release is sprayed on the bottom of the concrete stamps before the concrete is stamped.

===Stamping patterns===
[[Image:Concrete being stamped.jpg|thumb|275px|Concrete being stamped with an Ashlar Slate pattern]]
The pattern is the shape of the surface of the stamped concrete. The pattern reflects the shape of the natural building material. The pattern is made by imprinting the [[concrete]] shortly after it has been poured with a "concrete stamp". Most modern concrete stamps are made of [[polyurethane]], but older "cookie cutter" style stamps were made of various [[metals]]. The old style stamps lacked the capabilities of forming natural stone [[wikt:texture|texture]].

Concrete stamping is the procedure which uses the concrete stamps to make the pattern in the stamped concrete. Concrete stamps are placed on the concrete after the color release has been applied. The concrete stamps are pushed into the concrete and then removed to leave the pattern in the stamped concrete.

In most cases concrete stamping is made to look like ordinary building products such as flagstone, brick, natural stone, etc.

==History==
Stamping concrete increased in popularity in the 1970s when it was first introduced in the World of Concrete. Builders saw it as a new way to satisfy the customer and make their budget work simultaneously. This technique of stamping concrete has been done since at least the 1950s. When stamping concrete first began, there were very few choices of design and colors. However, as the industry grew more stamping patterns were being created along with many different types of stains. Another advantage to using stamped concrete is that it can be applied to many different surfaces and textures, such as driveways, highways, patios, decks, and even floors inside the home.

==Controversy==
The series was the subject of controversy when the BBC were accused of removing Patty Hopkins from a photograph of the architects, used to illustrate the third programme of the series. Patty Hopkins had been a full partner in the Hopkins company from the outset. The BBC were accused of ignoring women architects, though the BBC responded by saying that at the start of making the series, the director met with both Michael and Patricia Hopkins to discuss their involvement in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Waite, Laura Mark |title=BBC slammed for ‘bias’ after Patty Hopkins is sidelined in TV show |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/bbc-slammed-for-bias-after-patty-hopkins-is-sidelined-in-tv-show/8659720.article |work=[[The Architects' Journal]] |date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=23 October 2015 |quote= Deborah Saunt co-founder of DSDHA, said: ‘'''''The point is that the BBC are publicising the work of these great British architects without including a very important sixth member (being a full partner in Hopkins Architects from the beginning) - a member who was present at the time when the group photo was taken! To knowingly choose to use a metaphorically or literally [[photoshopped|edited photo]] without Patty in it, is an outrage.'''''' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Video 2000''' (also known as V2000, with the tape standard Video Compact Cassette, or VCC) is a [[consumer electronics|consumer]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] system and [[analog recording|analogue recording]] [[Standardization|standard]] developed by [[Philips]] and [[Grundig]] to compete with [[JVC]]'s [[VHS]] and [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] video technologies. Designed for the [[PAL]] colour television standard (some models additionally handled [[SECAM]]), distribution of Video 2000 products began in 1979 exclusively in Europe, South Africa and Argentina and ended in 1988.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Video 2000 was presented at the International Radio Exhibition in Berlin in 1979 and succeeded Philips's earlier [[Video Cassette Recording|Video Cassette Recording (VCR)]] format and its derivatives (VCR-LP and Grundig's SVR).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Although some early models and advertising featured a mirror-image 'VCR' badge based on the older systems' logo, Video 2000 was an entirely new (and incompatible) format that incorporated many technical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= 9 September 2018|title= Video History: V2000 - The format that came third in a two-horse race|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeSz6MoX00Q|access-date= 24 October 2018|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= [[YouTube]]|time=4:59-5:08|location= |publisher= Techmoan|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the format was not a major success and was eventually discontinued, having lost out to the rival VHS system in the [[videotape format war]].

== The Video Compact Cassette ==
Philips named the videotape standard Video Compact Cassette (VCC) to complement its landmark audio [[Compact audio cassette|Compact Cassette]] format introduced in 1963, but the format itself was marketed under the [[trademark]] Video 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= 9 September 2018|title= Video History: V2000 - The format that came third in a two-horse race|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeSz6MoX00Q|access-date= 24 October 2018|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= [[YouTube]]|time= 5:17-5:25|location= |publisher= Techmoan|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, VCCs are marginally larger than VHS cassettes —shorter, but thicker and deeper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v2000.palsite.com/ "V2000 PALsite"] accessed January 3, 2007, lists the VCC dimensions: 183mm × 26mm × 110 mm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhs-std.com/english/VHS_E/p1 VHS_e.htm "VHS Community: VHS 1976"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed January 3, 2007, lists the VHS cassette dimensions: 188mm × 25mm × 104mm&lt;/ref&gt; They have two co-planar [[reel]]s containing half-inch (12.5mm) wide [[Chromium#Applications|chromium dioxide]] [[magnetic tape]]. The format utilised only half (6.25mm) of the half-inch tape on a given 'side', and so it is occasionally referred to erroneously as a quarter-inch tape format despite its physical tape width. The cassette can then be flipped over to use the other half of the tape, thus doubling playing time.

The tape is totally enclosed when not in use. Unlike competing formats that have spaces in the cassette for the tape loading mechanism to be inserted, thus exposing the delicate magnetic tape surface, VCCs have a retractable sheath that covers such space. The sheath is retracted as a tape is inserted into the machine and only then can the tape cover be raised to fully expose the tape.

While VHS and Beta tapes have a break-off tab to protect recordings from erasure (as in [[Compact audio cassette|audio Compact Cassettes]] and, once broken, the cavity left by the missing tab must be covered or filled before the tape can be reused), VCCs employ a reversible solution: a switch on the tape edge can be turned to red/orange to protect the recordings, and back to black/brown (depending on the colour of the cassette housing) to re-record. The switch covers/uncovers a hole along the tape edge which is detected by a sensor in the machine.

The tape edge features six such holes along each side of the tape, detected by sensors on the cassette's underside. The left-hand cluster includes the write-protection hole. The right-hand cluster of three is used (by various permutations of open/closed status) to tell the machine the total tape running time. This was employed in second generation machines such as Grundig's Video 2x4 Super to provide a real-time tape counter: upon insertion of the tape the machine moves the tape forward and then backward by a small amount and monitors the comparative angular speed of the reels. This is looked up in a data table for the known total tape length and the hours and minutes used are then displayed. A similar technique was later used on [[Video8]], [[MiniDV]] and [[MicroMV]] cassettes. Some later VHS machines also featured this ability although it did not work with [[VHS-C]] cassettes. NOTE: When Grundig began marketing VHS recorders, its VS2XX series machines employed a similar system, whereby barcoded stickers attached to the tape edge indicated the total tape length to the machine so that it could calculate the time used.

A hole between the two spools enables a pin in the VCR to pass right through the cassette. This pin releases ratchets within the cassette that prevent the tape accidentally becoming slack in transit. The VCR's eject function includes a tape tensioning action prior to the cassette being ejected.

== Format and features ==
Dynamic Track Following (DTF) eliminated the need for a separate control track, and enabled the video heads to accurately follow the recorded tracks on the tape during playback. Therefore, by design V2000 machines does not require a video tracking control (however, Grundig's model 1600 lacked DTF). During record, a sequence of four pilot frequencies is recorded with the video signal. During playback, if a video head reads an adjacent track, a voltage of up to ± 150 volts is applied to the piezo-electric material on which the video heads are mounted. The flexible head mount enables the head to accurately read every track (i.e., no noisebars), at up to seven times normal speed forwards, and fives times in reverse. VHS developers JVC later introduced a so-called "Dynamic Drum" in a few top-of-the-range devices.

V2000 is able to play both [[Field (video)|fields]] of the image in still frame mode, providing full vertical [[display resolution|resolution]] whereas VHS and Betamax could only reproduce one field, giving only half of the normal vertical resolution. A real advantage of DTF on all but the very first V2000 models is the ability to provide picture search without noise bars across the screen, a feature domestic VHS or Betamax machines were only ever able to approach by introducing complex multi-head drums.

At the time of its launch, Video 2000 also offered several innovative features unmatched by the competing formats VHS and Betamax:
* All V2000 VCRs sport an auto-rewind function (later matched by VHS and Betamax)
* Dynamic noise suppression to reduce tape hiss on the audio track (similar to Dolby on VHS machines)
* Provision of a data track alongside the video track
* Channel selection and timer programming via a 0-9 numeric keypad
* While other formats used transparent leader to detect tape end, in a Video Compact Cassette a metal strip on the back of the tape is detected optically by reflection to trigger auto-stop
* Multiple motors meant that the mechanism was direct drive - each spool having its own motor and electric brake
* Direct control of any function so that, with a cassette inserted, one could just press play without switching the machine on first; machines would switch off after a short period of inactivity
* If record was pressed when the machine was empty or had a write-protected cassette in it, the machine would open the cassette carriage
* Automatically winding the tape to a tape counter value input on the keypad ("go to").
* Not long before the end of production Philips introduced a half-speed mode, the V2000 XL or eXtra Long, doubling capacity and making it possible to store 16 hours (eight hours per side) on one single tape. This was featured in Philips VR2840 and Grundig's Video 2x8 machines.
Linear [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound was available on some models, though both VHS and Betamax were offering hifi stereo sound with near-CD quality by the mid 1980s.

== Launch ==
[[Image:Vr2020.jpg|right|thumb|The Philips VR2020 was the first mass-marketed model for the Video 2000 format sold in the United Kingdom.]]
After displaying their VR2000 prototype at trade shows and to the media Philips released the first Video 2000 VCR, the VR2020, in the United Kingdom in 1979. Philips models were re-badged as Pye and ITT, amongst others, and even re-skinned as [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]], whilst Grundig models were re-badged as Siemens.

A key intention of the V2000 format, thanks to DTF, was tape compatibility. A tape from any machine should play perfectly on any other machine. Unfortunately, when the VR2020 reached the shops it was discovered that its audio head was 2.5mm out of position compared to that on Grundig's Video 2x4. This meant that the sound would be out of sync with the picture when played back on the other type of machine. Both manufacturers' production lines hastily moved the audio head 1.25mm to a common position, but compatibility issues remained for recordings made on the first generation of machines.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Richard. ''Home Video'' ([[Newnes Technical Books]], 1982), page 18&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the required close tolerances and fragility of the DTF system resulted in significant inter-machine compatibility issues which were never fully resolved.

Furthermore, there were initially some compatibility issues with the tape interchange, allegedly even with the lap synchrony, if cassettes recorded with Philips equipment were to be played on Grundig machines.

Although Philips and Grundig agreed on a common tape format, they came up with machines that were radically different mechanically. Building on its experience with [[Video Cassette Recording|DVD And VCR,]] Grundig machines featured a Betamax-style loading ring to gently pull the tape around the video heads in a 'U-wrap' over all three generations of their recorders, which was effective, simple and economical.

Philips, however, used an 'M-wrap' similar to that in VHS machines. Cables pulled pins along tracks in order to pull the tape into the transport path. This drive was large, heavy and very complex to produce, although having the head drum, capstan, audio/erase heads and the respective drive motors all mounted on a common base plate meant it was produced to high tolerances. Philips referred to this assembly as the ‘microworld’. Second and third generation Philips drives replaced the cable-pulled pins with a reliable lever mechanism.

In addition, first and second generation Grundig recorders had a high failure rate due to thin-walled plastic connectors between the drive and the motor connection board.

== Second-generation improvements ==
[[File:Philips VR 2340.jpg|thumb|The Philips VR2340 is a second-generation Philips Video 2000 recorder. This particular model features IR remote control, trick play and linear stereo.]]
Compared to VHS, production costs were a big problem with Video 2000. For their second-generation series Philips developed a completely new drive, with the tape pulled against the heads in an formation by pins on lever arms. This drive was very compact, with very high quality and (compared to VHS) very fast response times, but still had five direct-drive motors (head drum, capstan, two belt drive and a threading and cassette compartment). Due to their compact nature, these last Philips drives were quite expensive to service but defects in the mechanism are quite rare, except for the rubber pressure roller which is easy to change.

Other improvements include reduced outer dimensions and weight and addition of a [[SCART]] audio/video connector.

== Planned developments ==
Philips and Grundig intended Video 2000 to improve on the perceived failings of the VHS and Betamax formats whilst providing the potential for further developments. However, the format was withdrawn before many of these possibilities appeared on the market.

The [[prototype]] Video Mini Cassette was a compact version of the VCC (analogous to VHS-C) that was playable in existing machines using a full-sized cassette adaptor. Published photos clearly show the [[nomenclature]] VMC120, suggesting that 60 minutes per side were possible (compared to 20 minutes total initially for VHS-C), but Philips retired Video 2000 before the development was ready for market. The 108x72x21mm Video Mini Cassette was somewhat larger than VHS-C's (92x59x23mm). However, the cassette - as well as the adaptor - left the tape noticeably exposed to mishandling.

Hifi sound was never marketed although photos of the Philips VR2870 were published in 1985, shortly before the format's demise. This would have recorded [[pulse-code modulation|pulse-code modulated]] (PCM) audio in the data track, offering the format another advantage over VHS/Beta as the hifi track would be independent of the visuals, and so could be re-recorded or dubbed as became possible later with [[Video8]].

Rumours also circulated in the press of an auto-reverse machine shortly before the format was retired. Technically this would have been a major challenge to enable a single head drum to scan both 'sides' of the tape at the correct angle.

Alongside the write-protect hole were two that were never used. One was slated to indicate the tape formulation as higher coercivity tapes were to be introduced for the 'Super 2000' hi-band version of the format. The flexibility of this system also allowed for metal tape to be introduced for the digital version 'Digital 2000', also in the early stages of development as the format was canceled. Internal documents suggested the cassette abbreviations VSC and VDC to be used, respectively, for the two developments.

== Format's demise ==
Although Video 2000 was technologically superior to the competition in several ways, it could not compete with VHS and Betamax's key advantages:
* By the time it reached the market, VHS and Betamax had established [[market share]] and considerable prerecorded video libraries.
* JVC offered other manufacturers free licenses to produce VHS devices
* VHS and Betamax recorders have been credited with greater reliability.
* VHS and Betamax both had hi-fi stereo sound. 
* Betamax [[camcorder]]s arrived at market first.
* VHS and Betamax enjoyed worldwide distribution.
Additionally, Video 2000 never achieved the picture quality (optimally adjusted devices) of the predecessor systems VCR, VCR-LP or SVR because of the video writing speed.

In 1985 Grundig started development and production of VHS recorders alongside V2000, and in 1986 Philips announced that it would discontinue the manufacturing of Video 2000 recorders, focusing instead on VHS exclusively. Their first home-grown VHS recorder - VR6560 - was virtually a clone of the VR2324, using the VHS format tapes and the usual VHS M-wrap. Curiously, when Philips launched its second-generation home-grown VHS recorders (VR6467, VR6760, etc.) they pioneered the VHS 'U-wrap' (known colloquially as the "Charly" deck) and this was used in many Philips-built machines well into the first half of the 1990s. Grundig also used U-wrap in its own VHS decks for a short while before using Panasonic-manufactured decks.

The '''W86''' was an American [[thermonuclear bomb|thermonuclear warhead]] with earth-penetrating characteristics (a [[nuclear bunker buster]]), intended for use on the [[Pershing II]] IRBM missile.

The W86 design was canceled in September 1980 when the Pershing II missile mission shifted from destroying [[Target hardening|hardened]] targets to targeting soft targets at greater range. The [[W85]] warhead, which had been developed in parallel with the W86, was used for all production Pershing II missiles.

Published design details on the W86 are vague; it has been stated &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 New bomb, no mission] Greg Mello [http://thebulletin.org ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''] May/June 1997, pp. 28&lt;/ref&gt; that the W86 and W85 were yet more derivatives of the [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61]] bomb family (along with the [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]], [[W81]], and [[W84]]).  All of those weapons have a maximum diameter of roughly {{Convert|13|in|cm}}.  The later '''B61-11''' bomb is another earth-penetrating bomb type.

'''Water Data Transfer Format''' ('''WDTF''') is a data delivery standard implemented by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM) that was jointly developed with the [[CSIRO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://csiropedia.csiro.au/a-clearer-picture-of-australias-water-resources/ Media Release:A clearer picture of Australia’s water resources], March 29, 2010, CSIROpedia&lt;/ref&gt; The standard, released in 2009, specifies both the format of and the techniques used to deliver Australian water data measurements to the BoM.&lt;ref name="bom1"&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/water/standards/wdtf/ WDTF], Water Information: Regulations, Australian Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/ref&gt; Some private organisations and government agencies in Australia that collect water data are mandated to deliver it to the BoM according to the (Australian) Water Act 2007.&lt;ref name="bom2"&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/water/about/publications/document/InfoSheet_2.pdf The Water Act 2007 and Water Regulations 2008], information sheet, Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/ref&gt;

An external meteorological data source that delivers data in WDTF-compliant forms is the CSIRO Land &amp; Water's Automatic Weatherstation Network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010421072927/http://www.clw.csiro.au:80/services/weather/ CSIRO Land &amp; Water's Automatic Weatherstation Network] &lt;/ref&gt; Data from this weatherstation network can be viewed in a web browser, downloaded at text values in CSV format, downloaded in a condensed XML format for machine-to-machine communications, or downloaded as WDTF-compliant data.
 
The use of WDTF is an example of work in the field of [[Irrigation Informatics]].
