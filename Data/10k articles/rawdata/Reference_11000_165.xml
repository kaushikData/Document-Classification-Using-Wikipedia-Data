'''''A Chinese-English Dictionary''''' (1892), compiled by the British [[Consular Officer|consular officer]] and [[sinologist]] [[Herbert Allen Giles]] (1845-1935), is the first [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese.E2.80.93English dictionaries|Chinese-English]] [[encyclopedic dictionary]]. Giles started compilation after being rebuked for criticizing mistranslations in [[Samuel Wells Williams]]' (1874) ''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]''. The 1,461-page first edition contains 13,848 [[Chinese character]] [[headword|head entries]] alphabetically [[collation|collated]] by [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]] pronunciation [[Chinese romanization|romanized]] in the [[Wade-Giles]] system, which Giles created as a modification of [[Thomas Francis Wade|Thomas Wade]]'s (1867) system. Giles' dictionary furthermore gives pronunciations from nine regional [[varieties of Chinese]], and three [[Sino-Xenic]] languages [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Giles revised his dictionary into the 1,813-page second edition (1912) with the addition of 67 more entries and numerous usage examples.

==History==
[[File:Gems of Chinese Literature pg 6.png|thumb|Photograph of Herbert Allen Giles]]
Herbert Giles served as a British consular officer in late [[Qing dynasty]] China until from 1867 to 1892. After his return to England, he was appointed the second [[Joseph Needham Professor of Chinese History, Science, and Civilization|professor of Chinese]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], in succession to Thomas Francis Wade. They are renowned for developing what was later called the [[Wade-Giles]] romanization system of Chinese, which Giles' ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' firmly established as the standard in the Western world until the 1958 official international [[pinyin]] system (Wilkinson 2000: 93).

In 1867, Giles passed the competitive [[Foreign Office]] examination for a Student lnterpretership in China, and began studying the Chinese language at Peking. He later criticized his first Chinese book, a Part II reprint of [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]'s (1815-1823) ''[[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language|A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, in Three Parts]]'', because it failed to mark [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], "much as if an English-Chinese dictionary, for the use of the Chinese, were published without the letter ''h'', showing no difference between the conjunction ''and'' and the ''[h]and'' of the body" (Aylmer 1997: 8).

Herbert A. Giles wrote some 60 publications on [[Chinese culture]] and [[Chinese language|language]] (see [[s:Author:Herbert Allen Giles|Wikisource list]]), which may be divided into four broad categories: reference works, language textbooks, translations, and miscellaneous writings (Aylmer 1997: 4). His pioneering reference books established new standards of accuracy. Of all his publications, Giles was most proud of (1892) ''A Chinese Biographical Dictionary'' and (1892, 1912) ''A Chinese-English Dictionary''. Giles' textbooks for Chinese language learners include (1873) ''A Dictionary of Colloquial Idioms in the Mandarin Dialect'' and two Chinese [[phrasebook]]s transliterated phonetically according to the English alphabet, "so that anyone could pick up the book and read off a simple sentence with a good chance of being understood": the (1872) ''Chinese without a Teacher'' and (1877) ''Handbook of the Swatow Dialect: With a Vocabulary'' for [[Teochew dialect]] (Aylmer 1997: 13). His wide-ranging translations cover many genres of [[Chinese literature]]. Probably the best known are (1880, 1916) ''Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio'', (1884, 1922) ''Gems of Chinese Literature'', and (1889, 1926) ''Chuang Tz≈≠, Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer''. Giles' other writings include some of the first general histories of China, the (1901) ''A History of Chinese Literature'', (1906) ''Religions of Ancient China'', and (1911) ''The Civilization of China''.

Herbert Giles says he decided to compile ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' after his review of Williams' ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language'' "brought down on my head many objurgations from the author's friends" (Aylmer 1997: 14, Wilkinson 2000: 93). As Giles explains in his previously unpublished (c. 1918-1925) typescript memoirs, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] review was of Dr Williams' ''Syllabic Dictionary'' (''Evening Gazette'', 16 Sept., 1874), for which I was freely bespattered with abuse from all American quarters. I showed up a multiplicity of absurd blunders and equally egregious omissions; and I wound up with these prophetic words: "We do not hesitate to pronounce Dr Williams the lexicographer, not for the future, but of the past." I at once began upon a dictionary of my own. (Aylmer 1997: 15-16) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Provoked by the American missionary Williams, Giles devoted himself to publishing a new dictionary that "was meant to bring the glory of having compiled the best Chinese-English dictionary back from America to England" (Yang 2014: 317).

Five years later, Giles published a 40-page brochure (1879) ''On some Translations and Mistranslations in Dr. Williams' Syllabic Dictionary'' that was reported extensively among English-language newspapers published in China (Aylmer 1997: 21). "I was badly mauled" in the ''[[Daily Press (Hong Kong)]]'', "received unstinted praise" in the ''North China Daily News'', and was supported in the ''[[Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal]]'', which said "the Dictionary is in fault in most of the instances given." Giles sent a copy of his brochure to Williams, but received no reply. Since Williams reprinted his dictionary from [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype plates]], he was unable to make corrections, and added a (1883) Errata and Corrections on a fly-sheet at the end‚Äîwithout acknowledgement of Giles' corrections.

Herbert Giles continued working on his Chinese-English dictionary for 15 years until 1889 when the [[Foreign Office]] granted his request to be stationed as Consul at [[Ningpo]], where the workload was light and he could prepare the manuscript for press (Aylmer 1997: 32). The Shanghai publishers [[Kelly &amp; Walsh]] printed the dictionary in 4 fascicules from 1891 to 1892.

The first edition ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' (1892) , which [[Bernard Quaritch]] also published in London, had 2 [[Quarto#Quarto as format|royal quarto]] (250 by 320&amp;nbsp;mm.) volumes comprising a 46-page [[front matter]] (9-page Preface and 32-page Philological Essay) and the 1415-page dictionary, printed in triple columns, beginning with 60 pages of tables. The price was $35. (Aylmer 1997: 34).

For the subsequent two decades, Giles diligently worked "to correct mistakes, cut out duplicates and unnecessary matter, prepare revised Tables, and add a very large number of new phrases, taken from my reading in modern as well as in ancient literature" (Aylmer 1997: 51).

The revised and enlarged second edition (1912) was likewise published by Kelly &amp; Walsh and Bernard Quaritch in 7 fascicules printed from 1909 to 1912. It had 2 royal quarto volumes, with Part I comprising a 17-page preface (with extracts from the first edition) and 84 pages of tables; and Part II comprising the dictionary itself, printed in triple columns. Compared with the first edition of 1,461 total pages, the 1,813-page second edition is 398 pages longer. Giles produced the first edition entirely at his own risk, and it cost ¬£2300, towards which the Foreign Office gave ¬£300. The second edition cost ¬£4800, towards which they gave ¬£250 (Aylmer 1997: 32).

Giles' Chinese-English dictionary remained in "constant use" for generations (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). A compact edition was reprinted by Paragon Books (Chicago) in 1964, Ch'eng Wen (Taibei) in 1978, and is still available online (Yang 1985: 288).

Giles learned that [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Edmund Backhouse]], one of his first Chinese language students at Cambridge, had been trying for years to compile a Chinese-English dictionary. In 1925, he used it to metaphorically describe Chinese bilingual lexicography in terms of international [[Competition#Sports|sports competition]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Backhouse's dictionary] is of course intended to supersede my own work. Well, dictionaries are like dogs, and have their day; and I should be the last person to whine over the appearance of the dictionary of the future, which it is to be hoped will come in good time, and will help to an easier acquisition of "the glorious language." Morrison and Medhurst, both Englishmen, between them held the blue ribbon of Chinese lexicography from 1816 to 1874; then it passed to Wells Williams, who held it for America until 1892, when I think I may claim to have recaptured it for my own country, and to have held it now for thirty-three years. (Aylmer 1997: 38) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the history of bilingual Chinese lexicography, Giles' (1892, 1912) ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' is the fourth major [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese.E2.80.93English dictionaries|Chinese-English dictionary]] after [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]'s (1815-1823) ''[[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'', [[Walter Henry Medhurst]]'s (1842) ''[[Chinese and English Dictionary]]'', and [[Samuel Wells Williams]]' (1874) ''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]''. Giles' dictionary was superseded by [[Robert Henry Mathews]]' (1931) ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary|A Chinese-English Dictionary Compiled for the China Inland Mission]]''. In contrast to Morrison, Medhurst, Williams, and Mathews, who were all [[Christian missionaries]] in China, Giles was an agnostic [[anti-clericalist]] (Aylmer 1977: 2).

The historian Huiling Yang (2014: 318) found that although Giles strongly criticized Williams' dictionary, it turns out that Giles' own dictionary is more closely linked to Williams' than to Morrison's, which Giles praised highly. Medhurst's, Williams', and Giles' Chinese-English dictionaries are all members of a tradition that originated with Morrison's work. Each of their dictionaries made contributions and improvements to the art of Chinese-English dictionary compilation.

Giles' preface to the second edition gives a "Comparative Table of Phrases under Various Characters, Taken as Specimens, to illustrate the Progress of Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Lexicography", for example (1912: vii):

[[File:Giles 1892 1066.jpg|thumb|Sample page from Giles' ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' (1892: 1066)]]
Herbert Giles worked for 18 years to compile and publish the 1892 first edition ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'', which contains 10,859 character [[headword|head entries]] plus 2,989 [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]] for a total of 13,848 entries. He decided to number every head entry‚Äîan improvement lacking in the earlier dictionaries of Morrison, Medhurst, and Williams‚Äîin order to facilitate internal [[cross-referencing]] and make it easier for users to find characters (1892: v). Giles subsequently worked for 20 years revising and adding "a vast number of compounds and phrases" to the 1912 second edition, which contains 10,926 head entries (67 more) plus 2,922 variants, also totaling 13,848 (Norman 1998: 173).

Despite the addition of new head entries to the second edition, Giles kept the original 13,848 numerical arrangement owing to an [[unintended consequence]] (1912: viii). People in China were using the dictionary numbers as a [[Chinese telegraph code]], that is, a [[character encoding]] index for [[Electrical telegraph|telegraphs]] written in Chinese characters‚Äîanalogous with modern [[Chinese input methods for computers]]. Another example of using Giles' 13,848 numbers to [[Index (publishing)|index]] characters is Vernon Nash's (1936) ''Trindex: an Index to Three Dictionaries'' or ''San zidian yinde'' ‰∏âÂ≠óÂÖ∏ÂºïÂæó, for ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'', (1711) ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]'' [[rime dictionary]], and (1716) ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]''.

The dictionary is alphabetically [[collation|collated]] by [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]] pronunciation [[Chinese romanization|romanized]] in the [[Wade-Giles]] system, ''a'', ''ai'', ''an'', ''ang'', etc. Within each syllabic pronunciation section, characters sharing the same phonetic element and different graphic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] are arranged together, for instance, the phonetic ''ai&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' Ëâæ (number 32) "mugwort; artemisia" is followed by ''ai&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' Âìé (33, with the [[Radical 30|mouth radical]]) "an interjection of surprise", ''ai&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' È§Ä (34, [[Radical 184|food radical]]) "food which has been spoilt", and ''ai&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' È¥± (35, [[Radical 196|bird radical]]) "the hen of the tailor-bird".

Pronunciations are glossed in late 19th-century standard [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]]. In addition, Giles glosses pronunciations in archaic [[Middle Chinese]] rime ("R." according to the ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]'' [[rime dictionary]]) and ''[[fanqie]]'', nine regional varieties of Chinese (commonly mistaken for mutually-understandable "[[dialects]]"), and the Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean languages (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). Giles' dictionary went far beyond Williams', which glosses pronunciations in Middle Chinese and four regional varieties: [[Shantou dialect|Shantou]], [[Amoy dialect|Amoy]], [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhou]], and [[Shanghai]] Chinese. Giles' dictionary abbreviates the nine varieties ("dialects") by their initial letter: C. [[Cantonese]], H. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], F. [[Fuzhou dialect|Foochow]], W. [[Wenzhounese|W√™nchow]], N. [[Ningbo dialect|Ningpo]], P. [[Pekingese]], M. "Mid-China", Y. [[Yangzhou|Yangchow]], and S. [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Ssuch'uan]], as well as in K. [[Korean language|Korean]], J. [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and A. [[Vietnamese language|Annamese]] languages.

[[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|Tones]] are annotated with a superscript number in the upper right of a character or romanized word; the [[four tones]] of [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]] are indicated as 1 "high-level", 2 "rising", 3 "dipping", and 4 "falling". In the first edition, Giles uses 5 to denote alternate tonal pronunciations that he had heard, eruditely described as "''tra cotanto senno''" ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "amid such wisdom", from [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']]) (1892: vii). The prior dictionaries of Morrison, Williams, and Medhurst annotate tones in terms of the outdated [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation used in [[rime dictionaries]] such as the ''Kangxi''; namely ''p√≠ng'' Âπ≥ "level" tone, ''sh√†ng'' ‰∏ä "rising", ''q√π'' Âéª "departing", and ''r√π'' ÂÖ•"entering" tone. Giles uses an asterisk to indicate archaic [[entering tone]], with &lt;sup&gt;2*&lt;/sup&gt; denoting second tone with a ''-p'', ''-t'', or ''-k'' [[stop consonant]]. Despite the historical fact that the "entering" tone had already ceased to exist in 19th-century Beijing pronunciation, Norman notes that early Chinese-English dictionaries were "much concerned with including it" (1988: 173).

Dictionary pages are formatted in three columns, each split between the head entry character, number, and pronunciations on the left, and the translation equivalents ("definitions"), cross references, and subentries of terms on the right. Giles attempts to arrange the subentry example words and phrases according to the order of the translation equivalents. The dictionary's approximately "hundred thousand examples" diversely range from the "best and highest planes of Chinese thought" to everyday words and nursery rhymes (1892: vii).

The Chinese character [[wikt:ÈÅì|ÈÅì]] for ''d√†o'' "way; path; say; the [[Tao|Dao]]" or ''d«éo'' "guide; lead; conduct; instruct; direct" (or [[wikt:Â∞é|Â∞é]] clarified with [[Radical 41]] ÂØ∏ "thumb; inch") is a good litmus test for a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. The sample entry from Giles' dictionary for ''tao&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' ÈÅì&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (10,780) gives the character and number over pronunciations from [[Cantonese]] ''tou'' to [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''dau'' on the left, and the translation equivalents and examples on the right. Note that {} brackets indicate translation equivalents added in the second edition.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A road; a path; a way. Hence; the road ''par excellence''; the right way; the true path; {the ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ of the New Test.; identified by Kingsmill with the Buddhist ''M√¢rga'', the path which leads to Nirv√¢na;} the truth; religion{; principles ''see'' 8032}. Of or belonging to Taoism {''see'' Â§™Ê•µ 859}. A district; a region; a political division of the empire, varying under different dynasties; a circuit; a ''Tao-t'ai''. To speak; to tell. {A numerative; ''see'' entries.} (1892: 1066, {1912: 1332}) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The 1912 second edition adds references to [[Christian Greek Scriptures|Christian Greek scriptural]] [[wikt:ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ|ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ]] ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'', Thomas William Kingsmill's (1899) ''[[Daodejing]]'' translation comparing ''d√†o'' with [[Sanskrit]] ''mƒÅrga'' "path; [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|(Buddhist) paths to liberation]]", the meaning "principles" under ''mou'' Ë¨Ä&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (8032) "to plot; to scheme", "[[Tai chi]]" Â§™Ê•µ under Ê•µ&lt;sup&gt;2*&lt;/sup&gt; (859), ''d√†ot√°i'' ÈÅìËá∫ "(historical) the magistrate of a ''d√†o'' district/circuit", and the syntactic use of ÈÅì as a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] or [[measure word]] for rivers/topics/etc.

The first edition ÈÅì&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (1892: 1066-1068) entry gives 230 examples of words and phrases for ''tao&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' "way; path" (e.g., "ÈªÉÈÅì the [[ecliptic]]; good luck; a lucky day; the conjunction of the sun and moon; in Taoist language, the state of unconscious innocence, as of an unborn babe"), and "Read ''tao&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''. To lead; ''see'' No. 10,781" with 6 examples. The second edition (1912: 1332-1336) gives 255 examples (for instance, adding "‰∏ÄÈÅîË¨Ç‰πãÈÅì that which passes through is called ''tao''", quoting the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' dictionary definition of ''d√†o'') and "Read ''tao&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''. To lead; ''see'' 10,781" and 6 examples. The following ''tao&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' Â∞é&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (10,781) "To lead; to guide" entry gives 7 examples in the first edition and 8 in the second, for instance "Â∞éÂ∏´ the guiding Teacher‚ÄîBuddha".

Herbert Giles created the first Chinese-English [[encyclopedic dictionary]] in two ways, with comprehensive explanations under head entries and with informative tables. His example was followed by many later Chinese-English dictionaries up to the present time (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). First, some dictionary entries include in-depth information. Take ''p«îlu'' Ê∞ÜÊ∞á "a woolen fabric made in Tibet" as an example. Giles gives ''P'u&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' Ê∞Ü&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (9514) "An open-woven, thick woolen cloth, either plain or flowered, with a nap on one side, known as Ê∞ÜÊ∞á. It comes from Tibet, and is used for making the winter caps of Lamas. Known to the Mongols as ''cheng-m√©'' and ''chalma''." Second, Giles's dictionary has six tables, in addition to the requisite table of the 214 [[Kangxi Radicals]] (essential for using a [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-and-stroke index]]) included by Morrison, Medhurst, and Williams. The tables are for [[Qing official headwear|Insignia of Official Rank]], [[Chinese surnames|The Family Names]], [[dynasties in Chinese history|The Chinese Dynasties]], [[Provinces of China|Topographical]], [[Chinese calendar|The Calendar]], and Miscellaneous ([[Chinese numerals]]). Another table is found in the dictionary front matter, called the Table of Sounds (1892) or Table of Sounds for Dialects (1912).

Giles was the first Chinese-English lexicographer to systematically include [[Homograph#In Chinese|homographs]] "a character with two or more readings" (which he calls "duplicate characters"). For instance, the character [[wikt:Èï∑|Èï∑]] can be pronounced ''ch√°ng'' "long; lasting", ''zh«éng'' "grow up; increase", or ''zh√†ng'' "plenty; surplus": Wade-Giles ''ch'ang&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''chang&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''chang&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'', respectively. The main entry ''ch'ang&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' Èï∑&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (450) first has "Long, of time or space, as opposed to Áü≠ short. Excelling; advantageous; profitable." with 59 words and phrases (e.g., "Èï∑Áîü long life; immortality. Used as a euphemism for coffins, death, etc."); then "Read ''chang&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''. Old; senior. To excel; to increase; to grow." with 38 ("Èï∑Â¶æ the senior concubine"); and then "Read ''chang&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''. with 4 terms (e.g., ÁÑ°Èï∑Áâ© there is nothing over."). The alternate entry ''chang'' Èï∑ [no tone] (408) says "''See'' 450."

==Reception==
Giles' ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' has received both acclaim and censure. An early critic, the [[Chinese Malaysian]] scholar [[Gu Hongming]] (1857-1928) criticized Giles' lack of overall insight into [[Chinese literature]], and said
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is this want of philosophical insight in Dr. Giles which makes him so helpless in the arrangement of his materials in his books. Take for instance his great dictionary. It is in no sense a dictionary at all. It is merely a collection of Chinese phrases and sentences, translated by Dr. Giles without any attempt at selection, arrangement, order or method. As a dictionary for the purposes of the scholar, Dr. Giles' dictionary is decidedly of less value than even the old dictionary of Dr. Williams. (1915: [[s:Page:The Spirit of the Chinese People.djvu/166|120]]) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arthur C. Moule, son of the Anglican missionary [[George Moule]], wrote a critical review of Giles' dictionary, for instance, the Âê¶&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; entry (3596) gives ''fou&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' "Not; on the contrary; negative" and ''p'i&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' "Bad; wicked. One of the diagrams."  "Diagram" refers to the ''[[Yijing]]'' [[List of hexagrams of the I Ching#Hexagram 12|Hexagram 12]] ''p«ê'' Âê¶ "Obstruction". Moule (1922: 130) says ''fou'', ''p'i'', or ''pei'' {{sic}} has three meanings" "not", "to obstruct; an obstacle", and "evil", but Giles accidentally omitted the second, which is the hexagram's meaning.

The English sinologist Charles Aylmer, who first published ''The Memoirs of H. A. Giles'' from a [[Cambridge University Library]] manuscript, gives a balanced evaluation on the dictionary. Aylmer says the second edition "impresses by its sheer bulk" but falls short of the "highest standards of the best 19th-century lexicography". First, the dictionary does not cite sources for terms, but diversely includes both [[Classical Chinese]] literary [[archaism]]s from sources like the ''Kangxi Dictionary'' and modern vernacular [[colloquialism]]s that Giles "laboriously collected from books read and conversations held during a long stretch of years." Second, Giles failed to indicate stylistic level, which he justifies on the "(somewhat specious) grounds" that, "No division of phraseology into classical and colloquial has been made, for the simple reason that no real line of demarcation exists. Expressions are used in ordinary conversation which occur in the ''Book of Odes''. The book-language fades imperceptibly into the colloquial." (1912: viii). A third lexicographical shortcoming is the random arrangement of subentries, "requiring the reader to con up and down the columns". As a general rule, Giles explains (1892: vii), "the meanings found in the Classics stand first, and more modern and colloquial meanings follow. But to this rule there are some striking exceptions, purposely introduced, so as not to impair any value this Dictionary may have as a practical book of reference." Despite these deficiencies, Aylers says Giles' dictionary "held the field for many decades and lives on in successors", such as [[Robert Henry Mathews|Robert Mathews]]' (1931) ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary|A Chinese-English Dictionary Compiled for the China Inland Mission]]'', many of whose definitions "are taken, without acknowledgment, from Giles". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today the dictionary is most often cited as the [[wikt:locus classicus|locus classicus]] of the so-called "[[Wade-Giles]]" romanisation system, for which the name of Giles is widely known even to non-specialists. Apart from this, its practical use is mainly as a repository of late Ch'ing bureaucratic phraseology, though it is replete with fascinating nuggets of information and is a wonderful book for browsing. (1997: 5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American sinologist and linguist [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] (1998: 173) calls Giles' dictionary the "first truly adequate Chinese-English dictionary", with pronunciation glosses that were "by and large free of the artificiality found in earlier works". He also says that Giles, like his predecessors, mixed literary and colloquial definitions together without distinction, and concludes that the dictionary "remains a rich depository of nineteenth-century Peking colloquial words and phrases, in other respects it has been superseded by later dictionaries".

{{anchor|Wade-Giles}}
A recent book on Chinese lexicography says Giles' dictionary has "special significance and interest" and "enjoys pride of place in the history of Chinese bilingual dictionaries as the authoritative source for the Wade-Giles system of Romanization." (Yong and Peng 2008: 387).

The English sinologist and historian [[Endymion Wilkinson]] (2013: 85) says Giles' dictionary is "still interesting as a repository of late Qing documentary Chinese, although there is little or no indication of the citations, mainly from the ''Kangxi zidian'')." (Wilkinson 2013: 85)

Dr '''Alexander Scott''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] [[Chemical Society|PCS]] (1853&amp;ndash;1947) was a 19th/20th century Scottish chemist who served as Director of Scientific Research at the [[British Museum]]. He was President of the [[Chemical Society]] from 1915 to 1917.

He was the determinator of the [[atomic weight]] of several elements: [[potassium]] (1879), [[sodium]] (1879), [[manganese]] (1881), carbon -re-evaluation (1897), [[tellurium]] (1902), [[nitrogen]] (1905), .&lt;ref&gt;http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royobits/6/17/251.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]] in southern Scotland on 28 December 1853 the eldest of eight children of Alexander Scott, Rector of [[Selkirk Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 768921|title = Alexander Scott. 1853-1947|journal = Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume = 6|issue = 17|pages = 251‚Äì262|last1 = Robertson|first1 = Robert|year = 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1868 he studied Science at [[Edinburgh University]] under [[Fleeming Jenkin]], [[James Dewar]] and [[Alexander Crum Brown]]. He assisted James Dewar in lectures at the [[Dick Vet College]] from 1872 to 1875 and graduated BSc in 1876. He then took further degrees at [[Cambridge University]] gaining a BA in 1879 and MA in 1882. He ended his studies with a doctorate (DSc) back at Edinburgh gained in 1884. He then immediately obtained a post as Science Master at [[Durham, England|Durham]] Secondary School.&lt;ref&gt;http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royobits/6/17/251.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were Sir [[James Dewar]], [[Walter Weldon]], [[James Douglas Hamilton Dickson]] and [[Alexander Crum Brown]]. In 1898 he was also elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783‚Äì2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 he left Durham to become a Demonstrator in Chemistry at [[Cambridge University]]. In 1896 he joined the [[Royal Institution]] in [[London]] as a Researcher. From 1911 to 1919 he undertook private research. In 1919 he became Director of Scientific Research at the [[British Museum]], one of the most prestigious jobs in his field in the world. His initial task involved studying the deterioration of multiple objects stored in "safe" but damp conditions through the war.He founded the Research Laboratory within the museum and in 1924 brought in Dr [[Harold Plenderleith]] as his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1938 and died in [[Ringwood]] in [[Hampshire]] on 10 March 1947. On his death, [[Harold Plenderleith]] acted as his executor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1636739&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information ==
''Are Years What? (for Marianne Moore)'' is signature of di Suvero's monumental early 1960s "open-work constructions." These works utilize cast-off construction materials like chains, metal bars, and ladders. This sculpture is the first that di Suvero built, from beginning to end, with I-beams and using a crane, solely by himself.&lt;ref name="VirtualG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt;

=== Acquisition and installation ===
''Are Years What?'' was originally in the collection of the artist, then the collection of Enrico Martignoni of [[Winnemucca, Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Hirshhorn1"/&gt; Hirshhorn director [[James Demetrion]] first saw the sculpture when it was on display in [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]].&lt;ref name="Forgey"/&gt; The sculpture was acquired by the Hirshhorn with funds from the [[Joseph H. Hirshhorn]] Purchase Fund, a gift from the [[Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries]], and by exchange of the di Suvero artwork ''ISIS'',&lt;ref name="Forgey"/&gt; in 1999.&lt;ref name="Hirshhorn1"/&gt; The sculpture was installed on June 13, 1999, by crane into the museum's sculpture garden.&lt;ref name="SIRIS1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Don Hurlbert | year=1999 | title=Installing Hirshhorn Sculpture | work=History of the Smithsonian | publisher=Smithsonian Photographic Services Collection | url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!sichronology&amp;uri=full=3100001~!12741~!0#focus | accessdate= 23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
The dangling "V" shaped piece of the sculpture has been described as representing the [[prow]] of a ship, or, as by art critic [[Irving Sandler]] as a representation of di Suvero's family's [[sea|maritime]] heritage in [[Venice]]. Sandler also stated that the acute angles have male and female associations, with the horizontal representing a [[penis]] and the vertical "V", a [[vagina]], which di Suvero does not associate with the work. The "V" has also been suggested to represent [[V formation|birds in flight]] or a "V" for [[V sign#The V campaign and the victory.2Ffreedom sign|victory]].&lt;ref name="Sculpture"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jan Garden Castro | year=2005 | title=To Make Meanings Real: A Conversation with Mark di Suvero | work= | publisher=[[Sculpture (magazine)|Sculpture]] | url=http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag05/june_05/disuvero/disuvero.shtml | accessdate= 23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayne Merkel believed that ''Are Years What?'' exploited the strengths of the I-beams yet "at the same time, he has made a piece that is graceful and well balanced - aesthetically pleasing and intriguing from a number of points of view."&lt;ref name="CincinnatiMagazine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merkel|first1=Jayne|last2=|first2=|year=1971|title=Brilliant New Showplace on Government Square: Contemporary Arts Center |journal=[[Cincinnati Magazine]] |volume=4|issue=4|pages=35|publisher=[[Emmis Communications]] |doi= |url= | }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the sculpture's installation at the Hirshhorn, [[The Washington Post]] received the work as "brilliant in conception," "prominent, beautiful and memorable.

The '''Biblioteca Palafoxiana''' is a library in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Mexico]]. Founded in 1646, it was the first [[public library]] in colonial Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brescia|first=Michael M.|title=Liturgical Expressions of Episcopal Power: Juan de Palafox y Mendoza and Tridentine Reform in Colonial Mexico|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=July 2004|volume=90|issue=3|page=497|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25026636|doi=10.1353/cat.2004.0116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes considered the first in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to the Book|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Sherman, William H.|chapter=Palafoxiana, Biblioteca|editor1=Suarez, Michael F. |editor2=Woudhuysen, H. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has more than 45,000 books and manuscripts, ranging from the 15th to the 20th century. In 2005, it was listed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register ‚Äì Latin America and the Caribbean|Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblioteca Palafoxiana|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/mexico+palafoxiana.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Biblioteca Palafoxiana owes its name and foundation to [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]], bishop of Puebla. He was a lover of books, and is quoted as having said,
{{quote|He who succeeds without books is in an inconsolable darkness, on a mountain without company, on a path without a [[crosier]], in darkness without a guide.}}
On 6 September 1646, Palafox y Mendoza donated 5,000&lt;ref name=Jornada&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Arturo Garcia|title=Historia de una pasi√≥n por los libros y el conocimiento|url=http://anuario.upn.mx/index.php/noticias-educativas/2003/693-la-jornada/39836-historia-de-una-pasion-por-los-libros-y-el-conocimiento.html|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=La Jornada|date=26 August 2003|language=Spanish}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of his own items to the Colegio de San Juan‚Äîwhich was founded by him‚Äîon the condition that they be made available to the general public.&lt;ref name=Icon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster |first=Angela M.H. |title=Biblioteca Palafoxiana |journal=Icon |date=Winter 2004‚Äì2005 |pages=22‚Äì29 |url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_article/pg_22-29_palafoxiana.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108025313/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_article/pg_22-29_palafoxiana.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "it is very useful and convenient that there should be in this city and kingdom a public library, where all sorts of people will be able to study as they wish".&lt;ref name=Jornada /&gt;

More than a century later, [[Francisco Fabi√°n y Fuero]] ordered the construction of the premises which currently house the Biblioteca Palafoxiana. He donated his own collection, and the collections of the bishops [[Manuel Fern√°ndez de Santa Cruz]] and [[Francisco Pablo V√°zquez]] and the dean of the Francisco Irigoyen Cathedral were gradually added, as were volumes from Pueblan religious schools and individuals.&lt;ref name=Jornada /&gt; Books confiscated from Jesuits upon [[suppression of the Society of Jesus|their expulsion in 1767]] were also added.&lt;ref name=Icon /&gt;

The library was finished in 1773, consisting of a 43-meter-long [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] hall on the Colegio's second floor. Two levels of bookshelves were built, and a [[retablo]] of the Madonna of Trapani by [[Nino Pisano]] was acquired. By the mid-19th century, the size of the collection necessitated a third level of bookshelves.

Two earthquakes in 1999 caused damage to the building and shelves, leading to a restoration program in 2001.&lt;ref name=Icon /&gt; The library is open Tuesday through Friday 10am-6pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 6pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico In Depth.com|website=mexicoindepth.com |url=http://mexicoindepth.com/why-should-you-visit-the-biblioteca-palafoxiana-in-puebla/|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library has, since its inception, been used by any person who wishes to study. 

Today, it houses the Institute for Bibliographical Research which has been in charge of publishing "Los Impresos de la Biblioteca Palafoxiana" promoting the historical value of the collections and its museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cordova |first1=Arturo |title=The Palafoxiana Library |journal=Voices of Mexico |date=1999 |volume=47 |page=86-88 |url=http://ezproxy.fau.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=ip,cookie,url,uid&amp;db=mzh&amp;AN=2000040394&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bod''''' is a [[BBC One|BBC1]] children's television programme first shown in 1975, with thirteen episodes, based on four original ''Bod'' books by [[Joanne Cole|Joanne]] and [[Michael Cole (writer)|Michael Cole]]. It is a cel animated cartoon series narrated by [[John Le Mesurier]] and Maggie Henderson with music by [[Derek Griffiths]] and produced by David Yates. The four books were published in 1965 in the United Kingdom and later in the United States and France. They are: ''Bod's Apple'',  ''Bod's Present'', ''Bod's Dream'' and ''Bod and the Cherry Tree''. The French version of ''Bod's Apple'' is called ''La Pomme de Gus''.

Before the animated series was commissioned, the four books had been read on another BBC children's programme: ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]''. In 1974, thirteen five-minute episodes were created for transmission on the BBC as part of the ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' series, and were also sold to Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] channel. Soon thereafter, it was shown in New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Poland and Israel. In the United States, ''Bod'' aired on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] as a segment on the ''[[Pinwheel (TV show)|Pinwheel]]'' program.

The character of Bod is a boy who lives in a town with Aunt Flo, PC Copper, Frank the Postman and Farmer Barleymow. Each of the characters has their own theme music performed by [[Derek Griffiths|Griffiths]] which is heard when they appear. Regular features are animal identification and Bod Snap.

There is also another set of characters who appear in each episode called ''Alberto Frog and his Amazing Animal Band'' with artwork by [[Joanne Cole]]. This section featured short extracts from famous pieces of [[Western classical music|classical music]] as part of the story, and always ended with Alberto choosing a different flavour of [[milkshake]] as his reward for solving a problem, and was narrated by Maggie Henderson.

''Bod'' has appeared in [[Channel 4]]'s [[100 Greatest Kids' TV shows]] and [[100 Greatest Cartoons]].

The ''Alberto Frog'' segments were produced separately by the BBC and were originally shown alongside the Bod episodes; only five of these thirteen segments are known to survive, following a decision in the early 1990s to wipe a large amount of videotaped 1970s children's programmes &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Tie-ins and Taoism==
As well as books for each of the televised episodes, there have been two other [[tie-in]] books based on ''Bod'', by Alison and Lo Cole, the children of creators Joanne and Michael Cole. ''Bod's Way: The Meaning of Life'' was being worked on by Michael Cole before he died in 2001, and was completed by Alison.

The books reveal the [[Taoism|Taoist]] beliefs of Bod's original creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Brewers Dictionary of Phrase and Fable.jpg|thumb|The 18th edition of the dictionary, published in 2009]]
'''''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable''''', sometimes referred to simply as '''''Brewer's''''', is a [[reference work]] containing definitions and explanations of many famous [[Figure of speech|phrases]], [[allusion]]s, and figures, whether [[Biography|historical]] or [[Mythology|mythical]].

The "Revised and Updated Edition" from the 1890s is now in the [[public domain]], and Web-based versions are available online.

The most recent version is the 20th edition, published in November 2018 by [[Chambers Harrap Publishers]].

==History==
Originally published in 1870 by the Reverend [[E. Cobham Brewer]], it was aimed at the growing number of people who did not have a university education, but wanted to understand the origins of phrases and historical or literary allusions.  The 'phrase' part of the title refers mainly to the explanation of various idioms and proverbs, while the "fable" part might more accurately be labelled "[[folklore]]" and ranges from classical [[mythology]] to relatively recent literature.  On top of this, Brewer added notes on important historical figures and events, and other things which he thought would be of interest, such as [[Roman numerals]].

Although intended as a comprehensive reference work, early editions of ''Brewer's'' are highly idiosyncratic, with certain editorial decisions suggestive of the author's personal bias.  For instance, a list under the entry for ''John'' purported to show the bad luck associated with that name, ending "Certainly a disastrous list of Popes" despite several being described merely as "nonentities".  Some entries seem so trivial as to be hardly worth including, and others are almost definitely apocryphal.

Despite this inconsistency, however, the book was a huge success, providing information often not included in more traditional dictionaries and encyclopedias.  A revised and updated edition was published in 1896, shortly before Brewer died.  Since then, it has been continually revised and reprinted, often in facsimile, with the 15th edition being the first to make truly wide-scale changes to the content.

This retitled and updated version, initially edited by [[Adrian Room]], was first published in 2000 ({{ISBN|978-0304350964}}).  A second edition ({{ISBN|978-0550105646}}), edited by Ian Crofton and John Ayto, was published on 30 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brewersreference.com/brewers.php publisher's site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211101740/http://www.brewersreference.com/brewers.php |date=December 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this title is based on the structure of ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', it contains entries from 1900 onwards and exists alongside its parent volume as a separate work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Other special editions==

A variety of spin-off editions has been published in the past, some straying quite far from the theme of 'phrase and fable', such as ''Brewer's Dictionary of Cinema'' (1997) and [[William Donaldson]]'s A-Z of 'roguish Britons', ''[[Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics]]'' (2002). ''Brewer's Dictionary of London Phrase and Fable'' was published in 2009 and ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase and Fable]]'' was reissued at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11263">[[Netbooks]] are small [[laptop]]s, with screen sizes between approximately 7 and 12 inches and low power consumption. They use either an SSD ([[solid state disk]]) or a HDD ([[hard disk drive]]) for storage, have up to 2 gigabytes of RAM (but often less), lack an [[optical disk drive]], and usually have [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[WiFi]] and often [[Bluetooth]] connectivity. The name emphasizes their use as portable Internet appliances.

==Netbook distributions==
There are special [[Linux distribution]]s, called '''netbook distributions''', for these machines. All such distributions purport to be optimized for use with small, low-resolution displays. They tend to include a broad mix of [[VOIP]] and web-focused tools, including proprietary applications rarely seen installed by default by mainstream desktop distributions{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. For instance, [[Nokia]] [[Maemo]] and Asus' customized [[Xandros]] both ship with [[Skype]] and [[Adobe Flash]] installed, and Ubuntu's Netbook Edition offers the option to do the same for OEMs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubuntu.com/netbook Ubuntu 10.4 UNE]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23706">A number of computer [[operating systems]] employ security features to help prevent [[malicious software]] from gaining sufficient privileges to compromise the computer system. Operating systems lacking such features, such as [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] implementations prior to [[Windows NT]] (and its descendants), CP/M-80, and all Mac operating systems prior to Mac OS X, had only one category of user who was allowed to do anything. With separate execution contexts it is possible for multiple users to store private files, for multiple users to use a computer at the same time, to protect the system against malicious users, and to protect the system against malicious programs. The first multi-user secure system was [[Multics]], which began development in the 1960s; it wasn't until [[UNIX]], [[BSD]], [[Linux kernel|Linux]], and [[Windows NT|NT]] in the late 80s and early 90s that multi-tasking security contexts were brought to [[x86]] consumer machines.

== Security considerations ==
{{Expand section|Information for the Mac "Authenticate" dialog|date=December 2009}}

=== Falsified/intercepted user input ===
A major security consideration is the ability of malicious applications to simulate keystrokes or mouse clicks, thus tricking or [[Spoofing attack|spoof]]ing the security feature into granting malicious applications higher privileges.

* '''Using a terminal based client (standalone or within a desktop/GUI):''' '''su''' and '''sudo''' run in the terminal, where they are vulnerable to spoofed input. Of course, if the user was not running a multitasking environment (i.e. a single user in the shell only), this would not be a problem. Terminal windows are usually rendered as ordinary windows to the user, therefore on an intelligent client or desktop system used as a client, the user must take responsibility for preventing other malware on their desktop from manipulating, simulating, or capturing input.

* '''Using a GUI/desktop tightly integrated to the operating system:''' Commonly, the desktop system locks or secures all common means of input, before requesting passwords or other authentication, so that they cannot be intercepted, manipulated, or simulated:
::* '''PolicyKit''' ([[GNOME]] - directs the [[X Window System|X]] server to capture all keyboard and mouse input. Other desktop environments using PolicyKit may use their own mechanisms.
::* '''gksudo''' - by default "locks" the keyboard, mouse, and window focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.penguin-soft.com/penguin/man/1/gksu.html
|title=gksu - a Gtk+ su frontend Linux Man Page
|accessdate=2007-08-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; preventing anything but the actual user from inputting the password or otherwise interfering with the [[Confirmation dialog box|confirmation dialog]].
::* '''UAC (Windows)''' - by default runs in the ''Secure Desktop'', preventing malicious applications from simulating clicking the "Allow" button or otherwise interfering with the confirmation dialog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/uac/archive/2006/05/03/589561.aspx

|first=
|date=2006-05-03
|accessdate=2007-03-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this mode, the user's desktop appears dimmed and cannot be interacted with.
: If either gksudo's "lock" feature or UAC's Secure Desktop were compromised or disabled, malicious applications could gain administrator privileges by using [[keystroke logging]] to record the administrator's password; or, in the case of UAC if running as an administrator, spoofing a mouse click on the "Allow" button. For this reason, voice recognition is also prohibited from interacting with the dialog.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Note that since gksu password prompt runs without special privileges, malicious applications can still do keystroke logging using e.g. the [[strace]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ptrace was restricted in later kernel versions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace_Protection |title=ptrace Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fake authentication dialogs ===
Another security consideration is the ability of malicious software to [[Spoofing attack|spoof]] dialogs that look like legitimate security confirmation requests. If the user were to input credentials into a fake dialog, thinking the dialog was legitimate, the malicious software would then know the user's password. If the Secure Desktop or similar feature were disabled, the malicious software could use that password to gain higher privileges.
* Though it is not the default behavior for usability reasons, '''UAC''' may be configured to require the user to press [[Control-Alt-Delete|Ctrl+Alt+Del]] (known as the [[secure attention sequence]]) as part of the authentication process. Because only Windows can detect this key combination, requiring this additional security measure would prevent spoofed dialogs from behaving the same way as a legitimate dialog.&lt;ref name="Allchin"&gt;{{cite web

|date=2007-01-23
|accessdate=2007-03-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a spoofed dialog might not ask the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Del, and the user could realize that the dialog was fake. Or, when the user did press Ctrl+Alt+Del, the user would be brought to the screen Ctrl+Alt+Del normally brings them to instead of a UAC confirmation dialog. Thus the user could tell whether the dialog was an attempt to trick them into providing their password to a piece of malicious software.
* In GNOME, '''PolicyKit''' uses different dialogs, depending on the configuration of the system. For example, the authentication dialog for a system equipped with a [[fingerprint reader]] might look different from an authentication dialog for a system without one. Applications do not have access to the configuration of PolicyKit, so they have no way of knowing which dialog will appear and thus how to spoof it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/PolicyKit/introduction.html#intro-about|title=Authentication Agent|date=2007|accessdate=2017-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218163259/http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/PolicyKit/introduction.html#intro-about|archive-date=2012-02-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usability considerations ==
Another consideration that has gone into these implementations is [[usability]].

=== Separate administrator account ===
* '''su''' require the user to know the password to at least two accounts: the regular-use account, and an account with higher privileges such as [[Superuser|root]].
* '''sudo''', '''kdesu''' and '''gksudo''' use a simpler approach. With these programs, the user is pre-configured to be granted access to specific administrative tasks, but must explicitly authorize applications to run with those privileges.  The user enters their own password instead of that of the superuser or some another account.
* '''UAC''' and '''Authenticate''' combine these two ideas into one. With these programs, administrators explicitly authorize programs to run with higher privileges. Non-administrators are prompted for an administrator username and password.
* '''PolicyKit''' can be configured to adopt any of these approaches. In practice, the distribution will choose one.

=== Simplicity of dialog ===
* In order to grant an application administrative privileges, '''sudo''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/man/sudoers.html
|title=Sudoers Manual
|author=Miller, Todd C
|accessdate=2007-03-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''gksudo''', and '''Authenticate''' prompt administrators to re-enter their password.
* With '''UAC''', when logged in as a standard user, the user must enter an administrator's name and password each time they need to grant an application elevated privileges; but when logged in as a member of the Administrators group, they (by default) simply confirm or deny, instead of re-entering their password each time (though that is an option). While the default approach is simpler, it is also less secure,&lt;ref name="Allchin" /&gt; since if the user physically walks away from the computer without locking it, another person could walk up and have administrator privileges over the system. 
* '''PolicyKit''' requires the user to re-enter his or her password or provide some other means of authentication (e.g. fingerprint).

=== Saving credentials ===
{{Expand section|Information for the Mac "Authenticate" dialog|date=December 2009}}
* '''UAC''' prompts for authorization each time it is called to elevate a program.
* '''sudo''',&lt;ref name="Sudo Nutshell"/&gt; '''gksudo''', and '''kdesu''' do not ask the user to re-enter their password every time it is called to elevate a program. Rather, the user is asked for their password once at the start. If the user has not used their administrative privileges for a certain period of time (sudo's default is 5 minutes&lt;ref name="Sudo Nutshell"/&gt;), the user is once again restricted to standard user privileges until they enter their password again.

:sudo's approach is a trade-off between security and usability. On one hand, a user only has to enter their password once to perform a series of administrator tasks, rather than having to enter their password for each task. But at the same time, the surface area for attack is larger because all programs that run in that tty (for sudo) or all programs not running in a terminal (for gksudo and kdesu) prefixed by either of those commands before the timeout receive administrator privileges. Security-conscious users may remove the temporary administrator privileges upon completing the tasks requiring them by using the &lt;code&gt;sudo -k&lt;/code&gt; command when from each tty or pts in which sudo was used (in the case of pts's, closing the terminal emulator is ''not'' sufficient).  The equivalent command for kdesu is &lt;code&gt;kdesu -s&lt;/code&gt;.  There is no gksudo option to do the same; however, running &lt;code&gt;sudo -k&lt;/code&gt; not within a terminal instance (e.g. through the Alt + F2 "Run Application" dialogue box, unticking "Run in terminal") will have the desired effect.

* '''Authenticate''' does not save passwords. If the user is a standard user, they must enter a username and a password. If the user is an administrator, the current user's name is already filled in, and only needs to enter their password. The name can still be modified to run as another user.

:The application only requires authentication once, and is requested at the time the application needs the privilege. Once "elevated", the application does not need to authenticate again until the application has been Quit and relaunched.

:However, there are varying levels of authentication, known as Rights. The right that is requested can be shown by expanding the triangle next to "details", underneath the password. Normally, applications use system.privilege.admin, but another may be used, such as a lower right for security, or a higher right if higher access is needed. If the right the application has is not suitable for a task, the application may need to authenticate again to increase the privilege level.

* '''PolicyKit''' can be configured to adopt either of these approaches.

== Identifying when administrative rights are needed ==
{{Expand section|Information for the Mac "Authenticate" dialog|date=December 2009}}
In order for an operating system to know when to prompt the user for authorization, an application or action needs to identify itself as requiring elevated privileges. While it is technically possible for the user to be prompted at the exact moment that an operation requiring such privileges is executed, it is often not ideal to ask for privileges partway through completing a task.  If the user were unable to provide proper credentials, the work done before requiring administrator privileges would have to be undone because the task could not be seen though to the end.

In the case of user interfaces such as the Control Panel in Microsoft Windows, and the Preferences panels in Mac OS X, the exact privilege requirements are hard-coded into the system so that the user is presented with an authorization dialog at an appropriate time (for example, before displaying information that only administrators should see). Different operating systems offer distinct methods for applications to identify their security requirements:

* '''sudo''' centralises all privilege authorization information in a single configuration file, &lt;code&gt;/etc/sudoers&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a list of users and the privileged applications and actions that those users are permitted to use.  The grammar of the sudoers file is intended to be flexible enough to cover many different scenarios, such as placing restrictions on command-line parameters.  For example, a user can be granted access to change anybody's password except for the root account, as follows:
  pete    ALL = /usr/bin/passwd [A-z]*, !/usr/bin/passwd root
* '''User Account Control''' uses a combination of heuristic scanning and "application manifests" to determine if an application requires administrator privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480150.aspx
|title=Developer Best Practices and Guidelines for Applications in a Least Privileged Environment
|accessdate=2007-03-15
|work=MSDN
|publisher=Microsoft
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manifest ([[.manifest]]) files, first introduced with Windows XP, are [[XML]] files with the same name as the application and a suffix of ".manifest", e.g. &lt;code&gt;Notepad.exe.manifest&lt;/code&gt;.  When an application is started, the manifest is looked at for information about what security requirements the application has. For example, this XML fragment will indicate that the application will require administrator access, but will not require unfettered access to other parts of the user desktop outside the application:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;security&gt;
    &lt;requestedPrivileges&gt;
        &lt;requestedExecutionLevel level="requireAdministrator" uiAccess="false" /&gt;
    &lt;/requestedPrivileges&gt;
&lt;/security&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
:Manifest files can also be compiled into the application executable itself as an [[Resource (Windows)|embedded resource]].  Heuristic scanning is also used, primarily for backwards compatibility.  One example of this is looking at the executable's file name; if it contains the word "Setup", it is assumed that the executable is an installer, and a UAC prompt is displayed before the application starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/aa905117.aspx
|title=Understanding and Configuring User Account Control in Windows Vista
|accessdate=2007-03-15
|work=TechNet
|publisher=Microsoft
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:UAC also makes a distinction between elevation requests from a signed executable and an unsigned executable; and if the former, whether or not the publisher is 'Windows Vista'.  The color, icon, and wording of the prompts are different in each case: for example, attempting to convey a greater sense of warning if the executable is unsigned than if not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Applications using '''PolicyKit''' ask for specific privileges when prompting for authentication, and PolicyKit performs those actions on behalf of the application. Before authenticating, users are able to see which application requested the action and which action was requested.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64173">'''Research networking''' ('''RN''') is about using tools to identify, locate and use research and scholarly information about people and resources. '''Research networking tools''' ('''RN tools''') serve as [[knowledge management]] systems for the research enterprise. RN tools connect institution-level/enterprise systems, national research networks, publicly available research data (e.g., grants and publications), and restricted/proprietary data by harvesting information from disparate sources into compiled profiles for faculty, investigators, scholars, clinicians, community partners and facilities. RN tools facilitate collaboration and team science to address research challenges through the rapid discovery and recommendation of researchers, expertise and resources.&lt;ref name="F1000VIVO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istl.org/11-spring/article1.html|title=Faculty of 1000 and VIVO:  Invisible Colleges and Team Science - Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship|website=www.istl.org|access-date=2018-07-14|last=Carey |first=J |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fazel-Zarandi M, Devlin HJ, Huang Y and Contractor N (2011). "Expert recommendation based on social drivers, social network analysis, and semantic data representation". ''2nd International Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems''. pp. 41-48. (ACM, Chicago, IL)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
RN tools differ from [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as in that they access information in databases and other data not limited to web pages. They also differ from [[Social networking service|social networking]] systems in that they represent a compendium of data ingested from authoritative and verifiable sources rather than predominantly individually-posted information, making RN tools more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gewin | first1 = V |date =15 December 2010 | title = Collaboration: Social networking seeks critical mass | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7326/full/nj7326-993a.html | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue =7326 | pages = 993‚Äì4 |doi=10.1038/nj7326-993a }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, RN tools have sufficient flexibility to allow for profile editing.  RN tools provide resources to bolster human connections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Contractor | first1 = NS | last2 = Monge | first2 = PR |date=November 2002 | title = Managing knowledge networks | url =http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/16/2/249.extract | journal = Management Communication Quarterly | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 249‚Äì58  |doi=10.1177/089331802237238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they can make non-intuitive matches, do not depend on serendipity and do not have a propensity to return only to previously identified collaborations/collaborators.  RN tools generally have associated analytical capabilities that enable evaluation of collaboration and cross-disciplinary research/scholarly activity, especially over time. 

RN tools and research profiling systems can help researchers gain recognition. Active promotion of scholarship is an aspect of the publication cycle. Commercial and non-profit services help researchers increase visibility and recognition. Digital researcher services enhance discoverability, shareability and citability of scholarship. According to Shanks and Arlitsch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanks|first=Justin|last2=Arlitsch|first2=Kenning|date=2016-04-02|title=Making Sense of Researcher Services|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01930826.2016.1146534|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=56|issue=3|pages=295‚Äì316|doi=10.1080/01930826.2016.1146534|issn=0193-0826}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital researcher services fall into three categories: 

* Author/Researcher Identification‚Äîthese services provide infrastructure that may be used in the other two categories, such as unique identifiers and name disambiguation.
* Academic and Professional Networking‚Äîmost succinctly described as ‚Äúsocial networking for academics,‚Äù these services focus on connecting users based on research interest, affiliation, geography or other variables.
* Reference and Citation Management‚Äîthese tools and services include some of the functionality and features of other categories, although their primary focus is on management of citations that a researcher compiles for use within a publication or for sharing with other researchers.

Importantly, data harvested into RN tools can be repurposed, especially if available as [[Linked Open Data]] ([[RDF/XML|RDF]] triples). These RN tools enhance research support activities by providing data for customized, web pages, CV/biosketch generation and data tables for grant proposals.

== Users profiled, user interactivity and networking functionality ==

This table provides information on what user population is profiled for each tool, ability for users to edit their own profile data and type of networking.  Active networking means that the user can enter connections to the network by entering colleagues' names.  Passive networking means that the software infers network connections from a user's publication co-authors and builds a network from these names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7883">[[Spreadsheet]] is a class of [[application software]] design to analyze tabular data called "worksheets". A collection of worksheets is called a "workbook". [[Online spreadsheet]]s do not depend on a particular operating system but require a standards-compliant [[web browser]] instead. One of the incentives for the creation of online spreadsheets was offering worksheet sharing and public sharing or workbooks as part of their features which enables collaboration between multiple users. Some on-line spreadsheets provide remote data update, allowing data values to be extracted from other users' spreadsheets even though they may be inactive at the time.

'''Entering Heaven alive''' (called by various [[religion]]s "ascension", "assumption", or "[[Translation (Mormonism)|translation]]") is a belief held in various religions. Since [[death]] is the normal end to an individual's life on [[Earth]] and the beginning of [[afterlife]], entering [[Heaven]] without dying first is considered exceptional and usually a sign of a [[deity]]'s special recognition of the individual's [[piety]].

==Christianity==
[[File:5029-20080122-jerusalem-mt-olives-ascension-rock.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Ascension Rock, inside the [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)]], is said to bear the imprint of Jesus' right foot as he left earth and ascended into heaven.&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{See also|Ascension of Jesus|Rapture|Biblical cosmology}}

Unlike the other entries in this article, this paragraph does not, in the view of most Christians, relate to "entering Heaven alive". Jesus is considered by the vast majority of Christians to have died before being resurrected and ascending to heaven. In regard to his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] considers her to have died prior to being assumed (translated) into heaven. In like manner, [[Roman Catholicism]] affirms that Mary, the mother of Jesus, suffered death prior to her assumption which has been "expressly affirmed in the Liturgy of the Church" and is expressly seen in paragraph 20 of the proclamation of this teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, Ludwig Ott, Book III, Pt. 3, Ch. 2, ¬ß6, {{ISBN|0-89555-009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XII / Munificentissimus Deus / Defining the Dogma of the Assumption |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Protestantism]] generally believes that [[Protestant views on Mary|Mary]] died a natural death like any other human being and was not subsequently assumed into heaven, although the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition of [[Anglicanism]] often affirms the assumption.

Most Christians believe [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus did initially die]], but was then [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected from the dead by God]], before being [[Ascension of Jesus|raised bodily to heaven]] to [[Session of Christ|sit]] at the [[Right Hand of God]] with a promise to someday [[Second Coming|return to earth]]. The minority views that Jesus didn't die are known as the [[Swoon hypothesis]] and [[Docetism]]. 

Since the adoption of the [[Nicene Creed]] in 325, the [[Ascension of Jesus]] into heaven, as related in the [[New Testament]], has been officially taught by all orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and is celebrated on [[Ascension Thursday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Ascension of the Lord is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the Ascension is one of twelve [[Great Feasts]].

In the Reformed churches' tradition of [[Calvinism]], belief in the ascension of Christ is included in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] and the [[Second Helvetic Confession]]."&lt;ref name=gr&gt;Quotations as cited by Redman, Gary, article/Web page titled [http://debate.org.uk/topics/theo/states_christ_03.html "A Comparison of the Biblical and Islamic Views of the States of Christ]/ Part 2: The State of Exaltation", at "The Muslim-Christian Debate Website". Retrieved March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Rapture" is a reference to "being caught up" as found in [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 4:17, when the "dead in Christ" and "we who are alive and remain" will be caught up in the clouds to meet the [[The Lord|Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Thess|4:16‚Äì17|NKJV}} "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of entering Heaven alive is mentioned in the Old Testament: the prophet [[Elijah]] and the patriarch [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], son of Jared and ancestor of Noah.

===Catholicism===
{{Main|Assumption of Mary}}
The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between "The Ascension", in which Christ rose to heaven by his own power, and "The Assumption" in which [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was raised to heaven by God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/0506-96/Article6.html |last=Brumley |first=Mark, |title=Mary's Assumption: Irrelevant or Irreverent? |publisher=Catholic.net |accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and [[Elijah]] are said in scripture to have been "assumed" [experienced assumption]{{clarification needed|date=April 2017}} into heaven.)

On November 1, 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]], acting ''[[ex cathedra]]'', issued ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'', an authoritative statement of official doctrine of [[Roman Catholicism]]. In Section 44 the pope stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XII / Munificentissimus Deus / Defining the Dogma of the Assumption |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.}}

The doctrine is based on [[Sacred Tradition]] that [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was bodily assumed into heaven. For centuries before that, [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary in art|the assumption was celebrated in art]]. The proclamation states that Mary suffered bodily death before being assumed into Heaven. Some theologians{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} have argued that Mary didn't die, but this is contrary to the text of the dogma's proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/0506-96/Article6.html |last=Brumley |first=Mark |title=Mary's Assumption: Irrelevant or Irreverent?|publisher=Catholic.net |accessdate= March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Christianity===
[[File:Theofanus uspenie.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] (1392, [[Theophan the Greek]]).]]
{{Main|Dormition of the Mother of God}}
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] teaches that three other persons were taken bodily into heaven: [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Elijah]] (Elias) and the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary). Similar to the Western "Assumption" of Mary, the Orthodox celebrate the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] on August 15. Unlike Western uncertainty about Mary's physical death, the Orthodox teach that Mary died a natural death like any other human being, that she was buried by the [[Apostles]] (except for [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], who was late), and three days later (after Thomas had arrived) was found to be missing from her tomb. The church teaches that the Apostles received a revelation during which the Theotokos appeared to them and told them she had been resurrected by Jesus and taken body and soul into heaven. The Orthodox teach that Mary already enjoys the fullness of heavenly bliss that the other saints will experience only after the [[Last Judgment]].

There is a teaching among the Orthodox that the "[[Two Witnesses]]" referred to in the [[Book of Revelation]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|11:3‚Äì13}} are Enoch and Elijah,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} who will be sent back to earth to preach the Gospel in the time of [[apostasy]], and will be the last Christian [[martyr]]s before the [[Second Coming]]. According to Revelation, they will be resurrected and ascend again to heaven.

She believed that she could create for herself a new kind of ‚Äúlight body‚Äù. However, she died and was cremated.

==Islam==
[[File:Jerusalem Dome of the rock BW 3.JPG|thumb|right|The Dome of the Rock]]
{{See also|Kitab al-Miraj}}
Islamic teaching states that [[Muhammad]] ascended into heaven alive at the site of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. However, this ascent was temporary and he came back to Earth. It is ascribed to the exact descriptions presented in both the Quran and the [[Hadith]].

Islamic texts deny the idea of crucifixion or death attributed to [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] by the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Shafaat, Dr. Ahmad, [http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm Islamic View of the Coming/Return of Jesus"] article dated May 2003, at the ''Islamic Perspectives'' Web site: "In 4:159, after denying that the Jews killed or crucified Jesus and after stating that God raised him to Himself, the Qur`an says ...". Retrieved March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] states that people (i.e., the Jews and Romans) sought to kill Jesus, but they could not crucify or kill him, although "this was made to appear to them". Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead he was raised by God unto the heavens. This "raising" is often understood to mean through bodily ascension.

Some Islamic scholars have identified the prophet [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] to be the same person as [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] from the Bible. This is because the Qu'ran states that God "raised him to a lofty station", and that has been taken to be a term for ascending, upon which it is concluded that "Idris" was "Enoch".

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew bible the word for "heavens" is ''[[Heaven in Judaism|shamayim]]''. This is plural - it means "heavens", not "heaven" - but seems nevertheless to have a singular meaning: i.e., the older parts of the bible speak of "heavens" in the plural but evidence for a belief in more than one heaven from the bible is lacking. Shamayim also meant "sky", the atmosphere, as it does in modern English. The blue dome of the sky was called the ''[[Firmament|raqia]]'', and was believed to be a solid shield between the atmosphere and the true heaven where God lived.{{dubious|date=December 2016}} Heaven was the realm of God, earth of mankind, and the [[underworld]] was for the dead, and travel between them was generally impossible, although God and his messengers frequently appear on earth and the dead can be summoned up from the underworld as the [[Witch of Endor]] summons the shade of Samuel.

There are two possible exceptions to this general rule that humans could not go to heaven, Enoch and Elijah, but neither is clear. The [[Book of Genesis]] mentions [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as one who "was no more" because "God took him", but it does not explicitly say whether he was alive or dead, and it does not say where God took him. The [[Books of Kings]] describes the prophet [[Elijah]] being taken towards "shamayim" in a whirlwind, but the word can mean both heaven as the abode of God, or the sky (as the word "heavens" does in modern English), and so again the text is ambiguous.

According to the post-biblical [[Jewish]] [[Midrash]], eight people went to heaven (also referred to as the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Paradise]]) alive:&lt;ref&gt;''Derekh Erez Zuta'' (post-Talmudic tractate) cited in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' New York 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroastrianism==
It is believed in [[Zoroastrianism]] that the [[Peshotanu]] was taken up into Heaven alive{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and will someday return as the Zoroastrian [[Saoshyant|messiah]].

==Ascended Master Teachings==
Members of various [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[New Age]] religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], believe that [[Francis Bacon]] underwent a physical Ascension without experiencing death (he then became the deity [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]]). They also believe numerous others have undergone Ascension; they are called the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] and are worshipped in this group of religions. The leaders of these religions claim to be able to receive [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channeled messages]] from the Ascended Masters, which they then relay to their followers.&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

==Fictional portrayals==
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', those who ascended to heaven alive included [[Melchizedek]], [[Frederick Barbarossa]], [[King Arthur]] and [[Elwin Ransom]].
* In C. S. Lewis's ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', [[Reepicheep]] the Mouse is permitted to travel into [[Aslan's Country]] while alive. He is next seen in ''[[The Last Battle]]'' where he is the first to greet the protagonists when they arrive at Aslan's Country.
* In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth legendarium]], Elves who grow weary of life in [[Middle-earth]] may sail west to the [[Undying Lands]]. A few mortals also follow this route, including [[E√§rendil]], the [[Ring-bearers]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Frodo Baggins]], and [[Sam Gamgee]], and the Dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]].
* In the [[fictional universe]] of the ''[[Stargate]]'' franchise, the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], have learned how to "ascend" from the physical plane and have [[Ascension (Stargate)|moved on to a higher plane of existence]].
* In [[Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', Remedios the Beauty, is said to be the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, who unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally handicapped. However, Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a believes she has inherited great lucidity: "It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war", he said. She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon in the 4pm sun, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.

"'''Foggy Dew'''" or "'''Foggy, Foggy Dew'''" is an English [[Folk music|folk song]]. The song describes the outcome of an affair between a young weaver and a girl he courted for some time. She initially comes to his bed because she is afraid of the "foggy, foggy dew" but it seems she often returned. Early versions of the song refer to her fear of the "[[Bogeyman|bugaboo]]" rather than the foggy dew.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Cohen, ''Folk Music: A Regional Exploration'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; It is cataloged as [[George Malcolm Laws|Laws]] No. O03 and [[Roud Folk Song Index]] No. 558.

=="Foggy, Foggy Dew"==
The song is a lamentful ballad of a lover. It was published on a [[broadside (music)|broadside]] around 1815, though there are very many versions:  [[Cecil Sharp]] collected eight versions.&lt;ref name=the&gt;[http://www.mysongbook.de/msb/songs/f/foggydw1.html The Foggy Dew]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Burl Ives]], who popularized the song in the United States in the 1940s, claimed that a version dated to [[colonial America]], and he was once jailed in [[Mona, Utah]], for singing it in public, when authorities deemed it a bawdy song.&lt;ref&gt;Burl Ives (1948). ''The Wayfarying Stranger''. New York: Whittlesey House,  pp. 129-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[BBC Radio]] likewise restricted broadcast of the song to programmes covering folk tunes or the works of [[Benjamin Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Russell Davies|author=Russell Davies|publisher=BBC Radio 2|date=21 September 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/davies/|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tune is a late 18th or early 19th century revision of "When I First Came to Court", licensed in 1689.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

''Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew.''

''One night she came to my bedside''&lt;br/&gt;
''When I was fast asleep.''&lt;br/&gt;
''She laid her head upon my bed''&lt;br/&gt;
''And she began to weep.''&lt;br/&gt;
''She sighed, she cried, she damn near died''&lt;br/&gt;
''She said what shall I do?''&lt;br/&gt;
''So I hauled her into bed and covered up her head''&lt;br/&gt;
''Just to keep her from the foggy foggy dew.''

''So, I am a bachelor, I live with my son''&lt;br/&gt;
''And we work at the weaver's trade.''&lt;br/&gt;
''And every single time that I look into his eyes''&lt;br/&gt;
''He reminds me of that fair young maid.''&lt;br/&gt;
''He reminds me of the wintertime''&lt;br/&gt;
''And of the summer, too,''&lt;br/&gt;
''And of the many, many times that I held her in my arms''&lt;br/&gt;
''Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy, dew.''&lt;ref&gt;Version from ''Folksongs'' Arr. [[Benjamin Britten]], Perf. [[Peter Pears]], London Records&lt;/ref&gt;

A further verse, generally used as the penultimate one, is:

''Twas in the first part of the night''&lt;br/&gt;
''That we did sport and play''&lt;br/&gt;
''And in the second part of the night''&lt;br/&gt;
''She in my arms did lay''&lt;br/&gt;
''When morning came, she said to me''&lt;br/&gt;
''Oh sir, I am undone.''&lt;br/&gt;
''Oh hold your row, you silly young gal&lt;br&gt;
''The foggy dew is gone''.&lt;br&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32529">The '''Forbes Global 2000''' is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 [[public companies]] in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: [[sales]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], [[asset]]s and [[Market capitalization|market value]].{{r|method}} The list has been published since 2003.

The Forbes Global 2000 is a useful indicator of which are the leading public companies in the world, but it is only an interpretation, as only public companies are listed. The results are not definitive; any change to the criteria would produce a different list.

==2018 list==
In 2018, the ten largest companies as calculated by this method were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#e1cb533335d8|title=Global 2000: The World‚Äôs Largest Public Companies|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Integrated Authority File''' ({{lang-de|Gemeinsame Normdatei}}; also known as the ''Universal Authority File'') or '''GND''' is an international [[authority file]] for the organisation of personal names, subject headings and corporate bodies from [[Library catalog|catalogues]]. It is used mainly for [[documentation]] in [[library|libraries]] and increasingly also by [[archive]]s and [[museum]]s. The GND is managed by the [[German National Library]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Nationalbibliothek|links=no}}; DNB) in cooperation with various regional library networks in [[German-speaking Europe]] and other partners. The GND falls under the [[CC0|Creative Commons Zero]] (CC0) licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnb.de/EN/Standardisierung/GND/gnd.html Integrated Authority File (GND)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GND specification provides a hierarchy of high-level entities and sub-classes, useful in [[library classification]], and an approach to unambiguous identification of single elements. It also comprises an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] intended for [[knowledge representation]] in the [[semantic web]], available in the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd GND Ontology ‚Äì Namespace Document] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103070757/http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd |date=2013-01-03}}, version 2012-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Integrated Authority File became operational in April 2012 and integrates the content of the following authority files, which have since been discontinued:
* [[Name Authority File]] ({{lang-de|Personennamendatei|links=no}}; PND)
* [[Corporate Bodies Authority File]] ({{lang-de|Gemeinsame K√∂rperschaftsdatei|links=no}}; GKD)
* [[Subject Headings Authority File]] ({{lang-de|Schlagwortnormdatei|links=no}}; SWD)
* Uniform Title File of the Deutsches Musikarchiv ({{lang-de|Einheitssachtitel-Datei des Deutschen Musikarchivs|links=no}}; DMA-EST)

At the time of its introduction on 5 April 2012, the GND held 9,493,860 files, including 2,650,000 personalised names.

==Types of GND high-level entities==
There are seven main types of GND entities:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnb.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/DNB/standardisierung/entitaetencodierung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile  Entit√§tencodierung: Vergaberichtlinien] (short lists ‚Äì old and new versions)&lt;/ref&gt;

[Accessed: 22-Feb-2018].&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of this qualification is for these individuals to receive PCI DSS training so that their qualifying organization has a better understanding of PCI DSS and how it impacts their company.  Becoming an ISA can improve the relationship with [[Qualified Security Assessor]]'s and support the consistent and proper application of PCI DSS measures and controls within the organization.  The PCI SSC's secure portal can be used to verify ISA employee's.&lt;ref&gt;[1]‚ÄúOfficial PCI Security Standards Council Site - Verify PCI Compliance, Download Data Security and Credit Card Security Standards.‚Äù [Online]. Available: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/internal_security_assessors. [Accessed: 22-Feb-2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

An ISA is also able to perform self-assessments for their organization as long as they are not a Level 1 merchant &lt;ref&gt;[1]‚ÄúCan a PCI Internal Security Assessor validate level 1 merchants?,‚Äù SearchSecurity. [Online]. Available: http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/Can-a-PCI-Internal-Security-Assessor-validate-level-1-merchants. [Accessed: 22-Feb-2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

ISA training is only available for merchants and processors.&lt;ref&gt;[1]‚ÄúAvoid Paying For PCI Certification You Don‚Äôt Need | FierceRetail.‚Äù [Online]. Available: https://www.fierceretail.com/operations/avoid-paying-for-pci-certification-you-don-t-need. [Accessed: 23-Feb-2018].&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations are required to have an internal audit department and cannot be affiliated with a [[Qualified Security Assessor]] or Automated Scanning Vendor (ASV) company in any way.

== Certificate Renewal ==
The ISA certification must be renewed annually.  The ISA certification is company specific.  If the certified individual leaves the company that sponsored them, the certification is no longer valid &lt;ref&gt;[1]J. Vijayan, ‚ÄúPCI council launches certification program for IT staff,‚Äù Computerworld, 30-Apr-2010. [Online]. Available: https://www.computerworld.com/article/2517837/security0/pci-council-launches-certification-program-for-it-staff.html. [Accessed: 22-Feb-2018].&lt;/ref&gt;  The good news is you are no longer required to complete the onsite training.  Requalifying ISA Training currently costs $1,095.  This includes training modules and the exam.  Once an individual successfully completes the exam they will receive their renewed Certificate of Qualification.

The '''Latona Fountain''' in the [[Gardens of Versailles]] lies in the Latona Basin between the [[Chateau de Versailles]] and the [[Gardens of Versailles|Grand Canal]]. On the top tier, there is a statue of the [[goddess]] [[Latona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iledefrance.ca/versailles/basinlatona.html Latona Fountain]&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain operates three times a week during the high season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chateauversaillesspectacles.fr/spectacle.php?spe=1&amp;lang=eng Musical fountains show], chateauversaillesspectacles.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The [[fountain]] is [[Wedding cake|wedding-cake]] style, designed by [[Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy|Balthazar Marsy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iledefrance.ca/versailles/basinlatona.html Latona Fountain]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the goddess Latona are her children, [[Apollo]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The second and third tiers of the fountain have frogs (see next section), while the lowest tier has turtles and alligators.

==Myth==

Latona turned the [[Lyceum|Lycean]] [[peasant]]s into frogs when they refused to give her water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaeltaylor.ca/Culture/herr07.shtml Herrenchiemsee Photos] Latona Fountain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The Latona Fountain has been cited as inspiration for [[Buckingham Fountain]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buckingham Fountain|url=http://www.cpdit01.com/resources/buckingham_fountain.cfm|publisher=Chicago Park District|accessdate=15 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122220315/http://cpdit01.com/resources/buckingham_fountain.cfm|archivedate=22 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lingoes''' is a [[single-click]] [[multi-lingual]] translation software program released as a [[freeware]] translation utility. '''Lingoes''' is often compared to [[Babylon (program)|Babylon]] dictionary&lt;ref name= "Customer comparison to Babylon1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lingoes 2.5.3 beta - On- und Offline-W√∂rterbuch f√ºr 80 Sprachen (in German) (Eng:Lingoes 2.5.3 beta -On- and Offline-dictionary for 80 languages) (a forum thread at www.essential-freebies.de)|url=http://www.essential-freebies.de/board/viewtopic.php?t=12629|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to similarities in the [[GUI]], same functionalities and most importantly being [[free of charge]]. Lingoes could be installed in Windows 32/64 or used as portable application.

==Features and expandability==
Lingoes has the ability to add new dictionaries and encyclopedias to widen its usability. Online encyclopedias like ''[[Wikipedia|Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]],'' and ''[[Baidu Baike]]'' as well as leading dictionaries like ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'', ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'', ''[[WordNet]]'', ''MacMillan English Dictionary'',''Collins COBUILD Advanced Learner's English Dictionary'' and many other cross-English dictionaries i.e. Arabic, Armenian, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish (more over 80 languages as stated in Lingoes' official website).&lt;ref name = Languages&gt;{{cite web|title=Lingoes official website|url=http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/index.html|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lingoes Popup.JPG|thumb|right|'''Lingoes''' in action showing a popup translation window with Essential dictionary and Longman's Dictionary installed running under [[Windows XP]] desktop.]]
[[Image:Lingoes Appendices.JPG|thumb|right|'''Lingoes''' in action showing the Appendices configuration window running under [[Windows XP]] desktop.]]
Additional tools, termed as appendices in the program, include a [[currency converter]], weights and measure units converter, international time zones converter, plus the [[periodic table of elements]], a scientific calculator, [[Traditional Chinese]] &amp; [[Simplified Chinese]] conversion utility, Base64 encode / decode utility, ([[MD4]], [[MD5]] and [[SHA-1]] [[algorithms]]) and many other tools that can be added through the website.

The program has the ability to pronounce words and install additional [[text-to-speech engine]]s available for download also through Lingoes' website.

Lingoes also offers a whole-text translation ability using online translation service providers like [[Google Translate]], [[Babel Fish (website)|Yahoo! Babel Fish Translation]], [[SYSTRAN]], Cross Language, Click2Translate and others.
Lingoes also offers various ways to translate a text, for examples, via a mouse-over, or by bouble clicking the selected text, options not available with Babylon pro.

==Criticism==
*The use of dictionary brand names like Oxford's, Longman's, Cambridge's, Merriam-Webster's, Collin's and others without any reference in Lingoes' website to the legitimacy of this use is suspicious of an illegal act{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.
*Lingoes lacks the ability for auto-correction of misspelled words or offering suggestions{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

The '''National Museum of the American Indian''' is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is committed to advancing knowledge and understanding of the Native cultures of the Western Hemisphere‚Äîpast, present, and future‚Äîthrough partnership with Native people and others. The museum works to support the continuance of culture, traditional values, and transitions in contemporary Native life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/about/mission/|title=Mission Statement {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|website=nmai.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705142316/http://www.nmai.si.edu/about/mission/|archivedate=July 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has three facilities: the National Museum of the American Indian on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which opened on September 21, 2004, on Fourth Street and [[Independence Avenue (Washington D.C.)|Independence Avenue]], Southwest; [[the George Gustav Heye Center]], a permanent museum in [[New York City]]; and the Cultural Resources Center, a research and collections facility in [[Suitland, Maryland]].  The foundations for the present collections were first assembled in the former '''Museum of the American Indian''' in New York City, which was established in 1916, and which became part of the Smithsonian in 1990.

==History==
Following controversy over the discovery by [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] leaders that the Smithsonian Institution held more than 12,000‚Äì18,000 Indian remains, mostly in storage, [[United States Senator]] [[Daniel Inouye]] introduced in 1989 the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Indian Affairs, Daniel L. Fixico, Page 161&lt;/ref&gt; Passed as Public Law 101-185, it established the National Museum of the American Indian as "a living memorial to Native Americans and their traditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthropology.si.edu/repatriation/pdf/nmai_act.pdf | title=National Museum of the American Indian Act, Public Law 101-185 | publisher=101st Congress | date=November 28, 1989 | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120518101548/http://anthropology.si.edu/repatriation/pdf/nmai_act.pdf | archivedate=May 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also required that human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony be considered for repatriation to tribal communities, as well as objects acquired illegally. Since 1989 the Smithsonian has repatriated over 5,000 individual remains ‚Äì about 1/3 of the total estimated human remains in its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-515 | title=Much Work Still Needed to Identify and Repatriate Indian Human Remains and Objects | publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office | date=May 25, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | author=Mittal, Anu | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106001323/http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-515 | archivedate=January 6, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2004, for the inauguration of the Museum, Senator Inouye addressed an audience of around 20,000 [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]] and [[Native Hawaiians]], which was the largest gathering in Washington D.C. of indigenous people to its time.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Liz. [http://www.americanindianmagazine.org/story/warrior-chief-among-warriors "A Warrior Chief Among Warriors: Remembering U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517151736/http://www.americanindianmagazine.org/story/warrior-chief-among-warriors |date=May 17, 2014 }} ''American Indian'' (Spring 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the museum brought together the collections of the [[George Gustav Heye Center]] in [[New York City]], founded in 1922, and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

The Heye collection became part of the Smithsonian in June 1990, and represents approximately 85% of the holdings of the NMAI. The Heye Collection was formerly displayed in the Audubon Terrace location, but had long been seeking a new building.

The Museum of the American Indian considered options of merging with the Museum of Natural History, accepting a large donation from [[Ross Perot]] to be housed in a new museum building to be built in Dallas, or moving to the U.S. Customs House. The Heye Trust included a restriction requiring the collection to be displayed in New York City, and moving the collection to a Museum outside of New York aroused substantial opposition from New York politicians. The current arrangement represented a political compromise between those who wished to keep the Heye Collection in New York, and those who wanted it to be part of the new NMAI in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;"The Indian Museum's last Stand", ''New York Times'', November 27, 1988, accessed via Lexis/Nexis, February 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The NMAI was initially housed in lower Manhattan at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, which was refurbished for this purpose and remains an exhibition site; its building on the Mall in Washington, DC opened in 2005.

==Locations==

The museum of American Indian has three branches: National Museum of the American Indian in the National Mall (Washington, D.C.), George Gustav Heye Center in New York City, and the [[Cultural Resources Center]] in Maryland.

===National Mall (Washington, D.C.)===
[[File:Museum of the American Indian DC 2007.jpg|thumb|right|275px|National Museum of the American Indian seen from the north]]
The site on the [[National Mall]] opened in September 2004. Fifteen years in the making, it is the first national museum in the country dedicated exclusively to Native Americans. The five-story, {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}}, curvilinear building is clad in a golden-colored [[Kasota limestone]] designed to evoke natural rock formations shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.

The museum is set in a {{convert|4.25|acre|m2}}-site and is surrounded by simulated [[wetland]]s. The museum's east-facing entrance, its prism window and its {{convert|120|ft|m|0|adj=on}} high space for contemporary Native performances are direct results of extensive consultations with Native peoples. Similar to the [[The George Gustav Heye Center|Heye Center]] in Lower Manhattan, the museum offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs, public programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.

The museum's [[architect]] and project designer is [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Douglas Cardinal]] ([[Blackfoot]]); its design architects are [[GBQC]] Architects of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and architect Johnpaul Jones ([[Cherokee]]/[[Choctaw]]). Disagreements during construction led to Cardinal's being removed from the project, but the building retains his original design intent. He provided continued input during the museum's construction. The structural engineering firm chosen for this project was [[Severud Associates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cement.org/concrete-basics/buildings-structures/case-histories/cultural-buildings/national-museum-of-the-american-indian|title=404 Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.cement.org|accessdate=May 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030202932/http://www.cement.org/concrete-basics/buildings-structures/case-histories/cultural-buildings/national-museum-of-the-american-indian|archivedate=October 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Interior of the National Museum of the American Indian.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior view looking down toward the entrance]]

The museum's project architects are Jones &amp; Jones Architects and Landscape Architects Ltd. of [[Seattle]] and SmithGroup of Washington, D.C., in association with Lou Weller ([[Caddo]]), the Native American Design Collaborative, and [[James Polshek|Polshek Partnership Architects]] of [[New York City]]; Ramona Sakiestewa ([[Hopi]]) and Donna House ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]/[[Oneida tribe|Oneida]]) also served as design consultants. The landscape architects are Jones &amp; Jones Architects and Landscape Architects Ltd. of Seattle and EDAW, Inc., of [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

[[File:Museum of the American Indian DC 2007 005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Waterfall with the rocks]]

In general, Native Americans have filled the leadership roles in the design and operation of the museum and have aimed at creating a different atmosphere and experience from museums of European and Euro-American culture. Donna E. House, the Navajo and Oneida botanist who supervised the landscaping, has said, "The landscape flows into the building, and the environment is who we are. We are the trees, we are the rocks, we are the water. And that had to be part of the museum."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hayden, "By the People", ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'', September 2004, pp. 50‚Äì57.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme of organic flow is reflected by the interior of the museum, whose walls are mostly curving surfaces, with almost no sharp corners.

The Mitsitam Native Foods Cafe is divided into Native regional sections such as the Northern Woodlands, South America, the Northwest Coast, Meso-America, and the Great Plains; The museum has published a ''Mitisam Cafe Cookbook.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mitsitam Cafe cookbook : recipes from the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian | publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian | author=Hetzler, Richard | location=Washington, D.C. | isbn=978-1-55591-747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Native American groups not represented in the caf√© are the south eastern tribes such as the [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Cherokee]] and [[Seminole]], many of which supported the United States throughout the tribes' histories.{{clear left}}

===George Gustav Heye Center (New York City)===
[[File:National Museum of the American Indian, New York 11.jpg|thumb|National Museum of the American Indian main entrance]]

[[File:US Custom House, June 2000.JPG|thumb|right|192px|The [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]], site of the [[George Gustav Heye Center]]]]
[[George Gustav Heye]] (1874‚Äì1957) traveled throughout North and South America collecting native objects. His collection was assembled over 54 years, beginning in 1903. He started the Museum of the American Indian and his Heye Foundation in 1916. The Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian opened to the public on [[Audubon Terrace]] in New York City in 1922.

The museum at [[Audubon Terrace]] closed in 1994 and part of the collection is now housed at The Museum's [[George Gustav Heye Center]], that occupies two floors of the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]]-style building, designed by architect [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1907. It is a designated [[National Historic Landmark]] and a New York City landmark. The center's exhibition and public access areas total about {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|-3}}. The Heye Center offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.

===Cultural Resources Center (Maryland)===
In [[Suitland, Maryland]], the National Museum of the American Indian operates the Cultural Resources Center, an enormous, [[Nautilus (genus)|nautilus]]-shaped building which houses the collection, a library, and the photo archives. The Cultural Resources Center opened in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lonteree|first1=Amy|last2=Cobb|first2=Amanda|author3=Ira Jacknis|authorlink1=A New Thing?: The National Museum of the American Indian in Historical and Institutional Context|title=The National Museum of the American Indian: Critical Conversations|date=November 1, 2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=3‚Äì31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
The National Museum of the American Indian is home to the collection of the former Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The collection includes more than 800,000 objects, as well as a photographic archive of 125,000 images. It is divided into the following areas: [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Northwestern Amazon|Amazon]]; [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Andes|Andes]]; [[Inuit|Arctic]]/[[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic|Subarctic]]; [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|California]]/[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Great Basin|Great Basin]]; Contemporary Art; [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]]/[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Caribbean|Caribbean]]; [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]; [[Patagonia]]; [[Plains Indians|Plains]]/[[Plateau tribes|Plateau]]; [[Northeastern Woodlands tribes|Woodlands]].

[[File:VOALogueHorse480diffangle.jpg|thumb|325px|Representation of Crow horse regalia, ca. 1880s with [[cradleboard]] on exhibit at NMAI]]

The collection, which became part of the Smithsonian in June 1990, was assembled by [[George Gustav Heye]] (1874‚Äì1957) during a 54-year period, beginning in 1903. He traveled throughout North and South America collecting Native objects.  Heye used his collection to found New York's Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation and directed it until his death in 1957. The Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian opened to the public in New York City in 1922.

The collection is not subject to the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]]. When the National Museum was created in 1989, a law governing repatriation was drafted specifically for the museum, the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]], upon which NAGPRA was modeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmnh.si.edu/anthro/repatriation/faq/index.htm#general04|title=NMNH ‚Äì Repatriation Office ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=May 4, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502051725/http://www.nmnh.si.edu/anthro/repatriation/faq/index.htm#general04|archivedate=May 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to repatriation, the museum dialogues with tribal communities regarding the appropriate curation of cultural heritage items. For example, the human remains vault is smudged once a week with tobacco, sage, sweetgrass, and cedar, and sacred Crow objects in the Plains vault are smudged with sage during the full moon. If the appropriate cultural tradition for curating an object is unknown, the Native staff uses their own cultural knowledge and customs to treat materials as respectfully as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCAEh7hmwMQC | title=Liberating Culture: Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Museums, Curation, and Heritage Preservation | publisher=Psychology Press | date=2003 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Kreps, Christina Faye | pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has programs in which Native American scholars and artists can view NMAI's collections to enhance their own research and artwork.

===Nation to Nation:Treaties===
In 2014 NMAI opened  a new exhibition ''Nation to Nation: Treaties,'' curated by Indian rights activist [[Suzan Shown Harjo]].&lt;ref name=McGlone/&gt; The exhibit is built around the [[Two Row Wampum Treaty]], known from both Indian oral tradition and a written document that some believe is a modern forgery.&lt;ref name=PostStandAug12&gt;{{cite news|last=Coin|first=Glenn|title=400 years later, a legendary Iroquois treaty comes under attack|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/400_years_later_a_legendary_ir.html|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=The Post-Standard|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | last = Hermkens  | first = Harrie   |author2=Noordegraaf, Jan |author3=Sijs, Nicolien van der   | title = Tawagonshi-verdrag is vervalst (Tawagonshi-treaty has been forged)  | publisher = Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam   | year = 2013   | url = http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/handle/1871/39593 | format = PDF   | accessdate = 2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sijs, Nicolien van der (2009) ''Cookies, coleslaw, and Stoops.

==Reception==
The National Museum of the American Indian has been criticized occasionally for a perceived disjointedness of its exhibits. Two ''[[Washington Post]]'' reviews on the museum were hostile at the representation of the American Indian. Two writers, Fisher and Richard, expressed "irritation and frustration at the cognitive dissonance they experienced once inside the museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Museum of the American Indian: Critical Conversations|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|date=2008|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher expected the displays that depicted the clash between foreign colonists and the native people. The exhibit lacked a trace of Indians' evolution from centuries of life on this land, and gave little information as to the history of their survival. He concludes, "The museum feels like a [[trade show]] in which each group of Indians gets space to sell its founding myth and favorite anecdotes of survival. Each room is a sales booth of its own, separate, out of context, gathered in a museum that adds to the balkanization of a society that seems ever more ashamed of the unity and purpose that sustained it over two centuries".&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of the American Indian: Critical Conversations, University of Nebraska Press, 2008, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; Richards, who also had a similar assessment of the NMAI, begins his criticism by observing that he found the exhibits to be confusing and unclearly marked. To him, the exhibits were full with a mixture of "[[totem pole]]s and T-shirts, headdresses and masks, toys and woven baskets, projectile points and gym shoes".&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of the American Indian: Critical Conversations, University of Nebraska Press, 2008, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the items were presented in a hodgepodge that displayed history in an incoherent demonstration.

[[Edward Rothstein]] described the NMAI as an "identity museum"  that "jettisons Western scholarship and tells its own story, leading one tribe to solemnly describe its earliest historical milestone: "Birds teach people to call for rain";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/arts/design/29identity.html?ref=nationalmuseumoftheamericanindian |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505003608/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/arts/design/29identity.html?ref=nationalmuseumoftheamericanindian |archivedate=May 5, 2018 |df=mdy-all }} To Each His Own Museum, As Identity Goes on Display, Edward Rothstein, New York Times, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, [[Diana Muir]] accused the curators of going "with verve and confidence to a place where subjective personal narrative is privileged above factual evidence, and the deliberate myth-making of an active national revival trumps scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/pubid.413/pub_detail.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929061044/http://www.claremont.org/publications/pubid.413/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }} National Myth of the American Indian, Diana Muir, Claremont Review, March 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendance===
Attendance is low, compared to other museums on the Mall. Although the museum had 2.4 million visitors the year it opened, it has averaged only 1.4 million in the years since and is said to be "best known" for its cafeteria.&lt;ref name=McGlone&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGlone|first1=Peggy|title=National Museum of the American Indian uses a new exhibit to spread its message|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/national-museum-of-the-american-indian-uses-a-new-exhibit-to-spread-its-message/2014/10/01/18f0090e-44f1-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html|accessdate=8 October 2015|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=3 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016113214/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/national-museum-of-the-american-indian-uses-a-new-exhibit-to-spread-its-message/2014/10/01/18f0090e-44f1-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html|archivedate=October 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Washington Post]] described it in 2015 as "remarkably empty" of visitors and attributed this to exhibits that feel "disjointed and incomplete."&lt;ref name=McGlone/&gt;

==Directors==
[[Kevin Gover]] is the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian as of December 2, 2007. He is a former professor of law at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at [[Arizona State University]] in Tempe, an affiliate professor in its American Indian Studies Program and co-executive director of the university's American Indian Policy Institute. Gover, 52, grew up in Oklahoma and is a member of the [[Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma]] and of [[Comanche]] descent. He received his bachelor's degree in public and international affairs from Princeton University and his law degree from the University of New Mexico. He was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from Princeton University in 2001.&lt;ref name="gover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/about/bios/kevin-gover |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909024706/http://newsdesk.si.edu/about/bios/kevin-gover |archivedate=September 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.

Gover succeeds [[W. Richard West Jr.]] ([[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Southern Cheyenne]]), who was the founding director of the National Museum of the American Indian (1990‚Äì2007).&lt;ref name=gover/&gt;

West was strongly criticized in 2007 for having spent $250,000 on travel in four years and being away from the museum frequently on overseas travel. This was official travel funded by the Smithsonian,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702515.html?hpid=topnews "Museum Director Spent Lavishly on Travel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006062259/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702515.html?hpid=topnews |date=October 6, 2017 }}, ''Washington Post'', December 27, 2007, accessed August 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and many within the Native American community offered defenses of West and his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Apodaca]], "Under West's wing, NMAI made history," ''[[Indian Country Today]]'' (January 18, 2008), http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28404104.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/arts/design/21smit.html|title=Kevin Gover - National Museum of the American Indian - Smithsonian|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006113450/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/arts/design/21smit.html|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pa√ßo de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o''' ({{IPA-pt|Ààpasu d íi s…êÃÉw k…æi ÉÀàt…îv…êÃÉw}}, {{lang-en|Palace of Saint Christopher}}; also known as '''Pal√°cio Imperial''' or '''Pal√°cio Imperial de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o''') was an [[royal palace|imperial palace]] located in the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]] park in the [[Imperial de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o|Imperial Neighbourhood of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It served as residence to the [[House of Braganza|Portuguese Royal Family]] and later to the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] until 1889, when the country became a republic through a [[coup d'√©tat]] deposing [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. Then, the palace briefly served as a public building by the [[First Brazilian Republic|provisional government]] for the constituent assembly of the first republican constitution. It housed the major part (92.5%) of the collection of the [[National Museum of Brazil]], which, together with the building, were [[National Museum of Brazil fire|largely destroyed by a fire]] on 2 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/09/news-museu-nacional-fire-rio-de-janeiro-natural-history/ |title=Museu Nacional Fire in Rio de Janeiro Natural History |format= |work=G1 |accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2018/09/02/incendio-atinge-a-quinta-da-boa-vista-rio.ghtml |title=Inc√™ndio de grandes propor√ß√µes destr√≥i o Museu Nacional, na Quinta da Boa Vista |format= |work=G1 |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
===Background===

In the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th]] centuries, the area where the Palace is currently located, was part of a [[Jesuit]] farm in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. With the expulsion of the Order in 1759, the property was dismembered and passed into private ownership.
[[File:1803Pa√ßoS√£oCrist√≥v√£o.jpg|thumb|left|1803 Pa√ßo S√£o Crist√≥v√£o]]
In the early 19th century, the area known as ''Quinta da Boa Vista'' (Good View Estate), because could be seen from there the Tijuca Forest, the Corcovado Hill and the Caj√∫ Beach, belonged to the Portuguese-Lebanese [[slave]] [[merchant]], ''Elie Antun Lubbus'', (''Elias Ant√¥nio Lopes'' in [[Portuguese language]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genealogiabrasileira.com/emigracao_arabe/cantagalo_lubos.htm|title=Genealogia Fluminense ‚Äì Cantagalo|website=www.genealogiabrasileira.com|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had erected, around 1803, a [[manor house]] on top of a hill, from which one had a good view of the [[Guanabara Bay]] ‚Äì which gave rise to the current name of region. When the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese court was transferred to Brazil]], in 1808, Elias Ant√≥nio Lopes donated his farm to the [[Prince regent|Prince Regent]] [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]]. John VI appreciated the gift and stayed for long periods in the manor house. Before belonging to the monarchy, the residence had nothing special. It was just one of many colonial-style mansions scattered throughout the country. With the arrival of John VI to Brazil, who had left Lisbon fleeing Napoleon in 1808, countless houses in Rio were expropriated to house the Portuguese of the royal entourage. Before his Quinta da Boa Vista was confiscated, the merchant Elias Ant√¥nio Lopes hastened to donate it to the king. In thanks for his mime, Jo√£o VI granted Lopes titles of nobility and a fat indemnity. The mansion underwent countless renovations over the decades. An imposing masonry and cast iron gate was set there. It was built a side tower in [[Moorish style]]. There was a semicircular staircase to enter the residence on the second floor. Later, another tower rose, at the opposite end, in neoclassical style. The ladder was destroyed, and the entrance turned to the first floor. The third floor was built. The Moorish tower was rebuilt, which became also neoclassical.

The purpose of the changes was to leave the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o to the height of the power of the Brazilian Empire. In 1847, Parliament approved a government bill that would allocate 240 contos de reis to the completion of the reforms. The works seemed to have no end. For Senator ''Clemente Pereira (PA)'', Pedro II would do better if he left Sao Crist√≥v√£o, Pereira's proposal was approved, but the government did not even design a new imperial palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/especiais/arquivo-s/predio-do-museu-nacional-preocupava-senado-do-imperio|title=Pr√©dio do Museu Nacional preocupava Senado do Imp√©rio|website=www12.senado.leg.br|access-date=2018-10-01|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal residence===
[[File:Palace of sao cristovao 1817.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Palace in 1817 before the neoclassical intervention.]]
Prince Regent John and his family had been living in the [[Pa√ßo Imperial]] since their arrival in Rio de Janeiro in 1808. The prince regent felt very honored by Elias's gift of the best house in Rio and rewarded Elias with another property, not quite as grand. He began transforming the manor into a royal residence. 

At the time, the area of the farm was still surrounded by mangroves and communication by land with the city was difficult. Later, the wetlands were drained and the roads improved.

To better accommodate the royal family, the manor house, though vast and comfortable, needed to be adapted. The most important renovation was begun at the time of the nuptials of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] with the Archduchess [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria]], in 1819, and finished 1821. The renovation was directed by English [[architect]] John Johnston. In front of the palace, Johnston installed a decorative [[portico]], a gift sent from [[England]] to Brazil by [[Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland]]. The gate, inspired by Robert Adams' porch for the "Sion House", the nobleman's residence in England, is shaped in a kind of terracotta called "Coade stone" manufactured by the English company Coade &amp; Sealy.

The architectural line of the palace is similar to that of the [[Ajuda Palace]] which, left behind in [[Lisbon]], was never finished. The Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o won deserved prominence as the new state palace of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] and, subsequently, of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

===Imperial residence===
[[File:Palace of sao cristovao by stahl 1862.jpg|thumb|left|The Imperial Palace after the Neoclassical intervention, in 1862]]
After the declaration of [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the palace became the residence of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]]. The remodelling and expansion of the palace continued under Portuguese architect Manuel da Costa (1822‚Äì1826), followed by [[France|French]] architect Pedro Jos√© Pezer√°t (1826‚Äì1831), credited as the author of the definitive [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] project of the building. He added a new tower to the left of the main fa√ßade and added a third floor to the palace. The works were continued after 1847 by Brazilian artist [[Manuel de Ara√∫jo Porto-alegre]], who harmonised the style of the fa√ßades, followed by the [[Germany|German]] Theodore Marx (1857‚Äì1868). [[Italy|Italian]] painter [[Mario Bragaldi]] decorated many of the rooms of the palace, including the Throne Room and the Ambassadors' Room, with paintings in ''[[trompe-l'≈ìil]]''.

After the marriage of Pedro I and [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria]] in 1817, the Imperial couple resided in the palace. The future Queen of Portugal, [[Mary II of Portugal|Maria II]], and the future [[Emperor of Brazil]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] were born here. Empress Maria Leopoldina died in the palace in 1826. Pedro II, future Emperor, grew up and was educated in the palace, and in 1869 ordered the remodelling of the gardens. French garden designer [[Auguste Fran√ßois Marie Glaziou]] was put in charge of the project, which included artificial lakes, bridges, caves and fake ancient temples, all following the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] trend of the time. Pedro II's children were also born in the palace, including [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], famous for having abolished [[slavery]] from Brazil in 1888. After the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, the Imperial family left the country and the palace and its surrounding gardens became empty.

===Republican period===
[[File:Fundos do Pal√°cio de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o.JPG|thumb|Rear of the palace in 2015 showing evidence of the neglect of recent years]]
In 1891, the building was used by Brazilian politicians writing the first [[Constitution_of_Brazil#Old_Republic_Constitution_.281891-1930.29|Republican Constitution]] of the country. 

In 1892, the director of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro managed to transfer the institution from the Campo de Santana to the palace. The inner decoration of the palace was dispersed, but part of it can still be found in other museums, like the [[Imperial Museum of Brazil|Imperial Museum]] of [[Petr√≥polis]], in which the Throne Room was reassembled.

At the time, the gardens had a long period of abandonment, but in 1909 President [[Nilo Pe√ßanha]] had them restored and surrounded, preserving the characteristics that were given to him by Glaziou.

==National Museum==
{{main|National Museum of Brazil}}
[[File:Cr√¢nio de Luzia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luzia Woman]] [[fossil]]]]
[[File:MaxakalisaurusTopai Rec.jpg|thumb|[[Maxakalisaurus]]]]

Founded in 1818 by [[John VI of Portugal|King John VI of Portugal]], the National Museum was transferred to the old Imperial Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o in 1892. During its long history, its collections have been greatly expanded by acquisitions and donations, including by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]], a great sponsor of the sciences. The collections included [[Astronomy]] (mostly [[meteorites]]), [[Palaeontology]], [[Natural history]], [[Ethnology]] (including many interesting works by [[Brazilian indigenous peoples]]) and [[Archaeology]] (mostly antiquities from [[ancient Egypt]]).

Much of the art collection displayed by the Museum still consisted of what was gathered by the Emperor Pedro II himself. In this manner, it reflects 19th-century views of Anthropology, Archeology and sciences in general.

Visitors could also see a few rooms of the ancient Palace with its original painted and [[stucco]] decoration, like the Throne Room, the Ambassadors' Room and the room of [[Teresa of the Two Sicilies|Empress Teresa Cristina]]. These rooms still displayed a couple original pieces but were overall empty.

On 2 September 2018, the palace was [[National Museum of Brazil fire| devastated by a enxtensive fire]]. The damage to heritage assets have been reported to be "incalculable". One of the few known surviving major artifacts is the [[Bendeg√≥ meteorite|Bendeg√≥ meteorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bendeg√≥: el meteorito que resisti√≥ las llamas del incendio del Museo Nacional de Brasil |url=https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/ciencia-y-tecnologia/ciencia/2018/09/03/bendego-el-meteorito-que-se-resistio-las-llamas-del-incendio-del-museo-nacional-de-brasil.shtml |website=BioBioChile - La Red de Prensa M√°s Grande de Chile |accessdate=3 September 2018 |language=es-LA |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/fire-engulfs-brazil-national-museum-rio|title=Brazil museum fire: ‚Äòincalculable‚Äô loss as 200-year-old Rio institution gutted|last=Phillips|first=Dom|date=3 September 2018|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="200Years"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/fire-engulfs-brazil-national-museum-rio|title='200 years of knowledge lost': fire engulfs Brazil's national museum|last=Phillips|first=Dom|date=3 September 2018|website=The Guardian|dead-url=no|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire, a metallic roof covering 5,000 m¬≤ upper the [[debris]] is planned to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2018/09/14/museu-nacional-e-liberado-para-acoes-de-prevencao-e-estabilizacao.htm|title=Museu Nacional √© liberado para a√ß√µes de preven√ß√£o e estabiliza√ß√£o|date=14 September 2018|website=UOL|language=pt|access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''prefectural museum''' is a post-[[World War II|war]] development in [[Japan]]. These [[museum]]s tend to be large and some are more distinguished for their [[architecture]] than for the [[Museum collection|collections]] they hold. Since these institutions are of recent origin, their collections tend not to contain older Japan arts. [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era and 20th-century art, with an emphasis on local art, tend to dominate the collections. The prefectural museums do host exhibitions from collections from [[Tokyo]], though these exhibits tend to be contemporary as well. 

Examples of prefectural museums include:

* [[Aomori Prefectural Museum]]
* [[K≈çchi Prefectural Cultural Hall]]
* [[Okayama Prefectural Museum]]
* [[Okinawa Prefectural Museum]]

Noted architect [[Maekawa Kunio]] designed both the [[Kumamoto Prefectural Art Museum]] in [[Kumamoto]] as well as the [[Saitama Prefectural Museum]] at [[Omiya-ku, Saitama|≈åmiya]]. 

Some prefectural museums specialize in one aspect of the local culture. The [[Nagasaki Prefectural Art Museum]] is an example of one of these. It houses a collection of [[Nagasaki School]] paintings.

'''''Scholarpedia''''' is an [[English language|English-language]] online [[wiki]]-based [[encyclopedia]] with features commonly associated with [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] online [[academic journal]]s, which aims to have quality content.

''Scholarpedia'' articles are written by invited expert authors and are subject to [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://applied-neuroscience.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=79 |title=Scholarpedia: the free peer-reviewed encyclopedia |website=Society of Applied Neuroscience |date=2006-11-11 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archivedate=2012-02-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222104006/http://applied-neuroscience.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scholarpedia'' lists the real names and affiliations of all authors, curators and editors involved in an article: however, the peer review process (which can suggest changes or additions, and has to be satisfied before an article can appear) is anonymous. ''Scholarpedia'' articles are stored in an online repository, and can be [[citation|cited]] as conventional journal articles (''Scholarpedia'' has the [[ISSN]] number {{ISSN|1941-6016}}). ''Scholarpedia''{{'}}s citation system includes support for revision numbers.

The project was created in February 2006 by Eugene M. Izhikevich, while he was a researcher at the [[Neurosciences Institute]], [[San Diego, California]]. Izhikevich is also the encyclopedia's editor-in-chief.

==Scope==
[[File:Scholarpedia main page.png|thumbnail|''Scholarpedia'' main page]]
''Scholarpedia'' content is grouped into separate "encyclopedias". Currently seven of these are described as "focal areas": [[Astrophysics]], [[Celestial mechanics]], [[Computational neuroscience]], [[Computational intelligence]], [[Dynamical systems]], [[Physics]] and [[Touch]] - but a further 12 include such diverse area such as [[Play Science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Encyclopedia:Play_Science|title=Encyclopedia:Play Science - Scholarpedia|website=www.scholarpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Models of brain disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Encyclopedia:Models_of_brain_disorders|title=Encyclopedia:Models of brain disorders - Scholarpedia|website=www.scholarpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.typepad.com/mitpresslog/2007/01/scholarpedia.html |title=Scholarpedia |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2007-03-27 |website=The [[MIT]] Presslog}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|November}}, ''Scholarpedia'' has 1,804 content pages and 18,149 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Special:Statistics|title=Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Scholarpedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authorship ==
To ensure that the articles are written by experts, authors of the various articles in ''Scholarpedia'' are either invited by the editor-in-chief or other curators, or selected by a public election. For example, [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] were nominated for the article on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User:Eugene M. Izhikevich/Proposed/Wikipedia |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia&amp;oldid=37538 |website=Scholarpedia |date=2008-04-20 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2009, the list of authors included four [[Fields Medalists]] and sixteen [[Nobel Prize]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Editorial: Wouldn't you like to know? |journal=Nature Physics |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=505 |doi=10.1038/nphys1012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered users must provide their full real name, and a recognized affiliation to an academic institution. Only registered users can edit an article, and those edits are subject to approval by the ''curator'' of the article, who is typically the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Help:Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Help:Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_is_an_article_maintained.3F |website=Scholarpedia |accessdate=2012-05-25 |at=sec. How is an article maintained?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curatorship is transferable. Users have a ''curator index'' attribute which is incremented or decremented by various activities and which affects the user's capabilities on the website.

After October 20, 2011, anyone can propose an article for ''Scholarpedia'', but articles must be sponsored by Editors or Curators before the article can be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scholarpedia - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Scholarpedia:About|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright ==
Articles are available online without charge for non-commercial use, but may not be copied in bulk. Authors are credited on the article page.{{citation needed |date=March 2014}}

{{As of|2008|January}}, ''Scholarpedia'' changed their licensing policy and now also accepts articles under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] and the [[CC-BY-NC-ND|Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike]] 3.0 license, in addition to the earlier system in which the author gives a non-exclusive license directly to ''Scholarpedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Software ==
''Scholarpedia'' uses the same [[wiki software|wiki engine]] as [[Wikipedia]], [[MediaWiki]], with modifications to support voting on revisions. The software's development is done privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help:Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Help:Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_can_I_contribute_to_the_source_code.3F |website=Scholarpedia |accessdate=2012-05-25 |at=sec.

'''The Selden Society''' is a [[learned society]] and [[registered charity]] concerned with the study of [[English legal history]]. It functions primarily as a [[text publication society]], but also undertakes other activities to promote scholarship within its sphere of interest. It is the only learned society wholly devoted to the topic of English legal history.

The Society takes its name from the eminent English jurist and legal and constitutional scholar, [[John Selden]] (1584‚Äì1654).

==History and activities==
The Society was founded in 1887 by [[Frederic William Maitland|F. W. Maitland]]. Its principal activity is publishing historical records of [[English law]]. Since its inception, a volume of significant texts has been published every year. It also publishes a supplementary series.

The President is Professor Sir [[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]], former [[Downing Professor of the Laws of England]] at [[Cambridge University]]. The current literary director is Dr [[Neil Jones (academic)|Neil Jones]], who succeeded Sir John Baker in this role in 2011. The Secretary is [[Victor Tunkel]]. The Society meets for an AGM every year, and other meetings are held in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. The Society often collaborates with the [[Ames Foundation]] at [[Harvard Law School]].

The membership of the Society is primarily composed of educational institutions and interested individuals (mostly legal historians and lawyers).

==Publications==
Early volumes published by the Society included:

*{{cite book |editor-last=Maitland |editor-first=F. W. |editor-link=Frederic William Maitland |title=Select Pleas of the Crown. Vol. I: A.D. 1200‚Äì1225 |series=Selden Society Publications |volume=1 |year=1888 }}

In [[publishing]] and [[library science|library and information science]], the term '''serial''' is applied to materials "in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_S.aspx?#serial |title=Serial |work=ODLIS ‚Äî Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Periodicals ==
{{main|Periodical literature}}
In contrast to serials in general, a periodical has been defined as "A serial publication with its own distinctive title, containing a mix of articles  ... by more than one contributor, issued ... at regular stated intervals of less than a year, without prior decision as to when the final issue will appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_P.aspx?#periodical |title=Periodical |work=ODLIS ‚Äî Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus a periodical does not admit irregularly spaced publication times. This includes [[magazines]] and [[academic journals|journals]], but not [[proceedings]]; it also does not include [[newspapers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_N.aspx?#newspaper |title=Newspaper |work=ODLIS ‚Äî Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shortfin mako shark''' {{IPAc-en|Àà|m|…ëÀê|k|o ä}} (''Isurus oxyrinchus''), also known as the '''blue pointer''' or '''bonito shark''', is a large [[mackerel shark]]. It is commonly referred to as the '''mako shark''', as is the [[longfin mako shark]] (''Isurus paucus'').&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS |id=159924 |taxon=Isurus oxyrinchus |accessdate=23 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase | genus = Isurus | species = oxyrinchus | month = May | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortfin mako is on record as the fastest-swimming shark, capable of bursts of speed up to {{convert|18.8|m/s|km/h mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J. B., DeWar, H., Lai, N. C., Lowell, W. R., &amp; Arce, S. M. (1990). ''Aspects of shark swimming performance determined using a large water tunnel''. Journal of Experimental Biology, 151(1), 175-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
"Mako" comes from the [[MƒÅori language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maori.info/maori_language.htm|title=Maori language ‚Äì a glossary of useful words from the language of the Maori New Zealand|accessdate=2006-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either the shark or a shark tooth. As in the MƒÅori language (where there is no letter "s"), "mako" is both singular and plural.  The word may have originated in a [[dialect]]al variation as it is similar to the common words for shark in a number of [[Polynesian languages]]‚Äî''mak≈ç'' in the [[Ngai Tahu|KƒÅi Tahu]] MƒÅori dialect,&lt;ref name="DMaori"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Maori Language|author= H. W. Williams|edition=7th|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''mang≈ç'' in other MƒÅori dialects,&lt;ref name="DMaori" /&gt; "mago" in [[Samoan language|Samoan]], ''ma'o'' in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], and ''mano'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. The first written usage is in [[Samuel Lee (linguist)|Lee]] and [[Thomas Kendall|Kendall's]] ''Grammar and vocabulary of the language of New Zealand'' (1820), which simply states, "M√°ko; A certain fish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford: The Dictionary of New Zealand English: New Zealand words and their origins|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mako|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Taylor (missionary)|Richard Taylor's]] ''A leaf from the natural history of New Zealand'' (1848) is more elaborate: "Mako, the shark which has the tooth so highly prized by the Maoris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A leaf from the natural history of New Zealand|author=Richard Taylor|year=1848|page=xiii|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- the 1727 reference that appears in the Oxford English Dictionary and others is a misinterpretation of the Japanese word "makko" (sperm whale)--&gt;In 1809, [[Constantine Rafinesque]] gave the shortfin mako the scientific name ''Isurus oxyrinchus'' (''[[isurus]]'' means "the same tail", ''oxyrinchus'' means "pointy snout").

== Description ==
[[File:Isurus oxyrinchus Machoire.jpg|thumb|The jaws]]
[[File:Marrazo-hortzak.jpg|thumb|The lower teeth]]
The shortfin mako shark is a fairly large species of shark. Growth rates appear to be somewhat accelerated in comparison to other species in the [[Lamnidae|lamnid]] family.&lt;ref name= FLMNH /&gt; An average adult specimen measures around {{convert|3.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and weighs from {{convert|60|-|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

The authors did not estimate a weight for this specimen.

The shortfin mako shark is cylindrical in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits [[countershading]], with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the shortfin mako shark, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one lateral keel on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the mako from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus ''[[Lamna]]''.

== Ecology ==

=== Range and habitat ===
[[File:Isurus-oxyrinchus.jpg|right|thumb]]
The shortfin mako inhabits offshore [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] seas worldwide. The closely related longfin mako shark is found in the [[Gulf Stream]] or warmer offshore waters. (For ex. New Zealand and Maine.)

It is a [[pelagic]] species that can be found from the surface to depths of {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}, normally far from land, though occasionally closer to shore, around islands or inlets.&lt;ref name="SG" /&gt; One of the very few&lt;!-- 5 lamnid sharks, 2 thresher sharks --&gt; known [[Warm-blooded|endothermic]] sharks, it is seldom found in waters colder than 16&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (61&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Shortfin Mako sharks(Isurus oxyrinchus) | date=29 August 2005| publisher=Shark Foundation / Hai-Stiftung | url =http://www.shark.ch/Database/Search/species.html?sh_id=1027 | accessdate = 18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western [[Atlantic]], it can be found from [[Argentina]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to [[Gulf of Maine#Geographic features and biological importance|Browns Bank]] off of [[Nova Scotia]]. In Canadian waters, these sharks are neither abundant nor rare. [[Swordfish]] are good indicators of shortfin mako populations, as the former are a source of food and prefer similar environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Steven | last=Campana | author2=Warren Joyce | author3=Zoey Zahorodny | title=Shortfin Mako | date=2 October 2008 | publisher=The Canadian Shark Research Laboratory | url=http://www.marinebiodiversity.ca/shark/english/skull6.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529184135/http://www.marinebiodiversity.ca/shark/english/skull6.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=29 May 2012 | work= | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortfin mako sharks travel long distances to seek prey or mates. In December 1998, a female tagged off [[California]] was captured in the central Pacific by a Japanese research vessel, meaning this fish traveled over {{convert|1725|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Another specimen swam {{convert|1322|mi|km|abbr=on}} in 37 days, averaging {{convert|36|mi|km|abbr=on}} a day.&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;

=== Feeding ===
[[File:Close up of mako shark head 005.jpg|thumb|left|The head of a mako shark]]
The shortfin mako shark feeds mainly upon [[cephalopods]] and bony fish including [[mackerel]]s, [[tuna]]s, [[bonito]]s, and [[swordfish]], but it may also eat other sharks, [[porpoise]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[seabird]]s. They hunt by lunging vertically up and tearing off chunks of their preys' flanks and fins. Mako swim below their prey, so they can see what is above and have a high probability of reaching prey before it notices. In Ganzirri and Isola Lipari, [[Sicily]], shortfin mako have been found with [[amputated]] [[swordfish]] bills impaled into their head and gills, suggesting swordfish seriously injure and likely kill them. In addition, this location, and the late spring and early summer timing, corresponding to the swordfish's [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] cycle, suggests they hunt while the swordfish are most vulnerable, typical of many predators.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharks-med.netfirms.com/med/mako.htm |title=The Shark Gallery ‚Äì Shortfin Mako Shark (''Isurus oxyrinchus'') |publisher="The [[Shark Trust]]" |accessdate=2008-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714165639/http://sharks-med.netfirms.com/med/mako.htm |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortfin mako sharks consume 3% of their weight each day and take about 1.5‚Äì2.0 days to digest an average-sized meal. By comparison, the [[sandbar shark]], an inactive species, consumes 0.6% of its weight a day and takes 3 to 4 days to digest it. An analysis of the stomach contents of 399 male and female mako sharks ranging from {{convert|67|-|328|cm|abbr=on}} suggest mako from [[Cape Hatteras]] to the [[Grand Banks]] prefer [[bluefish]], constituting 77.5% of their diet by volume. The average capacity of the stomach was 10% of the total weight. Shortfin mako sharks consumed 4.3% to 14.5% of the available bluefish between [[Cape Hatteras]] and [[Georges Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Food, Feeding Habits, and Estimates of Daily Ration of the Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus ) in the Northwest Atlantic.|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|year=1982|first=|last=|volume=39|issue=3|pages=407‚Äì414.|id=|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=226343&amp;q=Shortfin+mako&amp;uid=793124504&amp;setcookie=yes|format=|accessdate=2008-11-04|doi=10.1139/f82-058|last1=Stillwell|first1=C.E.|last2=Kohler|first2=N.E.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520051349/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=226343&amp;q=Shortfin+mako&amp;uid=793124504&amp;setcookie=yes|archivedate=2011-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortfin mako sharks over {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} have interior teeth considerably wider and flatter than smaller mako, which enables them to prey effectively upon [[dolphin]]s, [[swordfish]], and other sharks.&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;{{cite news |author=R.

Its endothermic constitution partly accounts for its relatively great speed.&lt;ref name="MK"&gt;{{cite news | first=Nancy | last=Passarelli |author2=Craig Knickle |author3=Kristy DiVittorio | title=SHORTFIN MAKO | publisher=Florida Museum of Natural History | url =http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/ShortfinMako/Shortfinmako.html| accessdate = 2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other lamnid sharks, the shortfin mako shark has a heat-exchange [[circulatory system]] that allows the shark to be 7‚Äì10&amp;nbsp;¬∞F (4‚Äì7&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) warmer than the surrounding water. This system enables them to maintain a stable, very high level of activity,&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;{{cite news | first=M |last=McGrouther | title=Shortfin Mako | date=May 2007 | publisher=Australian Museum | url =http://www.australianmuseum.net.au/fishes/fishfacts/fish/ioxyrinchus.htm | accessdate = 15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving it an advantage over its cold-blooded prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Shortfin Mako Shark | date=October 30, 2007 | publisher=2008 Discovery Communications, LLC | url=http://dsc.discovery.com/sharks/shortfin-mako-shark.html | accessdate=2008-11-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925231641/http://dsc.discovery.com/sharks/shortfin-mako-shark.html | archivedate=September 25, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==
The shortfin mako is the fastest species of shark.&lt;ref name= FLMNH /&gt; Its speed has been recorded at {{convert|40|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with bursts of up to {{convert|74|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/shark_profiles/i_oxyrinchus.htm|title=Biology of the Shortfin Mako|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research|accessdate=2006-08-12|author=R. Aidan Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing it to jump to heights of approximately {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}. These characteristics have made the shortfin mako a highly sought-after [[game fish]] worldwide. Some cases of shortfin mako jumping into a boat after having been hooked have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monstrous mako shark hops on boat, gets itself stuck, dramatic video shows|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/07/28/monstrous-mako-shark-hops-on-boat-gets-itself-stuck-dramatic-video-shows.html|website=Fox News|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life history ==

=== Reproduction ===
The shortfin mako shark is a yolk-sac [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] shark, giving birth to live young. Developing embryos feed on unfertilized eggs ([[oophagy]]) within the uterus during the 15- to 18-month [[gestation]] period. They do not engage in sibling cannibalism unlike the [[sand tiger shark]] (''Carcharias taurus''). The four to 18 surviving young are born live in the late winter and early spring at a length of about {{convert|70|cm|abbr=on}}. Females may rest for 18 months after birth before mating again. Shortfin mako sharks bear young on average every three years.&lt;ref name="Last.and.Stevens.2009"&gt;{{cite book

=== Lifespan ===

Shortfin mako sharks, as with most other sharks, are aged by sectioning vertebrae ‚Äî one of the few bony structures in sharks ‚Äî and counting growth bands. The age of shortfin mako, and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4‚Äì6 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that shortfin mako sharks deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that shortfin mako sharks only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens.&lt;ref name="Natanson.et.al.2006"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natanson et al. (2006) aged 258 shortfin mako specimens and recorded:
* Maximum age of 29 years in males (260&amp;nbsp;cm fork length (FL))
* Maximum age of 32 years in females (335&amp;nbsp;cm FL)
* 50% sexual maturity at 8 years in males (185&amp;nbsp;cm FL)
* 50% sexual maturity at 18 years in females (275&amp;nbsp;cm FL)

Similar, validated age findings were made (median age at maturity in males 7‚Äì9 years, median age at maturity in females 19‚Äì21 years, longevity estimates 29 years and 28 years respectively) in New Zealand waters.&lt;ref name="Bishop.et.al.2006"&gt;{{Cite journal

Due to this error, fishery management models and ecological risk assessment models in use around the world were underestimating both the longevity and the age at sexual maturity in shortfin mako sharks, particularly in females, by two-thirds or more (i.e. 6 years versus 18+ years), and some of these inaccurate models remain in use.

=== Intelligence ===
Of all studied sharks, the shortfin mako has one of the largest [[Brain-to-body mass ratio|brain:body ratios]]. This large brain size prompted New Zealand Sealife Australia and New Zealand senior curator Craig Thorburn of Auckland, New Zealand, and film-maker Mike Bhana to investigate the intelligence of the mako. From tests involving shape differentiation to electroreception tests and individual recognition, Isuru Somawardana and his team of shark experts discovered mako are fast-learning sharks, able to determine whether or not the researchers were threatening. The sharks involved in the study (while never the same individuals) after initial caution showed unique and never before seen behaviors, such as refusing to roll back their eyes during feeding and allowing themselves to be briefly restrained and touched while being offered bait. Shortfin mako also do not rely on electroreception when hunting, unlike the great white shark, based on tests involving wired fiberglass fish designed to emit weak electrical signals resembling real fish of similar size. Instead, they rely on smell, hearing, and most prominently, vision. The results of this research were featured on a documentary presented by [[Shark Week]] in 1999 called " Mako: Swift, Smart &amp; Deadly".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzgeo.com/video/mako-swift-smart-deadly/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fishing for sport ===
Mako fishing is a predominant activity around the world.  As one of the fastest species in the water they offer acrobatic flips, fast runs, and heavy fights that entertain anglers.  Traditionally the sharks are hooked through the use of [[Chumming|chum]] and baitcasters. However fly fishing for them has become more popular, particularly in [[San Diego]], where one of the 3 known worldwide mako rookeries is located.  A cottage industry of fishing in this rookery has emerged, specifically catch and release with charter operations out of Mission Bay.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflystop.com/san-diego-fly-shop-fishing-guide-charter/california-mako-shark&lt;/ref&gt;  For many years the mass commercial boats hunted them for restaurant catch but through the efforts of many local fishing companies and national organizations such as Orvis this has been curbed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orvis.com/fishing_report.aspx?locationid=7394&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captivity ===
Of all recorded attempts to keep [[pelagic]] shark species in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]], the shortfin mako shark has fared the poorest, even more so than the [[oceanic whitetip shark]], the [[blue shark]], and the [[great white shark]]. The current record is held by a specimen kept at the [[Adventure Aquarium|New Jersey Aquarium]] for only five days in 2001. Like past attempts at keeping ''Isurus'' in captivity, the animal appeared strong on arrival, but had trouble negotiating the walls of the aquarium, refused to feed, quickly weakened, and died.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070423224849/http://homepage.mac.com/MOLLET/ Elasmobranch Research around Monterey Bay]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks on humans ===
[[International Shark Attack File|ISAF]] statistics records 9 shortfin [[Shark attack|attacks]] on humans between 1580 and 2017, one of which was fatal, along with 20 boat attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/species2.htm ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark]. Flmnh.ufl.edu (2012-01-30). Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; This mako is regularly blamed for attacks on humans and, due to its speed, power, and size, it is certainly capable of injuring and killing people. However, this species will not generally attack humans and does not seem to treat them as prey. Most modern attacks involving shortfin mako sharks are considered to have been provoked due to harassment or the shark being caught on a fishing line.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070714204605/http://www.marinebio.org/species.asp?id=36 ''Isurus oxyrinchus'' Shortfin Mako Shark].marinebio.org&lt;/ref&gt; Sharks can be attracted to spear fishermen carrying a stuck fish, and may slap them with [[cavitation]] bubbles from a swift tail flick. Divers who have encountered shortfin mako note, prior to an attack, they swim in a figure-eight pattern and approach with mouths open.&lt;ref name= Bio /&gt;

== Conservation ==
The shortfin mako is currently classified as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by the [[IUCN]], having been uplisted from [[Near threatened]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/media/news_releases/?103/More-oceanic-sharks-added-to-the-IUCN-Red-List|title=More oceanic sharks added to the IUCN Red List|publisher=IUCN|website=IUCN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; The species is being targeted by both sport and commercial fisheries, and there is a substantial proportion of [[bycatch]] in driftnet fisheries for other species.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;

== World record ==
The largest Mako ever recorded was caught in June 2013 off [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Its dimensions were 3.73 m (12.2 feet) long, 2.44 m circumference shortfin mako shark, and weighing 600&amp;nbsp;kg (1,323&amp;nbsp;lb).

'''''Star of India''''' was built in 1863 at [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] in the [[Isle of Man]] as '''''Euterpe''''', a full-rigged iron [[windjammer]] ship. After a career sailing from Great Britain to India and New Zealand, she became a [[salmon]] hauler on the [[Alaska]] to [[California]] route. Retired in 1926, she was not restored until 1962‚Äì63 and is a seaworthy [[museum ship]] home-ported at the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California]]. She is the oldest ship still sailing regularly and also the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship still floating.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==

=== As ''Euterpe'' ===
Named for [[Euterpe (muse)|Euterpe]], the muse of music, she was a [[full-rigged ship]] (a ship that is square-rigged on all three masts), built of iron in 1863 by Gibson, McDonald &amp; Arnold, of Ramsey, Isle of Man, for the Indian [[jute trade]] of Wakefield Nash &amp; Company of [[Liverpool]].  She was launched on 14 November 1863, and assigned British Registration No.47617 and signal VPJK.

''Euterpe's'' career had a rough beginning.  She sailed for [[Calcutta]] from Liverpool on 9 January 1864, under the command of Captain William John Storry. A collision with an unlit Spanish [[brig]] off the coast of [[Wales]] carried away the [[jib-boom]] and damaged other rigging. The crew became mutinous, refusing to continue, and she returned to [[Anglesey]] to repair; 17 of the crew were confined to the Beaumaris Jail at hard labor.  Then, in 1865, ''Euterpe'' was forced to cut away her masts in a gale in the [[Bay of Bengal]] off [[Madras]] and limped to [[Trincomalee]] and Calcutta for repair.  Captain Storry died during the return voyage to England and was [[Burial at sea|buried at sea]].

After her near-disastrous first two voyages ''Euterpe'' was sold, first in 1871 to David Brown of London for whom she made four more relatively uneventful voyages to India, then again (displaced by steamers after the opening of the Suez Canal) in 1871 to Shaw, Savill and Company of [[London]] (which in 1882 became the [[P Henderson &amp; Company#Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line|Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line]]).  In late 1871 she began twenty-five years of carrying passengers and freight in the New Zealand emigrant trade, each voyage going eastward around the world before returning to England.  The fastest of her 21 passages to New Zealand took 100 days, the longest 143 days.  She also made ports of call in Australia, California, and Chile.  A baby was born on one of those trips en route to New Zealand, and was given the middle name Euterpe. Another child, John William Philips Palmer, was born&lt;ref&gt;Otago Witness, Issue 1115, 12 April 1873, Page 12, [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=OW18730412.1.12&amp;e=-------10--1----0-- http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; on the 1873 journey to [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]], and was partially named after the captain Theo E. Philips&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nzbound/euterpe1.htm|title=The "Euterpe" -  New Zealand Voyages.|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Born Lo 42.30 south La 0.30 west at 11 am Feb 21").

In 1897, after 21 round-the-world trips, ''Euterpe'' was sold, first to [[Hawaii]]an owners, then in 1899 to the Pacific Colonial Ship Company of [[San Francisco, California]] and from 1898 to 1901 made four voyages between the Pacific Northwest, Australia and Hawaii carrying primarily lumber, coal and sugar. She was registered in the United States on 30 October 1900.

=== As ''Star of India'' ===
[[File:STARofIndia(c)Ted Rufus Ross.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Star of India'' docked in San Diego]]

In 1901, ''Euterpe'' was sold to the [[Alaska Packers' Association]] of San Francisco, who re-rigged her as a [[barque]] (converting the square-rigged aftermost mast to fore-and-aft) and in 1902 began carrying fishermen, cannery workers, coal and canning supplies each spring from [[Oakland, California]] to Nushagak in the [[Bering Sea]], returning each fall with holds full of canned salmon.  In 1906, the Association changed her name to be consistent with the rest of their fleet, and she became ''Star of India''. She was laid up in 1923 after 22 Alaskan voyages; by that time, steam ruled the seas.

In 1926, ''Star of India'' was sold to the [[San Diego Zoo|Zoological Society]] of San Diego, California, to be the centerpiece of a planned museum and [[aquarium]].  The [[Great Depression]] and World War II caused that plan to be canceled, and it was not until 1957 that restoration began.  [[Alan Villiers]], a [[windjammer]] captain and author, came to San Diego on a lecture tour.  Seeing ''Star of India'' decaying in the harbor, he publicized the situation and inspired a group of citizens to form the "Star of India Auxiliary" in 1959 to support the restoration of the ship.  Progress was still slow, but in 1976, ''Star of India'' finally put to sea again. She houses exhibits for the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]], is kept fully seaworthy, and sails at least once a year. With the many other ships now in the Museum, she hosts frequent docent-led school tours for over 6,000 children a year, as well as a Living History Program in which students "step back in time" and are immersed in history and teamwork activities during overnight visits.

The 1863  ''Star of India'' is the fourth oldest ship afloat in the United States, after the 1797  {{USS|Constitution}}, the 1841 [[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|''Charles W. Morgan'']], and 1854 {{USS|Constellation|1854|6}}, and is the oldest ship in the world that still sails regularly. Unlike many preserved or restored vessels, her hull, cabins and equipment are nearly 100% original.

== Home port ==

''Star of India'' is home-ported at the San Diego Maritime Museum, just south of [[Lindbergh Field]] (San Diego International Airport), on the west side of North Harbor Drive at approximately Ash Street ‚Äì all within the [[Port of San Diego]] tidelands. This location is slightly west of downtown San Diego, California. The other ships belonging to the Maritime Museum are always docked to the north of ''Star of India''. Her nearest neighbor ‚Äì since 2007 ‚Äì is {{HMS|Surprise|replica ship|6}} (a.k.a. HMS ''Rose''), a replica of a British [[frigate]].

When she sails, ''Star of India'' often remains within sight of the coast of San Diego County, and usually returns to her dock within a day. She is sailed by a skilled volunteer crew of Maritime Museum members, who train all year. She has become one of the landmark ships in San Diego's Harbor.

In August ‚Äì September 2009, ''Star of India'' was removed from display to a local drydock facility for a required Coast Guard inspection and various maintenance below the waterline, at a cost of approximately $225,000, and 3‚Äì4 weeks off display.

== Appearances in media ==
The ''Star of India'' has appeared in episodes of:
* [[List of Dirty Jobs episodes#Season 4 (2008‚Äì09)|''Dirty Jobs'']] Season Four, Episode 89, "Tar Rigger"
* [[List of Ghost Hunters episodes#Season 4 (2008)|''Ghost Hunters'']] Season Four, Episode 426, "Spirits on the Water".
* ''Great Ships'' episode "The Windjammers".
* [[Haunted History (1998 TV series)#Season One (1999-2000)|''Haunted History'']] Season One, Episode 3, "Haunted Ships"
* At the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], [[Ubisoft]] used the ship to promote their new game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'' and renamed the ship for 3 days after the in-game ship ''The Jackdaw''.
* [[List of Ghost Adventures episodes#Season 12 (2016)|''Ghost Adventures'']] Season 12, Episode 6 "Star of India"

== Trivia ==
* The residue of the logo of ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'' from the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] is still visible on the ship's sail.

'''''Surinder Singh Kanda v The Government of the Federation of Malaya''''' [[Case citation|(1962) 28 MLJ 169]] was a leading case in Malaysia.

== Background ==
Officer Surinder Singh Kanda " was supplied with a report of the board of inquiry. The question arose whether the hearing by adjudicating officer was vitiated by Insp. Kanda not being given any opportunity of correcting or contradicting the report."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsofactoj.com/APPEAL/2002/Part1/app2002(1)-008.htm Ang- vs -The Royal Malaysian Police Commission] - Court of Appeals, Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
[[Lord Denning]] noted that {{cquote|In a conflict of this kind between the existing law and the Constitution, the Constitution must prevail. The court must apply the existing law with such modifications as may be necessary to bring it into accord with the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsofactoj.com/appeal/2006/Part1/app2006(1)-010.htm Selangor- vs-Sagong Tasi] - COURT OF APPEAL, MALAYSIA&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It also defined constitutional rights {{cquote|If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused person to know the case which is made against him.  He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting him:  and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/jugdment/fc/archive/MP.%20R.S%20No.01-1-2001(W)).htm DALAM MAHKAMAH PERSEKUTUAN  DI KUALA LUMPUR] - Malaysian Courts Of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Back Series''''' is a series of four [[bas-relief]] sculptures, by [[Henri Matisse]]. Tjey are Matisse's largest and most monumental sculptures. The plaster originals are housed in the [[Matisse Museum (Le Cateau)|Mus√©e Matisse]] in Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis, France.

They were modeled between 1909 and 1930. ''Back (I)'' appeared in the second PostImpressionist show in London, and the [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/12/art.art|title=Hilary Spurling on Matisse's monolithic Back sculptures|author=Hilary Spurling|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four sculptures were unique plaster casts until 1950, when ''Back (I)'', ''(III)'', and ''(IV)'' were cast in bronze. ''Back (II)'' was rediscovered in 1955, a year after the artist‚Äôs death, then it was cast. The series have been cast in a bronze edition of twelve, included one for the artist's family. Nine complete sets are housed in nine major museums around the world:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/sculptures-statues-figures/henri-matisse-nu-de-dos-4-etat-5369418-details.aspx|title=Lot Notes of Henri Matisse, The Back (IV)|website=christies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Oratory''' stands to the north of [[Liverpool Cathedral]] in [[Merseyside]], England. It was originally the mortuary chapel to [[St James Cemetery]], and houses a collection of 19th-century sculpture and important funeral monuments as part of the [[Walker Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oratory|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/about/oratory/index.aspx|publisher=Walker Art Gallery|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade&amp;nbsp;I listed building]] in the [[National Heritage List for England]].

==History==
The Oratory was built in 1829, and used for funeral services before burials in the adjacent cemetery. It was designed by [[John Foster (architect)|John Foster]]. When the cemetery closed, the building fell into disuse. In 1986 it came under the care of [[National Museums Liverpool]], and is used to contain a collection of sculpture and statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pye| first = Ken| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2011| title = Discover Liverpool| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Liverpool| place = | publisher = Trinity Mirror Media| pages = | page = 50| format = | id = | isbn = 978-1-906802-90-5| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''''' ({{lang-ar|ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿàÿ∂ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿ∑ÿ± ŸÅŸä ŸÜÿ≤Ÿáÿ© ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿ∑ÿ±}} ''Al-raw·∏ç al- øƒÅ·π≠ir fƒ´ nuzha·∫ó al-·∏´ƒÅ·π≠ir'') by [[Mu·∏•ammad ibn Mu·∏•ammad al-Nafzawi]] is a fifteenth-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[sex manual]] and work of [[erotic literature]].

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive, gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about [[sexual health]], and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the [[Human penis|penis]] and [[vagina]], has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

According to the introduction of Colville's English translation, Mu·∏•ammad ibn Mu·∏•ammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote ''The Perfumed Garden'' sometime during the twelfth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi,&lt;ref&gt;ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÖÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÜŸÅÿ≤ÿßŸàŸä&lt;/ref&gt; was born among the [[Berbers|Berber]] Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day [[Tunisia]]. He compiled at the request of the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] ruler of [[Tunis]], Ab≈´ FƒÅris  øAbd al- øAzƒ´z al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.

==Translations==

===1886: Burton English translation===
''The Perfumed Garden'' first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of [[Pietro Aretino|Aretin]] and [[Rabelais]], and the French book ''Conjugal Love'' by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes ''The Perfumed Garden'' unique in the genre is "the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented." Burton points out that not all of the ideas in ''The Perfumed Garden'' are original: "For instance, all the record of Mo√ßama and of Chedja is taken from the work of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi]]; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book ''Birds and Flowers'' by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams."

The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript's last chapter ‚Äî Chapter 21 ‚Äî was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled ''The Scented Garden'', was never published as Burton's wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death.

=== 1976: Khawam French translation ===
A new French translation by [[Ren√© R. Khawam]] was published in 1976.

=== 1999: Colville English translation ===
In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English ''Perfumed Garden'' translated directly from the Arabic original.  Of the Burton translation, he says, "details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources.  The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation.  The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original".

Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled "Sexual Technique" in Colville's translation and "Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition" in Burton's.  Burton's translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these.  Colville's translation is 2¬Ω pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions.

==Inspiration for musical works==
In 1923 the English composer [[Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji]] wrote ''Le jardin parfum√©: Poem for Piano Solo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mus.ulaval.ca/roberge/srs/04-sourc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RAH Band]] released a single entitled ‚ÄúPerfumed Garden‚Äù in 1982.

Omnium Gatherum, a Finnish [[melodic death metal|melodic death metal band]], also wrote a song called "The Perfumed Garden", released on their "Spirits and August Light" album in 2003.

[[Ray Manzarek]], inspired by this, recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock &amp; Roll, Now It's Out Of Control.

The '''[[Tudor period|Tudor]] Trader House''' is a 16th-century house originally constructed at [[Haverfordwest]], [[Pembrokeshire]], Wales, and now relocated at [[St Fagans National History Museum]], Cardiff.

The house, which previously stood on a bank near Quay Street in Haverfordwest, was taken down during the 1980s and rebuilt at St Fagans in 2012 by the same group of men who dismantled it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18664538 BBC News - Wales: "Haverfordwest Tudor trader home opens at St Fagans museum", 2 July 2012]. Accessed 5 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Its original location suggests that it may have been the home and place of business of a merchant or trader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2012-07-02/st-fagans-reveal-latest-building-from-west-wales/ ITV Wales, "Tudor house rebuilt brick-by-brick opens at St Fagans", 2 July 2012]. Accessed 5 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that the residents lived in a single room upstairs, with a sleeping [[loft]] above, and stored goods on the ground floor.

It is the 42nd building to be relocated at the museum, but only the second from Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/1823/?article_id=755 National Museum of Wales press release 2 July 2012: "St Fagans brings Haverfordwest Tudor trader's house back to life"]. Accessed 5 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconstructed house is furnished and decorated as it would have been in around 1580.

In '''''Veldman v Director of Public Prosecutions, Witwatersrand Local Division''''', an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[criminal law]], the [[court]] held that the [[principle of legality]] is central to the rule of law under the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]]. That case concerned the question of whether, where the sentencing [[jurisdiction]] of a court had been increased after an accused had [[Plea|pleaded]], the accused could be sentenced in terms of the increased jurisdiction. The court held it could not, observing that, once an accused has pleaded, the constitutionally-enshrined principle of legality requires that the sentencing jurisdiction of a court could not be varied to the detriment of the accused, even where it was clear that the increased sentence was a permissible sentence for the charge involved. The court held that "to retrospectively apply a new law, such as s 92(1) (a), during the course of the trial, and thereby to expose an accused person to a more severe sentence, undermines the rule of law and violates an accused person's [[right to a fair trial]] under s 35(3) of the Constitution."

'''Laverne Clarence Gagne'''&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt; ({{IPAc-en|…°|√¶|n|j|e…™}}; February 26, 1926 ‚Äì April 27, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=He Helped Define Wrestling|url=https://classicwrestlingarticles.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/he-helped-define-wrestling/|website=Classic Wrestling Articles|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[professional wrestler]], [[American football|football player]], wrestling trainer, and [[Professional wrestling promotion|wrestling promoter]]. He was the owner and promoter of the [[Minneapolis]]-based [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), the predominant promotion throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Manitoba]] for many years. He remained in this position until 1991, when the company folded.

Gagne was a 16-time World Heavyweight Champion, having held the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] ten times, the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)]] five times, and the [[IWA World Heavyweight Championship (International Wrestling Enterprise)|IWA World Heavyweight Championship]] once. He holds the record for the longest combined reign as a world champion and is third (behind [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Thesz]]) for the longest single world title reign. He is one of only six men inducted into each of the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWE]], [[WCW Hall of Fame|WCW]] and [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame|Professional Wrestling]] halls of fame.

==Early life==
Gagne was born in [[Corcoran, Minnesota|Corcoran]], [[Minnesota]] and grew up on a [[farm]] in [[Robbinsdale, Minnesota]]. He left home at the age of 14 after his mother died. He went to [[Robbinsdale Armstrong High School|Robbinsdale High School]] and excelled in football, baseball and wrestling, winning district, regional, and state championships in high school wrestling, as well as being named to the All-State Football Team. In 1943, he was recruited to play football at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he was named to the All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Team.

After one year of college, Gagne enlisted with the Navy [[Underwater Demolition Team]].&lt;ref name=NWA&gt;{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|pages=234‚Äì237|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to return to the University of Minnesota, where, as an amateur wrestler, he captured two [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] titles. He was also an alternate for the U.S freestyle wrestling team at the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympic Games]]; he later said that he might have wrestled in the Olympics, but his coaches had discovered that he had earned money winning a wrestling match at a carnival, thus putting his amateur standing in question.&lt;ref name = "Grasso"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Grasso | first1 = John  | title = Historical Dictionary of Wrestling | location = Maryland | publisher = Scarecrow Press | pages = 107‚Äì109 | date = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-8108-7925-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football career==
Gagne joined the [[National Football League]] (NFL) soon after being drafted by the [[Chicago Bears]] in the 16th round (145th pick) of the [[1947 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?lg=NFL&amp;yr=1947 |title=1947 NFL Player Draft |publisher=databasefootball.com |accessdate=January 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319110056/http://www.databasefootball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1947&amp;lg=NFL |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bears owner [[George Halas]] prevented Gagne from pursuing both football and wrestling (likely due to former Bears Football Hall of Fame great [[Bronko Nagurski]] having [[Unreported employment|moonlighted]] as a professional wrestler during the height of his NFL career), and forced Gagne to make a choice. In a 2006 interview for [[WWE]], Gagne's son [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg]] mentioned that wrestling was a much better paying job at the time than playing football (as recently as the 1970s, it was not uncommon for NFL players to have a second job during the NFL offseason to help make ends meet), and as a result, Verne chose wrestling over football.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===National Wrestling Alliance===
In 1949, Gagne decided to wrestle professionally, starting his career in Texas. In his debut, he defeated Abe Kashey, with former World Heavyweight boxing Champion [[Jack Dempsey]] as the referee. On November 13, 1950, Gagne captured the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) Junior Heavyweight title in a tournament for the vacant championship.&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt;

In September 1953 in [[Fred Kohler Enterprises]], Gagne was awarded the newly-created [[NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Detroit version)|Chicago version of the NWA United States Championship]].&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt; Gagne became one of the most well-known stars in wrestling during the [[golden age of television]], thanks to his exposure on the [[DuMont Television Network|Dumont Network]], where he wowed audiences with his technical prowess. He was rumored to be one of the highest paid wrestlers during the 1950s, reportedly earning a hundred thousand dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/personalities/gagne_verne/crusade.html|title=Verne Gagne's Great Crusade|work=Wrestling-Titles.com|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 1957, [[Edouard Carpentier]] defeated NWA Champion [[Lou Thesz]] in Chicago. The NWA later overruled the decision of the referee in Chicago and gave the title back to Thesz. However, certain wrestling territories of the NWA including Nebraska refused to go along with the decision and continued to recognize Carpentier. Carpentier lost his title to Gagne in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] on August 9, 1958,&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt; making him the recognized NWA World champion in the NWA territories that had recognized Carpentier, before dropping the belt three months later to [[Wilbur Snyder]]. By early 1960, the highly wealthy Gagne rarely wrestled and turned his focus towards building a wrestling promotion of his own.

===American Wrestling Association===
In 1960, Gagne formed his own promotion, the [[American Wrestling Association|American Wrestling Alliance]] (later it became Association).  Before this, the Minneapolis territory was under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) umbrella. Setting up to pull away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known), gave a "story-line only" edict to the NWA in May 1960 that unless their NWA World Champion Pat O'Connor defended his title to Verne Gagne with 90 days, Verne Gagne would become recognized World Champion by default. There was never any intention of such a match taking place. At the end of the 90 period, the AWA was formed in August 1960 and it was announced that because NWA champion Pat O'Connor failed to meet Gagne, that the AWA recognized Gagne as the first AWA World Champion. 

Some of Gagne's biggest feuds were against [[Gene Kiniski]], [[Dr. Bill Miller]] (under a mask both as Dr. X and then Mr. M), [[Fritz Von Erich]], [[Dick Beyer|Dr. X]], [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]], [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]], [[Mad Dog Vachon]], [[Larry Hennig]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]]. He always wrestled as a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]], and utilized the sleeper hold as his finisher.

As promoter of the AWA, Gagne was known for putting on an "old school" show. He sought out wrestlers with amateur backgrounds over the hulking brutes who dominated wrestling in the 1980s. This led to a problem with his biggest draw, [[Hulk Hogan]], whom Gagne had acquired after Hogan had been let go by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and who Gagne also felt was not championship material, due to the fact that Hogan was a powerhouse wrestler and not a technical wrestler. Seeing Hogan as the company's top draw, Gagne did, however, let Hogan feud with Bockwinkel. Eventually, as noted on the 2006 ''Spectacular Legacy of AWA'' DVD, Gagne settled with making Hogan his champion after Hogan's feud with Bockwinkel ran its course in April 1983, but only under the condition that he would receive the bulk of the revenue Hogan made from both merchandise sales and his matches in Japan.  Hogan refused. In late 1983, Hogan accepted an offer from [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] to return to the WWF. [[The Iron Sheik]], whom Gagne trained, has alleged that he was offered a cash bribe by the AWA's owner to inflict career threatening damage on Hogan's knee after it became apparent that he was going to go to the WWF. This allegation was supported by Hogan during an interview for A&amp;E's ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''.

What followed was a purge of stars from various territories and promotions, including Gagne's AWA, by Vince McMahon, who wished to take his WWF "national" and do away with the traditional territorial system that dominated the North American pro wrestling landscape for decades. Unlike most of his contemporaries, by the mid 1980s, Gagne began promoting the AWA beyond the geographical bounds of the company's traditional territory. In September 1985, [[ESPN]] began broadcasting ''[[AWA Championship Wrestling]]'', granting the AWA national exposure similar to what the World Wrestling Federation was experiencing. However, the AWA suffered numerous setbacks; ''AWA Championship Wrestling'' wasn't treated as a priority by ESPN, the show was sometimes not aired in its regular timeslot, sometimes it was preempted by live sporting events and occasional changes in timeslots without advertising the changes resulted in many fans being unable to tune in on a regular basis. Gagne's booking strategies for the wrestlers themselves continued to be more old school than those of the WWF in that Gagne felt the biggest stars should be the most talented technical wrestlers instead of wrestlers with charismatic personas and over-the-top personalities. Throughout the mid to late 1980s, the AWA would lose nearly every one of its top stars while ratings and live attendance continued to decline. By 1991, the damage had been done, and the AWA shut down, after 30 years. Gagne would eventually end up in bankruptcy court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/1993/gagne.html|title=Wrestling Perspective: In re: Verne C. Gagne, Debtor.

==Hall of Famer==
In April 2006, Gagne was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by his son, [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]]. He is one of only six people to be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWE]], [[WCW Hall of Fame|WCW]] and [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame|Professional Wrestling]] halls of fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Wrestling Icon Verne Gagne Dead At 89|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/04/27/minnesota-wrestling-icon-verne-gagne-dead-at-89/|publisher=[[WCCO-TV|CBS Minnesota]]|date=April 28, 2015|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Helmut Gutmann==
On January 26, 2009, Gagne got into an altercation with Helmut Gutmann, a 97-year-old resident of the [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] facility where they both resided. According to Gutmann's widow, who was not present during the altercation, Gagne picked Gutmann up and hurled him to the floor, then broke his hip by pulling back on his body. "'The attack ‚Äì which was not a wrestling body slam ‚Äì happened quickly while the men were at a table,' Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said. 'It was more like "a push and a shove" and it caused Gutmann to fall.'"&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/more/03/13/wrestler.death.ap/index.html No Criminal Charges Against Ex-Wrestler] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629122400/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/more/03/13/wrestler.death.ap/index.html |date=June 29, 2011 }} SI.com, March 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vsya Moskva''''' (literally translated "''All Moscow''" or "''The Entire Moscow''") was a series of [[city directories]] of [[Moscow]], Russia, published on a yearly basis from 1872 to 1936 by [[Aleksei Sergeevich Suvorin]]. 
The directories contained detailed lists of private residents, names of streets and squares across the city with the details of their occupants and owners, government offices,  public services and medium and large businesses present in the city. Each volume was anywhere between 500 and 1500 pages long.  They are often used by [[genealogists]] for family research in pre-revolutionary Russia and the early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period when [[vital records]] are missing or prove difficult to find. [[Historian]]s use them to research the [[social histories]] of the city.

==List of residents==
Each directory was written exclusively in Russian Cyrillic only, and contains various sections among which was an [[alphabetical]] list of residents in the city. Those listed usually were the head of their respective household and so spouses and minors are not listed. 

The following information can be found:
*Person's surname and first name
*[[Patronymic]]
*Street address with apartment number
*[[Profession]]
*Telephone numbers (few private residents could afford a [[telephone]] before 1918)

==List of occupants of each building on every street and square==
A section immediately preceding or following that listing residents in alphabetical order was a directory of all streets, houses and flats with the names of their owners and occupants. In this way readers could determine all those people who lived on a particular street of in a certain apartment block.

==Other sections==
The following information can also be found in each directory:

*Maps of the city
*Interior theater seating plan layouts
*Lists of personnel in state, public and private institutions
*Original Advertising

== Interruption in the series ==

No volumes were published in the following years:
*1918
*1919
*1920
*1921

This was due to the events of the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent [[Russian civil war]].

== Termination of series ==

Publication came to a halt after the edition of 1936, coinciding with the time of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[great purge]]s and [[Moscow Trials]].

==Historical and genealogical value==
Because numerous residents emigrated from Moscow after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and tens of thousands more were either arrested, shot, or sent to the [[gulag]] by the [[Cheka]] and the [[NKVD]] after 1918 the section detailing residents names is especially useful in determining until when a certain person was still living in the city, and under which address.

==Availability==
Many original directories in the series (or [[microfiche]] copies thereof) can be found in libraries across the [[United States]], [[Europe]] (including [[The Baltics]], [[Finland]] the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]]) however most only have an incomplete collection.

==Other city directories in Russia==
Suvorin also published city directories for [[Saint Petersburg]] under the title ''[[Ves Petersburg]]'' (''All Petersburg'') for the years 1894 to 1940 and for the whole country under the titles ''[[Vsya Rossiya]]'' (''All Russia'') from 1895 to 1923 and continued under than name ''[[Ves SSSR]]'' (''All USSR'') from 1924 to 1931.

The '''Werner Collection''' is one of the collections on display at the [[National Museum of Brazil]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The collection gathers around 60 rare minerals obtained in the [[18th century]] from the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg Mining Academy]], Germany, by the Portuguese nobleman [[Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca|Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo]]. The name of the collection is due to the main researcher of the German academy, scientist [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]]. The collection came to Brazil in the 19th century, brought by the Royal Family, who was escaping from the Napoleonic invasion, and was initially sent to the [[Instituto Militar de Engenharia|Royal Military Academy]], being moved to the Royal Museum (former name of the National Museu) in 1819. It is considered that it was the first collection to compose the National Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/cultura/noticia/2017-12/museu-nacional-exibe-coleacao-de-minerais-da-familia-real-portuguesa|title=Museu Nacional exibe cole√ß√£o de minerais da Fam√≠lia Real portuguesa|last=Virgilio|first=Paulo|date=2017-12-13|work=Ag√™ncia Brasil|access-date=2018-09-25|language=pt-br|trans-title=National Museum displays collection of minerals of the Portuguese Royal Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;
