'''2C-T-16''' is a lesser-known [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]]. It was originally named by [[Alexander Shulgin]] as described in his book [[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]], however while Shulgin began synthesis of this compound he only got as far as the [[nitrostyrene]] intermediate, and did not complete the final synthetic step.&lt;ref&gt;{{CitePiHKAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesis of 2C-T-16 was finally achieved by Daniel Trachsel some years later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daniel Trachsel |year=2003 |title=Synthesis of novel (phenylalkyl)amines for the investigation of structure-activity relationships. Part 2. 4-Thio-substituted [2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]amines (=2,5-dimethoxybenzeneethanamines) |journal=[[Helvetica Chimica Acta]] |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=2610–2619 |doi=10.1002/hlca.200390210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was subsequently reported as showing similar psychedelic activity to related compounds, with a dose range of 10–25&amp;nbsp;mg and a duration of 4–6 hours,&lt;ref name="Trachsel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Daniel Trachsel |author2=David Lehmann |author3=Christoph Enzensperger |last-author-amp=yes |year=2013 |title=Phenethylamine: Von der Struktur zur Funktion |publisher=Nachtschatten Verlag AG |isbn=978-3-03788-700-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|788–789}} making it around the same potency as the better-known saturated analogue [[2C-T-7]], but with a significantly shorter duration of action. Binding studies ''in vitro'' showed 2C-T-16 to have a [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|binding affinity]] of 44nM at [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] and 15nM at [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Trachsel"/&gt;{{rp|791}} 2C-T-16 and related derivatives are potent [[partial agonist]]s of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and induce a [[head-twitch response]] in mice.&lt;ref&gt;Luethi D, Trachsel D, Hoener MC, Liechti ME.

'''''Ajaya: Roll of the Dice''''' is a 2013 [[India]]n novel of [[mythological fiction]]  written by [[Anand Neelakantan]]. The first installment of the Ajaya series, it tells the story of the [[Kauravas]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;Samhita Chakraborty (26 August 2015). ''[https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150826/jsp/t2/story_39047.jsp Anand Neelakantan is turning Indian Mythology on its head!]''. ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)]]''. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the usual tale told from the point of view of the victors, this entire story is written from [[Duryodhana]]'s view.&lt;ref name=indiannerve&gt;Ankita Katdare (25 February 2014). ''[http://indiannerve.com/ajaya-epic-of-the-kaurava-clan-book-review-37561-14199/ Ajaya – Roll Of The Dice | Book Review]''. indiannerve.com. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''[[Hindustan Times]]'' writes, "Neelakantan got [[Ravana]] to steal [[Rama]]’s thunder as the hero of the [[Ramayana]]. He dismantled long-cherished beliefs of good and evil, questioning the idea of victory and defeat. [[Asura: Tale of the Vanquished|Asura]] sold 1,30,000 copies, but Neelakantan is far from finished. Now, Ajaya: Roll Of The Dice, takes on the [[Mahabharata]], this time focusing on the ‘unconquerable’ Kauravas."&lt;ref name=hindustantimes&gt;Apekshita Varshney (18 January 2014). ''[http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/retelling-mahabharata-why-kauravas-are-villain-heroes-to-anand-neelakantan/story-22ziggKXECgsyZNV8GBxZN.html Retelling Mahabharata: why Kauravas are villain-heroes to Anand Neelakantan]''. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Nerve rated it 3.5 out of 5 stating "The simple and gripping writing style coupled with fast-paced story throughout the book is sure to make you enjoy the book."&lt;ref name=indiannerve/&gt;

'''''Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles''''' is a 1997 non-fiction book about [[Area 51]] in Nevada by David Darlington.

==Reception==
A review in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' called the book "a real service" for readers interested in the early history of the site, but also scolded the author for entertaining "alien seekers, the tragically abducted, and self-appointed aliens ... saucer nuts" whose record "drown[s] out any legitimate inquiry into how much secrecy and how large a restricted compound the government needs to conduct [[Black budget|black-budget activities]]".&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt; [[The A.V. Club]] called it "a definitive work on the place and its hold on our collective psyche" and "wonderfully even-handed" towards [[Ufology|Ufologists]] who speculate about "the physically impossible".&lt;ref name=Krewson/&gt;

== Early period ==

The first mention of Japan in [[Bahá'í literature]] is with the [[Secret of Divine Civilization]] written by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in 1875. It was written to try to enlighten [[Persia]]. It says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;…the government of Japan was in the beginning subject to and under the protection of China, and that now for some years, Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the techniques of contemporary progress and civilization, promoting sciences and industries of use to the public, and striving to the utmost of their power and competence until public opinion was focused on reform. This government has currently advanced to such a point that, although its population is only one-sixth, or even one-tenth, that of China, it has recently challenged the latter government, and China has finally been forced to come to terms. Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization bring honor, prosperity, independence and freedom to a government and its people.&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Firsts ===

Bahá'ís moved across Asia from the turn of the century. Bahá'ís were in [[Shanghai]] in 1902,&lt;ref name="hassal-china"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = China in the Baha'i Writings | work = Unpublished Articles | publisher = Bahá'í Academic Library | year = 2003 | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_china_bahai_history | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines|Philippines]] by 1944,&lt;ref name="bpg"&gt;{{Citation |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'í Faith in Taiwan|Taiwan]]&lt;ref name="brsims"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sims | first = Barbara R. | title = The Taiwan Bahá'í Chronicle: A Historical Record of the Early Days of the Bahá'í Faith in Taiwan | publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust of Japan | year = 1994 | location = Tokyo | pages = | url = http://bahai-library.com/sims_taiwan_bahai_chronicle | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in 1923,&lt;ref name="hassal-china" /&gt; and [[Macau]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Compiled by Sims | first = Barbara R. | title = The Macau Bahá'í Community in the Early Years | publisher = Bahá'í Academics Library | year = 1991 | location = Japan | pages = | url = http://bahai-library.com/sims_macau_bahai_community | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the Japanese contact with the religion came from the West. [[Kanichi Yamamoto]] was living in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii in 1902 where a Bahá'í, Elizabeth Muther, introduced him to the religion. Yamamoto wrote a letter to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and enters the history books as the first Japanese Bahá'í &amp;mdash; the second and third being [[Saichiro Fujita]] and Kenzo Torikai. The first Bahá'ís to visit Japan were [[Mason Remey]] and Howard C. Struve on December 27, 1909 who addressed an audience at a Tokyo [[YMCA]]. [[D. T. Suzuki]]'s wife, Beatrice, had multiple contacts with the Bahá'ís both in America and in Japan and was for a time considered a Bahá'í.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Tweed | first = Thomas A. | title = American Occultism and Japanese Buddhism | journal = Japanese Journal of Religious Studies | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–281 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/721.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Leach]] lived in Japan from 1909-1920 working on the [[Mingei]] arts and converted to the religion in 1940.

The first Bahá'í convert on Japanese soil was [[Kikutaro Fukuta]] in 1915, followed by the blind Russian youth [[Vasily Eroshenko]] who later drifted to communism.&lt;ref name="agnes12" /&gt; Also in 1915, [[Martha Root]] arrived for the first time in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Francis | first = N.

Cities where Bahá'ís traveled in this early phase include [[Kobe]], [[Kyoto]], [[Tokyo]], [[Hiroshima]] and this period also saw the first observances of the Bahá'í Holy Days of [[Naw Ruz]] and the [[Báb#Declaration to Mull.C3.A1 Husayn|Declaration of the Báb]].&lt;ref name="agnes12b"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=12–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1916 Fukuta and Eroshenko made the first contributions towards raising the first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] being raised in Wilmette, Illinois, USA.&lt;ref name="agnes19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1916 Eroshenko took a copy of [[Some Answered Questions]] with him when he traveled to [[Siam]] and [[Burma]]. The first Japanese woman to convert to the religion was Yuri Mochizuki in 1919.&lt;ref name="agnes30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=30, 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, Alexander and Oh Sang Sun made a trip from Japan to Korea, then under Japanese rule, for the first entry of the religion in that country.&lt;ref name="traces58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1992|pp=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also spent time with [[Shibusawa Eiichi]].&lt;ref name="traces62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1992|pp=62–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Fujita served as a secretary to [[Bahiyyih Khanum]] in communicating the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in late 1921.&lt;ref name="traces15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=15, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when women speaking in public was rare, two women, a Miss Mochizuki and Haruko Mori, spoke at the memorial service of the death of 'Abdu'l-Bahá held in Japan.&lt;ref name="traces38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp= 38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá meets ===

The Japanese Ambassador to Spain was staying in Paris when `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed there on his 1911 trip to the west and they met and had a prolonged conversation.&lt;ref name="blom" /&gt; In London in 1912, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá came in contact with the President of the [[Japan Women's University]]. It was this occasion that 'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the only prayer he wrote for the Japanese. It says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O God! The darkness of contention, strife and warfare between the religious, the nations and the people has beclouded the horizon of Reality and hidden the heaven of Truth! The world is in need of the light of Guidance! Therefore, O God! Confer Thy favor so that the Sun of Reality may illumine the East and the West.&lt;ref name="traces24"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In New York he met several Japanese as well.&lt;ref name="agnes4" /&gt; On September 12, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá reached Chicago. Fujita attempted to connect with ‘Abdu'l-Bahá at Cleveland but caught up with him in Chicago. Fujita would accompany ‘Abdu'l-Bahá across many American cities including Kenosha, Wisconsin, St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, Denver and Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, and San Francisco and Stanford, California&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; - Fujita would serve between the World Wars first in the household of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá and then of Shoghi Effendi. On October 22, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá reached San Francisco where he met Yamamoto who arranged for a presentation among a Japanese audience in Oakland.&lt;ref name="traces1" /&gt;

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá writes to Japan and Korea ===

In all `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote 18 tablets to Japanese living in Japan, and the last one was to the Koreans dated November 5, 1921. Eighteen of the nineteen Tablets were addressed to young people, and seven of these to girls of Tokyo. It is remarkable that the only Tablets to women in Asia were to three Japanese girls: Yuri Mochizuki who received three Tablets, Haruko Mori and Mikae Komatsu, each received one, and the group of girls who were sent two Tablets. ‘Abdu'l-Bahá made mentioned especially to the blind of Japan. He addressed five Tablets to three blind men.&lt;ref name="Alex43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ===

`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917 suggesting Bahá'ís take the religion to many places; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] but were delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá | others = Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, trans. and comments | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; One tablet says in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá” in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.…

…if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of [[Bahá'í Faith in Australia|Australia]], [[New Zealand]], Tasmania, also to Japan, [[Russian Empire#Government and administration#Provincial administration|Asiatic Russia]], [[Korea]], [[French Indochina]], [[Siam]], [[Straits Settlements]], [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Afghanistan]], most great results will be forthcoming.&lt;ref name="tab1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Growth to WW II ==

The Bahá'ís in Japan were witness to, and participated in the relief effort of, the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].&lt;ref name="traces67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=67–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moneys and letters of concern arrived from Bahá'ís in New York, Haifa, Kenosha, Wi., Brooklyn, Chicago, Somerville, Mass., Montreal, Canada among other places spreading encouragement and reporting on or actually sending funds Bahá'ís and others had marshaled for the relief effort.&lt;ref name="alex48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 [[Hands of the Cause#Appointments#First contingent, appointed 24 December 1951 by Shoghi Effendi|Siegfried Schopflocher]] visited Japan and reported the religion was firmly established and progressing.&lt;ref name="alex54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1932 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in Tokyo. There was a preliminary election that corrected when Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, specified rules that needed to be followed for the election. The members of the community of Tokyo were (former Rev.) Sempo Ito; Yuri Mochizuki Furukawa; Otoe Murakami; Kanae Takeshita; Mr. Y. Kataoka (first name unknown); Keiji Sawada; Agnes Alexander; Antoinette Naganuma; Mr. Nakanishi (first name unknown); Hidehiko Matsuda; and Keiko Eito. The first nine names were elected to the provisional Local Spiritual Assembly but the later official election changed adding Mr. Matsuda, who took the place of Mr. Y. Kataoka, who asked to be relieved. The members included five women and two who were blind. The assembly was reelected in 1933.&lt;ref name="traces20" /&gt; In all of Japan there were 19 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="traces64" /&gt; In 1916 Daiun Inouye was a young Buddhist priest when he first heard of the religion. In 1932 he translated [[Bahá'í literature#Bibliography#Other authors#Esslemont, J.E.|Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era]] and it was printed the following year. In 1937 he resigned from the priesthood and wrote that he would be free to spend his time propagating the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="traces54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=54–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1920s, Alexander began various trips and coming contact with public figures in Japan and some publications reached a broader audience. In 1923 Alexander first visited Hong Kong and returned on several more over the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Baha'i Faith in Hong Kong | work = approved for publication by the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Hong Kong | publisher = Japanese affiliate of the Association of Bahá'í Studies | year = 2008 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_bahai_hong_kong | accessdate = 2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also accompanied Root on one of her return trips to the area - this time on a trip to China and Alexander made contacts among the Chinese, especially from Canton and Shanghai,&lt;ref name="alex55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1977|pp=55–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; who visited Japan as well.&lt;ref name="traces73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 seven specially bound volumes of Bahá'í books were presented for the coronation of the emperor [[Hirohito]] and were part of his library and at the Enthronement Ceremonies of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan three foreigners were invited to speak, including Alexander as a Bahá'í representative.&lt;ref name="traces81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=81–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 Esperantist Tadashi Watanabe invited Alexander to talk about the Bahá'í Faith and Esperanto first in [[Tomakomai]], and then the then-village of [[Yamabe Station|Yamabe]], Hokkaido.&lt;ref name="traces87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=87–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crisis of WW II ==

In 1937 Alexander went on [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] and, aware of the impossibility of returning to Japan during the [[Second World War]], traveled to other countries.&lt;ref name="traces115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=115–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Fujita was excused from his services in Haifa out of fears for his safety during the war and returned to Japan until circa 1956.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; In 1942 back in the United States the Yamamoto family lived at a [[Japanese American internment|relocation camp]] &lt;!-- Sims in 1989 claims in Parlier Ca in 1942 but see http://home.comcast.net/~chtongyu/internment/camps.html - no relocation camp near Parlier, but there was an assembly camp near Fresno, near Parlier for much of 1942 --&gt; during the war.&lt;ref name="traces15" /&gt; Two children — one from Nagasaki and one from Hiroshima — later converted to the religion and have shared their story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= |first= |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=Hiroshima Commemorations |periodical=The Scottish Bahá’í |volume=Autumn, 2005 |issue=41 |pages= |year=2005 |url=http://www.breacais.demon.co.uk/sbn/sbn41/news-ma1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922151834/http://www.breacais.demon.co.uk/sbn/sbn41/news-ma1.htm |archivedate=2008-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'í Americans associated with the [[Occupation of Japan|American Occupation Forces]] reconnected the Japanese Bahá'í community: They were Michael Jamir, Lorraine Wright, and Robert Imagire. Jamir in particular undertook trips to find Torii and Fujita circa 1945-6.&lt;ref name="traces115" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Honnold | editor-first = Annemarie| authorlink = | first= Michael|last=Jamir | title = Why They became Bahá'ís|chapter=The First Generation Bahá'ís by 1963 | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India | year = 1993 | location = | pages = 74–79 | url = | isbn = 81-85091-72-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagire arrived in 1947 and was given an address where Alexander had left her printed materials. He found the only building still standing after the bombing held 200 copies of ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' in Japanese. In 1948 Imagire helped re-elect the assembly in Tokyo. While all the Japanese members were new Bahá'ís and eventually drifted into inactivity, the assembly was continually re-elected and remains today.&lt;ref name="traces115" /&gt;

Alexander was able to return to Japan in 1950 after being sponsored by Lt. J.C. Davenport (USAF) and in 1951 four American pioneers were elected to the Tokyo Local Spiritual Assembly. The Japanese membership then was Miss Ichige, Mr. Kadota, Mr. Horioka, Miss Nakanishi, and Mr. Yoshino. The Americans were Alexander, Lane Skelton, Barbara Davenport, and Imagire.&lt;ref name="traces117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=117–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly designated goal areas to take the religion — Yokohama, Sendai, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Kofu — and established eight committees with attention ranging from re-translating ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' to coordinating membership record keeping and the arrival of Persian pioneers. The Moghbel and Katirai Persian families arrived in 1953. In 1954 the community was 52 adults — 10 were Americans and 13 were Persians.&lt;ref name="traces126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=126–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Sims, one of the American pioneers, was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo in 1954 and served for many years on that body and authored several books on the history of the Bahá'í Faith in Japan.

The first center owned by the Bahá'í assemblies in Japan was in [[Amagasaki]] in 1953. The Tokyo assembly bought a house; it became the second Bahá'í Center in 1954. The third one was in [[Osaka]].&lt;ref name="traces132,134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims|1989|pp=132, 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 there were eight assemblies in Japan and the community had marshaled resources to publish a Japanese language Bahá'í ''Geppo'' (monthly newspaper) which was also read in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/east-asia/korea/korea.7.html The First Local Spiritual Assemblies in Korea, 1956]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Sims was elected to the first regional National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia, and Alexander was appointed as one of the [[Hands of the Cause]], a position which she held the rest of her lifetime.

== Post-War growth ==

In 1963 the statistics of Bahá'í communities showed 13 assemblies, 9 groups of Bahá'ís, and 31 isolated Bahá'ís.

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Bahá'í community of Japan has grown and developed strength in diverse interests. The Japanese census does not have questions regarding religion however the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 15,700 Bahá'ís in 2005&lt;ref name="WCE-05" /&gt; while the [[CIA World Factbook]] estimated about 12,000 members in 2006.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; In 2005 there were 31 delegates to the National Convention to elect the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Baha'is hold unique democratic elections | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | pages = | date = 2005-05-18 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Japan rose in support of a United Nations human rights resolution about concern over the Bahá'ís in Iran as well as taking steps to further document conditions.&lt;ref name="UN4"&gt;United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

=== Academics ===

In 1991 the community organized an affiliate of the [[Association for Bahá'í Studies]] in Japan which has since held annual conferences, published newsletters, and published and coordinated academic work across affiliates.&lt;ref name="yerrin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.125.45.102/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://members9.tsukaeru.net/ablaze/10PhtGrp003-09-19.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522association%2Bof%2BBaha%2527i%2Bstudies%2522%2Bjapan%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26sa%3DN&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBJvmRkZd8x7wVx-F0tn7kOk5IbQ Eleventh Conference, Association of Baha'i Studies Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1999 ''Yerrinbool Report on Scholarship'' various Japanese academics are noted: [[Landegg Academy]] had a faculty member, Seinan Gakiun, from the University in Japan, Nozomu Sonda published a revision to an introductory book in Japanese, Mary Noguchi who chaired the 8th conference, Tsunoi Hiroshi who chaired the 2008 conference,&lt;ref name="abs-japan" /&gt; Sandra Sims Fotos chaired several of the conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandra Sims Fotos '60 - Bibliography |work=ASIJ Libraries |publisher=The American School in Japan |year=2008 |url=http://www.asij.ac.jp/japan/asij_authors/e_g/fotos.htm |doi= |accessdate=2008-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607181609/http://www.asij.ac.jp/japan/asij_authors/e_g/fotos.htm |archivedate=2007-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; physicist Stephen R.

The '''''Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is''''' is a translation and commentary of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The ''Bhagavad Gita''  emphasizes a path of devotion toward the [[personal God]], [[Krishna]]. It was first published in 1968 by [[Macmillan Publishers]] and is now available in nearly sixty languages&lt;ref name = hk34&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="translation"&gt;The [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] offers a 2006 {{cite web| url=http://www.bbt.info/files/languages/Books_in_Print_JUN06.pdf| title=summary PDF file showing which books have been translated into which languages.| publisher=www.krishna.com| accessdate=2008-05-30| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528180745/http://www.bbt.info/files/languages/Books_in_Print_JUN06.pdf| archivedate=28 May 2008| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is primarily promoted and distributed by followers of ISKCON.

==Contents==
For each verse, the book (in complete editions) includes the [[Devanagari]] script, a [[Latin script|Latin]] transliteration, word-for-word [[Sanskrit]]-[[English language|English]] meanings, and English translation. An extensive commentary by Prabhupada is given throughout, based on various Gaudiya Vaishnava works, including: [[Ramanuja]] Bhasya (in Sanskrit); Sarartha-varsini-tika (Sanskrit) by [[Visvanatha Chakravarti]] Thakura; Gita-bhusana-tika (Sanskrit) by [[Baladeva Vidyabhushana]]; and [[Bhaktivinode Thakur]]'s [[Bengali language|Bengali]] commentaries.

The narrative in the Bhagavad-Gītā concerns a dialogue between Lord [[Krishna]] and a mighty warrior named [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.  In the narrative, Lord Krishna has descended to earth to aid Arjuna in his battle against Kauravas and their army.  Lord Krishna assumes the role of Arjuna's chariot driver and aids him in the battle and reveals to Arjuna several divine truths about human existence in the material plane, the true nature of the supreme personality of God, and the method of eternal progression and release from the earthly cycles of death and rebirth through the practice of [[bhakti yoga]].  The narrative teaches that achieving Krishna consciousness and attaining the inner realization that all life is a manifestation of the eternal energy of Krishna will release an individual soul from the cycles of reincarnation and death and rebirth.  The narrative culminates with Krishna revealing to Arjuna his universal form which encompasses all life and material existence.  One notable event in the narrative is when Arjuna gazes at the opposing army of demons and sees his relatives fighting for the demonic army, he is filled with grief and remorse that he must kill his own flesh and blood.  In reply, Krishna reveals his true form to Arjuna and tells him that it does not matter if his relatives die in the battle today because they will eventually die anyway, and that Arjuna's duty to the supreme lord and his own self realization transcends his material attachments to his relatives.  The central message of the text is that nothing ever truly dies and that all life is in a continual cycle of death and rebirth, and that one has a duty to the process of self realization and progression in order to manifest the supreme personality of God and achieve Krishna Consciousness, thereby escaping the eternal cycles of death and rebirth.  

The book advocates the path of ''[[bhakti]]'' toward [[Krishna]], who is seen as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. It establishes that Krishna is not an incarnation, He is the cause of all causes. He is the source of all incarnations. He is even the cause of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/11/1|title=PrabhupadaBooks.com Srila Prabhupada's Original Books|website=prabhupadabooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It teaches the loving service of the transcendental personality of the Lord.

The Bhagavad Gita As It Is by Prabhupada has been praised by scholars and theologians for providing the Western reader the unique opportunity of seeing how a Krishna devotee interprets his own texts and for giving insights into the original and highly convincing ideas of the Gauḍiya Vaisnava school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/foreword|title=PrabhupadaBooks.com Srila Prabhupada's Original Books|website=prabhupadabooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

''Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is'' is written in the tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]]. Followers of the Vedas regard the ''Bhagavad Gita'' as the essence of the [[Veda|Vedic knowledge]] and the [[Upanishad]]s and  consider the book authoritative and literally true.

Some abridged editions of the Gita come with prefaces by [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Thomas Merton]]. The 1972 Macmillan "Complete Edition" includes a Foreword by Professor Edward C. Dimock, Jr. from the University of Chicago.

==Edition history==

A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the author, arrived in the United States in 1965. By 1966 he had founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in a storefront at 26 2nd. Ave New York City. At that time he was very anxious to publish his Bhagavad-gita As It Is.  [[Macmillan Publishers]] agreed to publish a 400-page version in 1968 but the original manuscript was over 1000 pages. So the first Macmillan edition was known as  the Abridged Edition.

By 1972 the sales of the Abridged edition were substantial and Macmillan agreed to publish the "Complete Edition".

In 1983, the [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] (BBT) published the "Revised and Enlarged" edition containing at least one thousand substantial changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookchanges.com/108-iskcon-bhagavad-gita-changes/|title=108 ISKCON Bhagavad Gita Changes - ISKCON &amp; BBT Prabhupada Book Changes|website=bookchanges.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes were justified as being 'closer to the original manuscript'. This 'Revised and Enlarged' edition has been very controversial among the followers of Srila Prabhupada. In 2001 Krishna Books Inc (KBI) who are licensed by the BBT reprinted the 1972 "Complete Edition" so now both the "Complete Edition" and the "Revised and Enlarged" edition are available.

==Distribution==
Prabhupada's translation is sold outside [[India]] due to the efforts of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] members on the streets, in airports, and in other public places. The book also enjoys brisk sales within India. It has been published in fifty-nine languages, including [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]],  [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Telugu language|Telugu]].&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt;

==Varnashrama dharma==
Socially, ''Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is'' suggests a way of life derived from the ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' and other books of Hindu religious and social law and applied for the contemporary Western world. In this way of life, ideal human society is described as being divided into four [[Varna (caste)|Varnas]] (''[[brahmana]]'' - intellectuals, ''[[kshatriya]]'' - administrators, ''[[vaishya]]'' &amp;ndash; merchants, ''[[shudra]]'' - workers). Within his writings Prabhupada supports the view that one becomes a member of one of the Varnas not by birth but by one's personal qualities ([[guna]]) and the type of work ([[karma]]) one actually performs ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060112020030/http://vedabase.net/bg/4/13/en BG 4.13]). Society is described as best ruled by a benevolent ''kshatriya'' sovereign, who is to govern according to rules set by scriptural tradition and preserved by self-controlled and pure-hearted spiritual leaders (''brahmanas''). The ''kshatriya'' sovereign (like courts in many democratic states) may also order [[death penalty|capital punishment]].

Brahmanas, elders, women, children and cows are said to deserve special protection, with animals, especially [[cow]]s, being preserved from slaughter at all costs. Prabhupada encourages readers to adopt a [[Lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and gives [[agriculture]] as the ideal economic basis of society. Ultimately Prabhupada gives the conclusion that society should be "Krishna conscious"—enlightened by devotion (''[[bhakti]]'') to [[Krishna]] ([[God]]).

In June 2011, a group linked to the Christian Orthodox Church had demanded a ban owing to an alleged "conflict of interests" between the [[Hinduism in Russia|Russian followers]] of [[Krishna]] and local authorities in the Siberian region of [[Tomsk]]. The case was dismissed by a federal judge on 28 December 2011.&lt;ref name=ban1&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita row: Russia court refuses to ban Bhagvad Gita|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/russian-court-refuses-to-ban-gita-report-161516|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian ambassador [[Alexander Kadakin]] condemned the "madmen" seeking the ban, underlining that Russia was a secular country:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declare Bhagavad Gita as national book, demands BJP|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220143222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

15,000 Indians in [[Moscow]], and followers of ISKCON in [[Russia]] asked the [[Indian government]] to intervene to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita row snowballs, India raises issue at 'highest levels'|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/gita-row-snowballs-india-raises-issue-at-highest-levels/articleshow/11180045.cms|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712122740/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/gita-row-snowballs-india-raises-issue-at-highest-levels/articleshow/11180045.cms|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 July 2012|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move triggered strong protests by [[Parliament of India|Members of Parliament]] as they wanted the Indian Government to take up the matter strongly with Russia.

The Buddhist stupa of Boudha Stupa dominates the skyline; it is one of the largest unique structure's stupas in the world. The influx of large populations of refugees from Tibet has seen the construction of over 50 [[gompa]]s (Tibetan [[vihara|convent]]) around Boudha. As of 1979, Boudha Stupa is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Along with [[Swayambhu (architecture)|Swayambhu]], it is one of the most popular [[tourism|tourist]] sites in the Kathmandu area.

The Stupa is on the ancient trade route from Tibet which enters the [[Kathmandu Valley]] by the village of Sankhu in the northeast corner, passes by Boudha Stupa to the ancient and smaller stupa of Chā-bahī named [[Charumati]] Stupa (often called "Little Boudhanath"). It then turns directly south, heading over the [[Bagmati River]] to [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]] - thus bypassing the main city of Kathmandu (which was a later foundation).&lt;ref name="Snellgrove, David p. 365" /&gt; Tibetan merchants have rested and offered prayers here for many centuries. When refugees entered Nepal from Tibet in the 1950s, many decided to live around Boudhanath. The Stupa is said to entomb the remains of [[Kassapa Buddha]].

==Mythology==
=== Legend of the construction of the stupa according to Newar Buddhist mythology ===
[[File:Khaasti Stupa in 1950 by William Morris.jpg|alt=Khaasti Stupa in 1950 by William Morris|left|thumb|Khaasti Stupa in 1950 by William Morris]]According to the history of [[Nepal]], the palace of King Bikramaditya ([[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] King) once stood where the [[Narayanhity Palace]] currently stands. King Vikramaditya instructed that a [[Dhunge Dhara]] should be built in the southern part of palace courtyard. But there was no sign of water from the Dhunge Dhara, for which the king consulted Astrologers. Astrologers suggested that a [[Human sacrifice]] with a male candidate having ''Battis-Lakshanas'', or ''thirty-two perfections''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rukshananewa.wordpress.com/home/khaasti/|title=खास्ति चैत्य? बौद्धनाथ ? झ्यारुङ खास्योर ?|date=2016-09-25|work=Rukshana Kapali|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be performed. 

Only the king himself and his two princes were suitable candidates. So, the king decided to sacrifice himself and ordered one of his sons to sacrifice him so that sign of water could be seen at the Dhunge Dhara. According to local mythology, during the time of sacrifice, the head flew off to a place nearby [[Sankhu Bajrayogini Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vijayvaani.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?aid=2267|title=Bikram Sambat in Nepal|website=www.vijayvaani.com|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:Head of king bikramaditya.jpg|thumb|Stone made Head of King Vikramaditya in Bajrayogini]]
[[File:Boudha Stupa 2018 04.jpg|thumb|The Great Stupa]]
The prince then with a regretful heart, flew a hen from the top of Bajrayogini and decided to construct a [[Stupa]] where the hen landed. The hen landed in the place where Boudhanath Stupa is currently standing. During the same time, the place was struck with a [[Drought]] and the people managed to abate the scarcity of water by collecting the droplets of [[dew]]. So, the place was named Khāsti as in [[Nepal Bhasa]], "khas" refers to dew and "ti" refers to drops. 

Later His Majesty Government of Nepal renamed the place from Khasti to Boudhanath in order to reflect [[Hinduism]] as being the Hindu Nation.

:"The village that surrounds the great Kāśyapa stupa is generally known by the name of Bauddha. ...which in Tibetan is called Yambu Chorten Chenpo (Tibetan: ཡམ་བུའི་མཆོད་རྟེན་ཆེན་པོ། Wylie: ''yam bu'i mchod rten chenpo''). Yam is the general name by which Patan area is known in Nepal Bhasa, thus it's called Yembu even today in most part of the Himalaya and Tibet, and Chorten Chenpo means great stupa. The real name of the stupa in full is, however, Jya Lung Khashor Chorten Chenpo, literally which may be translated as "Chorten of Hens skin-rope breach promise" The stupa has an interesting history of its own which explains this strange name. It is said in this story that Kāśyapa was a Buddha that lived a long time before Śākyamuni Buḍḍha. after Kāśyapa Buddha's demise, a certain old woman-Ma-jha-zi-ma (Tibetan: མ་བྱ་རྫི་མ། Wyle: ''ma bya rzi ma'')who owned hens farm, with her four sons, interred this great sage's remains at the spot over which the great mound now stands, the latter having been built by the woman herself. Before starting on the work of construction, she petitioned the King of the time to grand a land size of a piece of skin and obtained permission to "proceed with" building a tower. the king was surprised how she going to build it on such small size of land, and gave her both land and permission. She then carefully cut the skin and made skin-rope ''(lung)'' and circulate the area. Which become the size of present area of Bouddhanath. By the time that, as a result of great sacrifices on the part of the woman and her four sons, the groundwork of the structure had been finished, those who saw it were astonished at the greatness of the scale on which it was undertaken. Especially was this the case with the high officials of the country, who all said that if such a poor old dame were allowed to complete building such a stupendous tower, they themselves would have to dedicate a temple as great as a mountain, and so they decided to ask the King to disallow the further progress of the work. When the King was approached on the matter his Majesty replied: "I have finished giving the order to the woman to proceed with the work. Kings must not eat their words, and I cannot undo my orders now" which is known as ''(Kha-Shor),'' thus, the name came as Jya Lung Khashor. So the tower was allowed to be finished, and hence its unique name, "Jya Lung Kha-shor Chorten Chenpo." I rather think, however, that the tower must have been built after the days of Śākyamuni Buddha, for the above description from Tibetan books is different from the records in Sanskrit, which are more reliable than the Tibetan." the biggest stupa in Nepal&lt;ref&gt;[[Ekai Kawaguchi]].

==History==
The ''Gopālarājavaṃśāvalī'' says Boudhanath was founded by the Nepalese [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] king Śivadeva (c. 590-604 CE); though other Nepalese chronicles date it to the reign of King Mānadeva (464-505 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Rishikesh|authorlink=Rishikesh Shah|title=Ancient and Medieval Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYYaAAAACAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Ratna Pustak Bhandar|isbn=978-0-7855-0252-4|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrhard, Franz-Karl (1990). "The Stupa of Bodhnath: A Preliminary Analysis of the Written Sources." ''Ancient Nepal - Journal of the Department of Archaeology'', Number 120, October–November 1990, pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan sources claim a mound on the site was excavated in the late 15th or early 16th century and the bones of King [[Amshuverma|Aṃshuvarmā]] 605-621 were discovered there.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrhard, Franz-Karl (1990).

However, the emperor [[Trisong Detsen]] (r. 755 to 797) of the [[Tibetan Empire]] is also traditionally associated with the construction of the Boudhanath Stupa. The [[Yolmo people|Yolmo]] Shakya Zangpo from [[Helambu]] resurrected Boudhanath.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of the Great Stupa and The Life Story of the Lotus Born Guru'', pp. 21-29.

The [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]] badly damaged Boudhanath Stupa, severely cracking the spire. As a result, the whole structure above the dome, and the religious relics it contained had to be removed, which was completed by the end of October 2015. The reconstruction began on 3 November 2015 with the ritual placement of a new central pole or "life tree" for the stupa at the top of the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Buddhism in Iceland''' has existed since the 1990s after immigration from countries with Buddhist populations, mainly [[Thailand]]. As of 2008, there are three Buddhist organizations in Iceland officially recognized as religious organizations by the Icelandic government. The oldest and largest is the Buddhist Association of Iceland, a [[Theravada]] group, which was recognized in 1996 and had 880 members in 2010. Another group, Zen in Iceland – Night Pasture, a [[Zen]] group, was recognized in 1999 and had 75 members in 2010. The most recent group is, SGI in Iceland, a [[Soka Gakkai]] group, which was recognized in 2008 with 135 members. Together, these three organizations represent approximately 0.3% of the population of Iceland. This is more than [[Islam in Iceland|the Islamic groups]] but less than [[Ásatrúarfélagið|the pagan groups]].

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
The '''Chandelas of Jejakabhukti''' were a royal dynasty in [[Central India]]. They ruled much of the [[Bundelkhand]] region (then called ''Jejakabhukti'') between the 9th and the 13th centuries.

The Chandelas initially ruled as feudatories of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s of [[Kanyakubja]] (Kannauj). The 10th century Chandela ruler [[Yashovarman (Chandela dynasty)|Yashovarman]] became practically independent, although he continued to acknowledge the Pratihara suzerainty. By the time of his successor [[Dhanga]], the Chandelas had become a sovereign power. Their power rose and declined as they fought battles with the neighbouring dynasties, especially the [[Paramara]]s of [[Malwa]] and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]]. From the 11th century onwards, the Chandelas faced raids by the northern Muslim dynasties, including the [[Ghaznavid]]s and the [[Ghurid]]s. The Chandela power effectively ended around the beginning of the 13th century, following [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] and Ghurid invasions.

The Chandelas are well known for their art and architecture, most notably for the temples at their original capital [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]]. They also commissioned a number of temples, water bodies, palaces and forts at other places, including their strongholds of [[Ajaigarh]], [[Kalinjar]] and their later capital [[Mahoba]].

== Origin ==

The origin of the Chandelas is obscured by mythical legends. The epigraphic records of the dynasty, as well as contemporary texts such as ''Balabhadra-vilasa'' and ''Prabodha-chandrodaya'', suggest that the Chandelas belonged to the legendary [[Lunar dynasty]] (''Chandravansha'').{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=3}} A 954 CE [[Khajuraho]] inscription states that the dynasty's first king [[Nannuka]] was a descendant of sage Chandratreya, who was a son of [[Atri]]. A 1002 CE Khajuraho inscription gives a slightly different account, in which Chandratreya is mentioned as a son of Indu (the Moon) and a grandson of Atri.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=4}} The 1195 CE Baghari inscription and the 1260 CE Ajaygadh inscription contain similar mythical accounts.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=5}} The ''Balabhadra-vilasa'' also names [[Atri]] among the ancestors of the Chandelas. Another Khajuraho inscription describes the Chandela king [[Dhanga]] as a member of the [[Vrishni]] clan of the [[Yadavas]] (who also claimed to be part of the Lunar dynasty).{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=3}}

The later medieval texts include Chandelas among the [[36 royal races|36 Rajput clans]]. These include ''Mahoba-Khanda'', ''Varna Ratnakara'', ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'' and ''Kumarapala-charita''. The ''Mahoba-Khanda'' legend of the dynasty's origin goes like this: Hemaraja, a priest of the [[Gahadavala|Gaharwar]] king of [[Varanasi|Benares]], had a beautiful daughter named Hemavati. Once, while Hemavati was bathing in a pond, the moon god [[Chandra]] saw her and made love to her. Hemavati was worried about the dishonour of being an unwed mother, but Chandra assured her that their son would become a great king. This child was the dynasty's progenitor Chandravarma. Chandra presented him with a [[philosopher's stone]] and taught him politics.&lt;ref name="Asopa1976"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jai Narayan Asopa |title=Origin of the Rajputs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_KznQEACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Bharatiya Publishing House |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=3}} The dynasty's own records do not mention Hemavati, Hemaraja or Indrajit. Such legends appear to be later bardic inventions. In general, the ''Mahoba-Khanda'' is a historically unreliable text.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=4}}

The British indologist [[Vincent Arthur Smith|V. A. Smith]] theorized that the Chandelas were of either [[Bhar]] or [[Gondi people|Gond]] origin. Some other scholars including [[R. C. Majumdar]] also supported this theory.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=6}} The Chandelas worshipped Maniya, a tribal goddess, whose temples are located at Mahoba and Maniyagadh.&lt;ref name="Ali_2008"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXVNBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |title=World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India |volume=1 |author=Ali Javid and Tabassum Javeed |publisher=Algora |year=2008 |isbn=9780875864822 |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, they have been associated with places that are also associated with Bhars and Gonds. Also, [[Rani Durgavati]], whose family claimed Chandela descent married a Gond chief of [[Mandla|Garha-Mandla]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=7}} Historian R. K. Dikshit does not find these arguments convincing: he argues that Maniya was not a tribal deity.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=8}} Also, the dynasty's association with Gond territory is not necessarily indicative of a common descent: the dynasty's progenitor may have been posted as a governor in these territories.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=7}} Finally, Durgavati's marriage to a Gond chief can be dismissed as a one-off case.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=8}}

==History==

=== Early rulers ===

The Chandelas were originally vassals of the [[Gurjara-Pratiharas]].&lt;ref&gt;Radhey Shyam Chaurasia, History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A. D.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nannuka]] (r. c. 831-845 CE), the founder of the dynasty, was the ruler of a small kingdom centered around [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sailendra Sen |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdW6lAEACAAJ |year=2013 |publisher=Primus |isbn=978-93-80607-34-4 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chandela inscriptions, Nannuka's successor [[Vakpati (Chandela dynasty)|Vakpati]] defeated several enemies.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=27-28}} Vakpati's sons [[Jayashakti]] (Jeja) and [[Vijayashakti]] (Vija) consolidated the Chandela power.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=30}} According to a [[Mahoba]] inscription, the Chandela territory was named "Jejakabhukti" after the Jayashakti.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=28}} Vijayashakti's successor [[Rahila]] is credited with several military victories in eulogistic inscriptions.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|pp=30-31}} Rahila's son [[Harsha (Chandela dynasty)|Harsha]] played an important role in restoring the rule of the Pratihara king [[Mahipala I|Mahipala]], possibly after a [[Rashtrakuta]] invasion or after Mahiapala's conflict with his step-brother [[Bhoja II (Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty)|Bhoja II]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|pp=32-35}}

=== Rise as a sovereign power ===

Harsha's son [[Yashovarman (Chandela dynasty)|Yashovarman]] (r. c. 925-950 CE) continued to acknowledge the Pratihara suzerainty, but became practically independent.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=36-37}} He conquered the important fortress of [[Kalanjara]].{{sfn|Sushil Kumar Sullerey|2004|p=24}} A 953-954 CE [[Khajuraho]] inscription credits him with several other military successes, including against [[Gauḍa (region)|Gaudas]] (identified with the [[Pala Empire|Palas]]), the [[Khasas]], the [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedis]] (the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]]), the [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosalas]] (possibly the [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamshis]]), the [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] (possibly a small tributary ruler), [[Malwa|Malavas]] (identified with the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]]), the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]], the [[Kasmira Kingdom|Kashmiris]] and the [[Gurjara]]s.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=42-51}} These claims appear to be exaggerated, as similar claims of extensive conquests in northern India are also found in the records of the other contemporary kings such as the Kalachuri king Yuva-Raja and the Rashtrakuta king [[Krishna III]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=42}} Yashovarman's reign marked the beginning of the famous Chandela-era art and architecture. He commissioned the [[Lakshmana Temple, Khajuraho|Lakshmana Temple]] at Khajuraho.{{sfn|Sushil Kumar Sullerey|2004|p=24}}

Unlike the earlier Chandela inscriptions, the records of Yashovarman's successor [[Dhanga]] (r. c. 950-999 CE) do not mention any Pratihara overlord. This indicates that Dhanga formally established the Chandela sovereignty.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=57}} A Khajuraho inscription claims that the rulers of [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]], Kratha (part of [[Vidarbha]] region), [[Kuntala country|Kuntala]], and [[Sinhala Kingdom|Simhala]] listened humbly to the commands of Dhanga's officers. It also claims that the wives of the kings of [[Andhra Kingdom|Andhra]], [[Anga]], [[Kanchi Kingdom|Kanchi]] and [[Rarh region|Raḍha]] resided in his prisons as a result of his success in wars. These appear to be eulogistic exaggerations by a court poet, but suggest that Dhanga did undertake extensive military campaigns.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=56}}{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=61-65}} Like his predecessor, Dhanga also commissioned a magnificent temple at Khajuraho, which is identified as the [[Vishvanatha Temple, Khajuraho|Vishvanatha Temple]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=69}}

Dhanga's successor [[Ganda (Chandela dynasty)|Ganda]] appears to have retained the territory he inherited.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=72}} His son [[Vidyadhara (Chandela king)|Vidyadhara]] killed the Pratihara king of [[Kannauj]] (possibly Rajyapala) for fleeing his capital instead of fighting the [[Ghaznavid]] invader [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=72-73}}{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=72}} Mahmud later invaded Vidyadhara's kingdom; according to the Muslim invaders, this conflict ended with Vidyadhara paying tribute to Mahmud.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=81-82}} Vidyadhara is noted for having commissioned the [[Kandariya Mahadeva Temple]].{{sfn|Sushil Kumar Sullerey|2004|p=26}}

The Chandela art and architecture reached its zenith during this period. The [[Lakshmana Temple, Khajuraho|Lakshmana Temple]] (c. 930–950 CE), the [[Vishvanatha Temple, Khajuraho|Vishvanatha Temple]] (c. 999-1002 CE) and the [[Kandariya Mahadeva Temple]] (c. 1030 CE) were constructed during the reigns of Yashovarman, Dhanga and Vidyadhara respectively. These [[Nagara architecture|Nagara-style]] temples are representative of the most fully developed style at Khajuraho.&lt;ref name="James_1994"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LwcBVvdqyBkC&amp;pg=PA234 |title=The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent |author=James C.

=== Decline ===
[[File:Kirtivarman Chandela visits the temple of Khajurahu.jpg|thumb|A 20th century artist's imagination of Kirtivarman Chandela visiting a [[Khajuraho]] temple]]
By the end of Vidyadhara's reign, the [[Ghaznavid]] invasions had weakened the Chandela kingdom. Taking advantage of this, the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] king [[Gangeyadeva|Gangeya-deva]] conquered eastern parts of the kingdom.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=89-90}} Chandela inscriptions suggest that Vidyadhara's successor [[Vijayapala]] (r. c. 1035-1050 CE) defeated Gangeya in a battle.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=88}} However, the Chandela power started declining during the Vijayapala's reign.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=101}} The [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty|Kachchhapaghatas]] of [[Gwalior]] probably gave up their allegiance to the Chandelas during this period.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=90}}

Vijayapala's elder son [[Devavarman (Chandela dynasty)|Devavavarman]] was subjugated by Gangeya's son [[Lakshmikarna|Lakshmi-Karna]].{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=91}} His younger brother [[Kirttivarman (Chandela dynasty)|Kirttivarman]] resurrected the Chandela power by defeating Lakshmi-Karna.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=94}} Kirtivarman's son [[Sallakshanavarman]] achieved military successes against the Paramaras and the Kalachuris, possibly by raiding their territories. A [[Mau]] inscription suggests that he also conducted successful campaigns in the Antarvedi region (the Ganga-Yamuna [[doab]]).{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=120-121}} His son [[Jayavarman (Chandela dynasty)|Jayavarman]] was of religious temperament and abdicated the throne after being tired of governance.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=126}}

Jayavarman appears to have died heirless, as he was succeeded by his uncle [[Prithvivarman]], the younger son of Kirttivarman.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=110-111}} The Chandela inscriptions do not ascribe any military achievements to him; it appears that he was focused on maintaining the existing Chandela territories without adopting an aggressive expansionist policy.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=111}}

=== Revival ===

By the time Prithvivarman's son [[Madanavarman]] (r. c. 1128–1165 CE) ascended the throne, the neighbouring [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] and [[Paramara]] kingdoms had been weakened by enemy invasions. Taking advantage of this situation, Madanavarman defeated the Kalachuri king [[Gayakarna|Gaya-Karna]], and possibly annexed the northern part of the [[Baghelkhand]] region.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=132}} However, the Chandelas lost this territory to Gaya-Karna's successor [[Narasimha (Kalachuri dynasty)|Narasimha]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=135}} Madanavarman also captured the territory on the western periphery of the Paramara kingdom, around [[Bhilsa]] (Vidisha). This probably happened during the reign of the Paramara king [[Yashovarman (Paramara dynasty)|Yashovarman]] or his son [[Jayavarman I (Paramara dynasty)|Jayavarman]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|pp=130-132}}{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=112-113}} Once again, the Chandelas could not retain the newly annexed territory for long, and the region was recaptured by Yashovarman's son Lakshmivarman.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=135}}

[[Jayasimha Siddharaja]], the [[Chaulukya]] king of Gujarat, also invaded the Paramara territory, which was located between the Chandela and the Chaulukya kingdoms. This brought him in conflict with Madanavarman. The result of this conflict appears to have been inconclusive, as records of both the kingdoms claim victory.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=133}} A [[Kalanjara]] inscription suggests that Madanavarman defeated Jayasimha. On the other hand, the various chronicles of Gujarat claim that Jayasimha either defeated Madanavarman or extracted a tribute from him.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|pp=133-134}} Madanavarman maintained friendly relations with his northern neighbours, the [[Gahadavala]]s.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=132-133}}

Madanavarman's son [[Yashovarman II (Chandela dynasty)|Yashovarman II]] either did not rule, or ruled for a very short time. Madanavarman's grandson [[Paramardi|Paramardi-deva]] was the last powerful Chandela king.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=130}}

=== Final decline ===

[[Paramardi]] (reigned c. 1165-1203 CE) ascended the Chandela throne at a young age. While the early years of his reign were peaceful, around 1182-1183 CE, the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] ruler [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] invaded the Chandela kingdom. According to the medieval legendary ballads, Prithviraj's army lost its way after a surprise attack by [[Ghurid|Turkic]] forces, and unknowingly camped at the Chandela capital [[Mahoba]]. This led to a brief conflict between the Chandelas and the Chauhans, before Prithviraj left for Delhi. Sometime later, Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom and sacked Mahoba. Paramardi cowardly took shelter in the [[Kalanjara]] fort. The Chandela force, led by [[Alha]], [[Udal of Mahoba|Udal]] and other generals, was defeated in this battle. According to the various ballads, Paramardi either committed suicide out of shame or retired to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]].{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=120-123}}

Prithviraj Chauhan's raid of Mahoba is corroborated by his Madanpur stone inscriptions. However, there are several instances of historical inaccuracies in the bardic legends. For example, it is known that Paramardi did not retire or die immediately after the Chauhan victory. He restored the Chandela power, and ruled as a sovereign until around 1202-1203 CE, when the Ghurid governor of [[Delhi]] invaded the Chandela kingdom.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=123-126}} According to ''Taj-ul-Maasir'', a chronicle of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], Paramardi surrendered to the Delhi forces. He promised to pay tribute to the Sultan, but died before he could keep this promise. His [[dewan]] offered some resistance to the invading forces, but was ultimately subdued. The 16th century historian [[Firishta]] states that Paramardi was assassinated by his own minister, who disagreed with the king's decision to surrender to the Delhi forces.{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=148}}

The Chandela power did not fully recover from their defeat against the Delhi forces. Paramardi was succeeded by [[Trailokyavarman]], [[Viravarman]] and [[Bhojavarman]]. The next ruler [[Hammiravarman]] (r. c. 1288-1311 CE) did not use the imperial title [[Maharajadhiraja]], which indicates that the Chandela king had a lower status by his time. The Chandela power continued to decline because of the rising Muslim influence, as well as the rise of other local dynasties, such as the [[Bundela]]s, the Baghelas and the [[Khangar (community)|Khangars]].{{sfn|R. K. Dikshit|1976|p=179}}

Hammiravarman was succeeded by Viravarman II, whose titles do not indicate a high political status.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=199}}{{sfn|Om Prakash Misra|2003|p=11}} One minor branch of the family continued ruling Kalanjara: its ruler was killed by [[Sher Shah Suri]]'s army in 1545 CE. Another minor branch ruled at [[Mahoba]]: [[Rani Durgavati|Durgavati]], one of its princesses married into the [[Garha Kingdom|Gond]] royal family of [[Mandla]]. Some other ruling families also claimed Chandela descent (see [[Chandel (Rajput clan)|Chandel]]).{{sfn|Romila Thapar|2013|p=572}}

== Art and architecture ==

The Chandelas are well known for their art and architecture. They commissioned a number of temples, water bodies, palaces and forts at various places. The most famous example of their cultural achievements are the Hindu and Jain temples at [[Khajuraho]]. Three other important Chandela strongholds were Jayapura-Durga (modern [[Ajaigarh]]), Kalanjara (modern [[Kalinjar]]) and Mahotsava-Nagara (modern [[Mahoba]]).{{sfn|Sushil Kumar Sullerey|2004|p=17}}

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; but the predominant religion is [[Islam]], practised by approximately 90% of the country's population.

The Christian community, situated mostly in the west and south of the country, is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]]; there are also several [[Protestant]] groups including Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and various small evangelical denominations.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; In 1963 the Gambia Christian Council was formed as an ecumenical association of Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

{{main|Roman Catholicism in the Gambia}}

In 1931 from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Senegambia]] was established [[Mission “sui iuris”]] of Gambia. In 1951 Mission was promoted as the [[Apostolic Prefecture]] of Bathurst, in 1957 promoted as Diocese of Bathurst in Gambia (renamed in 1974 as Diocese of Banjul).

Now there are about 42,400 (~2.4%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dbnjl|Diocese of Banjul|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics in the Gambia. The Diocese of Banjul is divided into 56 parishes.

Bishop [[Robert Ellison (Roman Catholic bishop)|Robert Ellison]] is the present Catholic Bishop of the diocese of Banjul.

==Anglicanism==
The [[Anglican Diocese of Gambia and the Rio Pongas]] was founded in 1935. [[John Daly (bishop)|John Daly]] was the first bishop of the new diocese. In 1951 five West African Anglican dioceses, including the Diocese of Gambia, were formed into the [[Church of the Province of West Africa]]. In 1985 from the Diocese of Gambia was separated the Diocese of Guinea and now the jurisdiction of Anglican Diocese of Gambia comprises the Republics of the Gambia, [[Senegal]], and [[Cape Verde]].

In 2000 the Church of the Province of West Africa adopted legislation permitting women priests, but only Liberia and the Gambia have passed enabling legislation and ordained women clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geoconger.wordpress.com/category/anglican-church-news/church-of-the-province-of-west-africa|title=Church of the Province of West Africa - Conger|website=Geoconger.wordpress.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church of the Creator''' is a Christian-based faith organization headquartered in [[Ashland, Oregon]].  It grew from a church association established in 1969 as '''Grace House Prayer Ministry, Inc.''', Chartered on July 14, 1975. The name of the corporation was changed in 1976, restructured in 1977, now the '''TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation-Family Of URI, Inc.''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/] California Charter, amendments are verifiable online via search at California Secretary of State, at this search page,  Check Corporation circle,  Search Criteria: enter=TE-TA-MA&lt;/ref&gt;  a California nonprofit [[public-benefit corporation]]. The Foundation, within public ministries, anchored through use, the name "Church of the Creator" first conceived in 1974. The Foundation registered the name Church of the Creator in Oregon in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egov.sos.state.or.us/br/pkg_web_name_srch_inq.login] Oregon Business Name Search, enter=Church Of The Creator&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation/Church is most notable for achieving protection of its [[Trademark|registered trademark]] Church of the Creator® through legal proceedings within US Federal Courts, "TE-TA-MA v World Church of The Creator"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofthecreator.com/images/PDF/TE-TA-MA_v_WCOTC_Case_Docket_US_7th_Northern_District_Court_Illinois.pdf] PACER: Court Docket: List of all entries, filings, in ® Trademark Litigation Case&lt;/ref&gt; and the Criminal Indictments,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/news/2003/01/08/white-supremacist-arrested-chicago] January 8, 2003 White Supremacists arrested in Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; trials and convictions that were precipitated during and after the litigation. This notable litigation, US Court Of Appeals OPINIONs included review of "name...genus" of religions, constitutional rights, intellectual property rights, re-defining what is unacceptable, "Vexatious litigation conduct."&lt;ref name=olsen&gt;{{cite article|title=Protecting Religious Identity with American Trademark Law  |author=Steven John Olsen}} (See [http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&amp;context=ckjip])&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Complaint, THE PARTIES, 4.  "…Church Of The Creator is associated with ministries located in the United States in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, as well as in Canada, South America and Europe."&lt;ref name="churchofthecreator.com"&gt;[https://www.churchofthecreator.com/images/PDF/TE-TA-MA_v_WCOTC_Complaint.pdf] PACER: Complaint, filed May 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

After a protracted legal battle, which culminated in a denied appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]], the Foundation was awarded sole usage of the name "Church of the Creator," which had also been part of the name of the white supremacist group "World Church of the Creator".  That racist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc.htm religioustolerance.org]&lt;/ref&gt; group is now known as the "[[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Alliance]]" and is not associated with the Oregon-based church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchofthecreator.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets, principles and practices==
The church is described in a dictionary of new religious movements as having a "synthesis of [[New Age]] thought, Christianity, and Jewish mystical ideas, such as [[kabbalah]] and [[gematria|gemiatry]].  Particular emphasis is given to the [[archangel Michael]] and high priest [[Melchizedek]]" and the goal of the church is unification of mankind "with the highest truth and justice for all".&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements |author=George D. Chryssides}} (See [https://books.google.com/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=james+germain+uri&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RL0fe3iWcL&amp;sig=UzXYUQpVySQAFbd77epgesKOliE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_tugVMD6AYOaNoS5hPgH&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20germain%20uri&amp;f=false Google books excerpt])&lt;/ref&gt;

Chryssides describes the church as having been founded in 1969 "by Dr. Grace Marama URI (1932-2006) and her husband, the Rev. Dr. James Germain URI."&lt;ref name=Chryssides/&gt;

According to Chryssides "There is one creative source of all being, with which humanity must align so that all thoughts all things become the manifestation of heaven on earth. "Love, Light and peace" are three key values. It is believed that intergalactic communicators can be summoned to act on humanity's behalf. Of particular assistance is a "tool of consciousness" known as "Divine Right Order®" is explained as an acronym for "Dedicated Individuals Viably Interconnecting New Endeavors; Redemptive Infusion God's Higher Truths; Overself Restoration Degeneration Eternally Redeemed."
Membership of the COTC includes all people and is by self-recognition. A member is one who accepts the Sacred Mandate, affirming the oneness of the universe's creative source and the aim of achieving the Divine Right Order in all things, thus securing the alignment between heaven and earth."&lt;ref name=Chryssides/&gt;

Church Organization, Beliefs, through exhibits submitted to the US 7th Circuit Court were reviewed in detail.  Judge Easterbrook in the opening statements of the Court Of Appeals OPINION: sets forth the "Treatise Of Joining In Principal and Witness", claim of membership described above by Cryssides, "Sacred Mandate" -  Church Of The Creator® Supports the Family Unification of Mankind In All Aspects Of The Whole. We of Like Mind Join Harmoniously In Oneness, Knowing That There Is Only One Creator Source. The Many In One Dedicate Our Physical Embodiments To The God Expression In Form, Bringing Forth By Example To This Planet Earth Love, Light and Peace. Therefore, Once Decreeing DIVINE RIGHT ORDER® In All Thoughts-All Things, Our Universe Automatically Aligns Into Manifestation of Heaven On Earth. Through The Priesthood of Melchizedek We Are One In The Body Of Jesus Christ. As Above So Below."  The Court further described this church as "descriptive" "distinctive not generic" stating ""Church of the Creator" as a denominational name leaves ample options for other sects to distinguish themselves and achieve separate identities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1260486.html] OPINION, United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit. No. 02-1381. Decided: July 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

COTC's Principle and Practice, use of the Decree "Divine Right Order®" is defined within the Ascension Glossary, "Stating Divine Right Order essentially means the evocation of the true spiritual law to be made present in all that governs time and space, and through one's own personal intent and consent, they are choosing the authority of Gods Natural Laws to be made manifested within their consciousness and throughout their creations. 
The delineation that is being made when invoking Divine Right Order is made through the statement, "not my will, but divine will", which is deferring to the highest expression that is possible in every moment. This also means the comprehension that the person that is asking for divine right order is acting upon their own Self-Determination, and the Law of Intent, in so to resolve the authority problem between the Negative Ego and the higher relationship they have with their inner spirit and God expression. It is a choice that is being made to relinquish ones personal control and will, releasing perceptions of needs and desires, with the consent to defer to the natural laws in Divine Right Order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Divine_Right_Order] Ascension Glossary, identifies, defines, the use of Divine Right Order, citation of COTC Principle &amp;  Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

The Concise Guide to Today's Religions and Spirituality, states: "Church of the Creator, Grace Marama URI – Ashland, OR: A NEW AGE group founded in 1969 as Grace House Prayer Ministry after URI, in an altered state of consciousness, was ordained into the Order, Brotherhood, and Priesthood of Melchizedek by the archangel Michael. In the mid -1970's the name was changed to Church of the Creator. The group teaches that members should develop their CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS and uplift humanity through the vibrational energy of the Feminine Principle. URI teaches that Jesus Christ is the Lifestream of Michael, and that the HOLY SPIRIT is the Divine Mother. In 1973 -74 the Cross released KARMA and allowed members to experience the New Birth."

==® Trademark litigation and "Ripple Effect"==
Suffering from confusion in the public mind and being mistaken, blamed, as responsible for despicable acts of violence, racial hatred, murder, and the publicity associated to such acts, the Foundation initiated litigation to protect its ® Registered Trademark Church Of The Creator.®  A Complaint for Trademark Infringement, was filed in the United States District Court For The Northern District of Illinois on May 2, 2002.&lt;ref name="churchofthecreator.com"/&gt;

While the Church of the Creator was headquartered in Ashland, Oregon, by 2000 it had ministries in 20 states, not including Illinois.  It reportedly "said the similar names and trademarks have left the mistaken impression that their church endorses [the Creativity Movement leader] Hale's racist messages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Sues Hale's Group Over Trademark |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=May 3, 2000 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, the church, represented by [[Kirkland &amp; Ellis]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/788635/te-ta-ma-truth-foundation-family-of-uri-inc-v-the-/ courtlistener] and [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2435592/te-ta-ma-truth-foundation-family-of-uri-inc-v-worl/? courtlistener 2]&lt;/ref&gt; won an appeals court ruling, and further in 2003 obtained a district judge's ruling of $1,000 per day fine to be applied against the Creativity Movement group, because that group's websites still came up in Yahoo and other internet searches in violation of the trademark ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hale church fined on trademark; U.S. judge sets penalty until it stops using name |author=Shia Kapos, Tribune staff reporter |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=April 25, 2003 |page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The substantial legal proceedings around the trademark concluded with a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Appeals Court]] in 2002;  there was a routine denial of further appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.churchofthecreator.org/TM/7th%20Circuit%20Opinion%20of%20July%2025,%202002.pdf |title=Appeals Court ruling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/297/f3d/662/te-ta-ma-truth-foundation-family-of-uri-inc-v-world-church-of-the-creator same ruling at OpenJurist.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] denial of further review ([[certiorari]]) was issued in January, 2003.{{cite web |url=http://www.churchofthecreator.org/TM/USSupremeCourtCertiorariDenied01-13-03.pdf |title=Supreme Court denial of certiorari) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027032845/http://www.churchofthecreator.org/TM/USSupremeCourtCertiorariDenied01-13-03.pdf |archivedate=2005-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens Against Hate, Nicole Nicholes, December 4, 2005 summarizes the trademark litigation… "This set the wheels in motion and caused Hale to seek the murder of Judge Joan Lefkow, the judge in the case. During that case, it was also determined that many "Creators" could be held responsible for the hefty fines that were imposed. Many of the members ran for cover as they didn't want to be responsible for paying the price of their involvement. .. That is a brief summary of a very dynamic laden situation with more twists and turns than a coal mine."

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) through Chicago Regional Director Lonnie Nasatir recognized the Foundation stating, "The recent trial and conviction of Bill White here in Chicago for his threats against the jury foreperson in the Matthew Hale trial gave us reason to consider the long and tangled web of events that ultimately led to this point. This inevitably included the work of you and your colleagues in defending your legal rights resulting eventually in the dismantling of what was, as you know, then the second largest neo-Nazi organization in the United States. Your efforts have had a positive [[ripple effect]] ever since then and the absence of this group has clearly enhanced the TE-TA-MA Foundation's stated goal of pursuing universal tolerance and social harmony…."

On January 9, 2003, [[Matthew F. Hale]] was arrested and charged with attempting to direct security chief Anthony Evola to murder judge [[Joan Lefkow#Matthew Hale|Joan Lefkow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/hale/ushale0103ind.pdf |format=PDF |title=United States of America v.

According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), "After Hale was convicted of soliciting the murder of a federal judge in 2004 — and the group was ordered to change its name because of a ruling in a copyright [SIC - trademark] infringement trial — the once-formidable outfit now known as the Creativity Movement all but collapsed, leaving only weak remnants."

"Plaintiff identifies himself as a member of World Church of the Creator ("WCOTC"). (Compl. at 3.) In 2002, WCOTC lost a trademark-infringement lawsuit to TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation-Family of URI, Inc., prohibiting WCOTC from continuing to use the name World Church of the Creator. TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation — Family of URI, Inc. v. World Church of Creator, 297 F.3d 662 (7th Cir. 2002). Defendants assert that WCOTC subsequently changed its name to "Creativity." (MSJ at 4.) … For consistency, the Court will refer in this order to plaintiff's alleged religion as "Creativity," to the associated overarching organization as the "[[Creativity Movement]]," and to Creativity's adherents as "Creators."… " Here, as discussed above, this Court has found plaintiff's evidence insufficient to support a finding that his beliefs are based on anything other than "purely secular considerations." See id. Accordingly, as plaintiff cannot meet his burden with respect to the issue of whether Creativity is a religion,…"     Maxine M. Chesney, District Judge.

The '''culture of Morocco''' reflects the [[Berbers|Berber]] and [[Arab]] influences represented by its population. The majority of [[Morocco|Morocco's]] population identifies as Berber and Arab. At least a third of the population speaks an [[Berber languages|Amazigh language]]. Following the [[Islamic conquests]], [[Arab tribes]] came to Morocco and settled in the low regions, such as [[Tadla]] and [[Doukkala]]. For example, there are groups called Charkawa and Arbawa who settled in Morocco from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. The Charkawa claimed to be descended from [[Umar ibn Al-Khattab]], the second [[caliph]] of [[Islam]].

==Literature==
{{Main|Moroccan literature}}

The history of Moroccan literature started in the early Middle Ages. In the era of the Berber dynasties, coinciding with the flowering of [[Al-Andalus]], there were several important Moroccan writers, especially in the fields of religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Ethnic groups and languages==
[[Image:Jüdische Hochzeit in Marokko-1024.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Jewish Wedding in Morocco by [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]

Morocco is considered by some as an Arab-Amazigh country. Others insist on the Amazigh-African identity of Morocco.

[[Classical Arabic]] and [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] are official language of Morocco. [[Classical Arabic]] rather than a mother tongue, and is used in a limited and formal socio-economic and cultural range of activities (like newspapers and official documents), in competition with French. The most common spoken languages of Morocco are [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] and [[Moroccan Arabic]].

Linguistically, Amazigh belongs to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic group]], and has many variants. The three main varieties used in Morocco are [[Shilha language|Shilha]], [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] and [[Riffian language|Riff]] (also called ''Tamazight'' by its speakers). Collectively, they are known as ''Shelha'' in Moroccan Arabic, and as ''Barbaria'' in the Classical Arabic used in the Middle East. The terms ''Barbar'' and ''Shelha'' are considered offensive by most Berber activists, who prefer the term ''Tamazigh''.

Shilha (also known locally as ''Soussia'') is spoken in southwest Morocco, in an area between Sidi Ifni in the south, Agadir in the north, and Marrakesh and the Draa/Sous valleys in the east. Central Atlas Tamazight is spoken in the Middle Atlas, between [[Taza]], [[Khemisset]], Azilal, and Errachidia. Riff is spoken in the Rif area of northern Morocco in towns like [[Nador]], [[Al Hoceima]], [[Ajdir]], [[Tétouan]], [[Taourirt, Morocco|Taourirt]], and [[Taza]].

Most Amazigh embraced Islam quickly, though their non-Arab ethnic and linguistic distinction has resisted the Arab-Islamic influence. Hundreds of Amazigh (Berber) associations have been created to defend their culture and identity in the last few decades in Morocco and Algeria. Newsstands and bookstores in all the major cities are filled with new Berber publications that provide articles and essays about the Amazigh culture and art. In 1994, the state-owned TV station RTM (now ''TVM'') started broadcasting a daily, 10-minute-long news bulletin in the 3 Berber dialects. Berber activists are repeatedly demanding a 50% share of broadcasting time in standardized Berber (Tamazight) on all state-owned TV channels. There is also a national Tamazight channel in Morocco, called [[Tamazight TV]]. It opened in 2010, and broadcasts for over 13 hours a day, with an extended broadcast on weekends..

== Religious celebrations ==
Morocco' official religion is Islam. Throughout the year, Moroccans life is rhythmed by many religious celebrations like [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid al-Adha|Eid Al Adha]]. During these celebrations, most of them being public holidays, Moroccans focus on praying and spending time with their family. Other religious celebrations include the [[Jumu'ah|Friday weekly prayer]] where most Moroccans go to the mosque for the Friday mid-day prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://moroccanzest.com/morocco-culture-and-religion-facts/|title=Morocco Culture &amp; Religion {{!}} MoroccanZest|last=|first=|date=2018-08-20|work=Moroccan Zest|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maroc Marrakech Bahia Luc Viatour 3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Moroccan ''[[kaftan]]'']]
The traditional dress for men and women&lt;ref&gt;https://www.morocco-guide.com/culture/traditional-clothing/&lt;/ref&gt; is called ''[[djellaba]]''; a long, loose, hooded garment with full sleeves. The djellaba has a hood that comes to a point called a ''qob''. The ''qob'' protects the wearer from the sun or in colder climates, like the mountains, the ''qob'' keeps in body heat and protects the face from falling snow. For special occasions, men also wear a red cap called a ''bernousse'', more commonly referred to as a ''[[Fez (hat)|Fez]]''. Women wear ''[[kaftans]]'' decorated with ornaments. Nearly all men, and most women, wear ''[[balgha]]'' (بلغه) —- soft leather slippers with no heel, often dyed yellow. Women also wear high-heeled [[Sandal (footwear)|sandals]], often with silver or gold [[tinsel]].

The distinction between a ''djellaba'' and a ''kaftan'' is the hood on the ''djellaba'', while a ''kaftan'' does not. Most women's ''djellabas'' are brightly colored and have ornate patterns, stitching, or beading, while men's ''djellabas'' are usually plainer and colored neutrally.

===Movies in Morocco=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Black Hawk Down (film)]] --&gt;
{{See also|List of foreign movies shot in Morocco}}

Some directors have set films in Morocco. In 1952 [[Orson Welles]] chose [[Essaouira]] as the setting for several scenes in his adaptation of Shakespeare's "Othello", which had won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film at that year's [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1955, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] directed ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' and in 1962, [[David Lean]] shot the [[Tafas]] Massacre scene of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' in the city of "Ouarzazate", which houses [[Atlas Studios]]. [[Aït Benhaddou]] has been the setting of many films. The film ''[[Hideous Kinky]]'' was filmed in Marrakech. &lt;!-- Would be nice to have something about films made in Morocco by Moroccans! --&gt;

==Gardens==

Morocco has many beautiful gardens, including the [[Majorelle Garden]] in [[Marrakech]] and the [[botanical garden]] in [[Rabat]].

==Domestic architecture==
{{Main|Moroccan architecture}}
[[File:Moroccan white corner, Fez.jpg|thumb|Taraditonal Moroccan metalwork, [[Fes]]. 2004 photo ]]
''Dar'', the name given to one of the most common types of domestic structures in Morocco, is a home found in a ''medina'', or walled urban area of a city.  Most Moroccan homes traditionally adhere to the ''Dar al-Islam'', a series of tenets on Islamic domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;Verner, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dar'' exteriors are typically devoid of ornamentation and windows, except occasional small openings in secondary quarters, such as stairways and service areas.  These piercings provide light and ventilation.&lt;ref name="Verner, 2004, p.41-42"&gt;Verner, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dars'' are typically composed of thick, high walls that protect inhabitants from thievery, animals, and other such hazards; however, they have a much more symbolic value from an Arabic perspective. In this culture the exterior represents a place of work, while the interior represents a place of refuge.&lt;ref&gt;Verner, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Moroccan interiors are often very lavish in decoration and craft.

Consistent with most [[Islamic architecture]], ''dars'' are based around small open-air patios, surrounded by very tall thick walls, to block direct light and minimize heat.&lt;ref name="Verner, 2004, p.41-42"/&gt;  Intermediary triple-arched porticos lead to usually two to four symmetrically located rooms.  These rooms have to be long and narrow, creating very vertical spaces, because the regional resources and construction technology typically only allow for joists that are usually less than thirteen feet.&lt;ref name="Verner, 2004, p.41-42"/&gt;

Upon entering a ''dar'', guests move through a zigzagging passageway that hides the central courtyard. The passageway opens to a staircase leading to an upstairs reception area called a ''dormiria'', which often is the most lavish room in the home adorned with decorative tilework, painted furniture, and piles of embroidered pillows and [[Moroccan rugs]].  More affluent families also have greenhouses and a second ''dormiria'', accessible from a street-level staircase.  Service quarters and stairways were always at the corners of the structures.&lt;ref name="Verner, 2004, p.41-42"/&gt;

==Contemporary Art==

Contemporary Art in Morocco is still in the making yet with a great potential for growth. Since the 1990-2000s Moroccan cities have welcomed institutions contributing to the diffusion of contemporary art and visual arts: [[L'appartement 22]] and Radioapartment22 in Rabat, the Cinémathèque de Tanger in Tangier, [[La Source du Lion]] in Casablanca, Dar Al-Ma'mûn residency and center, the Marrakech Art Fair, and the [[Arts in Marrakech (AiM) International Biennale|Marrakech Biennale]] all in Marrakech.

Local art galleries such as Galerie Villa Delaporte, Atelier 21, Galerie Matisse and Galerie FJ are also platforms showing, to a certain extent, contemporary artwork and contributing to its development.&lt;ref&gt;Bérénice Saliou. [http://www.cataloguemagazine.net/contemporary-art/magazine/article/art-contemporain-au-maroc/]. Contemporary Art Magazine, Issue 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Global art market also participates in developing and giving visibility to contemporary art in Morocco. International exhibitions such as "Africa Remix" (2004) and "Uneven Geographies" (2010) featured contemporary artists from North Africa, including Moroccan ones. Regional events such as the [[Dakar Biennale]] (or Dak'Art – Biennale de l'Art Africain Contemporain), which is a major [[contemporary African art]] exhibition and gives greater visibility to artists from this continent.

===Moroccan Artists and their Initiatives===

Artists born in Morocco or with Moroccan origins include such as [[Mounir Fatmi]]. Other artists include Latifa Echackhch, Mohamed El Baz, Bouchra Khalili, Majida Khattari, Mehdi-Georges Lahlou, and the young Younes Baba-Ali.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

There are several initiatives from Moroccan artists to help developing a contemporary art market in the country. For example, artists such as Hassan Darsi created La Source du Lion in 1995, an art studio who welcomes artists-in-residence, and [[Yto Barrada]] founded the Cinémathèque de Tanger in 2006, which is dedicated to promote Moroccan cinematographic culture. A group of Moroccan artists called Collectif 212 features Moroccan artists such as Amina Benbouchta, Hassan Echair, Jamila Lamrani, Safâa Erruas and Younès Rahmoun. This group is committed to develop more artistic experiences and collaborates with other promising artists such Hicham Benohoud.

There are also promising local artists such as Batoul Shim and Karim Rafi, who both participated in the project "Working for Change", a project trying to act within the fabric of Moroccan society, during the 2011 [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Planel. [http://www.higheratlas.org/pdf/alice%20planel%20EN.pdf Traveling Back to Ourselves: The Maghreb as an Art Destination], p. 4, higheratlas.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Market ==
There's a bourgeoning market for modern &amp; contemporary art.According to the data compiles by [[Global Africa Art Market Report]] ,with South Africa and Nigeria, Morocco is among the most important marketplaces in Africa.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Moroccan cuisine}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
[[File:Couscous-1.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[couscous]] dish]]

Moroccan cuisine is home to [[Amazigh people|Berber]], and [[Al-Andalus|Moorish]]. It is known for dishes like the [[couscous]], [[tajine]], [[pastilla]] and others. Moroccan cuisine uses a lot of spices like [[cinnamon]], [[turmeric]], [[ginger]] and [[saffron]], giving it an original taste. Moroccans everyday go-to meal is the [[tajine]] as it is a balanced and quick to make meal. On special occasions, more complex meals like the Moroccan [[pastilla]] and some special pastries like ''gazelle corns'' and ''briwates'' are served for guests. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://moroccanzest.com/moroccan-food-you-must-try/|title=Moroccan Traditional Cuisine {{!}} What to Eat in Morocco {{!}} MoroccanZest|last=|first=|date=2018-07-28|work=Moroccan Zest|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweets like [[halwa]] are popular, as well as other sweets. Cuisines from neighbouring countries also influence the country's culinary traditions.

==Music==
Moroccan music is of Amazigh and Arab origins. Rock-influenced chaabi bands are widespread, as is trance music with historical origins in Muslim music.

Morocco is home to Andalusian classical music that is found throughout North Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in Cordoba, and the Persian-born musician Ziryab is usually credited with its invention. A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian Music and art is the brainchild of Morisco visual artist/composer/oudist Tarik Banzi, founder of the Al-Andalus Ensemble.

Chaabi ("popular") is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.

Popular Western forms of music are becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as fusion, rock, country, metal and, in particular, hip hop.

Morocco participated in the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest, where it finished in the penultimate position.

'''''De Constantia Sapientis''''' ({{lang-en|On the Firmness of the Wise}}) is a moral [[essay]] written by [[Seneca the Younger]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, sometime around 55 AD. The work celebrates the imperturbility of the ideal Stoic sage, who with an inner firmness, is strengthened by injury and adversity.

==Date and addressee==
The work is addressed to Seneca's friend [[Annaeus Serenus]] and written sometime between 47 and 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1-first=L. D.|author1-last=Reynolds|author2-first=M. T.|author2-last=Griffin|author3-first=E.|author3-last=Fantham |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012 |editor1-first=S|editor1-last=Hornblower|editor2-first=A|editor2-last=Spawforth |editor3-first=E|editor3-last=Eidinow| isbn=0199545561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Constantia Sapientis'' is one of a trio of dialogues addressed to Serenus, which also includes ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]'' and ''[[De Otio]]''.&lt;ref name="conte"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gian Biagio Conte|translator=J Solodow|title=Latin Literature: A History|publisher= JHU Press|date=4 Nov 1999 |isbn= 0801862531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior position [[Sage (philosophy)|the sage]] inhabits, of detachment from earthly future events of a detrimental nature, is the unifying theme of the dialogues.&lt;ref name="conte"/&gt; Since Serenus is portrayed as not yet a Stoic in ''De Constantia Sapientis'', it is usually considered the earliest of the three dialogues.&lt;ref name="smithy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Constantia Sapientis|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=121–6|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In ''De Constantia Sapientis'' Seneca argues that [[Stoicism]] is not as harsh as it first appears. Recalling the figure of [[Cato the Younger]] Seneca argues that Cato as a wise person suffered neither injury nor insult. Although Serenus objects to this paradox, Seneca provides further analogies to emphasize the impervious nature of the wise person. In chapter 5 Seneca distinguishes between ''contumelia'' (insults) and ''iniuria'' (injuries). The rest of the treatise through to chapter 19 consists of discussions on the nature of both themes, showing that the wise person is immune from both insults and injuries. Seneca concludes the treatise praising the idea of the wise person while offering practical advice for all of us who are imperfect.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], in [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern]] and [[Roman Rite|Latin]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesacredheart.com/dictnary.htm|title=Dictionary of Catholic Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the teaching of the [[Church Fathers]] which undergirds the [[theology]] of those communions, '''economy''' or '''oeconomy''' ({{lang-gr|οἰκονομία}}, ''oikonomia'') has several meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Lampe, et al., ''A Patristic Greek Lexicon'' (Oxford, 1968) 940–943.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic meaning of the word is "handling" or "disposition" or "management" or more literally "housekeeping" of a thing, usually assuming or implying ''good'' or ''prudent'' handling (as opposed to ''poor'' handling) of the matter at hand.  In short, ''economia'' is discretionary deviation from the letter of the law in order to adhere to the spirit of the [[Canon law|law]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].  This is in contrast to  [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]], or ''[[akribia]]'' ({{lang-gr|ακριβεια}})—strict adherence to the letter of the law of the church.

As such, the word "economy", and the concept attaching to it, are utilized especially with regard to two types of "handling": (a) ''divine economy'', that is, God's "handling" or "management" of the fallen state of the world and of mankind—the arrangements he made in order to bring about man's [[salvation]] after [[the Fall of Man|the Fall]]; and (b) what might be termed ''[[pastoral care|pastoral]] economy'' (or) ''[[ecclesiastical]] economy'', that is, the Church's "handling" or "management" of various pastoral and disciplinary questions, problems, and issues that have arisen through the centuries of Church history.

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology (''theologia'') and economy (''oikonomia''). "Theology" refers to the mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy" to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the ''oikonomia'' the ''theologia'' is revealed to us; but conversely, the ''theologia'' illuminates the whole ''oikonomia''. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works. So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm CCC §236].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Divine economy==
The divine economy, in the broadest sense, not only refers to God's actions to bring about the world's [[salvation]] and redemption, but to ''all'' of God's dealings with, and interactions with, the world, including the Creation.  In this sense, ''economy'', as used in classical Orthodox doctrinal terminology, constituted the second broad division of all Christian doctrinal teaching.  The first division was called ''theology'' (literally, "words about God" or "teaching about God") and was concerned with all that pertains to God alone, in himself—the teaching on the Trinity, the divine attributes, and so on, but not with anything pertaining to the creation or the redemption. "...The distinction between {{lang|grc|οικονομια}} and {{lang|grc|θεολογια}} ... remains common to most of the Greek Fathers and to all of the Byzantine tradition. {{lang|grc|θεολογια}} ... means, in the fourth century, everything which can be said of God considered in Himself, outside of His creative and redemptive economy. To reach this 'theology' properly so-called, one therefore must go beyond ... God as Creator of the universe, in order to be able to extricate the notion of the Trinity from the cosmological implications proper to the 'economy.'"&lt;ref&gt;V. Lossky, ''In the Image and Likeness of God'' (Crestwood, New York: St. Vladimir's, 1985), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical economy==
As noted above, ''economy'' also refers to the Church's "handling" or "management" or "disposition" of various pastoral and disciplinary questions, problems, and issues. Here again, "economy" is used in several ways.

In one sense, it refers to the discretionary power given to the Church by Christ himself to manage and govern the Church.  Christ referred to this when he gave the apostles the authority to "bind and to loose".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|16:19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|18:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This authority was transmitted to the bishops who came after the apostles.  In this sense "economy" means, as already noted, "handling", "management", "disposition". In general then, "economy" refers to pastoral handling or discretion or management in a neutral sense.

An example in the New Testament of the application of lenient economy, or "economy according to leniency", is found in Acts chapter 15, where the Apostles decided to limit the number and degree of Jewish observances that would be required of [[Gentile]] converts.  An example in the New Testament of the application of strict economy, or "economy according to exactness (or, strictness, preciseness) [''akribeia'']", may be seen in Acts 16:3, when St. Paul set aside the usual rule to [[circumcise]] Timothy, whose father was a Gentile, to placate certain [[Jewish]] Christians.  In both instances, economy was exercised to facilitate the salvation of some of the parties involved.

In Orthodox Church history, examples and instances of economy abound.  Since ancient times, converts to the Church who were coming from certain heretical groups were not required to be baptized, even though the normal path of entrance to the Church was through baptism.  Thus the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, decided that under specific conditions, the application of economy (i.e. according to leniency) would be the norm in this matter.  But since the usual rule is baptism, such leniency can easily be, and sometimes has been, suspended (usually in periods when the heretical groups in question were actively opposing the Church).  In these cases, the Church returned to her customary usual rule of "exactness," not applying economy (or not applying economy according to lenience).  In calling for the reception of converts into Orthodoxy through means other than baptism in certain cases, the Ecumenical Councils made no determination regarding the existence of sacraments outside of Orthodoxy, but only addressed the situation of the convert to Orthodoxy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Bearing a name appropriate to the usage of a significant amount of its land, '''Al-Fakiha'''  ({{lang-ar|فاكهة}}, literally "fruits") is a village in [[Baalbek-Hermel Governorate]], [[Lebanon]]. The village is separated into three neighborhoods: ''Jdaydi'', ''Zaytoun'' and ''Fakiha'', the grouping adopting the name of the third one.

==Fakiha neighbourhood==
The Fakiha sub-village is mostly [[suburbia]] with houses built very close to each other if not on top of each other or connected in some other way. As a result, a close-knit community has developed in the village, despite two major religions being present: [[Sunnite]] Muslim and Melkite [[Greek Catholic Church]].
The most  authentic  families in Fakiha zaytoun and jdeideh like bayt Aoun and Kibar as they are have lived in this domain much longer than all the other families . The village is mainly Sunni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMOnthly-Municip-E91-Feb10.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111732/http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMOnthly-Municip-E91-Feb10.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zaytoun==
Zaytoun (literally "[[olive]]s") is a much more spaced section. The houses are built more modernly and spaciously, each boasting a large block of land (at least two to three acres). The land is used to its full potential, with the agriculture including an abundance of olive groves, orchards of [[apricot]] and [[ficus|fig]] trees as well as a variety of other fruits and vegetables depending on the whim of the farmer and his intention of use of the [[crops]].

Within Zaytoun is a branch of the Omar El-Mokhtar educational facilities called Al-Qayrawaan. It is one of the few in the area that supports a K-9 English/Arabic curriculum with highly qualified staff. The sciences, mathematics and a language subject is taught in English, whereas the humanities and a language subject are taught in Arabic. Moreover, extra-curriculum subjects are available. The community present in Zaytoun shares the closeness of that of Fakiha despite the more spaced housing. However, its population is completely of the [[Sunni]] Muslim faith.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:jdeide2.jpg|jdeide
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Jdeide or al jdeideh==
The last of the three sections is the Jdaydi sub-village. It is similar in structure to Zaytoun, but the difference is that the housing is less spacious as is the land allotments. The community in Jdaydi is not as close-knit as the former two, with the tendency to form social groups more noticeable, especially among the youth. The population is a mixture of Sunni Muslim and the [[Catholic]] church.
Jdeide or Djedeideh is very famous in the second world war as Djedeide Fortress or Djedeideh Gorge
^^The defence was to be based on a number of ‘fortresses’, corresponding more or less to the desert ‘boxes’, covering all the routes down through Syria. The Division's particular responsibility, the Djedeide fortress, was an important one, blocking the Bekaa valley, for centuries a north-south highway pointing at Palestine and Egypt. Near the little village of Djedeide the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges bounding this valley converged, making a naturally strong position that would be difficult to get at from a flank. The fortress was to be tank-proof, dug for all-round defence, and stocked with two months' supplies. All this was to be done by mid-May—Jerry, said the experts, would not be able to overcome all the obstacles separating him from Syria before the end of May at the earliest.
^The Djedeide fortress, sprawling across the valley and up the hills on either side, had already had some work done on it— an anti-tank ditch across the front was nearly finished. Fourth Brigade had the right-hand sector, consisting mostly of the forbidding Anti-Lebanon slopes; only 18 Battalion had a stretch of comparatively low, accessible ground. About a mile along the good main road running north from camp the unit's area began, and from there it stretched another mile and a half forward, astride the road, as far as Djedeide village, which was included in the front line. The battalion's mile and a quarter of front was to be held by two companies, B in Djedeide and on the valley floor to the left of the road, D among gardens and orchards on gentle slopes on the right flank, just above Djedeide. The rest of the unit was farther back, perched on hillsides on the right of the road, in the lee of a rocky spur which came down just behind Djedeide. The battalion's right-hand neighbour, 20 Battalion, looked down on it from the crags, while 18 Battalion itself looked down on the valley to its left, where other troops were later to come in and complete the line.

For two months the men worked at Djedeide, blasting away the hard rock, hewing out slit trenches and gun positions, living quarters and first-aid posts, observation posts and headquarters, the last-named roofed over and strengthened with heavy railway iron. Some natural caves provided ready-made dugouts without the hard work, once the traces of native occupation were cleared away. Everything was camouflaged, and an intricate system of dummy and alternative positions was built. The Syrians living nearby became very friendly after a while, and the first-aid posts found themselves acting fairy godmothers to the villagers, whose medical services seemed to be nil.

At first the men attacked the work with enjoyment. It was a novelty to be in cultivated country, or even on a rocky hill, after the eternal sand and sameness of Egypt. The air was crisp and clear, the cold invigorating, and the weather for the first few days good. From about 18 to 25 March the retreating winter had a last fling, with vicious rainstorms, snow almost page 241 to the bottom of the hills, and freezing cold; but this ended very quickly, and by the end of the month the sun was out again and the valley warming up with the advance of spring. The oranges ripened and were a pleasant variation in the rations, succeeded by apricots as the weeks wore on.

The malarial season came too. The Bekaa valley is a highly malarious area, and from 4 April every possible weapon was turned against its bearer, the too friendly anopheles mosquito. Anti-malaria squads could be seen prowling the area spraying stagnant water with insecticide. Complicated personal precautions appeared in routine orders—mosquito nets to be tucked in round blankets at dusk, sleeping quarters sprayed every morning, face nets and gloves for sentries, repellent cream smeared on exposed skin. You even saw inspecting officers running their fingers along a man's cheek to see if he had greased himself properly. Later in April, when summer clothes were issued, the unlovely Bombay bloomers at last came into their own, being unhitched and let down below the knee at dusk to dissuade the ‘mossies’. In 18 Battalion, as in every other unit, the men were apt to look on all these precautions with a tolerant contempt, and observe them when convenient. But this was not the case with typhus, which was reported in the Bekaa valley in March. This most unpleasant disease commanded more respect among the Kiwis, who were quite ready to co-operate by obeying ‘out of bounds’ restrictions where typhus was concerned.

As the weeks went on and the heat increased, the first enthusiasm for manual labour was less evident. The Bekaa valley, the men found, was a natural wind funnel. It blew almost continuously, sometimes in gales that forced fine dust in everywhere—you might as well be back in Egypt, was the men's reaction whenever this got particularly bad. The tempo of the work slackened considerably.

With the receding snow the mountains lost their beauty and became arid, ragged hunks of rock, and though the valley blossomed in lush spring green splashed with the vivid red of wild poppies, there was a feeling of being shut in, of having no horizon wider than the few miles of river plain and the mountain tops. This increased when in late April the semi-nomadic local peasants began their move to summer grazing page 242 grounds. Every day and all day the valley was filled with a moving throng of sheep and camels, of dark gipsy-looking people, of donkeys loaded high with household goods, all coming from nobody knew where and disappearing into the vague distance. No wonder that the Kiwis, without enough hard work to absorb all their surplus energy, tended to become restless.

With restlessness comes mischief. Mild mischief, to be sure, but it took several forms—a vastly greater consumption of questionable liquor with all its unpleasant effects, an equally vast increase in the popularity of that expensive sport ‘two up’, systematic dynamiting of the fish out of the Orontes River which ran past 18 Battalion's camp some two miles away.

This last caused most trouble. Beginning in a small way in March, it had assumed such proportions by late April that the river was practically denuded of fish, and the local authorities, perturbed by the disappearance of one of their staple food sources, made a vigorous protest which led to the sport being completely banned under penalty of severe punishment.

It was all very well putting notices in routine orders banning this or that, but it was more to the point to provide recreation. So this is what 18 Battalion set out to do, and it was very successful.

==Emigration==
Being in direct contact with the major road that connects Lebanon to [[Syria]] and, in turn, to the rest of the Arab world, Fakiha has flourished commercially and culturally and is a major contributor in the field of teaching across the entire Bekaa Valley. Not only have its inhabitants spread across the country, but a significant amount of them have emigrated to many countries including [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], the [[United States|America]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]] and other countries all over the world.

'''Fear of God''' refers to [[fear]] or a specific sense of respect, awe, and submission to a [[deity]]. People subscribing to popular [[monotheistic religions]] might fear [[divine judgment]], [[hell]] or God's [[omnipotence]].

==Bahá'í==
In the Bahá'í Faith, "The heart must be sanctified from every form of selfishness and lust, for the weapons of the unitarians and the saints were and are the fear of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/compilation_fear_god "Fear of God", Bahá'í Library Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
According to [[Pope Francis]], “The fear of the Lord, the gift of the Holy Spirit, doesn’t mean being afraid of God, since we know that God is our Father that always loves and forgives us,...[It] is no servile fear, but rather a joyful awareness of God’s grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our hearts find true peace.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-fear-of-the-lord-an-alarm-reminding-us-of-whats-right-48609 Harris, Elise. "Pope: Fear of the Lord an alarm reminding us of what's right", Catholic News Agency, June 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theological perspective "fear of the Lord" encompasses more than simple fear. Robert B. Strimple says, "There is the convergence of awe, reverence, adoration, honor, worship, confidence, thankfulness, love, and, yes, fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH01/03a.html|title=The Fear of the Lord|publisher=Opc.org|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Magnificat]] (Luke 1:50) Mary declaims, "His mercy is from age to age to those who fear him." The [[Parable of the Unjust Judge]] (Luke 18:1-8) finds Jesus describing the judge as one who "...neither feared God nor cared for man." Some translations of the [[Bible]], such as the [[New International Version]], sometimes replace the word "fear" with "reverence".

It can also mean fear of [[Divine judgment|God's judgment]]. The fear of God is felt because one understands the "fearful expectation of judgement". Still, this is not a fear that leads one to despair, rather it must be coupled with trust, and most importantly, love. In {{Bibleref2|Psalms|130:3-4}}, it is said, "If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? But  with you there is forgiveness; therefore you are feared."

In the [[New Testament]], this fear is described using the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word φόβος (''[[Phobos (mythology)|phobos]]'', "fear/horror"), except in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]] 2:10, where [[Saint Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] describes γυναιξὶν ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν (''gynaixin epangellomenais theosebeian''), "women professing the fear of God", using the word θεοσέβεια (''theosebeia'').

Roman Catholicism counts this fear as one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. In {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|15:33}}, the fear of the Lord is described as the "discipline" or "instruction" of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[New Revised Standard Version]]'' translates the Hebrew as ''instruction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[Jacques Forget]] explains that this gift "fills us with a sovereign respect for God, and makes us dread, above all things, to offend Him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm Forget, Jacques. "Holy Ghost." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2006 article published in ''Inside the Vatican'' magazine, contributing editor John Mallon writes that the "fear" in "fear of the Lord" is often misinterpreted as "servile fear" (the fear of getting in trouble) when it should be understood as "filial fear" (the fear of offending someone whom one loves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to [[Jerry Bridges]], "There was a time when committed Christians were known as God-fearing people. This was a badge of honor."&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, Jerry. ''The Joy of Fearing God'', p.1, WaterBrook Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutheran theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] coined the term [[numinous]] to express the type of fear one has for the Lord. Anglican [[C. S. Lewis]] references the term in many of his writings, but specifically describes it in his book ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' and states that fear of the numinous is not a fear that one feels for a tiger, or even a ghost. Rather, the fear of the numinous, as C. S. Lewis describes it, is one filled with awe, in which you "feel wonder and a certain shrinking" or "a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant of or prostration before it". It is a fear that comes forth out of love for the Lord.

==Islam==
''[[Taqwa]]'' is an Islamic term for being conscious and cognizant of God, of truth, of the rational reality, "[[piety]], fear of [[God in Islam|God]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/tak-wa-COM_1457?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=takwa "Taḳwā"],''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nanji, Azim. "Islamic Ethics," in ''A Companion to Ethics'', Peter Singer. Oxford: Blackwells,n(1991), pp. 106&amp;ndash;118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often found in the Quran. ''Al-Muttaqin'' ({{lang-ar|لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Al-Muttaqin}}'') refers to those who practice ''taqwa'',  or in the words of [[Ibn Abbas]] -- "believers who avoid [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] with Allah and who work in His obedience."&lt;ref name=Al-Muttaqin&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Al-Muttaqin|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=453&amp;Itemid=36|website=Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{see also|Devekut#Forms of love and fear of God}}
The first mention of the ''fear of God'' in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is in Genesis 22:12, where [[Abraham]] is commended for putting his trust in God. In Isaiah 11:1-3, the prophet describes the shoot that shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, "The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord, and his delight shall be the fear of the Lord." Proverbs 9:10 says that "fear of the Lord" is "the beginning of wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version]]'' translates the Hebrew as ''discipline''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] words יִרְאַ֣ת (''yir’aṯ'') and יִרְאַ֣ת (''p̄aḥaḏ'') {{huh|tyese are the same Hebrew|date=September 2018}} are most commonly used to describe fear of God/[[El (deity)|El]]/[[Yahweh]].

[[Bahya ibn Paquda]] characterized two types of fear as a lower "fear of punishment" and a higher "fear of [divine awe] glory." [[Abraham ibn Daud]] differentiated between "fear of harm" (analogous to fear of a snake bite or a king's punishment) and "fear of greatness," analogous to respect for an exalted person, who would do us no harm. Maimonides categorized the fear of God as a positive commandment, as the feeling of human insignificance deriving from contemplation of God's "great and wonderful actions and creations."

'''Halo''' is the third single from the album ''[[The Blackening]]'' by the [[groove metal]] band [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]. This is the only song on the album to be written by all four band members. It was also featured as one of the metal genre tracks in [[The Sims 2]]:  Teen Style Stuff pack.
==Music video==
On March 24, 2008, Machine Head announced through their official website that they are to film a video for Halo, asking local [[Bay Area]] fans (and in some cases, fans from around the globe) to be extras in the video. Fans from the [[UK]] and [[Germany]] attended, In the video features bassist [[Adam Duce]]'s father as the evil figure. The video was released May 31, 2008, premiering on [[MTV2]]'s [[Headbangers Ball]]. The edit version as heard on the video is much shorter than the original as heard on the Blackening, cut from 9:04, down to 5:11. Flynn cited [[Metallica]] as its inspiration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25793">'''The Jewish Community of Gdańsk''' ({{lang-de|Danzig}}) dates back to at least the 15th century though for many centuries it was separated from the rest of the city. Under Polish rule, Jews acquired limited rights in the city in the 16th and 17th centuries and after the city's 1793 incorporation into [[Prussia]] the community largely assimilated to [[German culture]]. In the 1920s, during the period of the [[Free City of Danzig]], the number of Jews increased significantly and the city acted as a transit point for Jews leaving Eastern Europe for the United States and Canada. Antisemitism existed among German nationalists and the persecution of Jews in the Free City intensified after the [[Nazis]] came to power in 1933. During [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]] the majority of the community either emigrated or were murdered. Since the fall of communism Jewish property has been returned to the community, and an annual festival, the [[Baltic Days of Jewish Culture]], has taken place since 1999.

==History==

===Early history===
A Jewish community in Danzig proper did not exist until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt;&lt;ref name=TYM/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgen/&gt; The earliest records indicate that Jews were present in Gdańsk as early as the 11th century.&lt;ref name=IYP&gt;[http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/gdansk/sightseeing/Jewish-Gdansk inyourpocket.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1308 Gdańsk was [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gdańsk)|taken over by the Teutonic Knights]] and a year later, the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Knights|Order]], [[Siegfried von Feuchtwangen]], forbid Jews to settle or remain in the city in an edict of non-toleration ("de non tolerandis Judaeis"). The knights weakened the restriction in the early 15th century under pressure from the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], [[Witold of Lithuania|Witold]], and as a result a limited number of Jewish merchants from [[Lithuania]] and [[Volhynia]] were allowed to come to Danzig.&lt;ref name=gjh&gt;[http://gdansk.jewish.org.pl/historia_01_1.html Żydzi na Pomorzu] {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1440 a "[[Judengasse]]" ("Jewish Lane", modern Spichrzowa) and around 1454 a Jewish settlement existed.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07105.html Gdansk] at [[Jewish Virtual Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] the city returned to Poland and Jewish merchants came to trade from all over Poland and Lithuania. Many of them received special privileges from the [[King of Poland]] in regards to both the internal (along the [[Vistula river]]) as well as trans-Baltic trade. Others acted as agents of the [[szlachta]] (Polish nobility) in commercial matters.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

In 1476, on the initiative of the King of Poland, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] the city council allowed two Jewish merchants to have equal rights with other merchants.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; Danzig's semi-autonomous status within the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] however allowed the city to refuse citizenship and trading rights to outsiders, thus the rights of Jews in the Kingdom did not apply in Danzig (similar restrictions also applied to [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Mennonites]], many of whom also settled around the city).&lt;ref name=Bacon&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Danzig.html Danzig Jewry: A Short History] by Gershon C. Bacon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt; On the insistence of local merchants, Jews had to move to the Schottland suburb outside of the city's boundary in 1520, subsequently Jews also settled in other places outside of the jurisdiction of the city.

The city burghers continued to curtail the rights of Jews in the city throughout the 16th century, particularly in regards to trade. This was opposed by the Jewish merchants through a boycott of the Danzig owned banking house in [[Kowno]] (which had to be closed down) and through the intercession of the Polish Kings on behalf of the [[Council of the Four Lands]].&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;

In 1577, [[Danzig rebellion|Danzig rebelled]] against the election of [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]] as King of Poland and an inconclusive [[Siege of Danzig (1577)|siege of the city commenced]]. The negotiations that finally broke the stalemate included concessions by the Polish king in religious matters that also concerned Jews. Jewish religious services were not allowed in the city and in 1595 the city council again permitted sojourns only during the fair days. In the 1620s Jewish merchants were allowed to stay for the Domenic Fair and remain 4 days after its closure.&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RnoUPD9ByT4C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=jewish+danzig&amp;q=jewish%20danzig |title=An alternative path to modernity |first1=Yosef |last1=Kaplan |publisher=Brill |year=2000 |isbn=90-04-11742-3 |page=93 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 17th century, almost half a thousand Jews lived in the city and, in 1620, King [[Zygmunt III Waza]] enforced an edict permitting the Jews to live within the city. A few years later, Jews were allowed to trade in grain and timber, first in one part of the city, then all of it.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;

In 1752 a city ordinance regulated a tax of 12 [[Florin (Italian coin)|Florin]] per month for a Jewish merchant, 8 Florin for an assistant and a 4 Florin for a servant.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt; 50 Jewish families received citizenship in 1773 and 160 Jews were allowed to reside in the city.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;

===Kingdom of Prussia===
[[File:GreatSynagogueDanzig.jpg|thumb|150px|Great Synagogue]]
The situation changed with the [[First partition of Poland]] in 1772, when the suburbs became [[Prussia]]n while the city of Danzig remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1793. The 240 Jewish families (1,257 persons) of the Danzig suburbs received a General-Privilege in August 1773, which guaranteed their legal status. As Gershon C. Bacon states:&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''This was the beginning of the association of Danzig Jewry with Germany, the German economy and German culture, which lasted until the dissolution of the community in the Nazi era''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation edict of 1812]] improved the legal status of Jews in Prussia, anti-Jewish riots ([[pogroms]]) occurred in 1819 with the [[Hep-Hep riots]] as well as in 1821,&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Gdansk |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/gdansk-danzig |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the legal rights of Jews were often questioned by local officials.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;

In the 19th century the communities of Altschottland (modern Stary Szkoty), Weinberg (modern Winnicka), [[Langfuhr]] (modern Wrzeszcz), Danzig-Breitgasse (modern Szeroka) and Danzig-Mattenbuden (modern Szopy) were still independent and elected their own officers, built synagogues, ran charitable institutions and chose their own rabbis. The Altschottland community started an initiative to unify the Jews of Danzig in 1878. A committee was established in 1880 and in February 1883 elections were held for a unified [[Kehilla (modern)|Kehilla]] board. In 1887 the new founded ''Synagogen-Gemeinde'' (Synagogue-kehilla) opened the [[Great Synagogue (Danzig)|Great Synagogue]]. Danzig Jewry at that time was a liberal, German-Jewish community and most Danzig Jews considered themselves "Germans of the Mosaic persuasion" and spoke German.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/danzig/wkaelter.php Wolli Kaelter interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Danzig Jews volunteered for [[German Army (German Empire)|military service]] in [[World War I]],&lt;ref name=jgen&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol6_00033.html jewishgen.org]&lt;/ref&gt; about 95 of them died in service, a memorial plaque was later displayed in the Great Synagogue and shipped to [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt;

===Free City of Danzig===
[[File:England and Danzig delegations to the 1st Maccabiah.jpg|thumb|Danzig's delegation at the [[1st Maccabiah]] (1932)]]
After World War I Danzig became a [[Free City of Danzig|Free City]] under the protection of the [[League of Nations]]. The number of Jews in Danzig grew rapidly as visa restrictions did not exist and many Jews from the [[Polish Corridor|areas attached to Poland after World War I]], the [[Second Polish Republic]] and refugees of the [[Russian Civil War]] settled here or were awaiting visas for the [[US]] or [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt;

Danzig Jewry, aided by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] and the [[HIAS|Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]] took care for these refugees, which were housed in a transit camp in the port area.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; Between 1920 and 1925 some 60,000 Jews passed through Danzig. The influence of Eastern European Jews, often sympathizing with [[Zionism]], caused tensions within Synagogengemeinde Danzig. Besides the traditional ''Centralverein Danziger Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens'' (CV; Central Association of Danzig Citizens of Jewish Faith), led by [[Bernhard Kamnitzer]], [[Jews from Russia]] and Poland founded the new "OSE" association, which also provided for charitable services such as a kindergarten, a public soup kitchen, a clothing store, occupational counselling, and a job service, as well as for a theatre for the people's edification and entertainment.

The OSE further ran a health centre in the former ''Friedländersche Schule'' on Jakobstor street #13. The native Jews tried to maintain their German-Liberal style community and their leadership made several attempts to restrict the participation of foreigners in the election of the ''Repräsentantenversammlung'' (legislative assembly of representatives) of Synagogengemeinde Danzig.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt; However, naturalised immigrants could vote so that also proponents of [[Agudat Yisrael|"Agudas Jisro'el"]] and [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|"Misrachi"]], forming [[Folkspartei|Jüdische Volkspartei]] ({{lang-yi|ייִדישע פֿאָלקספּאַרטײַ}}; {{lang-pl|fołkspartaj}}) ran for seats and eventually won some.

In 1920 the "Jung-Jüdischer Bund Danzig" (Young-Jewish Association Danzig) was founded, a newspaper, the ''Jüdisches Wochenblatt'' (Jewish weekly), was published from 1929 to 1938&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; as well as the Zionist ''[[Danziger Echo]]'' (until 1936).

A new synagogue was built on Mirchauer Weg in [[Langfuhr]] (Wrzeszcz) in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/?id=start&amp;art=5679&amp;id=koepfe-artikel&amp;src=AR&amp;cHash=66bc0911a8 Schalom, Günther Grass], [[Die Tageszeitung]], 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the first world conference of the [[Betar]] was organized in Danzig.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02836.html Betar] at [[Jewish Virtual Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and early 1930s anti-Semitism grew&lt;ref&gt;Żydzi na terenie Wolnego Miasta Gdańska Grzegorz Berendt page 110, Gdańskie Tow. Nauk., Wydz. I Nauk Społecznych i Humanistycznych, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the local [[Nazi party]] took power in the [[Volkstag]] (parliament) elections of 1933 and 1935. The Nazis took over the government in 1933 and as a result Jews were dismissed from public service and discriminated against in public life.&lt;ref name=shoa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zukunft-braucht-erinnerung.de/die-loesung-der-judenfrage-in-der-freien-stadt-danzig/|title=Die "Lösung der Judenfrage" in der Freien Stadt Danzig| publisher=Zukunft braucht Erinnerung|first=Wolfgang|last=Gippert| language =German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1a3lkHv9NZ0C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=jewish+danzig&amp;q=jewish%20danzig |title=Model Nazi:Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland |first1=Catherine |last1=Epstein |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-954641-1 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the League of Nations' High Commissioner however still guaranteed a minimum of legal certainty. In summer 1933 an "Association of Jewish Academics" was founded, which protested against the discrimination of Jews to the Senate and the League of Nations. Though the League declared several acts of the Nazi-government unconstitutional, this had no effect on the actual situation in the Free City. Following the example of the [[Jüdischer Kulturbund]] in [[Berlin]] a similar association existed since September 1933.&lt;ref name=shoa/&gt;

On 23 October 1937 60 shops and several private residences were damaged in a [[Pogrom]] which followed a speech of the Nazi Party's [[Gauleiter]] of the city, [[Albert Forster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Danzig 1930 - 1945: Das Ende einer Freien Stadt |first=Dieter |last1=Schenk |publisher=Ch. Links |year=2013 |isbn=978-3-86153-737-3 |page=70|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused the flight of about the half of the Jewish community within a year.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;&lt;ref name=shoa/&gt; In 1938 Forster initiated an official policy of repression against Jews; Jewish businesses were seized and handed over to Gentile Danzigers, Jews were forbidden to attend theaters, cinemas, public baths and swimming pools, or stay in hotels within the city, and, with the approval of the city's senate, barred from the medical, legal and notary professions. Jews from [[Zoppot]] (Sopot) were forced to leave that city within the Danzig state territory.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt; The [[Kristallnacht]] riots in Germany were followed by similar riots between 12 and 14 November 1938. The Synagogues in Langfuhr, Mattenbuden, and Zoppot were destroyed and the Great Synagogue was only saved because Jewish war veterans guarded the building.&lt;ref name=Bacon/&gt;

Following these riots the Nazi senate (government) introduced the racialist [[Nuremberg laws]] in November 1938&lt;ref name=shoa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2nue91Rlg-0C&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=N%C3%BCrnberger+Gesetze+Danzig&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=N%C3%BCrnberger%20Gesetze%20Danzig |title="Die Blechtrommel" von Günter Grass:Bedeutung, Erzähltechnik und Zeitgeschichte |first1=Hannelore |last1=Schwartze-Köhler |publisher=Frank &amp; Timme GmbH |year=2009 |isbn=978-3-86596-237-9 |page=396 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jewish community decided to organize its emigration.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WOd3rLul-LcC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=jewish+danzig&amp;q=jewish%20danzig

The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee paid up to $50,000&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt; for the ceremonial objects, books, scrolls, tapestries, textiles and all kind of memorabilia, which arrived at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] on 26 July 1939. The extensive collection of [[Lesser Giełdziński]] was also shipped to [[New York City]], where it was placed at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish museum]].&lt;ref name=TYM/&gt;&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

===Holocaust===
In early 1939 about 3,500 Jews, most of them Danzig citizens, were still living in the city. In March 1939 the first transport to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] departed&lt;ref name=shoa/&gt; and by September 1939 barely 1,700, mostly elderly, Jews remained. About 140 children were evacuated to Great Britain by the [[Kindertransport]] in 1938/39.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.memorialmuseums.org/denkmaeler/view/1485/Denkmal-an-die-Kindertransporte memorialmuseums.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Wehrmacht]] and [[SS Heimwehr Danzig]], followed by the German annexation of Danzig Free City, about 130 Jews were held in a "ghetto" in a building on Milchkannengasse street (today's ulica Stągiewna), and another group was imprisoned, along with the city's Poles, at the [[Victoriaschule]], an old [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] building, where they were beaten and tortured. There were also camps at [[Westerplatte]] and [[Orunia-Św. Wojciech-Lipce|Ohra (modern Orunia)]]. Jews from Zoppot were executed in the [[Mass murders in Piaśnica|Piaśnica forest murders]]. In 1940 another ghetto was created, which held about 600 individuals.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

The last group that managed to leave for Palestine departed in August 1940, with many of them facing the [[Patria disaster]] in [[Haifa]] port.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;&lt;ref name=shoa/&gt; Of those who remained, 395 were deported during February and March 1941 to [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and 200 from the Jewish old age home were sent to [[Theresienstadt]]&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; and [[Auschwitz]]. Some were also taken out into the Baltic sea on barges and drowned.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

In the former territory of the Free City of Danzig [[Stutthof concentration camp]] was organized in September 1939, when first Jews arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gelsenzentrum.de/stutthof.htm Gelsenzentrum: Das Konzentrationslager Stutthof]&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of Jews  (49 000) were sent there in 1944, many of them died.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/germany/stutthof.htm Jewishgen, German Jews at Stutthof Concentration Camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stutthof.org/node/604 Stutthof Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were [[Stutthof concentration camp#Death march|evacuated]] in 1945, many of the murdered.

At the end of [[World War II]] 22 Jewish partners of [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriages]], who had remained in the city, survived.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; About 350 individuals, from the areas surrounding the city, reported to the regional offices of the [[Central Committee of Polish Jews]] in the summer of 1945.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

==Present day==
Jewish life in Gdańsk began to revive as soon as the war was over. Jewish committees were organized within the city and region. In particular the Regional Jewish Committee (Okręgowy Komitet Żydowski) was composed of members of [[Ichud]], [[Poale Zion]] and [[Poale Zion-Left]] members, as well as the Polish Communist Party. Members of the [[Jewish Bund|Bund]] however were excluded and not allowed to join by the Communist authorities. The religious organization Jewish Religious Organization of the (Pomeranian) Voivodeship (Wojewódzkie Żydowskie Zrzeszenie Religijne) was created in October 1945 and reacquired the synagogue in Wrzeszcz in the same year. However, the religious life of Gdańsk's Jews was slow during this time, partly because a good portion of those present in the city were non-religious and partly because of general anti-religious persecutions carried out by the [[Stalinist]] regime during the period 1947–53.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

During the [[March 1968 events]], a major student and intellectual protests against the communist government of the People's Republic of Poland, the communist authorities instigated a wave of antisemitism as part of a "anti-Zionist" campaign. Jews of Gdańsk were also affected, as exemplified by the repressions directed at [[Wiktor Taubenfigiel]], the director of the Gdańsk hospital.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt; [[Jakub Szadaj]], a native of Gdańsk involved in Jewish cultural activities in the city and a prominent member of the democratic anti-communist opposition, was also arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison (later commuted to five). Szadaj was exonerated of all charges in post-Communist Poland in 1992.&lt;ref name=jsbio&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://ngwm.w.interia.pl/Jakub/Jakub.htm Wstrząs po latachNiezależna Gmina Wyznania Mojżeszowego w PR]&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibit of photographs and documents entitled "Marzec '68" (March '68) covering the events was held in the Great Synagogue in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.e-teatr.pl/pl/artykuly/91243.html Gdańsk. Wystawa "Marzec '68" w Nowej Synagodze]&lt;/ref&gt; However the general subject of what impact the events of 1968 had on the Jewish community in Gdańsk has not yet been studied extensively.&lt;ref name=gjh/&gt;

According to the [[In Your Pocket City Guides|In Your Pocket City Guide]] no member of the contemporary Jewish community is a descendant of a pre-war resident.&lt;ref name=IYP/&gt; However, Jakub Szadaj, for example, is the son of Moses Szadaj, a citizen of the pre-war Free City of Danzig.&lt;ref name=jsbio/&gt;

An annual festival, the [[Baltic Days of Jewish Culture]] (Bałtyckie Dni Kultury Żydowskiej), has been taking place in Gdańsk since 1999. It is organized by [[Social and Cultural Organization of Jews in Poland]] (Towarzystwo Społeczno-Kulturalne Żydów w Polsce) and Jakub Szadaj.&lt;ref&gt;Gdańsk.pl, official website of the city of Gdańsk, [http://www.gdansk.pl/kultura?id=7579 X Bałtyckie Dni Kultury Żydowskiej], last accessed August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish.org.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=385&amp;Itemid=58 jewish.org.pl] {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nowa Synagoga w Gdańsku Wrzeszczu 02.jpg|right|thumb|New Synagogue in Gdańsk-Wrzeszcz]]
In 2001 the only remaining pre-war synagogue, used as a warehouse for store furniture and as music school after World War II, was transferred to the Jewish community. Since September 2009 the complete "New Synagogue" serves for religious purposes again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=153589 Gdańsk shul back in Jewish hands] [[Jerusalem Post]] 1 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
A photo exhibit "Żydzi gdańscy—Obrazy nieistniejącego świata" (Jews of Gdańsk—Images of a lost world) was held in the [[Opatów Palace]] in [[Oliwa]] in 2008. The exhibition included more than 200 photographs documenting the history of the Jewish community in the city from the end of the 19th century until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://kultura.trojmiasto.pl/info_imp.php?id_imp=104285 Żydzi gdańscy - Obrazy nieistniejącego świata]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Gmina of the Mosaic Faith]] (Niezależna Gmina Wyznania Mojżeszowego) represents about 100 Jews in the city,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/gdansk/6,demografia/Gdańsk – Demografia]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[World Union for Progressive Judaism|WUPJ]] affiliate. In addition to helping with the organization of the Baltic Days of Jewish Culture, it offers [[Hebrew]] lessons and keeps contact with the [[Beit Warszawa]] congregation in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngwm.w.interia.pl/onas.htm interia.pl] {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11995">'''''Illui''''' ({{lang-he|'''עילוי'''}} or '''עלוי''' also '''ilui'''; pronounced {{IPA-he|ʔiˈluj|}} plural: ''illuim'') is a noun (meaning "above," "elevation," "going up," or "best" from the root על meaning "on top" or "above" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Babli, Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature|page= 1070 |last=[[Marcus Jastrow]] |first=Rabbi |year=1903 |publisher=The Judaica Press, 1971, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;) derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], meaning a young [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]]ic [[child prodigy|prodigy]] or [[genius]].

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term and title is applied to exceptional [[Talmud]]ic scholars among [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]s. It is used among English speaking and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] speaking Orthodox Jews to identify, as a type of mark of honor, those who have been blessed with greater mental and intellectual capabilities than the average intelligent [[Torah study|Torah scholar]].

==Recognition of genius==
It is considered a mark of honor and excellence for a Talmudic scholar to be recognized as an ''illui'' and to be described and called as such by his peers. It indicates that he is regarded as having extraordinary intelligence and mental capacity, necessary for the most serious, advanced and complex Talmudic learning and [[Torah study]].

==Usage==
In common terminology, an ''illui'' would be someone who has an extraordinarily high "[[IQ]]" as recognized from early childhood as a [[child prodigy]] by [[rabbi]]s and Torah scholars who have a keen eye to recognize the qualities of excellence in budding young Torah scholars.

[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Jews are very familiar with this term, and if a scholar that they are familiar with has been known to have been called an ''illui'' they will regard it as a great honor for that individual as well as for his family, teachers and those with whom he associates. In Orthodox, Haredi and Hasidic circles, the term ''illui'' is applied to males only, as women are not obligated in [[Torah study]] to the same degree that men are required to devote much of their early life to serious and intense [[Torah study|Torah studies]], also referred to as [[Torah learning]].

Most [[rosh yeshiva]]s (heads of [[yeshiva]]s) have been called ''illuim'' as have many [[Rebbe#Chasidic rebbes|Hasidic Rebbes]].

==Views of origins==
There are some Judaic mystical traditions that explain how and why ''illuim'' are different. One explanation attributes it to an "Angel's Slap":

:An intriguing legend from the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]] describes how a child, while still in its mother's womb, is taught the entire Torah to the glow of a supernatural lamp that allows it to see to the ends of the earth. It is only at the moment of birth that an angel appears and imposes upon it an oath to live a righteous life, and then slaps the youngster on the mouth or the nose, causing it to forget all that it has learned.

:The angel's smack in the Talmudic legend produces total [[amnesia]] for all, but in the Greek theory of "[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]" the souls quaff varying quantities of the oblivion-inducing potion. The clever souls drink no more than they have to, which makes for an easier job of learning and recalling during their coming lives. Only the foolish and short-sighted souls make the mistake of rashly and greedily gulping down excessive doses, dooming them to lives of ignorance and dull-wittedness.

:Furthermore, the Jewish world had its share of child prodigies and geniuses who mastered the Talmud at a tender age (such a person is known in Hebrew as an "Illui"). This phenomenon could be ascribed to the soul's evading the angel's slap, whether by accident or design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= ucalgary.ca/~elsegal |title= From the Sources by Eliezer Segal: The Angel's Slap, (citing E. E. Urbach, ''The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs'', Cambridge (Mass.) and London 1987.)  |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/941027_Angel_Slap.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term is also used with caution in terms of its practical implications for the one who holds it. For example, [[Jonathan Rosenblum]], a notable Haredi commentator has cautioned that:

:Talmudic prodigies exist. But there is a certain type of wisdom that only comes with age and life experience, no matter how brilliant a person may be. That is why the leaders of the Torah world are inevitably drawn from the ranks of the ''ziknei hador'' ("elders of the generation"). If the first adjective still used to describe a person is ilui, he is probably not yet ready for leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= jewishmediaresources.com |date=April 15, 2005  |title= Rosenblum's Columns: Cleaning for their own good|author= Jonathan Rosenblum|work=Hamodiah newspaper |url=http://www.jewishmediaresources.com/article/825/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical usage in the yeshiva world==
[[Image:Vilna Gaon portrait.gif|right|thumb|100px|Rabbi Elijah Ben Solomon, the ''[[Vilna Gaon]]'', leader of the [[History of the Jews in Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[Misnagdim]].]]

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] explains that in the history of the [[yeshiva]]s (also known as [[Talmud]]ical or [[rabbi]]nical schools or academies), the term "illui" had a definite function:

:Organization:

:The students in the yeshibah were grouped according to the cities whence they came. Thus one would be known as "Itzel der Kovner" (Isaac of Kovno) and another as "Getzil der Warsawer." Some received the title "'illui" (= "the excellent") or "matmid" (= "diligent student"), such a one being known, for example, as "Der Kovner 'Illui" or "Der Lomzer Matmid," assuming that only one from a town was so designated. The title was given by the general consent of the students. They studied singly or in pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |publisher= jewishencyclopedia.com |encyclopedia= Jewish Encyclopedia|title=YESHIBAH|author= Joseph Jacobs &amp; Judah David Eisenstein  | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=35&amp;letter=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition in all denominations==
The term illui has widespread usage in all [[Jewish denominations]]. Rabbi [[Eric Yoffie]], President of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] in the United States states that: "... It was the illui – the truly superior student – who would devote his life to study, while others would return to full-time employment. Indeed, even when the great yeshivot of [[Eastern Europe]] were at their height, the number of students was relatively modest and smaller than the number of full-time Torah students in Israel today..." (writing for [[Union for Reform Judaism]], 2008.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= urj.org |title= Reform Reflections: The Honor of Torah Study|author= Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie |url=http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=15380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]] (1920 - 2006), of the [[Conservative Judaism]]-Masorti Movement, has been described as being: "...Identified by his teachers as an ilui, a talmudic genius — renowned even then for his prodigious memory and sharp intellect — he went on to study at the [[Gateshead Talmudical College|Gateshead Kollel]], which at that time was considered the Oxford of rabbinical academies..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= forward.com |date= July 7, 2006  |title= 'Greatest British Jew,' 85, Synthesized Faith and Modernity|author= Elliot Cosgrove| url=http://www.forward.com/article/%E2%80%98greatest-british-jew-%E2%80%99-85-synthesized-faith/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Abraham Mapu]] (Hebrew writer) (1808 - 1867): "...His early education in Bible and Talmud was received at the [[Cheder|heder]], on leaving which, at the age of twelve, he continued the study of the Talmud in private, and was so successful that he soon acquired the name of "'Illui" (Friedberg, "Zikronot," in "Hausfreund," i. 22)..."

'''John MacNeil''' (1854-August 1896), was a Presbyterian author and evangelist in Australia. He is best known for his 1894 book, ''The Spirit-Filled Life''.

==Life==
MacNeil was born into a Presbyterian family in Scotland, but was brought up in [[Ballarat, Victoria]]. He studied theology at [[New College, Edinburgh]] and was ordained in 1879. Shortly afterwards he was introduced to the [[Higher Life movement]].

He experienced "an [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit#Pentecostal and charismatic views|anointing of the Holy Spirit]]" and in 1881 began evangelistic ministry. Poor health, however, hindered his itinerant work until he recovered after laying on of hands by an Anglican minister. He then toured Australia, seeing many people turn to Jesus.

In 1890, together with a few others, he formed a prayer group which came to be known as "The Band". They met regularly to pray for revival. They also focused strongly on the need for an infilling of the Holy Spirit, and prayed for "the full Baptism of the Holy Spirit for themselves and for all ministers, officers and members of the Churches."&lt;ref&gt;Watsford, J., Glorious Gospel Triumphs London: Charles Kelly, 1900 (pg. 272)&lt;/ref&gt;

From their prayer times came a decision to hold a [[Keswick Convention|Keswick]]-style convention in [[Geelong]], with George Grubb, who had addressed Keswick Conventions in England, as the primary speaker, along with MacNeil, Webb and others.

In 1896 MacNeil toured [[Queensland]] a final time. At the end of his tour, in late August, he collapsed and died in a city shop.

'''Kayra''' or '''Kaira''', ({{lang-ota|كايرا}}) is creator god in [[Turkic mythology|Turkish mythology]]. He is the supreme god of the Tatars and the Son of the sky deity (Gök Tengri). This son, Kara Han (the black king), left his father's home in the heaven and went to live in the underworld. On occasion, identified as '''Kara-Khan''' (black king), he was the primordial god and his father was the ancordial god called [[Tengri]].

==Etymology==
The name of this deity is found in several forms, as is that of his opponent. "Kayra-Khan" may be translated as "merciful king", while the form "Kara Han" signifies "black king". For this reason, authority on Turkish Mythology Deniz Karakurt, considers Kara-Han and Kayra-Han to be two different deities.&lt;ref&gt;Türk Söylence Sözlüğü (Turkish Mythology Dictionary), Deniz Karakurt, [[:tr:Türk Söylence Sözlüğü|(OTRS: CC BY-SA 3.0)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Turkish word ''kara'' can mean both ''black'' and ''land'', with the result that Kara Han can mean not only 'Black (Dark) Ruler' but also 'Ruler of the Land'.

==God of Creation==
In ancient Turkish  belief, Tangri (God) Kara Han is neither male nor female nor even human in form, but a pure-white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of water (time), the benign creator of all that is, including the other, lesser gods. Among all Altaic Tartars the dualistic division is most clear (Ulgen and [[Erlik]]), and the highest god, Tengre Kaira Khan, is a good power. But before [[Ak Ana]] appears to urge it to create, Kara-han becomes anxious, creation occurring in a context of loneliness, turmoil and fear: the water becomes turbulent, but it reassures itself that it "need not fear" (the implication of such self-reassurance being that it is indeed afraid). Supreme being in the universe it created, Kara-han is the ruler of the three realms of air, water and land, seated on the seventeenth level of the universe, from which it determines the fate of its creation. After creating the universe it planted the nine-boughed tree of life, from the branches of which came the ancestors of humans. Thus emerged the nine races (nine clans).
It has three sons: [[Bai-Ulgan|Ulgan]], Mergen and Kyzaghan.

A Tuvinian / Soyoth legend, told as follows... The giant turtle which supported the earth moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would happen, built a raft. Boarded it with his family, and he was saved. When the waters receded, the raft was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it remains today. After the flood Kaira-Khan created everything around the world. Among other things, he taught people how to make Araq (some kind of liquor).

'''''La Giudecca''''' {{IPA-it|la dʒuˈdɛkka|}} was a term used In [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] to identify any urban district (or a portion of a village) where [[Jews|Jewish]] communities dwelled and had their [[synagogue]]s and businesses.

Unlike the compulsory [[ghetto]]s of Northern Italy and elsewhere, in some Southern Italian hamlets and cities Jewish families and their members voluntarily chose to live in certain areas but were free to travel and even contribute together with their Christian neighbours to the success or commercial, cultural and artistic progress of a [[Regions of Italy|region]]. A very few Sicilian Giudeccas were unhealthy and declined, in fact, the majority included many craftsmen, doctors and tradesmen.

==Etymology==
''Judeca'' and ''Giudecca'' are the corrupt or jargonized medieval versions of the Latin female adjective ''Judaica'', meaning ''Jewish'' or ''Judaean''. ''The Jewess'' or ''The Jewry'' are other plausible meanings.

It is not known why the Venetian island of [[Giudecca]] acquired that name, as there is no evidence of Jewish settlement there.

The word ''Giudecca'' is also used in Dante's [[Divine Comedy|Inferno]] for the lowest circle of Hell, in which [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] resides.

During the evening of Assumption's Day, with a single collective  raptus numberless citizens (fomented by fanatic Catholic preachers) slaughtered about 360 innocents causing a total and fierce devastation.

== Some names and their meanings==

{| cellpadding="4"
|- valign="top"
|
* '''''Meschita''''' derives from Arabic '''''Masjid''''' meaning ''[[Mosque]]'' through the Castilian "''mezquita''".&lt;ref&gt;In Saracenic Sicily the '''''Synagogue''''' or the '''''Temple''''' were commonly called '''''Mosque''''', since synagogues were sometimes established in abandoned Muslim places of worship.  The words '''''Meskita, Moschetta, Muschitta, Moschella''''' are the Siculo-Arab variants for '''''Little Mosque'''''. After 1492, '''''Moschetta''''', '''''Muschitta''''' and '''''Moschella''''' were widely adopted as surnames by several Southern Italian [[Neofiti|Neophytes]].  Nowadays, they are three very common last names highly diffused in all the southern regions of Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''''Guzzetta''''' is the altered name '''''Achuzzath''''', a [[Hebrew]] word that means "''possession, property, estate''". 
* '''''Cafarone''''', corruption of ''[[Capernaum|Cafarnao]]'' or the local Hebrew dialectization of '''''"Kefar Aharon"''''', namely '''''"The Hamlet of [[Aaron]]"''''' (maybe a Jewish religious leader, a rich or prominent Jewish personage from ''Catanzaro'' or the simple respectful [[eponym]] to remember [[Moses]]' brother). 
*'''''Rabato''''' (or ''Rabbato'') is the Sicilian Arabicized translation of '''''Rabāṭ''''' (literally a '''''Stronghold''''' or a '''''Fortress'''''). The ancient fortified zone of ''Erice'' was mainly populated by Jews.
* '''''Cartellone''''' should not be explained by its literal Italian meaning notwithstanding a local legend asserting that a "''big placard''" was placed in the quarter's main entrance to make easily manifest to Christians the Jewish presence in it. Nowadays, visible traces of such "''large signboards''" or "''showy signposts''", if any, have completely vanished or been removed.  According to another folk legend the houses' doors and their outer facings were adorned with little tablets reproducing the Mosaic Laws or a few precepts of [[Torah]].  That might be the simple result of Christian misinterpretation of the [[mezuzah]], where little scrolls are kept in the doorposts.  The most likely explanation is related to a typical Modica's craftsmanship.  ''Cartellone'' is the male augmentative of medieval Latin word "'''''cartallus, cartella'''''" that qualified a "''woven [[hamper]]''" or more precisely, in this case, a "'''''big woven hamper'''''" (to identify an entire specific category of workingmen and workingwomen).  Aforetime, in that area, the production of wicker baskets was chiefly monopolized by Jewish basket-makers and today many craftsmen of Cartellone still practise this kind of patient traditional handiwork.  A last surmise would be a likely dialectal mangling of an Hebrew toponym called '''''"Qiryath Alon"''''' or '''''"Qiryath Aloni"''''' (''The Village of the [[Oak]]'' or ''The Village of Alon'').

{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}
'''Marital conversion''' is [[religious conversion]] upon [[marriage]], either as a conciliatory act, or a mandated requirement according to a particular religious belief. [[Endogamy|Endogamous]] religious cultures may have certain opposition to [[interfaith marriage]] and [[ethnic assimilation]], and may assert [[apostasy|prohibitions]] against the conversion ("marrying out") of one their own claimed adherents. Conversely, they may require the marital conversion of those who wish to marry one of their adherents.

==Islam==
{{Main|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
This is provided that the children from that marriage be raised as "believers," a common Islamic term for Muslims. 
The Qur'anic verses generally quoted are:&lt;ref&gt;http://quran.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{cquote|"And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe. And a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist :,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polytheism]]&lt;/ref&gt; even though she might please you. And do not marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a polytheist, even though he might please you. Those invite [you] to the Fire, but Allah invites to Paradise and to forgiveness, by His permission. And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they may remember." (Qur'an 2:221).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-2/verse-221/|title=Quran Surah Al-Baqara ( Verse 221 )' |publisher=IReBD.com - Islamic Religious Education |date= |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

:{{cquote|"This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste (virgin, innocent, clean) women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers." (Qur'an 5:5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-5/verse-5/|title=Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 5 )' |publisher=IReBD.com - Islamic Religious Education |date= |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Judaism==
{{Main|Interfaith marriage in Judaism|Conversion to Judaism|Jewish assimilation|Apostasy in Judaism}}

Jewish views on religious conversion due to intermarriage are largely in opposition to such marriage even if such marriages are [[toleration|tolerated]]. If a non-Jew wishes to become a Jew, in the sense that they practice Judaism and thus are accepted as [[Who is a Jew?|a Jew]], they are, depending on the Jewish religious tradition, typically welcome. On the other hand, if a Jew desires to leave Judaism, they are regarded as [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostates]] or "[[Jewish assimilation|assimilators]]" into a [[Goy|non-Jewish]] religion or culture. Non-Jewish cultures, tend to be regarded and portrayed as negative; being [[idolatry|idolatrous]], or rejecting of [[God]] (as [[God in Judaism|Jews conceive God]]).

Some Jewish leaders have called Jewish intermarriage a "[[Silent Holocaust]]," particularly in 20th-21st century [[United States|America]] where as many as 47% of American Jews have intermarried with non-Jews in past two decades. Such [[cultural assimilation|cultural]] and [[religious assimilation]] is said to represent a slow destruction of the Jewish people. Others have expressed a different view, accepting or tolerating such marriages, instead focusing their attention towards the concept that the children of a Jewish parent be raised Jewish, with some sense of their identity rooted in Judaism and in Jewish culture. However, some children of a Jewish parent were raised in the non-Jewish parent's religion while maintaining a sense of Jewish ethnicity and identity.

==Christianity==
===Catholicism===
{{update|section|date=October 2018}}
Historically, in the case of the [[Catholic Church]], Catholics were obligated to marry only other Catholics (including those of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]]), and marital conversion of the non-Catholic party was considered almost obligatory. However, it was permissible for a Catholic to marry an [[Independent Catholic churches|Independent]]/[[Old Catholic]] (who is not in communion with Rome) or non-Catholic baptized in a manner recognized by the Catholic Church as valid (i.e., mainline Christians such as [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s or [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]s, and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]), but a dispensation had to be granted by a bishop and the non-Catholic party had to agree to raise the children as Catholics. Marriage to unbaptized persons, meaning all non-Christians and members of some Christian denominations (such as [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]s or [[Mormons]]), was forbidden. [[Civil marriage]] can be the only alternative if a religious wedding is not possible under these circumstances.

===Iglesia ni Cristo===
The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], a [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarian]] church that is the largest indigenous Christian denomination in the [[Philippines]], requires non-adherents marrying members to convert to the religion prior to the wedding. Conversely, members found to have married outside of the religion are automatically expelled from the church. A church wedding is required after the civil one.

==Sikhism==
Sikhs may only marry Sikhs.

==Hinduism==
Hinduism has allowances for such practice even if Hinduism considers all religions are a way to God, but there can be political differences and so marital conversion is sometimes discouraged. Throughout Hindu history, interreligious marriages have also been a way for keeping the peace and building alliances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17769">'''Mesopotamian divination''' was [[divination]] within the [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian period]].

[[Perception|Perceptual elements]] utilized in the practice of a divinatory technique included the [[astronomical]] ([[stars]] and [[meteorites]]), [[weather]] and the [[calendar]], the configuration of the earth and waterways and inhabited areas, the outward appearance of inanimate objects and also vegetation, elements stemming from the behavior and the birth of animals, especially humans.&lt;ref name="J. Bottéro, Z. Bahrani"/&gt;

[[Magic (paranormal)#Ancient Mesopotamia|Magic]] was used to counter a negative fate foretold by divination.&lt;ref name="D.R. Brown"/&gt;

==Dating and development==
The earliest evidence for practice is (''dating is true to this article'') from the fourth millennia B.C. ([[Sumeria]]), 2100 to 2000 BC ([[Neo-Sumerian|Neo-Sumeria]]) and 7th century BC ([[Babylonia]]), except for circa 2100 via the Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

===Sumer===

The area of land known as [[Sumer]], within Mesopotamia, had a settled population within the [[5th millennium BC|5th millennia BCE]].&lt;ref name=" The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica  "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Sumer |author=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Sumer - Ancient region, Iraq|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica  |date= |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2015-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seal from [[Sumer]], (of ''[[Mudgala (Sumerian)|Mudgala]],'' &lt;ref name=" L.A. Waddell "/&gt; ''Lord of [[Edin]],'' ''Minister to [[Uruas]]'' &lt;ref name=" C.

Waddell "/&gt;  a death amulet seal, shows the name Uzu-as' and is a resurrection amulet for the slave and seer of the Temple of the Sun, Uzu-as'.

===Neo-Sumerian===

There is some suggestion people of this era knew of, and were experiencing, [[dreams]] as portents and sources for divination.&lt;ref name=" F.H. Cryer "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3qtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Sumerian+divination&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsZDM-_vJAhXrwHIKHR07D1sQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20divination&amp;f=false |author=F.H.

Heise  |title=Akkadian language |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Space Research |date=1995-01-06 |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2015-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babylonia===

Most of the extant material showing evidence of divination practice are from the 7th century BCE &lt;ref name="F. Rochberg 2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb-jl0nef-4C&amp;pg=PA169|author=F.

The [[Epic of Gilgamesh#Versions|Sumerian version]] of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] (circa 2100 &lt;ref&gt;R.C. Thompson - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7vMtDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq The Epic of Gilgamesh - Old Babylonian and Standard versions] Delphi Classics, 24th July 2017 {{ISBN|1786562154}} Retrieved October 14th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;) has the mother of Gilgamesh interpreting a dream of Gilgamesh (a portent of the advent of [[Enkidu]]).&lt;ref name=" F.H. Cryer "/&gt;

===Development===
Divination practice evolved through time from [[abductive]] positions to reckonings by virtue of an ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'', and a tendency to make generalizations about causes.&lt;ref name="G. Manetti"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cTZZ0453GgC&amp;pg=PA1|author=G. Manetti|title=Theories of the Sign in Classical Antiquity|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |date=March 1993 |isbn= 0253112575|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/a-priori Oxford Dictionary]  [Retrieved 2015-12-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Two types of divination existed in Mesopotamia, divine and human.&lt;ref name="J. Bottéro, Z. Bahrani"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rygDbL2U5YEC&amp;pg=PA125|author1=J. Bottéro |author2=Z. Bahrani |title=Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]], |date=June 1995 |page=125 |isbn=0226067270|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesopotamian diviners most often used a [[liver]] for divination, or else by observing the [[sky]].&lt;ref name="Abraham Winitzer "&gt;{{cite book |jstor=10.5615/jcunestud.63.0077|author=A. Winitzer ([[University of Notre Dame]]) |title=Writing and Mesopotamian divination: The case of alternative interpretation|publisher=Journal of Cuneiform Studies Vol. 63 (2011), pp. 77-94,  Published by American Schools of Oriental Research DOI: 10.5615/jcunestud.63.0077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference delineated by Bottéro, is of two types of divination, both divine, but one artificial and the other natural; the artificial being divinations where through a process of "computation and constant observation" a future truth is gleaned; and natural, being a kind of gift from a god whereby direct inspired communication occurs from god to human.&lt;ref name="U.S. Koch"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QiwAqGlmAQC|author=U.S. Koch|title=Mesopotamian Astrology: An Introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian Celestial Divination|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=1995 |isbn=8772892870 |accessdate=2015-12-20|volume=19|series=Carsten Nieburh Institute Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottéro and Bahrani assert Mesopotamian divination was not just divination, and not limited in development to a type of superstition, but was developed to the extent to which it was in fact a [[science]].&lt;ref name="J. Bottéro, Z. Bahrani"/&gt;

===Divine===
Study of portents from gods was vital within Mesopotamia throughout the entire time of its existence.&lt;ref name="A. Annus "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/ois6.pdf |author=A. Annus |title=Divination and Interpretation of Signs in the Ancient World|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] 2010 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gods [[Šamaš]] and [[Adad]] were associated most closely with divination, Šamaš related to divination in [[Decision-making|decisions]], and Adad for [[Oracle#Description|oracles]] and [[omens]].&lt;ref name="A.A. Orlov"/&gt;

====Celestial====
Celestial divination was conducted for the purposes of the king and the state.&lt;ref name="F. Rochberg 2"/&gt;
Diviners observed the sun by day and the stars of the [[night sky]], which they knew as šıṭır samé , or, šıṭır šamāmī , or, šıṭır burūmē (writing of the [[Wikt:firmament|firmament]] &lt;ref name="F. Rochberg"/&gt;). These three things refer to their thought of the stars of the sky interpreted as ''heavenly writing''.&lt;ref name="Abraham Winitzer "/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W.T. |last=Arnold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQcyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340 |title=Let us Go up to Zion: Essays in Honour of H. G. M. Williamson on the Occasion of his Sixty-Fifth Birthday |publisher=Brill |date=July 2012 |page=340  |isbn=9004226583 |accessdate=2015-12-20}}(source: "sun of the sky")&lt;/ref&gt; By way of the celestial, this type of divination was one of Babylon's three related celestial sciences, along with [[astronomy]] and [[horoscopy]].&lt;ref name="F. Rochberg"/&gt;

The descriptions šıṭır šamê and šıṭırti šamāmī are found sometimes within [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] royal inscriptions in special reference to those temples thought of a beautiful in a way of those temples being (lit.)

====Impetration====
Impetration is a type of divination which involved a diviner asking a deity to control a medium for the diviner to foretell the future. Media might include smoke, [[Cleromancy|lots]], or drops of oil in, or on, water.&lt;ref name="F. Rochberg 2"/&gt;

===Human===
Divination by way of deductive thought whereby people understood the significance of forms and/ or, changes in a medium as showing and revealing a truth, is attested to within [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonia]], at a date of 1950 BCE&lt;ref name="J. Bottéro, Z. Bahrani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.R. Brown"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.eastm.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/146/134|author=D.R.

====Hepatoscopy====
{{See also|Haruspex#Ancient Near East|l1=Ancient Near East hepatoscopy}}

Divination of this type involved using the [[liver]], and possibly additionally  the [[gall-bladder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=K.R. |last=Nemet-Nejat |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgIuVoDTooAC |title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=1565637127 |series=The Greenwood Press "Daily life through history" |accessdate=2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examinining internal organs to make predictions is known as [[extispicy]].&lt;ref name="A. Annus "/&gt;&lt;ref name="A.A. Orlov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/extispicy definition] published by The Free Dictionary [Retrieved 2015-12-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Extant sources reveal individuals were restricted from using extispicic means by a prohibitive cost for the performance of this divination so that [[royal family|royal]] members and [[nobles]] were mostly the only ones able to afford to know the future by this means.&lt;ref name="A.A. Orlov"/&gt;

Existing sources for knowledge of hepatoscopy are clay models of divined livers.&lt;ref name="W. Burkert, M.E. Pinder"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cIiUL7dWqNIC&amp;pg=PA48|author-link1=Walter Burkert |first1=W. |last1=Burkert |first2=M.E.  |last2=Pinder|title=The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1995 |page=48 |isbn=067464364X |series=Issue 5 of Revealing antiquity|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B. Nicolas "/&gt;

Hepatoscopic practice and belief began during the third millennium BCE &lt;ref name="B. Nicolas "/&gt;

=====Practice=====
To make predictions, diviners had two things to aid their making of a divinatory statement – lists of previous predictions and clay models made of previously interpreted livers.&lt;ref name="B. Nicolas "/&gt;

Hepatoscopic predictions were made on the entrails of slaughtered animals (Oppenheim) by observing any kind of abnormality within the organ, such as [[atrophy]], [[hypertrophy]], displacement, or any type of unusual marking.&lt;ref name="A.A. Orlov"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foqSvRbR3vIC&amp;pg=PA31|author=A.A.

Orlov references L. Oppenheim - ''Ancient Mesopotamia portrait of a dead civilization'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Belief=====
In Mesapotamian culture the [[liver]] was thought of as being the centre of [[Mind|thought]] and [[Emotion|feeling]].&lt;ref name="B. Nicolas "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/model-liver-divination |author=B. Nicolas |title=Department of Near Eastern Antiquities|publisher=published by the [[Louvre]] |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physiognomics====
Study of the human body and foretelling of an individual's fate from this study is known as [[physiognomics]]. Diviners (or perhaps associated others) made and circulated these texts to successive generations, handing down knowledge for nearly two millennia.&lt;ref name="Mladen Popović"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ue6K0IU0yL0C&amp;pg=PA72|first=Mladen |last=Popović |title=Reading the Human Body: Physiognomics and Astrology in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Hellenistic-Early Roman Period Judaism|publisher=published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |year=2007 |page=72 |isbn=9004157174 |volume=67 |series=Studies of the Texts of the Desert of Judah|accessdate=2015-12-20}}(Popović references F. Kraus &amp; B. Böch &gt; "texts of nearly two millennia")&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiognomic divination omens, in the first extant recorded, date from a period 2000 - 1600 BCE &lt;ref name="Mladen Popović"/&gt;

==== Dream interpretation ====
The Mesopotamian dream interpreter was known as ša'il(t)u.&lt;ref name=" F.H. Cryer "/&gt;

==== Necromancy ====
{{Main|Necromancy}}

Necromantic practice is shown by historical document to have begun from at least 900 BCE, and was relied upon for insight to a much greater extent within urban culture by the time of King [[Esarhaddon]] in the early 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name=" S.I.

==Literature==
In literature, Babylonian divination material very often does not appear in the contents within written introductories, making it difficult for any reader who might want to know the contents of the text.&lt;ref name="Mladen Popović"/&gt;

[[Enūma Anu Enlil]] is a text of [[omens|conclusions]] of divination.&lt;ref name="Abraham Winitzer "/&gt;

Šumma alammdimmǔ is a series of omens made by physiognomics dating to the close of the second millennium BCE. They are inscribed  upon 27 [[clay tablets]].&lt;ref name="Mladen Popović"/&gt;

The '''Milang tribe''' (alternately '''Millang''', '''Malaa''', or '''Holon''') are a tribe of the [[Adi people]] of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and nearby [[Jonai]], in [[Assam]], [[India]].

==Etymology==
The term ''Milang'' is an [[exonym]], used by non-members of the tribe to refer to the tribe.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;
{{cite journal
  |title=Language contact and the genetic position of Milang in Tibeto-Burman
  |last1=Post|first1=Mark W.

  |url=https://unibe-ch.academia.edu/MarkWPost/Papers/229667/Language_contact_and_the_genetic_position_of_Milang_in_Tibeto-Burman
  |journal=Anthropological Linguistics
  |date=In press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the tribe prefer the name ''Malaa''.

== Language ==
Malaa  people use a language{{which|date=October 2012}} unintelligible to most of the other Adi tribes.  There has been several theories regarding this language; most Malaa maintain that they adopted their language from a people called Soi-sotem, who inhabited their lands long before Malaa settled there. The Malaa remember the Soi-sotem in their ballads as:

: ''Soi belu kettunge, Sotem belu kettunge''.

Soi sotem were believed to come from Kalang Ade(dite), the highest peak in the land of the Milang beyond which is the land of [[Idu Mishmi tribe|Idu Mishmi]] people.

==Religion==
The Malaa are adherents of indigenous  Donyi-Poloism, the practice of praying to the almighty Sun goddess and The Moon God. The priests, called ''Madar'' in Malaa, are popularly believed to be the intermediaries between the natural human world and Spiritual and supernatural world. Male priests are connected with act of divination while the female priests are related with healing of sickness. The priesthood is hereditary practice as it passed from generation to generation in a family. The ritual of sacrificing an animal as suggested by priest to cure a disease is called ''Lulu''. Whenever an epidemic or disease breaks down in a village,the villagers construct a gate at the entrance of the village and a dog is sacrificed with intestines sagging out and hanged.This ritual is called ''Lukan''.

''Ayid Madar Bemmanu'', a ritualistic dance is performed throughout the night in which priest bargains to appease the spirits to release the soul of diseased person and in exchange for gifts. The priest examines the chicken liver and reads omen and suggest the nature of disease and corresponding sacrifice to be made to heal the disease.

==Geography==
Geographically the Malaa land lies approximately between 94-95 degree N latitude and 28-29 degree E longitude in [[Upper Siang district]].  The land of the Milangs extends to the ''Chage'' and ''Felo'' hills in the north which is land of the Idu tribe of Dibang valley. To south and the east they are bounded by the land of the [[Padam tribe|Padams]].

Their land is a rich source of the ''[[Aconitum]]'' plant (variously known as monk's hood or wolf's bane), the source of the powerful poison [[aconitine]], which the Milang historically used on their spears and arrows during battle.The ''[[Anglo-Abor wars]]'' between 1835 and 1912 saw massive use of ''EMO'(called AMU in Millang) being supplied from Peki Modi village against the invading British forces.

The principal rivers are Sidip, Yamne, Yammeng, Satamak and Chapel besides many rivulets flowing through their land.

Millang, Dalbing and Peki Modi are the important ancestral villages of the Malaa.  However, as of today they are found residing in the hills and the valleys of [[East Siang district|East Siang]], [[Upper Siang district|Upper Siang]] and  [[Lower Dibang Valley district|Lower Dibang Valley]] Districts of Arunachal Pradesh.

==Surnames==
Surnames used by Malaa are based on family lineage.  Common surnames include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}

In inscription of 13th century  that describes the construction of the [[Kirti Stambha]] at [[Chittor Fort|Chittor]]  gives 10 shlokas that give a rendering in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;jain Shilalekh Samgrah, Part V, Bharatiya Jnanapitha, 1971, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;   
A Hindi rendering Nirvana Kanda Bhasha was composed by Bhaiya Bhagvatidaas in Samvat 1741.

It is popularly recited on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhaskar.com/news/RAJ-JAI-HMU-MAT-latest-jaipur-news-031558-3017911-NOR.html भगवान महावीर को चढ़ाया निर्वाण लाडू, Bhaskar News Network, Nov 14, 2015, निर्वाण काण्ड के बाद निर्वाण लाडू चढ़ाया गया]&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge was likely first used against Jews in Egypt, where donkeys were at some points associated with [[Set (deity)|Set]], the murderer of [[Osiris]] who is in turn destroyed by [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cueva | first=E.P. | last2=Byrne | first2=S.N. | title=A Companion to the Ancient Novel | publisher=Wiley | series=Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4443-3602-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl5IAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183 | access-date=2018-07-11 | page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first attested in the late first century BCE, and was used against Christians extensively in the first and second centuries CE before disappearing almost entirely in the third.&lt;ref name="Ramelli"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramelli |first=Ilaria |chapter=Apuleius and Christianity: The Novelist-Philosopher in fron of a New Religion| editor=Pinheiro, M.P.F. | editor2=Bierl, A. | editor3=Beck, R. | title=Echoes of Myth, Religion and Ritual in the Ancient Novel | publisher=De Gruyter| year=2013 | isbn=978-3-11-031190-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7DpBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 | page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation against the Christians is discussed by [[Tertullian]] and [[Minucius Felix]], among other early Christian apologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Ass (in Caricature of Christian Beliefs and Practices) |author=Hassett, M. |date=1907 |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Robert Appleton Company.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], in an 1894 article, argued that there had been an [[Mycenaean Greece|ancient Mycenaean]] cult practicing onolatry, citing a fresco depicting donkey-headed figures found near a sacrificial pit and several carved gems apparently showing people wearing donkeys' heads and skins holding sacrificial objects, and further describing the diverse roles asses played in Ancient Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Animal Worship in the Mycenaean Age |author=A.B.

The '''Parents Television Council''' ('''PTC''') is a United States-based [[censorship]] [[advocacy group]] founded by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Christian Republican [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] activist [[L. Brent Bozell III]] in 1995. Through publications on its website including staff reviews, (non peer-reviewed) research reports, and web-based newsletters, the Council proclaims television programs or other entertainment products to be beneficial or harmful to the development of children and actively works to ensure broadcasters and content producers conform to the council's advice.

Council activities include attempts to hold advertisers accountable for the content of the programs they sponsor, encouraging the development of what the council considers to be responsible, [[family-friendly]] entertainment, pressuring broadcasters to stop and/or limit television content the council claims to be harmful to children, as well as pressuring [[cable television in the United States|cable operators]] to unbundle cable channels so consumers can pick and pay for only the channels they want to watch.

The council launches several media campaigns a year against the producers and advertisers of television programs they perceive to be [[morality|indecent]]. A typical campaign involves press releases declaring a particular program harmful (often with a tally of "unacceptable" character behavior or situations), the organized mass mailing of form letters and emails to advertising sponsors of unapproved programs, organized mass filing of complaints via the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) website complaint form, and direct threats of long, potentially costly FCC license challenges to local network affiliates planning to broadcast what the council considers harmful network programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Parents-Protests-CBS-1018806.aspx|title=Parents Council Protests CBS' $#*! My Dad Says|date=May 20, 2010|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|work=TV Guide|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the FCC revealed the Parents Television Council as the primary source of most content complaints received.&lt;ref name="NYT2010"/&gt; Throughout its existence, the Parents Television Council has been accused of promoting censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sexual-intelligence/201208/parents-television-council-really-loves-the-sin|title=Parents Television Council REALLY Loves the Sin|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techliberation.com/2004/11/22/parents-television-council-not-good-parents/|title=Parents Television Council = Not Good Parents|work=Technology Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steve Allen 1987 cropped.jpg|thumb|Steve Allen, former host of ''The Tonight Show'', was PTC's Honorary Chairman and a member of its Advisory Board.]]

After the release of its first annual ''Family Guide to Prime-Time Television'' following the [[1995-96 United States network television schedule|1995-1996 television season]], the PTC hoped to hold the entertainment industry accountable for the indecency that it perceived to be prominent on prime-time television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= 2005 Annual Report |publisher= Parents Television Council |year=2006 |url= http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/joinus/AR2005.pdf |format= PDF |page=13 |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, the organization had the support of several members of the [[U.S. Congress]], including [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Lamar S.

The PTC lost nearly $1 million in 2008 and in 2009 received $2.9 million in revenue, a 29 percent drop from the previous year. In 2009 and 2010, the PTC cut its staff by 38 percent to save money.&lt;ref name="NYT2010"/&gt;

==Leadership==
[[File:Brent Bozell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[L. Brent Bozell III]], a conservative political activist, founded the Parents Television Council in 1995.]]
PTC was founded in 1995 by longtime political activist [[L. Brent Bozell III]]. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as Executive Director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a [[political action committee]] that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates over the past ten years. He was also National Finance Chairman for [[Pat Buchanan]]'s 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by [[Timothy F. Winter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Bob |title=Fighting Indecency, One Bleep At a Time |work=The Washington Post |page=C1 |date=2004-12-09 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49907-2004Dec8?language=printer |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62dlDjJBR?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49907-2004Dec8?language=printer |archivedate=October 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter served as Executive Director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/aboutus/winterbio.asp|title=Tim Winter - President|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Parents Television Council Appointed to FCC's Consumer Advisory Committee | publisher = Parents Television Council  |date=2007-07-26 | url =http://parentstv.org/PTC/news/release/2007/0726.asp | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory Board==
The PTC also has an Advisory Board consisting of [[politician]]s and [[entertainer]]s working to assist the council in their goal of protecting children against profanity and violence in the media. Notable members of the advisory board include singer [[Pat Boone]], former football player [[Mel Renfro]], writer-producer Coleman Luck, [[country music|country]] musician [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], comedian and actor [[Tim Conway]] of CBS's ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Kansas]] and [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential]] candidate [[Sam Brownback]], film critic [[Michael Medved]], star of 1980s soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' [[Susan Howard]], and [[ION Television]] producer Gary Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Board|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/aboutus/advisoryboard/main.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the PTC has established numerous local chapters for most [[List of television stations in North America by media market#United States of America|American media markets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/grassroots/main.asp|title=Parents Television Council Chapters|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable former Advisory Board members include - both of whom are now deceased - comedian [[Steve Allen]], original host of NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', and [[C.

===Columns and reports===
The website of the PTC features reports on what the group finds to be harmful content on television and regular writings from its staff. Their research is done with the support of their Entertainment Tracking System, an archive of prime-time television programming that they claim is the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/insider/2002/IAarchive.asp "Saving the World's Largest Archive of Prime-Time Television"].

In 2000, PTC's report ''What a Difference a Decade Makes'' allegedly stated that there was an increase in profanity, sex, and violence on television during the 1990s. The report also claimed that references to homosexuality increased the most during that decade - by 24-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2005|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the PTC released a report claiming that there was an increase in profanity on network programming shown during the first hour of [[prime time]].&lt;ref name="oh the profanity"&gt;{{cite news|last=Farhi |first=Paul |title=Oh, the Profanity! |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16027-2002Apr19 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 2002 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zq1HVjtZ?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16027-2002Apr19 |archivedate=June 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 report titled ''Wolves in Sheep's Clothing'', analyst Kristen Fyfe perceived an increase in violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming.&lt;ref name="wolves"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Kristen Fyfe| title = Wolves in Sheep's Clothing: A Content Analysis of Children's Television| publisher = Parents Television Council|date=2006-03-02| format= PDF| url = http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/childrensstudy/childrensstudy.pdf| accessdate = 2007-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its results, based on research during summer 2005, the PTC stated that ''[[Teen Titans]]'' was the most violent program, and claimed [[Cartoon Network]] had the most violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/children.television/index.html|title=Group: Children's TV isn't kid stuff|last=McManus|first=Michael|date=2006-03-02|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Huff of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', "[[Sailor Mouth]]", over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huff |first=Richard |title=A four-letter word for decency police: Lame |work=New York Daily News |date=2006-03-04 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2006/03/07/2006-03-07_a_four-letter_word_for_decen.html |accessdate=2007-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106185047/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2006/03/07/2006-03-07_a_four-letter_word_for_decen.html |archivedate=November 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2005–06 United States network television schedule|2005–06 television season]], PTC issued a report ''Faith in a Box'' that analyzed depictions of religion in primetime television. The study stated that most positive references to religion were on reality shows such as ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', while claiming that scripted shows tended to be more negative towards it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipschultz|2008|pp=154–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also ranked Fox as the "most anti-religious network", followed by NBC, UPN, ABC, CBS, and the WB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955772.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=PTC unhappy with TV's religious stereotypes|last=Learmonth|first=Michael|date=2006-12-14|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, PTC published a report titled ''Happily Never After'', using analysis of several primetime shows early in the 2007-2008 television season to assert that extramarital sex is favored on television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex beats marriage on network TV, study shows|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26045428/|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-08-06|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian O'Doherty of ''The Irish Independent'' asked regarding the PTC's marriage depiction study: "After all, would you rather watch people having fun or would you rather watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which...would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on you and that their mother was right all along?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/ian-odoherty/truly-an-inspiration-to-us-all-1456239.html|title=Truly, an inspiration to us all|last=O'Doherty|first=Ian|date=2008-08-15|work=The Irish Independent|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of [[violence against women]] in 2009 than in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/arts/television/29arts-MORETVVIOLEN_BRF.html|title=Study: More TV Violence Against Women |last=Wyatt|first=Edward|date=2009-10-29|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the PTC released a study, ''Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV's Sharp Increase in Foul Language'', which claims that there was a sharp rise in the usage of profanity between 2005 and 2010—during the 8PM to 9PM ET/PT time period commonly referred to them as the [[Family Viewing Hour]], the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed that there was a 69.3% increase in prime time in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period. The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was [[Bleep censor|bleeped out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/459666-PTC_Report_Notes_Sharp_Rise_in_Primetime_Broadcast_Profanity.php|title=PTC Report Notes &amp;quot;Sharp Rise&amp;quot; in Primetime Broadcast Profanity - Broadcasting &amp; Cable|work=broadcastingcable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTC's activities extend to evaluation, rating, and educating around broadcast TV programs according to a traffic light system across three categories of sex, violence and profanity, accumulating to an overall rating based on the ratings of these three categories.

===Seal of Approval===
To recognize excellence in the media, the Parents Television Council awards its Seal of Approval to television shows, movies, home products, and advertisers that provide or sponsor content it deems to be "family-friendly". It is divided into two categories: Entertainment and Advertiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PTC Seal of Approval|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/awards/main.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular television shows that have been awarded include ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'', and ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''.

==Activism==

===World Wrestling Federation campaign and lawsuit===
In 1999, the PTC launched a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), complaining that their ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90544|title=WWF Tones Down Its 'Smackdown' Act|last=Gordon|first=Devin|date=1999-12-13|work=Newsweek|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the campaign, Bozell said that four children had been killed by peers emulating [[professional wrestling]] moves learned from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTC Calls MCI Worldcom to the Mat - archived on 31 October 2001 |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Parents Television Council |url=http://www.parentstv.org/publications/release/pr20000601.html |date=2000-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011106164514/http://www.parentstv.org/publications/release/pr20000601.html |archivedate= 6 November 2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117800064.html?categoryid=22&amp;cs=1|title=WWF wins round 1 against parents org|last=Dempsey|first=John|date=2001-05-28|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWF wins Round 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/may01/may28/3_wed/news7wednesday.html|title=News Shorts - WWF wins Round 1 against parents group|date=2001-05-28|work=Media Life Magazine|accessdate=2009-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025050900/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/may01/may28/3_wed/news7wednesday.html|archivedate=2006-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on ''SmackDown!'' to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.&lt;ref name="WWF wins Round 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="judgereject"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Judge rejects Parents Television Council motion to Dismiss Lawsuit |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |date=2001-05-24 |url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_05_24.jsp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609225904/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_05_24.jsp |archivedate=2009-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed a lawsuit against the PTC in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], claiming that the PTC's statements were false and constituted [[defamation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Suit Filed Against L.

During the conflict the WWF created the [[Right to Censor]] (RTC) stable, a group of wrestlers that parodied the PTC by portraying them as self-righteous moral crusaders.

===Broadcast indecency===
In 2003, the PTC unsuccessfully campaigned for the FCC to take action against the NBC television network in response to the use of the word "[[wikt:fucking|fucking]]" by [[Bono]], lead singer for the rock band [[U2]], during the network's January 2003 telecast of the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. Among an audience of nearly 20 million, the FCC received only 234 complaints, 217 of which came from the PTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, the FCC decided not to fine NBC because Bono's obscenity was ruled as fleeting and not describing sexual or excretory functions, the FCC's standard for fining a network for indecency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FCC OKs Bono's F-Word Slip | publisher = CBS News |date=2003-10-07 | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/17/entertainment/main573729.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the PTC filed an Application for Review to the FCC, in March 2004 the FCC decided that the word was indecent by law but still decided not to fine NBC; however, the ruling was to serve as a warning to networks that there would be a "zero tolerance" policy towards obscene language willfully used during the daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|2006|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PTC's complaints about profanity used by presenter [[Nicole Richie]] in the December 10, 2003 broadcast of the ''Billboard Music Awards'' led the FCC to conclude that the language violated decency law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipschultz|2008|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTC began attracting more attention after it filed around 65,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcast Indecency Campaign|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/fcc/Complaints.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503021051/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/fcc/Complaints.asp|archivedate=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; complaints to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) about the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]], in which one of performer [[Janet Jackson]]'s nipple shielded breasts, was exposed for 9/16ths of a second. FCC chairman [[Michael Powell (attorney)|Michael Powell]] stated that the number of indecency complaints to the FCC had risen from 350 in the years 2000 and 2001, to 14,000 in 2002 and 240,000 in 2003.&lt;ref name="mediaweek 2004"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Shields | first = Todd | title = Activists Dominate Content Complaints | work = Mediaweek | publisher = Parents Television Council  |date=2004-12-06 | url = http://www.mediaweek.com/mediaweek/headlines/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000731656 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050213091055/http://www.mediaweek.com/mediaweek/headlines/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000731656 | archivedate = 2005-02-13 | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that the PTC had generated most of the indecency complaints received by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name="mediaweek 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lynetterice"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rice | first = Lynette | title = No S---!

[[File:Fcc complaints and fines 2001-2004.JPG|thumb|right|500px|PTC campaigns led to a great increase in FCC-issued fines and received complaints compared to those from previous years.]]

After the halftime show, the PTC launched five more FCC complaint drives, starting March 2004 with an episode of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[That '70s Show]]'' titled "Happy Jack", which revolved around character [[Eric Forman]] being caught [[masturbating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/action/70s/content.htm|title=Content from the March 24, 2004 episode of Fox's That '70s Show|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=2004-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the [[2004–2005 United States network television schedule|2004–2005 television season]] sparked four new campaigns, the first being against NBC's animated series ''[[Father of the Pride]]'', stating that it contained a "barrage of sexual innuendo and profanity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Tim|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/action/fotp/emailH.htm|title=PTC E-Alert (Father of the Pride)|date=n.d.|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while being promoted "from the creators of ''[[Shrek]]''", which they felt would potentially attract children to watching the series. That campaign led to over 11,000 email complaints to the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Halonen | first = Doug| title = PTC E-Mails Generate Results| work = Television Week| publisher = Parents Television Council |date=2004-10-18 | url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/news/2004/indecency_tvweek3.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071206041839/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/news/2004/indecency_tvweek3.htm | archivedate = 2007-12-06 | accessdate = 2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, shortly after [[CBS]] broadcast the word "[[fuck]]" during an airing of ''[[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|Big Brother 5]]'', the PTC took action again, this time claiming that CBS ignored a warning from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) that there would be zero tolerance toward unbleeped profanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/154735-CBS_Hit_with_F_Word_Complaint.php|title=CBS Hit with F-Word Complaint|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=2004-09-24|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those complaints became moot when [[Viacom (1971-2005)|Viacom]], then-owners of CBS, settled with the FCC for $3.5 million regarding all allegedly indecent programming broadcast in the years around 2003 and 2004, including the ''Big Brother 5'' episode in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heine|first=Paul|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4458922-1.html|title=Viacom, FCC Reach $3.5 Million Indecency Consent Decree|work=AllBusiness.com|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the FCC ruled that ''Father of the Pride'' was not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Martin, Kevin| authorlink = Kevin Martin (FCC) | title = Notices of Apparent Liability and Memorandum Opinion and Order | version = FCC 06-17| publisher = [[Federal Communications Commission]] | url = http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-06-17A1.pdf| format = PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following were complaints about an October 2004 episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s short-lived teen drama ''[[Life As We Know It (TV series)|Life As We Know It]]'', which the PTC felt was sexually charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Tim|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/action/lawki/email.htm|title=PTC E-Alert (Life As We Know It)|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=n.d.|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTC started off 2005 with their campaign against the ''[[Without a Trace]]'' episode "Our Sons and Daughters", leading to CBS being fined for indecency in March 2006; the PTC objected to the depiction of teenagers participating in an [[orgy]] in that episode.

On January 25, 2008, the FCC proposed an estimated $1.4 million fine against ABC for a scene of female nudity in the ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' episode "[[Nude Awakening]]" aired on February 25, 2003.

In January 2010, the PTC launched a complaint campaign after the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "[[Don't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth]]" aired in January 2010.

The series is based on the popular [[Twitter]] [[Shit My Dad Says|account]] created by Justin Halpern, who will also serve as one of the co-producers on the show. CBS defended its decision and says that it is working with the account's creator and its content will be toned down for the program before the series debuts in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eggerton|first=John|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/452905-PTC_Takes_Aim_At_My_Dad_Says_.php|title=PTC Takes Aim At '$#*!

In October 2010, the PTC targeted an episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', stating that the episode featured outfits that were scantily clad and guest-star [[Britney Spears]] going shopping in lingerie, calling it, "an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque." They were also criticizing it for making an episode idolizing Britney in the first place, stating: "Perhaps most troubling is the deification of a troubled popstar into a symbol of empowerment and self-esteem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2010/10/britney-spears-glee-ripped-by-parents-television-council|title=Britney Spears, Glee Torn a New One By Parents Television Council|publisher=The Hollywood Gossip}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, PTC criticized ''[[GQ]]'' magazine for featuring three ''Glee'' stars posing in risque outfits; the PTC statement said that the photoshoot "borders on [[pedophilia]]."&lt;ref name="NYT2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Sexy 'Glee' Photos Draw 'Pedophilia' Protests|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/953207/sexy-glee-photos-draw-pedophilia-protests|publisher=Billboard.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405215518/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/953207/sexy-glee-photos-draw-pedophilia-protests|archivedate=April 5, 2013|date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Communications Commission doesn't regulate the content of cable networks, and even if it did, a crackdown on shows like "Skins" would be a bad idea, because adults should be able to watch whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents vs. 'Skins'|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-mtv-20110122,0,2642216.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
In May 2005 [[Carl's Jr.]] introduced its "Spicy BBQ Six Dollar Burger" in a television advertisement featuring celebrity [[Paris Hilton]] in a swimsuit, soaping up a [[Bentley Arnage]] while leaning on it, and then eating the burger. A similar ad with Hilton for [[Hardee's]] hamburger chain was aired in June 2005.
The Parents Television Council and other media watchdog groups criticized the commercial for being shown during programs that were very likely to be watched by children. Melissa Caldwell, PTC research director, said, "This commercial is basically [[Softcore pornography|soft-core porn]]. The way she moves, the way she puts her finger in her mouth—it's very suggestive and very titillating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = James  | first = Meg| title = Critics are saying 'That's Too Hot' of sexy Carl's Jr. ad| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-05-24| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/24/business/fi-paris24| accessdate = 2007-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group mobilized more than one million members to contact the restaurant chain and voice their concern and claimed that "[i]f this television commercial were to go unchallenged it would set a new standard for acceptable television commercial content." Caldwell, then-president Bozell, and then-executive director Winter appeared on various news programs such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', ''[[The Early Show]]'', ''[[American Morning]]'', and ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' to discuss this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/campaigns/TVads/main.asp|title=TV Ads: Advertiser and Network Campaign|publisher=Parents Television Council|year=2005|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Puzder|Andy Puzder]], CEO of Carl's Jr., says the group needs to "get a life...This isn't [[Janet Jackson]]—there is no nipple shield in this," referring to the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy]].

PTC accused television commercials for Hardee's "biscuit holes" food product of suggesting double entendres. The commercial featured consumers suggesting "[[asshole|A-holes]]" and "B-holes" as nicknames for the biscuit holes. Boddie-Noell Enterprises, which owned 350 Hardee's restaurants in four states, refused to show the ads in its respective markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Alan M.|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2009/07/23/article/hardees_ads_too_racy_for_nc_consumers|title=Hardee's ads too racy for N.C. consumers|work=Raleigh News &amp; Observer|publisher=McClatchy News Service|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Mayo Boddie, chairman of Boddie-Noell, wrote a letter to the PTC condemning the ads as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/07/23/2009-07-23_hardees_ad_rejected_for_asking_reviewers_to_choose_between_aholes_and_bholes.html|title=

===In-flight entertainment===
In September 2007, the PTC launched a campaign to get [[airlines]] in America to reduce the number of "PG-13" and "R"-rated films shown as [[in-flight entertainment]]. Consequently, [[Heath Shuler]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representative of [[North Carolina]], introduced the Family Friendly Flights Act of 2007 bill to require airlines to set aside "child-safe" viewing areas for families to sit in planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6485560.html|title=PTC Seeks In-Flight-Video Guidelines|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=2007-09-28|accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill never became law.

===YouTube===
Twice has the PTC targeted video-hosting website [[YouTube]] in its campaigns and statements. PTC called for NBC to reconsider uploading the uncensored clip of the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' novelty song "[[Dick in a Box]]" on NBC's site and YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b54026_ptc_puts_nbc_on_naughty_list.html|title=PTC Puts NBC on Naughty List |last=Hall|first=Sarah|date=2006-12-22|publisher=E!

===Ethics controversy===
In October 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that former PTC vice president of development Patrick W. Salazar had accused PTC of mishandling hundreds of thousands of mailings to donors and members. Based on [[Internal Revenue Service]] filings, the [[American Institute of Philanthropy]] rated PTC "C+" on financial efficiency. Salazar also disputed the PTC's official membership figure of 1.3 million and estimated that at most 12,000 people respond to annual fundraisers. Although Salazar stated that he left the PTC in November 2009, the PTC said that it fired Salazar and that Salazar was trying to extort money from the organization.&lt;ref name="NYT2010"/&gt;

===Other===
The PTC also criticized ''[[The Muppets (TV series)|The Muppets]]'' for not meeting "family viewing" guidelines and suggested a boycott, based on the mockumentary format of the series including mentions of plastic surgery, "inside" business language being used in a crude manner, and the Muppets in a bar consuming alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.parentstv.org/Main/News/Detail.aspx?docID=3296|title=New PTC Research Finds ABC's The Muppets Exposes Kids to Adult-Themed Content Every 3 Minutes|last=Oliver|first=Kelley|work=Parents Television Council|date=October 20, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTC also criticized the U.S. version of ''[[Sex Box (U.S. TV series)|Sex Box]]'', due to it being a live sex show on basic cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/01/29/parents-group-slams-sex-box-basic-cable-show/ | title=Parents group slams 'Sex Box' basic cable show | first=Diana | last=Falzone | publisher=[[Fox News]] | date=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
On its website, PTC states that its mission is to "promote and restore responsibility and decency to the entertainment industry in answer to America's demand for positive, family-oriented television programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the PTC's mission?|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/faqs/main.asp#What%20is%20the%20PTCs%20mission |work=FAQ|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTC believes that the entertainment industry—not only television but also music, movies, and video games as well—and its sponsors share responsibility with parents for children's television viewing habits. It therefore believes that television is harming children through a perceived "gratuitous" amount of sex, violence, and profanity.&lt;ref name="about us"/&gt; Its activism has influenced the removal of potentially objectionable content from certain shows, such as the fourth season of the popular CBS crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Battaglio |first=Stephen |title="CSI" Goes for Less Seamy Side |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2003/09/25/2003-09-25__csi__goes_for_less_seamy_si.html |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2003-09-25 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220222326/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2003/09/25/2003-09-25__csi__goes_for_less_seamy_si.html |archivedate=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased government regulation of broadcasting is another viewpoint supported by PTC.&lt;ref name="Television Watch"&gt;{{cite press release

===V-Chip===
Since the [[V-Chip]] was established in conjunction with the [[TV Parental Guidelines]] ratings system, PTC has frequently accused the guidelines of having inaccuracy and low standards. In 1997, PTC was twice as likely to rate a show with the toughest rating classification, "red light" in the PTC's case, and "TV-14" in the Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|1998|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Berkowitz quoted PTC president Bozell as stating, based on PTC research, that "the current ratings system and V-chip are failures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/story.php?storyID=62|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427133850/http://www.mediatransparency.org/story.php?storyID=62|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-04-27|title=The Parents Television Council|last=Berkowitz|first=Bill|date=2005-05-11|publisher=Media Transparency|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a V-Chip advertising campaign in the summer of 2006, Bozell proposed instead that cable companies either apply FCC-style broadcast television standards or offer choice in ordering channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Parents-group-derides-V-Chip-ads/2100-1028_3-6099408.html|title=Parents group derides V-Chip ads|last=Ogg|first=Erica|date=2006-07-27|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television Watch]] considers PTC's reporting on the V-chip inaccurate and ideologically charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.televisionwatch.org/newspolls/pressreleases/pr016.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015418/http://www.televisionwatch.org/newspolls/pressreleases/pr016.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-27|title=Parents Want Control of TV|publisher=TV Watch|date=2007-03-15|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable choice===
{{Further|Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007}}
The PTC is an avid supporter of "[[Cable television in the United States#A la carte|a la carte]]" [[cable television in the United States|cable television]] services to allow families to choose only the cable television channels that are appropriate for their children, and also impose the same decency standards already in place on broadcast television on cable channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Winter | first = Tim | title = Cable Choice is the Right Choice | work = ParentsTV.org | publisher = Parents Television Council | url = http://parentstv.org/PTC/cable/documents/TWCableChoice.asp | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the Council has criticized programs on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[Comedy Central]], [[E!]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[MTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Eggerton| first = John| title = PTC Doesn't Want Its MTV| work = [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |date=2005-02-01 | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/100322-PTC_Doesn_t_Want_Its_MTV.php| accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]], [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], and [[VH1]] because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parentstv.org/PTC/cable/archives.asp|title=Cable Consumer Choice Campaign|publisher=PTC|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the issue, the PTC has awarded its "Seal of Approval" to cable networks [[Disney Channel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/news/release/2007/0308.asp|title=PTC Awards Disney for Family-Friendly Advertising Practices|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=2007-03-08|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hallmark Channel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Review - Naomi's New Morning | work = ParentsTV.org| publisher = Parents Television Council| date = 2007-05-04| url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reviews/naomisnewmorning.asp|accessdate=2009-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for their original programs several years ago.

On June 14, 2007, United States Representatives [[Dan Lipinski]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], [[Illinois]]) and [[Jeff Fortenberry]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Nebraska]]) introduced into legislation the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007, which intends to allow families to choose and pay for only the cable television channels that they want to watch.  In September 2007, the PTC launched a new website, ''HowCableShouldBe.com'', to allow cable customers to see how much they are paying for their monthly cable bill currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/news/release/2007/0925.asp|title=PTC Shows Consumers How Cable Should Be |publisher= Parents Television Council|date=2007-09-25|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the PTC released a statement criticizing MTV for the airing of a performance by [[Miley Cyrus]] during its [[Video Music Awards]] and urged Congress to pass the Television Consumer Freedom Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strecker|first=Erin|title=Parents Television Council isn't happy with Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/08/26/parents-television-council-miley-cyrus-vmas/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
In April 2008, PTC released ''The Rap on Rap'', a study covering hip-hop and R&amp;B music videos rotated on programs ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' and ''[[Rap City (TV series)|Rap City]]'', both shown on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], and ''[[Sucker Free]]'' on [[MTV]]. PTC urged advertisers to withdraw sponsorship of those programs, whose videos PTC stated targeted children and teenagers "with adult content...once every 38 seconds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Linda|last2=Umstead|first2=R.

In May 2011, the PTC took issue with [[Rihanna]]'s music video for her song "[[Man Down (song)|Man Down]]." In the video [[Rihanna]] portrays a woman who resorts to killing the man who had previously raped her. They claimed the video promoted gun crime and murder, while the pop star said she wanted to be a voice to victims. After the video became the most viewed [[YouTube]] video that week, [[Streisand effect|she sarcastically used Twitter to thank the PTC in helping her make the video such a success.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/rihanna/57235|title=Rihanna thanks US pressure groups for making 'Man Down' a success|publisher=NME|date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The PTC has been frequently criticized for hypocrisy, slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that are aimed at adults. Critics of the PTC have alleged that it supports increased governmental censorship of television by lobbying the FCC for indecency enforcement for certain television shows&lt;ref name="Television Watch"/&gt; and inaccurately reporting on the [[V-Chip]] in order to further their agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015418/http://www.televisionwatch.org/newspolls/pressreleases/pr016.html Parents Want Control of TV]. TV Watch. March 15, 2007. Retrieved April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Family Guy]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who is frequently criticized by the PTC, said in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''&lt;ref name="BGFM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Voss |first1=Brandon |year=2008|title=Big Gay Following: Seth MacFarlane |journal= The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Oh, yeah. That's like getting hate mail from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. They're literally terrible human beings. I've read their newsletter, I've visited their website, and they're just rotten to the core. For an organization that prides itself on Christian values—I mean, I'm an atheist, so what do I know?—they spend their entire day hating people. They can all suck my dick as far as I'm concerned.}}

In January 2005, [[Bahçeşehir University]] associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC Advisory Board members ([[L. Brent Bozell III]] as 'National Finance Chairman for the 1992 "Buchanan for President" campaign' of "neo-fascist [[Pat Buchanan]]"; [[Susan Howard]]'s portrayal of adulterous [[Donna Culver Krebbs]] on TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which series "was soaked in scantily-clad women, emotional cruelty, violence, alcoholism, and marital infidelity"; Coleman Luck as 'writer and producer' ... 'on "''[[Otherworld (TV series)|Otherworld]]''," "''[[The Equalizer]]''," "''[[Gabriel's Fire|[Gabriel's] Fire]]''," "''[[Matrix (TV series)|Matrix]]''," and "''[[The Burning Zone]]''" [which] ... included a fair amount of death and violence'; [[William Bennett]] as 'a very popular guest at a number of Las Vegas casinos ... gambling'; [[Bruce Jarchow]] appearing in 'less family-friendly products ... such as "''[[The Puppet Masters (film)|The Puppet Masters]]''" (R-rated horror), "''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]''" (R-rated comedy) and "''[[Married... with Children|Married...With Children]]''" (crude [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom packed with blatant sexual banter)'; [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], who 'starred in the TV pilot "''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''" made by erotic, anti-family values filmmaker [[David Lynch]]' and 'had the lead in the independent film mega-flop, "''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212458/ Radical Jack]''," the synopsis of which highlights the lunacy of Cyrus being on the board of the PTC: "CIA agent Jack Reynolds (Billy Ray Cyrus) has a score to settle. Five years ago, his family was slaughtered after he tried to break up an illegal arms ring. But now he's discovered the location of the gunrunner who killed his family--and he's going undercover and taking on a whole crooked town in order to get his man!"'; and John Carvelli, 'who, in 1987, "took part in a fact-finding mission in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Honduras]] with the National Conservative Foundation during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaraguan civil war]]."'), as not consistent with their stance on morality.&lt;ref name="Christensen" /&gt;

In a December 2005 column of his, ''[[Advertising Age]]'' columnist [[Simon Dumenco]] claimed that the PTC is "very very afraid of gay TV characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dumenco|first=Simon|title=Honey, I Shrank the Cable-TV Universe|periodical=Advertising Age|date=2005-12-12|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culture Watch'' columnist Christopher Gildemeister defended the PTC as being "not homophobic" but simply opposed to "sexual references or innuendo (of any variety, hetero, homo or other) aired where children might be exposed to them."&lt;ref name="culture watch 12 26"/&gt;

'''Pipa Jing''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 琵琶精; [[Pinyin]]: Pípa Jīng), a [[yaojing]] changed from [[jade]] [[pipa]], is a fictional character featured within the famed classic Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. 

Pipa Jing is one of three renowned female spectres under the legendary [[Nu Wa Niang Niang|Nu Wa]]. After Pipa Jing- as like both [[Daji]] and Splendor - was ordered by Nu Wa to bring chaos to the [[Shang Dynasty]], Pipa Jing would not be shown until the time of chapter 16. At one point in time when Pipa Jing had returned from a visit with her friend, Daji, she happened to find [[Jiang Ziya]] with a large crowd of people around the fortune telling studio. Thus, Pipa Jing would turn herself into a very attractive young woman and approach Jiang for a fortune. 

Unfortunately for Pipa Jing however, Jiang could see that she was truly an evil spectre in disguise; the palm reading still continued however. Once Jiang became more forceful and would not let go of Pipa Jing's palm, she began to scream and ask for help with the people around her. Due to this, Jiang had no choice but to smack her over the head with an ink stone -- which would kill her mortal body. Following this point, Jiang would never let go of Pipa Jing's palm so that the true spectre could not escape. Soon enough, Pipa Jing was set around a large amount of firewood and set aflame after varied jujus were set as to prevent her true self from escaping. Once everyone realized that even her hair never burned or even got caught on fire, Pipa Jing would end up being burned to death once Jiang unleashed a triple divine fire combined with shattering lightning. Five years following her death, Pipa Jing would finally be revived once again after Daji gathered the essence of both the moon and the sun.

[[File:Flagpolesitting-youngman-1929.jpg|thumb|A fifteen year old boy attempting to set a world record in 1929.]]
'''Pole sitting''' is the practice of sitting on top of a pole (such as a [[flagpole]]) for extended lengths of time, generally used as a test of endurance. A small platform is typically placed at the top of the pole for the sitter. Led by the stunt actor and former sailor [[Alvin "Shipwreck" Kelly]], flagpole sitting was a [[fad]] in the mid-to-late 1920s, but mostly died out after the start of the [[Great Depression]]. 
 
==History and 1920s fad==
Pole sitting is related to the ancient [[ascetic]] discipline of [[stylitism]], or column-sitting.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} [[Simeon Stylites|St. Simeon Stylites the Elder]] (c. 388–459) of [[Antioch]] (now [[Turkey]]) was a column-sitter who sat on a small platform on a column for 36 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13795a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Simeon Stylites the Elder |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-02-01 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagpole sitting was a fad in the mid-to-late 1920s. The fad was begun by stunt actor and former sailor&lt;ref name="Pole position"&gt;Baker, Danny. "Shipwreck for ever in pole position." ''The Times'' (United Kingdom) 21 Aug. 2002: ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 22 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvin "Shipwreck" Kelly, who sat on a flagpole, either on a dare by a friend&lt;ref&gt;Long, Mark A., and Jim Fee. ''Bad Fads.'' Toronto: ECW, 2002. p. 17 ''Ebrary.''  Web. 22 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  or as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="Pole position" /&gt;  Shipwreck's initial 1924 sit lasted 13 hours and 13 minutes.  It soon became a fad with other contestants setting records of 12, 17 and 21 days.  In 1929, Shipwreck decided to reclaim the title.  He sat on a flagpole for  49 days in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], setting a new record.&lt;ref&gt;"Atlantic City's Historic Steel Pier at Trump Taj Mahal Hits the Auction Block on August 25th." ''PR Newswire US.'' 29 June 2011: ''Regional Business News.'' Web. 22 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 1930, his record was broken by Bill Penfield in [[Strawberry Point, Iowa]] who sat on a flagpole for 51 days and 20 hours, until a thunderstorm forced him down. Flagpole sitting in the 1920s was a major part of the decade.
For the most part, pole sitting died out after 1929, with the onset of the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.badfads.com/events/flagpole-sitting/ |title=Flagpole Sitting - The Bad Fads Museum |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004221821/http://www.badfads.com/events/flagpole-sitting/ |archivedate=October 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33324">'''Quintus Valerius Soranus''' (b. ''circa'' 140–130 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Cichorius, “Zur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus,” ''Hermes'' 41 (1906), p. 67; ''American Journal of Philology'' 28 (1907) 468.&lt;/ref&gt; d. 82 BC) was a [[Latin]] poet, grammarian, and [[tribune|tribune of the people]] in the Late [[Roman Republic]]. He was executed in 82 BC while [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] was [[Roman dictator|dictator]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton|T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', vol. 2, 99 B.C.–31 B.C. (New York: American Philological Association, 1952), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; ostensibly for violating a religious prohibition against speaking the arcane name of Rome, but more likely for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Cichorius, “Zur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus,” ''Hermes'' 41 (1906) 59–68, remains the most thorough discussion of the evidence; English abstract in ''American Journal of Philology'' 28 (1907) 468.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[cognomen]]'' Soranus is a [[toponym]] indicating that he was from [[Sora (FR)|Sora]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1982, 1985 printing), entry on "Soranus," p. 1793.&lt;/ref&gt;

A single [[Latin poetry#Elegiac couplet|elegiac couplet]] survives more or less intact from his body of work. The two lines address [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as an all-powerful begetter who is both male and female. This [[androgyny|androgynous]], [[Unitarianism|unitarian]] conception of [[deity]],&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Alvar, “Matériaux pour l'étude de la formule ''sive deus, sive dea'',” ''Numen'' 32 (1985), pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly an attempt to integrate [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] doctrine, has made the fragment of interest in [[religious studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 66–68; Attilio Mastrocinque, "Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choices," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', edited by [[Jörg Rüpke]] (Blackwell, 2007), p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius Soranus is also credited with a little-recognized literary innovation: [[Pliny the Elder]] says he was the first writer to provide a [[table of contents]] to help readers navigate a long work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], preface 33, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]''; John Henderson, “Knowing Someone Through Their Books: Pliny on Uncle Pliny (''Epistles'' 3.5),” ''Classical Philology'' 97 (2002), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and political career==
[[Image:CiceroEpistulaeAdFamiliaresVenice1547page329Detail.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Valerius Soranus was admired for his learning by [[Cicero]] (depicted [[anachronism|anachronistically]] in a 16th-century edition of his letters)]]
[[Cicero]] has an [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] in his ''[[De oratore]]'' praise Valerius Soranus as “most cultured of all who wear the [[toga]],”&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[De oratore]]'' 3.43: ''litteratissimum togatorum omnium''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cicero lists him and his brother Decimus among an educated elite of ''[[Roman military confederation|socii]] et [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 169.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, those who came from allied [[polity|polities]] on the [[Italian peninsula]] rather than from Rome, and those whose legal status was defined by [[Latin Right|Latin right]] rather than full [[Roman citizenship]]. The [[municipium|municipality]] of [[Sora (FR)|Sora]] was near Cicero's native [[Arpinum]], and he refers to the Valerii Sorani as his friends and neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 169: ''vicini et familiares mei''; Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Soranus was also a friend of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and is mentioned more than once in that scholar's multi-volume work on the [[Latin]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Terentius Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 7.31, 7.65, 10.70; [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' 2.10.3; Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of Q. Valerius Soranus is thought to have been the [[Quintus Valerius Orca]] who was [[praetor]] in 57 BC.&lt;ref name="Giovanni Niccolini 1934 pp. 430"&gt;Giovanni Niccolini, ''I fasti dei tribuni della plebe'' (Milan 1934), pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Orca had worked for Cicero's return to public life&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Post Reditum in Senatu|Post reditum in senatu]]'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and is among Cicero's correspondents in the ''Epistulae ad familiares'' (''Letters to Friends and Family'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''Epistulae ad familiares'' 13.4 (= 318 in the [[chronology|chronological]] [[edition (book)|edition]] of [[D. R. Shackleton Bailey|Shackleton Bailey]]), 13.5 (= 319 SB), 13.6 (= 57 SB), 13.6a (= 58 SB); discussion in John Pairman Brown, ''Israel and Hellas: Sacred Institutions and Roman Counterparts'', vol. 2 (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1995), pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero presents the Valerii brothers of Sora as well schooled in Greek and Latin literature, but less admirable for their speaking ability.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 169: ''non tam in dicendo admirabilis quam doctus et Graecis litteris et Latinis''.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italians]], they would have been lacking to Cicero's ears in the smooth sophistication (''urbanitas'') and faultless pronunciation of the best native Roman orators.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin S. Ramage, “Cicero on Extra-Roman Speech,” ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 92 (1961) 481–494, especially pp. 487–488.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude of social exclusivity may account for why Valerius Soranus, whose scholarly interests and friendships might otherwise suggest a [[Optimates|conservative]] temperament, would have found his place in the [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|civil wars of the 80s]] on the side of the [[populares|popularist]] [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] rather than that of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;John Pairman Brown, ''Israel and Hellas'', vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), pp. 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt; It might also be noted that Cicero's expression of this attitude is double-edged: like Marius and the Valerii Sorani, he was also a man from a ''[[municipium]]'', and had to overcome the same obstructing biases that he adopts and expresses.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 82 BC, the year of his death, Valerius Soranus was or had been a [[tribune]] of the people (''tribunus plebis''), a political office open only to those of [[Plebs|plebeian]] rather than [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] birth.&lt;ref name="Giovanni Niccolini 1934 pp. 430"/&gt;

==Execution==
The fullest account of the infamous death of Valerius Soranus is given by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], who says he was executed for revealing the secret name of Rome:&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Klinghardt discusses the religious case in "Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion," ''Numen'' 46 (1999), pp. 43–45; see also H.S. Versnel, “A Parody on Hymns in Martial V 24 and Some Trinitarian Problems,” ''Mnemosyne'' 27 (1974), p. 374, especially note 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The tribune Valerius Soranus dared to disclose this name, according to Varro and many other sources. Some say he was hauled in by the [[Roman senate|senate]] and strung up on a [[crucifixion|cross]]; others, that he fled in fear of retribution and was apprehended by a [[praetor]]&lt;ref&gt;The "praetor" may be Pompey; see below.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sicily]], where he was killed by order of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''Commentary on the Aeneid'' 1.277: ''denique tribunus plebei quidam Valerius Soranus, ut ait Varro et multi alii, hoc nomen ausus enuntiare, ut quidam dicunt raptus a senatu et in crucem levatus est, ut alii, metu supplicii fugit et in Sicilia comprehensus a praetore praecepto senatus occisus est''; from the [[Perseus Project]]'s [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Serv.+A.+1.277&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 online edition] of ''Servii Grammatici qui feruntur in Vergilii carmina commentarii'', edited by George Thilo et Hermann Hagen ([[Bibliotheca Teubneriana|Teubner]] 1881).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Servius's account presents several difficulties. [[Crucifixion]] was a punishment generally reserved for slaves in the Late Republic;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'', entry on "Crux," Bill Thayer's [[LacusCurtius]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Crux.html edition;] Elizabeth Rawson, "Sallust on the Eighties?", ''Classical Quarterly'' 37 (1987), pp. 175–176; K.M. Coleman, "Fatal Charades: Roman Executions Staged as Mythological Enactments," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 80 (1990), p. 53 ''et passim''; for full discussion, see M. Hengel, ''Crucifixion in the Ancient World'' (London 1977), especially "Crucifixion and Roman Citizens" and "The 'Slaves' Punishment," [https://books.google.com/books?id=UDEPFqTiQhUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:crucifixion+inauthor:Hengel&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U07z7qcHrYCD6nN3UI4URTj0X25xA#PPA51,M1 chapters 6 and 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerius Maximus]], a historian in the early [[Principate]], reckoned that the punishment should not be inflicted on those of Roman blood even when they "deserved" it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], 2.7.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a tribune's person was by law sacrosanct.&lt;ref&gt;"Tribune" at [http://www.livius.org/to-ts/tribune/tribune.html Livius.org]; fuller discussion of the tribunate at Smith, ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'', "Tribunus," Bill Thayer's [[LacusCurtius]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tribunus.html edition.].&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it is unclear whether the ten tribunes should possess the knowledge of Rome's secret name,&lt;ref&gt;“This name and the name of the [[tutelary deity]] of Rome had to be handed down from one generation of Roman priests and magistrates to the succeeding one”: [[Jerzy Linderski]], "The Augural Law," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II 16.3 (1986), p. 2255, note 424. The story of Valerius Soranus, Linderski assumes, indicates that tribunes knew the name; the reasoning may be circular.&lt;/ref&gt; or in what manner Soranus would have publicized it. Among sources earlier than Servius, both [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Plutarch]] note that Valerius Soranus was punished for this violation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]'' 3.65; [[Plutarch]], ''Roman Questions'' 61. The late antique grammarian [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] (1.4) also reports that Valerius Soranus was killed for profaning the name of Rome, connecting the act to the Roman goddess [[Angerona]], whose cult statue depicted her with a sealed mouth.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the name was revealed in his one work for which a title is known, the ''Epoptides.'' The title, if interpreted as it sometimes is to mean "[[Tutelary deity|tutelary deities]]," offers an apt context.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, "Die Ἐπόπτιδες des Valerius Soranus," ''Rheinisches Museum'' 113 (1970) 323-358. "Tutelary deities" is not the universal translation: see discussion under [[Quintus Valerius Soranus#Literary works|Literary Works]].&lt;/ref&gt; But elsewhere Servius — so too [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]] — implies that the name remained unrecorded.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, ''Commentary on the Aeneid'' 1.277; [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 3.9; John Pairman Brown, ''Israel and Hellas'', vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), p. 250. The ancient sources on the violation make a distinction without, in the outcome for Soranus, a difference; some say the ''arcanum'' not to be revealed was the secret name of Rome, and others that of Rome's tutelary deity, see ''L'identità segreta della divinità tutelare di Roma. Un riesame dell' ''affaire ''Sorano''. Roma, Settimo Sigillo, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quintus Valerius Soranus has been identified with the Q. Valerius, described as ''philologos'' and ''philomathes'' (“a lover of literature and learning”),&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'' 10.4: φιλόλογος ἀνὴρ καὶ φιλομαθής.&lt;/ref&gt; whom Plutarch says was a supporter of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]. This man was put to death by [[Pompey]] in Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Cichorius, "Zur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus," ''Hermes'' 41 (1906), p. 59; T.R.S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', vol. 2, 99 B.C.–31 B.C. (New York: American Philological Association, 1952), p. 68; Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; where he would have accompanied [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo|Carbo]], the [[Roman consul|consular]] colleague of the recently murdered [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna]]. Carbo was executed by Pompey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'', translated and edited by Richard Gordon (Cambridge: Polity, 2007) p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Conrad Cichorius published an article&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Cichorius, "Zur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus," ''Hermes'' 41 (1906) 59–68; English abstract in ''American Journal of Philology'' 28 (1907) 468.&lt;/ref&gt; that organized the available evidence for the life of Valerius Soranus and argued that his execution was a result of the [[proscription|Sullan proscription]] in 82. The view of his death as politically motivated has prevailed among modern scholars:

{{cquote|His death was thus the result of being proscribed (as a supporter of Marius), and has nothing to do with religious issues of any kind. At the same time, we know that Soranus wrote works of a religious-[[antiquarian]] kind, as well as verse, and was often cited by Varro. This link with Varro must be the reason for associating the revelation of Rome's secret name with Soranus' violent death, for, as we saw, it is Varro whom Servius cites as his authority for linking the death with the revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', translated and edited by Richard Gordon (Cambridge: Polity, 2007). p. 133. This view is shared by Stefan Weinstock, review of ''Die Geheime Schutzgottheit von Rom'' by Angelo Brelich, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 40 (1950) 149–150. Political and religious motives reviewed by John Pairman Brown, ''Israel and Hellas'', vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), pp. 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But if Varro originated the story, his reasons are hard to tease out of the roiled politics of the Late Republic. Although Varro was the friend of Valerius Soranus, in the civil war of the 40s he was on the side of the Pompeians; Caesar, however, not only pardoned him, but gave him significant appointments.&lt;ref&gt;For the development of the story of Valerius Soranus as a cautionary tale, see Trevor Murphy, “Privileged Knowledge: Valerius Soranus and the Secret Name of Rome,” in ''Rituals in Ink: A Conference on Religion and Literary Production in Ancient Rome'' (Stuttgart 2004), pp. 127–137.&lt;/ref&gt; The biases of the contemporary sources were not lost on Plutarch in his account of the killing:&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Furthermore, [[Gaius Oppius|Caius Oppius]], the friend of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], says that Pompey treated Quintus Valerius also with unnatural cruelty. For, understanding that Valerius was a man of rare scholarship and learning, when he was brought to him, Oppius says, Pompey took him aside, walked up and down with him, asked and learned what he wished from him, and then ordered his attendants to lead him away and put him to death at once. But when Oppius discourses about the enemies or friends of Caesar, one must be very cautious about believing him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pompey'' 10.4–5, Loeb Classical Library translation of the ''Lives'', vol. 5 (Cambridge University Press 1917), Bill Thayer's edition at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html LacusCurtius].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Speaking the name could be construed as a political protest and also an act of [[treason]], as the revelation would expose the tutelary deity and leave the city unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;John Pairman Brown, ''Israel and Hellas'', vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), p. 250, citing Luigi Alfonsi, "L'importanza politico-religiosa della 'enunciazione' de Valerio Sorano," ''Epigraphica'' 10 (1948) 81–89.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief rests on the power of utterance to "call forth" the deity ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|evocatio]])'', so that enemies in possession of the true and secret name could divert the divine protection to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] says that the Romans practiced ''evocatio'' when they laid siege to a city, with the priests calling out the foreign god and promising him a greater cult among them (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]'' 28.18). Macrobius even provides the charm of evocation used against [[Carthage]] (''Saturnalia'' 3.9). The secrecy surrounding prayer formularies, particularly the correct names of gods, was characteristic also of [[Judaism]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] [[syncretism|syncretistic]] [[Hellenistic religion|religion]], [[mystery cult|mystery religions]], and later [[Christianity]]. See Matthias Klinghardt, “Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,” ''Numen'' 46 (1999) 1–52, pp. 43–44 on this case; also article on "Magic and Religion: [[Magic and religion#Religious practices and Magic#The name of God|The Name of God]]."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intellectual history|intellectual historian]] of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] [[Elizabeth Rawson]] ventured cautiously that Soranus's "motive remains unclear, but may have been political."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 300, note 12.&lt;/ref&gt; More vigorous is the view of Luigi Alfonsi, who argued that Soranus revealed the name deliberately so that the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Italian]] [[municipium|municipalities]] could appropriate it and break Rome's monopoly of power.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Alfonsi, "L'importanza politico-religiosa della enunciazione di Valerio Sorano (a proposito di ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' I² 337)." ''Epigraphica'' 10 (1948) 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation of these events, worth noting despite its fictional context, is that of [[historical novel]]ist [[Colleen McCullough]], who melds political and religious motives in a psychological characterization. In ''[[Fortune's Favourites (novel)|Fortune's Favorites]]'', McCullough's Soranus “screams aloud” the arcane name because the atrocities committed during the [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|civil war]] had rendered Rome unworthy of divine protection:

{{cquote|Rome and all she stood for would fall down like a shoddy building in an earthquake. Quintus Valerius Soranus himself believed that implicitly. So having told air and birds and horrified men Rome's secret name, Soranus fled to [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] wondering why Rome still stood upon [[Seven hills of Rome|her seven hills]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Colleen McCullough]], ''[[Fortune's Favourites (novel)|Fortune's Favorites]]'' (HarperCollins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lu22i2t94oIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Soranus+inauthor:Colleen+inauthor:McCullough&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 1994 edition]), pp. 108 and 158.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Literary works==

The single [[Latin poetry#Elegiac couplet|couplet]] that survives from Valerius Soranus's vast work as a poet, grammarian, and [[antiquarian]] is quoted by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' (7.9) to support his view that the [[tutelary deity]] of Rome was the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Capitoline Jupiter]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], “The European Sky-God III: The Italians,” ''Folklore'' 16 (1905), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque

''progenitor genetrixque deum, deus unus et omnes …''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[syntax]] poses difficulties in attempts at [[translation]], and there may be some [[Textual criticism|corruption of the text]]. It seems to say something like "[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] All-powerful, of kings and the material world and of gods the Father (''progenitor''), the Mother (''genetrix'') of gods, God that is One and All … ." Augustine says that his source for the quotation is a work on religion (now lost) by Varro, with whose conception of [[deity]] Augustine argues throughout Book 7 of the ''De civitate Dei''. The view of Varro, and presumably of Soranus, was that Jupiter represents the whole [[universe]] which emits and receives seeds (''semina''), encompassing the generative powers of Earth the Mother as well as Sky the Father.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Grant, review of ''Varros'' Logistoricus ''über die Götterverehrung ("Curio de cultu deorum")'', dissertation by Burkhart Cardauns (Würzburg 1960) in ''Classical Philology'' 57 (1962), p. 140; Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 300, especially note 12; Jaime Alvar, "Matériaux pour l'étude de la formule ''sive deus, sive dea''," ''Numen'' 32 (1985), pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt; This unitarianism is a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] concept, and Soranus is usually counted among the Stoics of Rome, perhaps of the contemporary school of [[Panaetius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Zeller]], ''A History of Eclecticism in Greek 'Philos','' translated by S.F. Alleyne (Kessinger, 2006, originally published 1883), p. 74; [[Michael von Albrecht]] et al., ''A History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius'', vol. 1 (Brill, 1997), p. 504, translated from ''Geschichte der römischen Literatur: von Andronicus bis Boethius'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The unity of opposites in deity, including divine [[androgyny]], is also characteristic of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] doctrine, which may have impressed itself on Stoicism.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 66–68; Attilio Mastrocinque, "Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choices," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 382, pointing out that the [[Cleanthes#Philosophy|''Hymn to Zeus'' of Cleanthes]] presents a similar view of the god, and that [[Laevius]], a likely contemporary of Valerius Soranus, held that [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was both female and male (according to [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 3.8.3). Marcello De Martino, in ''L'identità segreta della divinità tutelare di Roma. Un riesame dell' ''affaire ''Sorano''. Roma, Settimo Sigillo, 2011, believes that Sorano revealed the name of Roman tutelar deity, who was androgynous.&lt;/ref&gt;

The couplet may or may not come from the ''Epoptides''. The title is mentioned only in Pliny, and none of the known fragments of Soranus can be attributed to this large-scale work with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Horsfall, “Roman Religion and Related Topics,” review of Thomas Köves-Zulauf, ''Kleine Schriften'' (Heidelberg 1988), ''Classical Review'' 41 (1991) 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Soranus's innovation in providing a [[table of contents]]&lt;ref&gt;An innovation admired by [[Pliny the Elder]], preface 33, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; — most likely a list of ''capita rerum'' ("[[Subject (documents)|subject]] headings")  at the beginning — suggests that the ''Epoptides'' was an [[Encyclopedia#History|encyclopedic]] or [[compendium|compendious]] prose work.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 51; John Henderson, “Knowing Someone Through Their Books: Pliny on Uncle Pliny (''Epistles'' 3.5),” ''Classical Philology'' 97 (2002), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the ''Epoptides'' may have been a long [[didacticism|didactic]] poem. Soranus is known to have written didactic poetry and is likely to have been an influence when [[Lucretius]] chose verse as his medium for philosophical subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;C. Joachim Classen, “Poetry and Rhetoric in [[Lucretius]],” ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 99 (1968), p. 115; "Lucretius and [[Callimachus]], " in ''Lucretius'', edited by Monica R. Gale, Oxford Readings in Classical Studies (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive argument regarding the ''Epoptides'' is that of Thomas Köves-Zulauf.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Horsfall called the 33-page essay on a non-extant work "something of a tour de force," in “Roman Religion and Related Topics,” ''Classical Review'' 41 (1991) 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what can be conjectured about the work derives from the interpretation of its title. The Greek verb ἐποπτεύω (''epopteuo'') has the basic meaning of "to watch, oversee" but also "to become an ἐπόπτης (''epoptes'', "initiate," feminine ''epoptis'' and plural ''epoptides'')," the highest grade of initiate at the [[Eleusinian mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1843, 1985 printing), entry on ἐποπτεία and related words, p. 676; Trevor Murphy, “Privileged Knowledge: Valerius Soranus and the Secret Name of Rome,” in ''Rituals in Ink'' (Stuttgart 2004), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Köves-Zulauf argued that Soranus's ''Epoptides'' was an extended treatment of [[mystery cult|mystery religions]], and the title is sometimes translated into German as ''Mystikerinen.'' The classicist and [[mythographer]] [[H.J. Rose]], on the contrary, insisted that the ''Epoptides'' had nothing to do with initiates.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], “Latin Literature for Italian Children,” ''Classical Review'' 51 (1937) p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Rawson held with ''Initiated Women'';&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rawson, ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34, note 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Loeb Classical Library]] offers ''Lady Initiates'';&lt;ref&gt;H. Rackham's translation of Pliny's ''Natural History'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Horsfall is satisfied with ''The Watchers''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Horsfall, noting that the word's only other occurrence in Latin is from [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus|Cornutus]], in “Roman Religion and Related Topics,” ''Classical Review'' 41 (1991) 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Köves-Zulauf maintains that the ''epoptides'' of the title represent the Stoic conception of female ''[[Daemon (mythology)|daimones]]'' who are guardians of humanity, such as the Hours (''[[Horae]]'') and the Graces (''[[Charites]]''). Soranus integrates this concept, he says, with the ''[[Tutela]]e'', ancient [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] protective spirits. The crime of Soranus was thus to reveal in this work the name of the ''Tutela'' charged with protecting Rome.

Works of later Roman grammarians suggest that Soranus took  an interest in [[etymology]]&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Aulus Gellius]], citing [[Varro]], notes that Valerius Soranus thought the Old Latin word ''flavisa'' referred to the same object as the Greek-derived word ''thesaurus'' 'treasure trove', and suggested that the Latin word derived from the ''flata pecunia'', that is 'minted money', stored there  (''Attic Nights'' 2.10 = Varro, fragment 228 in Funaioli ''Grammaticae Romanae Fragmenta''). Roman antiquarians often used etymology to investigate the history of objects and institutions.&lt;/ref&gt; and other linguistic matters.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 7.31 and 10.70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rasam Pagri''' (रसम पगड़ी) is a social ceremony, prevalent in [[Punjab]] common to [[Hindus]]. The ceremony is conducted upon the death of the eldest male member in a family, in which the eldest surviving male member of the family ties a [[turban]] (''[[Pagri (turban)|pagri]]'') on his head in the presence of the extended family or clan.&lt;ref name="ref18dymtb"&gt;{{Citation | title=Veins of devotion: blood donation and religious experience in north India | author=Jacob Copeman | publisher=Rutgers University Press, 2009 | isbn=978-0-8135-4449-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbSXa5Fag9gC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22Rasam+Pagri%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rasam%20Pagri%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false | quote=''... rasam pagri is the passing of the deceased male's turban to ...

The turban signifies honor of the family, and the ceremony signifies the transition of responsibility for the protection and welfare of the family from the deceased to the surviving oldest male member.&lt;ref name="ref18dymtb"/&gt; (While this is predominantly the case, in the Hindu religious scriptures, it is actually the male member who "gives fire" to the body of the deceased who is entitled to wear the turban. As per tradition, it is the oldest surviving son who performs this final rite.)

==Etymology==
''Rasam'' means ''ceremony'' in different languages of [[India]], including [[Hindi]], the most widely spoken. It is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''rasm'' meaning ''procedure'' or ''method''.&lt;ref name="ref44pabag"&gt;{{Citation | title=Arabic literature to the end of the Umayyad period | author=Alfred Felix Landon Beeston | publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1983 | isbn=978-0-521-24015-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXKBa1qph-UC | quote=''... Arabic rasm, meaning method, procedure ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rasam Pagri'' literally means ''the ceremony of the turban''.

==Reform movements==
Some communities have decided to end the custom of Rasam Pagri because it is associated with mrityu-bhoj (feast marking the end of the mourning period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebishnoiism.in/bishnoi-society-will-be-festive-and-ritual-turban-now-closed/  बिश्नोई समाज में मृत्युभोज व रस्म पगड़ी अब होगा बंद, 28th September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some reform-minded families, the daughters have been given the Pagri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/meerut-city-pagri-ceremony-of-daughter-in-meerut-after-death-of-father-14999292.html  मेरठ में पिता की तेरहवीं पर बेटी को बंधी पगड़ी, Jagran,  08 Nov 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Raim||RAIM (disambiguation)}}
{{One source|date=October 2008}}
In [[demonology]], '''Raum''' is a Great Earl of [[Hell]], ruling thirty legions of [[demon]]s.  He is depicted as a crow which adopts human form at the request of the conjurer.

{{Quote|text=Raum, Reym (Rey) or Raim is a great earle, he is seene as a crowe, but when he putteth on humane shape, at the commandement of the exorcist, he stealeth woonderfullie out of the kings house, and carrieth it whether he is assigned, he destroieth cities, and hath great despite unto dignities, he knoweth things present, past, and to come, and reconcileth freends and foes, he was of the order of thrones, and governeth thirtie legions.|sign=[[Johann Weyer]]|source=''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]''}}

==Characteristics==
Raum steals treasures out of kings' houses, carrying them where he wishes, and destroys cities and dignities of men (he is said to have great dispraise for dignities). Raum can also tell things past, present and future, reconcile friends and foes, and invoke love.

==Etymology==
'Raum' in German means "space, room, chamber"; 'räumen' means to empty, evacuate.  See [[lebensraum]], literally "living room" (that is, room for living - like an aquarium for fish, not a [[living room]]).

''Other spellings'': Raim, Raym, Räum.

'''[[Sikhism]]''' is the [[Sikhism|fourth largest religion]] in India and has existed for 548 years, beginning with the birth of its founder [[Guru Nanak]]. The Sikhs are predominantly located in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], but also in many other parts of India. It is also the fifth largest religion in the world, with more than 27 million  followers in the world as of the year 2010.

==Prominent Sikhs in India==
Though Sikhs are a small minority in India, the community occupies a significant place in the country. The former Chief Justice of India, [[Jagdish Singh Khehar]], and the former Prime Minister of India, Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/world/india-swears-in-13th-prime-minister-and-first-sikh-in-job.html|title=India Swears In 13th Prime Minister and First Sikh in Job|date=23 May 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; are Sikh, as is former President of India Gyani [[Zail Singh]]. Almost every council of ministers in India has included Sikh representatives. Sikhs are also conspicuous in the Indian army, primarily because of their history as defender of righteousnss,  they formed the sword arm of the British empire. The Late Indian officer with a 5 star rank, [[Arjan Singh]], is a Sikh. Sikhs have also led the Indian army through [[JJ Singh]] and the Indian Air Force was led by Air Chief Marshal [[Dilbagh Singh]]. Sikhs have been prominent in Indian sports, with the only Indian individual gold medalist in Olympics, [[Abhinav Bindra]], being a Sikh. Similarly they occupy important official positions, like Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1652689_1652372_1652362,00.html|title=India's Most Influential|date=15 August 2007|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; governor [[Surjit Singh Barnala]]. Sikhs are also known for entrepreneurial business in India. Milkha Singh, also known as The Flying Sikh, is a former Indian track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army. One reason for visibility of Sikhs in the Indian spectrum is the disproportionate role played by the Sikh community during the Indian freedom struggle, with [[Bhagat Singh]] remaining a youth icon to Indian youth.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday.in 2015"&gt;{{cite web | author=IndiaToday.in | title=Bhagat Singh, a Sandhu Jat, was born in September 1907 to a Sikh family in Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India (now in Pakistan). | website=IndiaToday.in | date=23 March 2015 | url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/bhagat-singhs-martyrdom-day-10-lesser-known-facts-you-should-know-about-the-legend/1/425282.html | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gurdwara Bangla Sahib.jpg|thumb|left|Gurdwara Bangla Sahib]]
A Sikh place of worship is called [[Gurdwara]]. &lt;ref name="Star 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Star | first=Brian Leaf Rockford Register | title=Sikhs condemn fasting, visiting places of pilgrimage, superstitions, worship of the dead, idol worship and other blind rituals. | website=Rockford Register Star | date=15 August 2015 | url=http://www.rrstar.com/article/20150815/NEWS/150819655 | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] in Punjab is a prominent Sikh Gurdwara. The Golden Temple represents the
highest spiritual seat of Sikh Authority.

===Langar (the communal meal)===
Sikhism emphasises community services and helping the needy. One of the distinct features of Sikhism is the common kitchen called [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]. In every Gurdwara there is a Langar . Every Sikh is supposed to contribute in preparing a [[communal meal]] in the free kitchen. The meals are served to all and are eaten sitting on the floor. Sikhism does not believe in holding fasts, for the body is God's present to the human being; and therefore humans must foster, maintain and preserve it in good, sound condition, unless fasting is done to foster the human body like healthy diets.
It is available for all people following any religion.

[[Image:Gurdwara sis ganj.jpg|thumb|left|Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib]]

===The Guru Granth Sahib ===
[[Guru Nanak]] was the founder of  Sikhism and the first [[Sikh gurus|Sikh Guru]]. The last Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] passed the Guruship of the Sikhs to the Eternal Guru of the Sikhs, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (the sacred text of Sikhism). It also includes the writings of the Sikh Gurus and the writings of [[Hindu]] and Muslims saints because all of these Bhagats and Bhatts shared the view of one universal creator god, they have experienced unison with almighty. Every human being is  equal in front of Waheguru.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Image:Turbannedman.jpg|thumb|120px|A [[Sikh]] man wearing a turban]]

==Sikhs combat with the Mughals==
Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji on the request of Kashmiri Pandits saved the people of India. Aurungzeb's religious policy was against Hindus, they had to pay more taxes than Muslims. Sir Mohd. Latif writes "He discouraged the teaching of the Hindus, burnt to the ground the great Pagoda near Delhi, and destroyed the temple of Bishnath at Benares, and the great temple of Dera Kesu rai at Mathura, said to have been built by Raja Narsingh deo, at the cost of 33 lakh rupees. The gilded domes of this temple were so high that they could be seen from Agra 54 km distant.  On the site of temple he built a mosque at a great cost. About year 1690, the emperor issued an edict prohibiting Hindus from being carried in palanquins or riding on Arabian horses.

Khalsa Panth (Punjabi: ਖਾਲਸਾ ਪੰਥ ) meaning: the worldwide community of Khalsa or Sikhs generally (baptised Sikhs are called "Khalsa"). It is a name given to the religious structure and the community that manages the affairs of the global Khalsa community.
"Khalsa" refers to the entire group of people who have taken an active decision to follow the way of life laid down by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru; it is the way of the life managed by the Khalsa community, who are self-managed through their democratic and collective wishes.
Since Vaisakhi 1699 when the Khalsa was first forged, this community has existed as a distinct group; completely involved in their own local societies but also aware of its social and spiritual responsibility as stipulated by the tenth master. Unlike, other societies, this group did not lay claim to territory or land and property, even when they had rightfully defeated their aggressive opponents.
The Panth's aim are the same as that of Sikhi in general and one is just the distillation of the other. The Panth has always existed as a community within other social groups. So, you have had panthic members living as Khalsa in locations away from Punjab where the Khalsa was originally created. Today, you will find the Khalsa located in almost all the major countries of the world; living in harmony with their local societies but always aware of the underlying requirements of their spiritual masters.

Kesh: (Kesh is uncut hair) A Sikh is to maintain and adorn this natural God-given gift. To work with nature and not against it. The Kesh is covered with a turban, Keski or Chunni to keep it clean and manageable. 

Kanga (wooden comb) for the maintenance and ongoing upkeep of Kesh. A reminder to regularly maintain the body and mind in a clean and healthy state.

Kara (steel bracelet or slave bangle): Symbolises an unbreakable bond with God. It is a constant reminder that the Sikh is a servant and student of the Lord. He or she must only do His work in accordance with the Holy Scripture; to abstain for wrongdoing at all times.

Kachhera (cotton underwear) Standard, Naturally Comfortable, dignified attire reflective of modesty and control of Kaam (Lust). A sign of a soldier; ever ready; dignified and highly mobile.

Kirpan (a small sword) A sign that a Sikh is a soldier in "Akal Purakh's (God's) Army" (Akal Purakh de fauj); to maintain and protect the weak and needy and for self-defence. Never to be used in anger or to attack.

==Sikh population in India==
[[File:Percentage_Sikh_population,_India.png|thumb|400px|Sikhs as percentage of total population in different districts of India (Census 2011)]]
[[File:Madam, A Photo With You?.jpg|thumb|Sikh people at Golden temple]]

As per the latest figures of 2011 census, India has Sikh Population of 2.08 crores (20.8 million), which is only 1.72% of the country's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/religion.php|title=Religion Data - Population of Hindu / Muslim / Sikh / Christian - Census 2011 India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the total Sikhs in India, 77% are concentrated in state of Punjab. Sikhism is the dominant religion in Punjab, where it is followed by 58% of the population, the only Indian state where Sikhism is the majority faith. 

Other states where Sikh population has some impact are U.T. of Chandigarh (13.11%), New Delhi (5.4%), Haryana (4.91%), Uttarakhand (2.34%), Rajasthan (1.27%), Jammu &amp; Kashmir (1.87%) and Himachal Pradesh (1.16%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punjabdata.com/Sikh-Population-In-India.aspx|title=Sikh Population in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homeland of Tonpa Shenrab Miwo Olmo Lungring. Tibet, 19th century, Rubin Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Olmo Lung Ring, homeland of [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche|Tonpa Shenrab Miwo]], 19th-century painting, [[Rubin Museum of Art]]]]
'''''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'''''&lt;ref group="note"&gt; ''Olmo Lung Ring'' is part of the land of ''Tazig''. They have been conflated for economy.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[non-dual]] spiritual [[realm]] ([[plane (metaphysics)|plane]] or [[dimension]]) of the [[Bon (religion)|Bon]] tradition which resides beyond [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. It is understood to be a timeless perfected realm where peace and joy are the very fabric of being.  

The [[Beyul]] realm of ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'' is [[fable]]d to be located to the west of [[Mount Kailash]] and shaped like an eight-petaled [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] and divided into four regions: inner, middle, outer and [[boundary area]]. The sky of this realm is likened to an eight-spoked wheel (refer [[Dharmachakra]]) and the land itself is fragrant and coloured by beautiful [[flora]] and landscaping, [[chorten]] and snow-capped mountains. 

Central to ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'' is '''''Yungdrung Gutsek''''', a pyramidal-shaped mountain serving as [[axis mundi]] with nine Yungdrungs&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Yungdrung'' is a [[wikt:polyvalent|polyvalent]] symbol that may be understood to personify [[dharmakaya]] and the everlasting and indestructible essence-quality of the [[mindstream]].&lt;/ref&gt; (refer [[sauwastika]]) ascending like a staircase evocative of the Nine Ways (or stages) of Bon. The four faces of the pyramidal mountain, face the four [[cardinal directions]].  At the corner-joints of ''Yungdrung Gutsek'' ([[cross-quarter directions]]) four rivers flow from [[simulacra]] of [[archetype|archetypal]] [[thoughtform]]s:&lt;br /&gt;
*from the simulacrum of a [[Snow Lion|snowlion]] the river '''''Narazara''''' flows from the East;
*from the simulacrum of a [[horse]] the river '''''Pakshi''''' flows from the North;
*from the simulacrum of a [[Indian peafowl|peacock]] the river '''''Gyim Shang''''' flows from the West; and
*from the simulacrum of an [[Indian elephant|elephant]] the river '''''Sindhu''''' flows from the South.

==Scholarly view and retort==

Mount Kailash of south-western Tibet has been equated with ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'' by some scholars. The Bonpo contend with this as ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'' is not a physical locality that can be visited by humans in the state of dualism. In order to access ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'', one must diligently practice spiritual disciplines, purify the [[bodymind]] and [[mindstream]] of all obscurations and realise the non-dual state. [[Bonpo]] pray with the [[heartmind]] to take birth in ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'' as this may only occur post-[[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. Mount Kailash is accessible by those in a dualistic and non-realised state and is therefore proof to the Bonpo that Mount Kailash and ''Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring'' are qualitatively and essentially, different realms.  Historical Bon texts state explicitly that the sacred mountain of Mount Kailash is central to the kingdom of [[Zhang Zhung|Zhangzhung]].

'''Thomas Forsyth Torrance''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE|FRSE|FBA|size=100%|sep=,}} (30 August 1913 &amp;ndash; 2 December 2007), commonly referred to as '''T. F. Torrance''', was a Scottish [[Protestant]] [[theologian]]. Torrance served for 27 years as professor of Christian dogmatics at [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]], in the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He is best known for his pioneering work in the study of science and theology, but he is equally respected for his work in [[systematic theology]]. While he wrote many books and articles advancing his own study of theology, he also edited the translation of several hundred theological writings into English from other languages, including the English translation of the thirteen-volume, six-million-word ''[[Church Dogmatics]]'' of Swiss theologian [[Karl Barth]], as well as [[John Calvin|John Calvin's]] New Testament ''Commentaries''. He was a member of the famed [[Torrance family]] of theologians.

Torrance has been acknowledged as one of the most significant English-speaking theologians of the twentieth century, and, in 1978, he received the prestigious [[Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templetonprize.org/previouswinner.html#torrance |title=The Templeton Prize – Previous Winners |publisher=Templetonprize.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Torrance remained a dedicated churchman throughout his life, serving as an ordained minister in the [[Church of Scotland]]. He was instrumental in the development of the historic agreement between the [[Reformed]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches on the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] when a joint statement of agreement on that doctrine was issued between the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]] and the Orthodox Church on 13 March 1991.&lt;ref&gt;I. John Hesselink, "A Pilgrimage in the School of Christ: An Interview with Thomas F. Torrance," Reformed Review 38, no. 1 (autumn 1984):  p. 50. Torrance also served on the Reformed-Roman Catholic Study Commission on the Eucharist in Woudschoten, Holland (1974). Also see, Thomas F. Torrance, ed., ''Theological Dialogue Between Orthodox and Reformed Churches'', p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1979, but continued to lecture and to publish extensively. Several influential books on the [[Trinity]] were published after his retirement: ''The Trinitarian Faith: The Evangelical Theology of the Ancient Catholic Church'' (1988); ''Trinitarian Perspectives: Toward Doctrinal Agreement'' (1994); and ''The Christian Doctrine of God, One Being Three Persons'' (1996).

==Early years==

Torrance was the son of the Revd [[Thomas Torrance]] (1871–1959) and Annie Elizabeth Torrance (1883–1980), both [[Scotland|Scottish]] missionaries of [[China Inland Mission]] in [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], [[West China]];&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, ''T. F. Torrance: An Intellectual Biography'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828037561|title=The global diffusion of evangelicalism : the age of Billy Graham and John Stott|last=1953-|first=Stanley, Brian,|isbn=9780830825851|volume=volume 5|location=Downers Grove, Illinois|oclc=828037561}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after his great-grandfather, Thomas Forsyth Torrance;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the first thirteen years of his life there. He was educated at the universities of [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Basel|Basel]]. He began studying in Edinburgh in 1931 focusing on classics and philosophy.  At that time his own realist views of philosophy, theology and morality started to take shape, and as he moved to the study of theology at the Faculty of Divinity ([[New College, Edinburgh|New College]]) in 1934 this led him to question the theological methodology of [[Schleiermacher]] for its lack of any realist scientific objectivity.  For Torrance, such objectivity meant that theology needed to allow all its concepts to be shaped by the unique nature of the object of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Torrance, ''Karl Barth, Biblical and Evangelical Theologian'', p. 121; see also Thomas F. Torrance, "My Interaction with Karl Barth" in ''How Karl Barth Changed My Mind'', pp. 52-64, 52, and Hesselink, "Pilgrimage," p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  n this regard, theology did not differ from science; what set science and theology apart of course was the different nature of the objects of their reflection. In the case of science that was the world created by God; in the case of theology it was God the creator, reconciler and redeemer who was no distant God but the God who became incarnate in his Son within time and space in order to reconcile the world to himself. This insight led Torrance to oppose every form of dualism because such thinking always tended to keep God from interacting with us in history in one way or another. He also opposed all forms of "subjectivism" because he held that it was impossible for people to know God objectively by reflecting upon themselves. Torrance was strongly influenced by Hugh Ross Mackintosh (1870-1936)&lt;ref&gt;David W. Torrance, "Thomas Forsyth Torrance:  Minister of the Gospel, Pastor, and Evangelical Theologian" in ''The Promise of Trinitarian Theology'', pp. 1-30, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Daniel Lamont]] (1869-1950), the former stressing the centrality of Christ and the connection between theology and mission, and the latter stressing the relationship between Christianity and scientific culture.&lt;ref&gt;David. F. Wright and Gary D. Badcock (eds), ''Disruption to Diversity:  Edinburgh Divinity 1846–1996'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student years and early years as professor==

Torrance was awarded the Blackie Fellowship in 1936 for study in the Middle East.  This was not without its precarious moments as when he was sentenced to death in Basra (Iraq), accused of being a spy.  Fortunately, he was able to convince the authorities that he was a theological student and was allowed to proceed to Baghdad and then to Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Molnar, ''Thomas F. Torrance:  Theologian of the Trinity'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually returned to Scotland, specialized in systematic theology and graduated ''summa cum laude''.  After that he studied with Karl Barth in Basel.  In 1946 he became engaged to Margaret Edith Spear and completed his doctorate ''magna cum laude''.  From 1938 to 1939 Torrance taught at Auburn Theological Seminary in upstate New York and was eventually offered a position in religion at Princeton University which he did not accept because he decided to return home to Scotland with war in Europe on the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1939 to 1940 Torrance studied at Oriel College, Oxford.  He was ordained as minister on 20 March 1940.  During World War II Torrance provided pastoral and practical support to Scottish soldiers in North Africa and northern Italy and, by the grace of God, escaped with his life after coming under fire on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Torrance, ''The Promise of Trinitarian Theology'', pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, Torrance returned to his parish in Alyth and later became minister at Beechgrove Church in Aberdeen, following in the footsteps of his former beloved professor, Hugh Ross Mackintosh. He married Margaret Edith Spear on 2 October 1946 in Combe Down Parish Church, near Bath, England.  The Torrance family soon included: Thomas Spear Torrance who was born on 3 July 1947 and is now an economist and philosopher of science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh; [[Iain Torrance|Iain Richard Torrance]] who was born on 13 January 1949 and the former President of Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey and Professor of Patristics; and Alison Meta Elizabeth Torrance who was born on 15 April 1951 and is now a medical doctor in general practice in Edinburgh.

Torrance received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1983 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churchman==

As an ordained minister in the Church of Scotland he served as [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] from 1976-1977, as did his son Iain from 2003 to 2004. As a Reformed churchman and theologian Torrance worked tirelessly toward ecumenical harmony with Anglicans, Lutherans, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics throughout his career. In recognition of his ecumenical work with the Eastern Orthodox church, he was consecrated a Protopresbyter in the Patriarchate of Alexandria by the Archbishop of Axum in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Torrance himself served on the Reformed–Roman Catholic Study Commission on the Eucharist which met at Woudschoten, in the Netherlands in 1974, during which time he formed a personal relationship with the Roman Catholic cardinal and renowned ecumenist, [[Yves Congar]]. He represented the Church of Scotland in conversations with the Church of England between 1949 – 1951 and fought tirelessly for the visible union of the Church, and not merely a spiritual union;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Torrance, ''Conflict and Agreement in the Church, Vol. I, Order and Disorder'', Eugene, OR:  Wipf and Stock, 1996, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; he was the Convener of the Church of Scotland Commission on Baptism from 1954 to 1962 (with John Heron, the father of Alasdair Heron, acting as secretary to the Commission); and was present at the [[World Council of Churches]] meeting in Evanston, Illinois, in 1954.
 
Torrance led a colloquy in Switzerland in March 1975 which discussed Karl Rahner's work on the Trinity because he believed that Rahner's work offered an opportunity for genuine ecumenical convergence between East and West, Catholic and Evangelical Christians.  Torrance made significant contributions to Reformed and Roman Catholic discussions of Justification by Faith and by Grace as well.  It should also be noted that there is much in Torrance's writing that could form the basis for significant fraternal dialogue between Christians and Jews.  Torrance studied with the distinguished Swiss Reformed theologian Karl Barth in Basel, completing his dissertation on "The Doctrine of Grace in the Apostolic Fathers" in 1946, after his service as a chaplain during World War II.  In 1948, he was the founding Editor of the important and highly regarded peer reviewed journal, the [[Scottish Journal of Theology]], which his son Iain continues to edit along with Bryan Spinks of Yale University.

==Dogmatic theology==

One of the reasons that Torrance's theology is now becoming the focus for many doctoral students is that his was a profoundly Christ-centered theology that was in no way Christomonist (one that reduced all theology to Christology), but instead integrated all Christian doctrine in such a way as to offer sensible and compelling explanations of the Christian faith.  This integration of doctrine began for Torrance with the Nicene homoousion (the fact that the eternal Son was and is one in being with the Father and Spirit in eternity and with us by virtue of the incarnation), and included the doctrines of the [[Trinity]], [[Creationism|Creation]], [[Incarnation]], [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]], [[Eschatology]], [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|Pneumatology]], the Church and the Sacraments as well as a theology of ordained Ministry.  Interpreting each of these doctrines from within the perspective of an ecumenically open doctrine of the Trinity, with which most Roman Catholic and Orthodox theologians would substantially agree, Torrance forged an understanding of Justification by Grace that demonstrated exactly how and why Christ, in his uniqueness as God become man acting from within the human situation marked by sin and evil, overcame sin, suffering, evil and death once and for all both from the divine and the human side.  This enabled Torrance to offer a theology that was at once full of depth and meaning and yet joyful and hopeful because he knew that Jesus was no mere moral example of the good life, but God himself who suffered the God-forsakenness associated with human enmity against God on the cross out of unconditional love for humanity, and did so effectively precisely because he was the Word of God incarnate.  He once said that if Jesus was just a man dying on a cross, then Christianity would be immoral, offering a picture of a vindictive God along with the image of a pagan human attempt to appease God through human sacrifice—a form of self-justification.  But put God on the cross and the whole picture changes because then the depth of God's costly love could be seen to include the fact that God was not aloof from human suffering but willing himself to experience this suffering in his own Son in order to overcome all that threatens true human existence in fellowship with God.  All of this was accomplished and demonstrated in Christ's resurrection and continues to be lived as part of the new creation in the Church, as the community is united through faith and hope with the ascended and advent Lord by the Holy Spirit, through partaking of the Sacraments and through preaching and teaching the Gospel.

==Theology and science==

As indicated by the fact that he was awarded the [[Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion]] in 1978, Torrance made singular contributions to the dialogue between science and theology.  His contributions in this area led [[Alister McGrath]] to observe that many of those theologians he studied did not seem bothered by the fact that they had no first-hand knowledge of the method and norms of natural science, but wrote about science nonetheless!  But it was different with Torrance. "Torrance’s writings were, quite simply, of landmark significance."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;  P. Mark Achtemeier describes Torrance's work in this area as "magisterial and highly original."&lt;ref&gt;P. Mark Achtemeier "Natural Science and Christian Faith in the Thought of T. F. Torrance" in ''The Promise of Trinitarian Theology'', 269–302, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christopher B. Kaiser|Christopher Kaiser]] noted that if Einstein was the person of the century from the perspective of the secular media, then Torrance would qualify as the theologian of the century from the perspective of people who are science minded.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Kaiser, "Humanity in an Intelligible Cosmos: Non-Duality in Albert Einstein and Thomas Torrance" in ''The Promise of Trinitarian Theology'', 239-267, 240&lt;/ref&gt;  In his groundbreaking book ''Theological Science'', Torrance argued that theological and natural science held in common the same need to understand reality through our thoughts by pointing beyond ourselves and not letting our subjective experiences and knowledge distort the objective reality we are attempting to conceptualize.  Theology and science should be seen as "allies in a common front where each faces the same insidious enemy, namely, man himself assuming the role of Creator . . ." (Torrance, ''Theological Science'', xiii).  As long as the dialogue is conceived to be between science and religion, Torrance contended, "we shall not escape from romantic naturalism."  Instead, he insisted that we must focus on the dialogue between science and theology and thus between the "philosophy of natural science" and the "philosophy of theological science" because these two methods have in common the "struggle for scientific method on their proper ground and their own distinctive fields" (Torrance, ''Theological Science'', xiii).  Torrance did a great deal to foster this discussion in his books ''Space, Time and Incarnation'' and ''Space, Time and Resurrection'' where he showed the connections between the two sciences by allowing theology to understand what it means to think of God acting in new and distinctive ways within created time and space, while respecting the distinctive nature of creation itself in its fallen and reconciled condition.  Torrance famously argued for a non-dualist and non-monist view of theology and science in the school of the renowned physicist and theologian [[John Philoponus|John Philoponos]] (490-570) whose thinking stood in stark contrast to Aristotelian and Neoplatonic thinking which Torrance believed was harmful both to science and to theology.  Such thinking led to ideas of God as an unmoved mover, and thus one who was not a living God capable of acting within creation without being conditioned by creation or limited by it.  Torrance approved of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]] in their attempts to hold together thought and reality, experience and ideas, instead of tearing them apart and believed that theologians could learn from this.  Such unitary thinking in science, Torrance believed, could help theologians overcome Kantian and Cartesian dualism.  His theology demonstrates exactly how he thought this should be done, especially as this relates to interpreting Scripture.  When form and being are separated, as they are when our ideas are separated from objective reality, then it becomes impossible to know Jesus as he is in himself; we only know Jesus as he appeared to be to his followers and this leaves the door open to the idea that Jesus could be created and re-created according to people's faith.  This was especially problematic with respect to the risen Lord.  When the chord is cut between idea and reality, then it is thought that the resurrection is only a mythological way of reflecting on the death of Jesus instead of as a description of a unique occurrence in his life history that enabled a true understanding of his person and work as recorded in the scriptures.

==Implications of thought==

Torrance's scientific theology could be especially helpful today in the debate over whether election constitutes God's triunity or whether the triune God eternally elects us without exhausting his being in his actions for us as Creator, Reconciler and Redeemer.  Torrance's thinking, following Barth, clearly comes down against any idea that God's eternal being is constituted by his relations with us in history.  And that is precisely one of the factors that makes his thinking so compelling to so many today.  More than any theologian of the twentieth century, Torrance had a lively sense of Christ's continued high-priestly mediation of humanity to the Father through the Holy Spirit.  It is just this emphasis that enabled Torrance to take seriously the fact that there could be no created substitute for the man Jesus in his continued existence as the risen, ascended and advent Lord who, in his true humanity and true divinity, continues even now and until his second coming, to unite people humanly to himself as his body on earth (the Church) through faith and by grace.  His is a biblically informed and patristically grounded theology that will serve the ecumenical church for many years to come just as the theology of [[Karl Barth]], his mentor, continues to do.

==Influence==

*The fact that there is a scholarly society, formed in 2004, the Thomas F. Torrance Theological Fellowship, with a mission to promote serious reflection on the Christian faith following Torrance's own approach to theology, is certainly testimony to the growing importance of his work and extraordinary contributions to the Christian Church and its theology.
*Torrance's thinking has influenced a number of prominent twentieth-century theologians such as [[Colin Gunton|Colin E. Gunton]] (1941-2003), a leading theologian of the [[Trinity]] in Great Britain.
*Torrance's thinking about the theology of nature has influenced [[Alister McGrath|Alister McGrath's]] approach to the subject of natural theology.
*Torrance influenced the thinking of some of today's leading Systematic Theologians in Great Britain and on the Continent such as Ivor Davidson of the University of St. Andrews, David A. S. Fergusson of the University of Edinburgh, Alasdair I. C. Heron of the University of Erlangen, Germany, [[Alan Torrance|Alan J. Torrance]] of the University of St. Andrews, Robert T. Walker of the University of Edinburgh and John B. Webster of the University of Aberdeen.
*In the United States, Torrance influenced the theology of Ray S. Anderson (1925-2009), one of his former students, who taught in the area of Theology and Ministry for many years at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] and learned from Torrance to understand theology as a practical science.
*Torrance has influenced many other American and Canadian theologians too numerous to mention here.  One indication of this influence is the fact that so many North Americans are engaged in research and doctoral study of Torrance's theology.  Also, Torrance's influence can be seen in the thinking of Matthew Baker of Fordham University; Elmer Colyer of the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary, one of the founding Directors of the T. F. Torrance Theological Fellowship and author of a number of works on Torrance; Gary Deddo, Senior Editor at InterVarsity Press and founding President of the T. F. Torrance Theological Fellowship and author of a number of works on Torrance; George Dion Dragas, Professor of Patrology and Patristics, Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology, Brookline, Massachusetts;  Eric Flett of Eastern University, St. David's, Pennsylvania and author of a book on the Theology of Culture as understood through the thinking of Torrance; Michael Gibson of Vanderbilt University; Myk Habets of Carey Baptist College, Auckland, New Zealand, author of a number of works on Torrance, including a book on Torrance and Theosis; George Hunsinger, Hazel Thompson McCord Professor of Systematic Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and author of a number of works on Torrance as well as an important book on the Eucharist, influenced by Torrance; Christian Kettler of Friends University, Kansas, the current President of the Thomas F. Torrance Theological Fellowship and author of a number of books that demonstrate Torrance's influence; Paul D. Molnar, Professor of Systematic Theology at St. John's University in Queens, New York, past President of the Thomas F. Torrance Theological Fellowship and author of a number of works on Torrance including a book on Torrance's trinitarian theology; Andrew Purves, Chair in Reformed Theology at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary; and Joel Scandrett, Director of the Robert E. Webber Center at Trinity School for Ministry in Ambridge, Pennsylvania.

In 1921, Mathison wrote the fictional short story "A Phony Phone", which was published in ''[[Radio News]]'' edited by [[Hugo Gernsback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Ashley  | first =Michael |author2=Robert A.

In the June 1929 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', Mathison's story "The Mongolian's Ray" appeared and was promoted on the cover.&lt;ref name="ackerman"&gt;{{cite book| last = Ackerman | first = Forrest J.  |author2=Brad Linaweaver  | title = Worlds of Tomorrow: The Amazing Universe of Science Fiction Art | publisher = Collectors Press| year = 2004 | page =56  | isbn = 978-1-888054-93-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest J. Ackerman and Brad Linaweaver write in the book ''Worlds of Tomorrow'', "In this story, he created the fictional device that shortly after the introduction of Dianetics, morphed into reality as the E-meter employed today to supposedly reveal the personalities of individuals interested in becoming 'clears' in the Dianetic regimen."&lt;ref name="ackerman" /&gt; Mathison's story "Thor Olsen's Ace" was selected for inclusion in ''The World's Best Short Stories of 1930''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = | first = | title = The World's Best Short Stories of 1930 | publisher = Minton, Balch | year = 1930 | location = New York | page =308 | oclc = 3373283  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Mathison was employed building [[short wave radio]]s.&lt;ref name="nye" /&gt; He was also a [[chiropractor]] and [[psychoanalyst]].&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clearthinking"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Pilkington  | first =Mark  | title =Clear thinking  | work =[[The Guardian]]  | publisher =Guardian News and Media Limited   | date =February 17, 2005  | url =https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/feb/17/science.research  | accessdate = 2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pilkington"&gt;{{cite book | last =Pilkington  | first =Mark   | title =Far Out: 101 Strange Tales from Science's Outer Edge  | publisher =The Disinformation Company| year =2007  | pages =85–87  | isbn = 1-932857-87-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some critics of [[Scientology]], Mathison designed and built the first E-meter in the 1940s,&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{cite book  |last = Singh|first = Simon|authorlink = Simon Singh|author2 = [[Edzard Ernst|Ernst]]|title = [[Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine]]|publisher = W.

The E-meter "has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts".&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;  He used the device to investigate the psychoanalytic problems of his patients.&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt; He then employed [[self-hypnosis]] tapes, and instructed his patients to use them to address those issues.&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt; The device became popular and was used among other chiropractors.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt; John Freeman writes in ''Suppressed and Incredible Inventions'', "Recalling my visits at the height of his career, I remember that, while his results were outstanding, he was typically fought by the Medical Profession."&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt; The Mathison meter was based on the [[Wheatstone bridge]] invented in 1833. Earlier [[electrodermal activity]] meters were used by [[Ivane Tarkhnishvili]] in 1889 and popularized by [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]] in a series of papers published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binswanger|first1=L.|editor1-last=Jung|editor1-first=Carl|title=Studies in Word-Association|date=1919|publisher=Moffat, Yard &amp; company|location=New York, NY|pages=446 et seq|url=https://archive.org/stream/studiesinwordass00jung#page/446/mode/2up/search/psychogalvanic|accessdate=30 March 2015|chapter=XII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Volney mathison.jpg|right|thumb|Volney Mathison uses an E-meter to analyze a patient, circa 1951]]
Mathison was a follower of [[Dianetics]] founded by [[L. Ron Hubbard]].&lt;ref name="atack"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Atack  | first =Jon  | title =[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]  | publisher =Carol Publishing Group  | year =1990  | location =New York  | pages =128–129  | isbn =0-8184-0499-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard incorporated Mathison's device into [[Scientology]] practices.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt; Hubbard often called him simply "Mathison" in his writings.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt; According to author [[Paulette Cooper]], Scientologists erroneously referred to him as "Olin Mathison".&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Cooper  | first =Paulette  | authorlink =Paulette Cooper  | title =[[The Scandal of Scientology]]  | publisher =Tower Publications  | year =1971  | location =New York  | pages =145–146|oclc=921001  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Singh]] and [[Edzard Ernst]] write in ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' that "The E-meter was also widely used by the Church of Scientology, so much so that many Scientologists believe that it was invented by their founder L. Ron Hubbard."&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;

According to the 1986 memoirs of Hubbard's son, [[Ronald DeWolf]], after establishing usage of the E-meter in Dianetics, Hubbard asked Mathison to give the patent rights to him, but Mathison refused to give up the patent rights, wishing that it remain the "Mathison E-meter".&lt;ref name="clearthinking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pilkington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corydon" /&gt;  Mathison was granted {{US Patent|2684670}} for his vacuum tube E-meter in 1954.  But DeWolf was inconsistent on this history.  In an earlier sworn affidavit to the Federal District Court in about 1980, DeWolf stated that Mathison gave Hubbard his rights to the E-meter in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = DeWolf|first1 = Ronald|title = Affidavit of Ronald DeWolf|url = http://www.ronthenut.org/dewolf.htm|website = Ron the Nut|publisher = Organized Crime Civilian Response|accessdate = 30 April 2015|date = 1980|quote = My father obtained the rights to the E-meter in 1952 from Volney Mathison in the same manner that he does everything - through fraud and coercion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another writer tells yet a third version this history.  According to [[Gordon Melton]], the first E-meter was "developed by Volney Mathison, following Hubbard's designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J. Gordon|title=Studies in Contemporary Religion: The Church of Scientology|date=2000|publisher=Signature Books, Inc.|location=United States of America |page=10 |isbn=1-56085-139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the E-meter in Dianetics practice was subsequently stopped by Hubbard in 1954.&lt;ref name="pilkington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corydon"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Corydon  | first =Bent | title = [[L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?]] | publisher =Barricade Books  | year =1992  | pages =332–333 | isbn = 0-942637-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Hubbard was awarded a United States patent for a solid-state E-meter, described as a "Device for Measuring and Indicating Changes in Resistance of a Living Body".&lt;ref name="clearthinking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pilkington" /&gt;

According to some writers, Mathison was bitter and disillusioned about Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dianetik und Scientology in ihrem Anspruch als Wissenschaft|first=Tilo|last=Müller|pages=32|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2010|ISBN=978-3-640-58010-1|quote=Mathison stated: "I decry the doings of trivial fakers, such as scientologists and the like, who glibly denounce hypnosis and then try covertly to use it in their phony systems"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Allen was born in [[Fernandina Beach, Florida|Fernandina Beach]], [[Florida]], in 1944, as the oldest of twelve children of a [[Baptist]] preacher. During high school, he studied science at [[Virginia Union University]], but his interests shifted to politics and philosophy, and he moved to [[Pepperdine College]], where he graduated in 1967 (B.A., M. A. 1968) and received a Ph.D. In 1972 from [[Claremont Graduate University]]. In 1970–71, he was [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Advanced Teaching Fellow]] at [[University of Rouen]] in [[France]]. He was appointed Assistant Professor at the School of Government and Public Administration at [[American University]] in 1971 and the next year he became Assistant Professor of Government at [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1972, with tenure in 1976. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1976 and served as full Professor from 1983–94.&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;[http://www.docjax.com/document/view.shtml?id=809742&amp;title=RESUME%20-%20Dr.%20William%20B.%20Allen Resume] DocJax.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="york"&gt;[http://www.yorktownuniversity.com/faculty/allen.html William B. Allen, PhD] Yorktown University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="che"&gt;Sara Hebel: [http://www.goacta.org/press/Articles/1999Articles/99-08-13CHE.pdf "Virginia's Higher-Education Chief Bows Out After 13 Tumultuous Months"], ''Chronicles for Higher Education,'' August 13, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen was a member of the National Council on the Humanities 1984–87. He resigned to take seat on the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], on which he served until 1992. He was chairman of the commission from August 8, 1988 to October 23, 1989.

Allen was Dean and Professor at [[James Madison College]], Michigan State University, 1993–98. Under his leadership, the College gained broad national recognition as a center of liberal education, faculty and student life was vivified, and faculty productivity saw a dramatic increase.&lt;ref name=york /&gt; The following year, he was Executive Director of the [[State Council of Higher Education for Virginia]]. During his tenure, Council staff and operations were thoroughly reorganized, focusing on its two statutory obligations – public policy recommendations, and administration of educational programs.  Under his guidance the agency developed major strategic planning, funding formula, program assessment, and general education recommendations. He successfully put questions like making colleges more accountable for the state money they get on the agenda in Virginia.&lt;ref name=york /&gt;&lt;ref name=che /&gt;

'''The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe''' (ZTFE) is a religious, cultural and social organisation for Zoroastrians residing in [[Europe]], namely the [[United Kingdom]]. It was founded on 31 October 1861&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Jenny|title=Zoroastrianism: A Guide for the Perplexed}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Muncherjee Hormusji Cama]] and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palsetia|first1=Jesse S.|title=The Parsis of India: Preservation of Identity in Bombay City}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the time of its founding, it was reported that there were approximately fifty Zoroastrians present in England who were mainly students. However, [[Parsi|Zoroastrians]] have been present in the United Kingdom long before the foundation of the ZTFE; the first known Parsi arrival being Nowroji Rustom Maneck Sett (Nowroji Rustomji) in 1721&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-xCUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=nowroji+rustamji&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vKOYnhUcFR&amp;sig=H1kL3mlBFTeL9gZHdF7N_FDSPGE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiizMizgLfXAhWBtxoKHSwiAqgQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=nowroji%20rustamji&amp;f=false|title=Routledge Handbook of the South Asian Diaspora|last=Chatterji|first=Joya|last2=Washbrook|first2=David|date=2014-01-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136018244|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rustom Maneck of Surat (1635–1721 CE). Intercessor Extraordinaire|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/parsi/surat3.htm|publisher=Heritage Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are around 5,000 members of the ZTFE.

The secretariat and principal venue attached to the organisation is ''The Zoroastrian Centre'' located in the [[Rayners Lane]] area of [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]]. The centre is a [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II* listed]] [[Art Deco]] former ACE cinema.&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1079729|desc=ACE Cinema|access-date=19 June 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9047000/9047764.stm|title=In pictures: 20 years of saving London's buildings|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the ZTFE also manage the "Parsee burial ground" established in 1862, at [[Brookwood Cemetery]] which is the only operating Zoroastrian burial ground in Europe.[[File:Parsee Brookwood Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Zoroastrian graves at Brookwood Cemetery]] [[File:Brookwood Zoroastrian Cemetery building.jpg|thumb|Zoroastrian building at Brookwood Cemetery]]

Notable visitors to The Zoroastrian Centre in recent years include [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Dr Rowan Williams]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Proctor|first1=Ian|url=https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/prince-philip-delighted-attend-harrow-5982495|title=Prince Philip 'delighted' to attend Harrow Zoroastrian association's 150th anniversary | date=6 October 2011 | accessdate=12 February 2018|work=Get West London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rowanwilliams.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/939/archbishop-makes-first-official-visit-to-a-zoroastrian-place-of-worship|title=Archbishop makes first official visit to a Zoroastrian place of worship|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZTFE News 2009|url=http://www.ztfe.com/News/Summer2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first formal move to organise the growing Parsi community in the United Kingdom was from Muncherjee Cama who was joined by Dadabhai Naoroji in a circular letter to the fifty Parsis they knew to be in London in 1861.&lt;ref name="Hinnells2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfO4-5yh7VYC|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration|date=28 April 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-826759-1|page=388|author=John R. Hinnells|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially founded as ''''Europena Zarthost Dharmanu Khatu'''' as ('''"The Religious Funds of the Zoroastrians in Europe"''' in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), in [[Kensington|Kensington, London]]; the first meeting was attended by fifteen [[Parsis]] at Cama's residence at 24 Devonshire Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinnells|first1=John|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"Religious Funds of the Zoroastrians of Europe"''' existed to purchase land for the burial of the dead, help stranded or destitute Zoroastrians; to purchase and produce books on Zoroastrianism; to fund research on Zoroastrianism; to establish a 'House of Prayer' and general fund for miscellaneous expenses.

Under its regulations four of the seven managing trustees were to be students, with other members representing the association at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Edinburgh]].

Whilst the association initially consisted of Parsis only they were active in campaigning for the rights of the [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecuted Zoroastrians in Iran]]. Dadabhai Naoroji and [[Mancherjee Bhownagree]], both presidents of the ZTFE and MPs addressed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on this issue. On the six occasions, Shah [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] visited London; Parsi delegations from the ZTFE were present to advocate for their Iranian co-religionists suffering intense [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecution]] under the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Desh Pardesh: The South Asian Presence in Britain|isbn=9781850650928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
