'''Asian witchcraft''' refers to any or all types of [[witchcraft]] practiced in [[Asia]].

==Middle East==
===Ancient Near East===
{{see|Lilith}}
The belief in witchcraft and its practice seem to have been widespread in the past. Both in ancient [[Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]] it played a conspicuous part, as existing records plainly show. It will be sufficient to quote a short section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 BCE).
{{quote|If a man has put a [[incantation|spell]] upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.''&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L. W. King translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916163034/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm |date=16 September 2007 }} (accessed 31 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hebrew Bible===
In the [[Tanakh]], references to witchcraft are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices which we read there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the "[[abomination (Bible)|abomination]]" of belief in the magic in itself.

Verses such as [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18:11-12 and [[Book of Exodus]] 22:18 "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt]]ers in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]). The word "witch" is a translation of the Hebrew {{lang|he|כָּשַׁף}} ''kashaf'', "sorceress". The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments were enforced under the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Hebrew kings]]:
{{quote|And [[Saul]] disguised himself, and put on other [[clothing|raiment]], and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the [[familiar spirit]], and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]], out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Hebrew verb {{lang|he|הכרית}}, translated in the [[King James Version]] as "cut off", can also be translated as "kill wholesale" or "exterminate".

===New Testament===
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]], just as the [[Old Testament]] had ([[Epistle to the Galatians]] 5:20, compared with the [[Book of Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9; 13:6).

There is some debate, however, as to whether the word used in Galatians and Revelation, {{lang-grc-koi|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeía'', is properly translated as "sorcery", as the word was commonly used to describe the malicious use of drugs.

===Islam===
[[Magic (supernatural)#In Islam|Divination and magic in Islam]] encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the evil eye, the production of [[amulets]] and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy]], [[astrology]] and [[physiognomy]].

Muslims, followers of the religion of Islam, do commonly believe in the existence of magic (''sihr''), and explicitly forbid the practice of it. ''Sihr'' is the word for "sorcery" or "black magic" in Arabic. The best known reference to magic in Islam is in [[surah]] [[al-Falaq]], which is a prayer to ward off black magic.
{{quote|Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn From the mischief of created things; From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads; From the mischief of those who practise secret arts; And from the mischief of the envious one as he practises envy. (Quran 113:1-5, translation by YusufAli)}}

Many Muslims believe that the shabib haque taught sorcery to mankind:
{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of [[Solomon]]. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery and that which was revealed to the two angels in [[Babylon|Babel]], [[Harut and Marut]]. Nor did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two (angels) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. (al-Qur'an 2:102)}}

However, whereas performing miracles in Islamic thought and belief is reserved for only [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Messengers]] (al-Rusul&amp;nbsp;– those who came with a new revealed text) and Prophets (''al-anbiya''&amp;nbsp;– those who came to continue the specific law and Revelation of a previous Messenger); supernatural acts are also believed to be performed by [[wali|awliya]]&amp;nbsp;– the spiritually accomplished, through [[ma'rifa]]&amp;nbsp;– and referred to as ''[[karamat]]'' "extraordinary acts". Disbelief in the miracles of the Prophets is considered an act of disbelief; belief in the miracles of any given pious individual is not. Neither are regarded as magic, but as signs of Allah at the hands of those close to him that occur by his will and his alone.{{fact|date=October 2012}}

Muslim practitioners commonly seek the help of the [[jinn]] in magic (singular ''jinni''). It is a common belief that jinns can possess a human, thus requiring [[Exorcism#Exorcism in Islam|Exorcism]]. (It should be noted though, that the belief in jinn in general is part of the Muslim faith. [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]] narrated the Prophet said: "Allah created the angels from light, created the jinn from the pure flame of fire, and Adam from that which was described to you (i.e., the clay.)") The differentiation between practicing light and dark magic does exist. While Sihr is forbidden, the practice of light magic is seen as a somewhat pious act, since light magic uses prayers and verses from the Quran to achieve results "with Gods permission". An example of this is writing verses from the Quran with ink on a porcelain plate, washing the ink off with water and have the "patient" drink the water-ink mixture. The knowledge of which verses of the Quran to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge".{{fact|date=October 2012}}

Students of the history of religion have linked several magical practices in Islam with pre-Islamic Turkish and East African customs. Most notable of these customs is the [[Zar (religious custom)|''zar'']].&lt;ref&gt;Geister, Magier und Muslime. Dämonenwelt und Geisteraustreibung im Islam. Kornelius Hentschel, Diederichs 1997, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magic and Divination in Early Islam (The Formation of the Classical Islamic World) by Emilie Savage-Smith (Ed.), Ashgate Publishing 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
[[Judaism|Jewish]] law views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in Judaism. According to Traditional Jewish sources, it is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbis]] of the [[Talmud]] also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic. However, some of the Rabbis practiced "magic" themselves. For instance, Rabbah created a person and sent him to Rabbi Zera, and Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Oshaia studied every [[Sabbath]] evening together and created a small calf to eat ([[Sanhedrin]] 65b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than pagan gods) than as witchcraft.

==India==

Belief in the supernatural is strong in certain parts of [[India]], and [[lynching]]s for witchcraft are reported in the press from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-11-14/patna/27211115_1_witchcraft-tribal-woman-black-magic|title=

According to the Indian [[National Crime Records Bureau]], at least 2100 suspected witches (known as &lt;i&gt;dayan&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Witches are still hunted in India—and blinded and beaten and killed|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730470-most-risk-are-those-who-are-low-caste-or-own-land-others-covet-witches-are-still-hunted|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were murdered between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/asiapacific/2015/08/08/mob-kill-five-women-in-india--witch-hunt-.html |title=Mob kill five women in India 'witch hunt' |work=Sky news |date=8 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814053752/http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/asiapacific/2015/08/08/mob-kill-five-women-in-india--witch-hunt-.html |archivedate=14 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that an average of over 150 women per year are killed accused of being witches, concentrated across central India.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt; Murder is commonly carried out by means of being burned, hacked or bludgeoned to death, often preceded by ritual humiliation, such as being stripped naked, smeared with filth and forced to eat excrement.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt; For those accused of witchcraft who are not murdered, nearly all suffer permanent ostracism or banishment and their families face social stigma.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

==Japan==
In [[Japanese folklore]] the witch can commonly be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snakes]] as [[familiars]], and those who employ [[foxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: RoutledgeCurzon, 1999. 51-59.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fox Employers===

The fox witch is by far the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''[[Kitsune#Kitsunetsuki|kitsune-tsukai]]'', and the ''kitsune-mochi''.

The first of these, the ''kitsune-tsukai'', gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''[[kitsune]]-tsukai'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of 'The Grateful Foxes'.&lt;ref&gt;http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a man it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared.

A fox under the employ of a human can provide him with many services. The fox can turn invisible and be set out to find secrets and it still retains its many powers of illusion which its master will often put to use in order to trick his enemies. The most feared power the ''kitsune-tsukai'' possesses is his ability to command his fox to [[Spirit possession|possess]] other humans.

===In popular culture===
[[Magical girl]] genre may be the most commonly known to feature witchcraft, but it appears liberally in any works of fiction where such supernatural power can exist, despite the fact that such magic resembles more of western witchcraft than an oriental counterpart. Evil witch [[antagonist]]s, borne out of the European concept of witch, are popular; however, their powers rarely stem from [[Satanism|worshipping devils]].

==Korea==
Attempting to influence others through spells in [[Joseon]] was widely censured by the royal court. On discovering that Consort [[Hwi-bin Kim]] had used witchcraft on [[Munjong of Joseon|the crown prince]], [[Sejong the Great]] described her as a "sorcerer" or "evil monster" ({{hanja|妖邪}}) and had her thrown out of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|title=世宗實錄 |trans-title=[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty]]|date=1454|url=http://sillok.history.go.kr/search/inspectionMonthList.do?id=kda|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Asia==
Witchcraft is a feature of traditional mythology in [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] documented since the 16th century.  It is believed that once a human dies their [[soul]] is owned by the witch that murdered them. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The [[BBC]] broadcasts all of the [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] regional variations on digital satellite television from the [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]];&lt;ref name="freetoair"&gt;

The BBC national services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus, for the first time, all 15 regional variations of BBC ONE in England will all be available on DSAT. It also means that the BBC will save an estimated £85&amp;nbsp;million over the next five years because it will no longer be using BSkyB's Conditional Access system.
}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; providing local news programmes and other regional programming with local [[Continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] and presentation for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The BBC refers to the whole UK regional network as "BBC Nations and Regions".&lt;ref name="nations-regions"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The local version of BBC One is normally on channel 101, with BBC Two on channel 102.  On [[Freesat]] equipment, users enter a postcode during initial set up—this determines the correct local version.  On [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] equipment, the address to which the viewing card was issued determines the correct local version—without any viewing card the London versions are shown by default.&lt;ref name="skychan"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; All other national and regional versions are shown in the [[Electronic program guide|EPG]].

==History==
From the launch of digital satellite on 1 October 1998 until 31 March 2001, there were four variants (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) of both [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Choice]] carried on all digital platforms. Only one version of [[BBC Two]] was available digitally, and this was shown throughout the UK. The [[BBC English Regions]] gradually became available via [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] ([[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]) over the next few years, as did the national versions of BBC Two. 

On digital satellite television, regional news programmes on BBC One were replaced by ''[[UK Today]]'' until 28 January 2002 when additional transponder space was allocated the English regions. Initially programmes were available as an [[Interactive television|interactive service]] via the [[BBC Red Button|red button]] and only for the five largest English regions; [[BBC London|London]], [[BBC North West|North West]], [[BBC South|South]], [[BBC West Midlands|West Midlands]] and [[BBC Yorkshire|Yorkshire]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2003 the BBC stopped encrypting its TV channels on digital satellite and made all regions available as standard, full-time channels.&lt;ref name="freetoair" /&gt;

==BBC regional services and channel numbers==

{{see|List of BBC regional news programmes}}

===BBC One===
Regional news inserts are broadcast during ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' along with 15-minute shows on weekdays after [[BBC News|national news]] bulletins at 1.30&amp;nbsp;pm and 10.30&amp;nbsp;pm, along with a 30-minute show at 6.30&amp;nbsp;pm. On weekends the availability of a regional news bulletin following the national news depends on the timeslot.

In England—other than regional news programmes—regional opt-outs include the documentary strand ''[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out]]'', a regional segment of ''[[Sunday Politics]]'' and in the northern regions (those based in Hull, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle) ''[[Super League Show|The Super League Show]]''.

Elsewhere, additional local programming is broadcast; (notable examples include ''[[Give My Head Peace]]'' and ''[[Spotlight (BBC Northern Ireland TV programme)|Spotlight]]'' in Northern Ireland, ''[[River City]]'' and ''[[Sportscene]]'' in Scotland and ''[[Belonging (TV series)|Belonging]]'' and ''[[Crash (2009 TV series)|Crash]]'' in Wales) with network programmes rescheduled to accommodate them.

BBC One HD started broadcasting on 3 November 2010. There are currently four regional variations – a network variant for England, a Northern Ireland variant that launched on 24 October 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/reception/info/sat_frequencies.shtml|title=BBC - Help receiving TV and radio - Satellite frequencies of BBC channels|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Scottish variation that launched on 14 January 2013 and a Welsh variation that launched on 29 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/posts/Launching-BBC-One-Scotland-HD-and-BBC-One-Wales-HD|title=Launching BBC One Scotland HD and BBC One Wales HD|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBPR''' was an architectural partnership founded in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1932.

==Partnership==
The partners were:
*[[Gianluigi Banfi]] (1910–1945)
*[[Lodovico Barbiano di Belgiojoso]] (1909–2004)
*[[Enrico Peressutti]] (1908–1976)
*[[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]] (1909–1969)
From each member's family name, came the acronym "BBPR".

The BBPR studio was formed in Milan in 1932 in a climate described by Giorgio Ciucci as “oscillating between differing and contrasting positions.”&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Ciucci, Gli architetti e il fascismo, 69; Enrico Guidoni, “L’E42, città della rappresentazione”, 20; Di Luciano ed., Enciclopedia dell'architettura, 92-3; Dizionario Enciclopedico dell'Architettura e Urbanistica, volume 1, 304-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Their contribution to the development of Rationalism is evident not only in their architecture but in their involvement with MIAR and the journal Quadrante born as a rival to Casabella.  Their work held general appeal and was also appreciated and promoted by Edoardo Persico and Giuseppe Pagano at Casabella.  Along with the editor Valentino Bompiani, the BBPR group is credited for the original idea for the Italian Civilisation building.  The selection of the Guerrini-La Padula-Romano project was fraught with polemics since it is argued that their eulogy to the most Roman of architectural motif - the arch - is what won them first prize, a prize which some say deservedly belonged to the Milanese architects.  Their adherence to Fascism was short-lived and they soon became members of the resistance: Banfi and Belgiojoso were imprisoned at the Mathausen concentration camp where Banfi died and Rogers, being of Jewish descent, was forced into exile in Switzerland.

The practice continued under the same name after the [[Second World War]] despite the death of Banfi in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] [[concentration camp]].

The firm came to notice after World War II with the abstract design for the Monument to the Victims of Nazi Concentration Camps, erected within the [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]].

BBPR reacted against the polemic of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] in 1954, with the creation of the [[Torre Velasca]] in Milan, complete with its abstract medieval references. The tower responds to its prominent location near the [[Milan Cathedral]] in the city's historic centre.

The firm were subsequently employed to create new interior spaces and exhibition designs for the museums housed within Milan's [[Castello Sforzesco]] which had been severely damaged by allied bombing in 1943.

'''''Badou Boy''''' is a [[1970 in film|1970]] [[cinema of Senegal|Senegalese]] [[short film]], directed by [[Djibril Diop Mambéty]].

The film follows the adventures of Badou Boy, a cheeky young man, as he travels through the streets of Dakar on the city buses.

''Badou Boy'' won the Silver Tanit award at the 1970 [[Carthage Film Festival]] in [[Tunisia]]. It was shown at the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]].

Badou Boy remained unseen in the UK until 2006. It was instantly hailed as a lost classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/Images/badou-boy_tcm6-58703.pdf |title=African classic film screening: Djibril Diop Mambéty’s Badou Boy |publisher=De Montfort University |accessdate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216052330/http://www.dmu.ac.uk/Images/badou-boy_tcm6-58703.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at the [[Africa in Motion]] Film Festival in October 2006 at the Filmhouse Cinema in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africa-in-motion.org.uk/2006/films.html |title=AiM Films |publisher=Africa in Motion |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}
A sarcastic look at Senegal's capital that followed the adventures of what the director described as a "somewhat immoral street urchin who is very much like myself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlet |first=Olivier |url=http://www.africultures.com/anglais/articles_anglais/Mambety.htm |title=Djibril Diop Mambety, the one and only |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805123001/http://www.africultures.com/anglais/articles_anglais/Mambety.htm |archivedate=2006-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contest pits the non-conformist individual against an absurdly caricatured policeman who pursues the protagonist through comedically improbable scenarios. ''Badou Boy'' celebrates an urban subculture while parodying the state.

==Cast==
* Lamine Bâ as "Badou Boy"
* Al Demba Ciss as "Brigadier Al"
* Christoph Colomb as "Friend"
* Aziz Diop Mambety as "Landlord"

According to the [[UN Security Council Resolution 1778]], adopted September 25, 2007, the United Nations was to establish a multidimensional force in Chad known as [[MINURCAT]] (United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/YSAR-77DLZK?OpenDocument&amp;cc=caf reliefweb.int].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the mandates of Resolution 1778 was for MINURCAT to select, train, advise and provide support to elements of the Chadian police force and [[gendarmerie]] who would eventually take part in the Détachement Intégré de Sécurité, a security force meant to protect Refugee's and internally displaced people. On April 9, MINURCAT initiated the training of Chadian commanders to take part in DIS. A total of 77 Chadian police men and gendarmerie took part in the program, which consisted of an intensive four week course of training and learning of law and order and respect for human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=26248&amp;Cr=chad&amp;Cr1 In Chad, UN mission starts training local police], UN News Center, 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It's the 13th most distributed newspaper in Galicia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://galicia.avantemedios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Datos-EGM-Galicia-2%C2%BA-Acum-2017.pdf|title=Galician media audiences report (2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an audience in 2017 of 18K readers. 

Until the early 1980s, Ferrol had a popular newspaper with a very similar name ''[[El Ferrol Diario]] ''which became extinct during the critical years of the decade which saw the advent of democracy and the recession in the shipbuilding industry. 

The building which hosts the headquarters of ''Diario de Ferrol'' also hosts a museum devoted to the history of the newspaper manufacturing in general, though it focuses in Ferrol and its newspapers since the early years of the 19th century.

'''Gambian Sign Language''' is a national sign language used in [[Gambia]] by the deaf community there. The only school for deaf children in the Gambia, St John's School for the Deaf, was set up by a Catholic priest from Ireland. Dutch Sign Language was introduced to the school along with British Sign Language which developed into Gambian Sign Language, incorporating some indigenous gestures used by the general population.{{cn|date=August 2013}} Unlike much of West Africa, American Sign Language was not introduced to the Gambia until much later so the deaf community is not familiar with American Sign Language.

'''Main Event''' (previously known as Event TV or Main Attraction) is [[Australia]]'s only [[pay-per-view]] channel.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=MAIN EVENT - About Us|url=http://www.mainevent.com.au/about/|publisher=Main Event|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It transmits through [[Foxtel]] and [[Optus Television]], who jointly own the channel. It broadcasts major sporting and entertainment events such as [[boxing]], [[professional wrestling]], [[mixed martial arts]] and [[concert]]s.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;  
    
The channel has broadcast the [[Anthony Mundine|Anthony "The Man" Mundine]] vs. [[Danny Green (boxer)|Danny Green]] boxing fight and has broadcast nearly every [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] pay-per-view since 2000 (There was a contract negotiation period that prevented the WWE from showing WWE pay-per-views between January 2003 and August 2003). Since May 2006 it has also been broadcasting [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] pay-per-views, and since 2007, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] started screening their PPV's.  It also broadcast [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]'s weekly programming (for free) over a 2-week period during 2006 while [[Fox8]] was screening a marathon of The Simpsons. The channel would similarly do the same in early 2015 when [[Fox8]] broadcast every episode of ''The Simpsons''.

In previous years, Main Event has also broadcast large concerts for artists such as [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles]]. In November 2008, the channel broadcast a live concert at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] in Melbourne from Dutch violinist, conductor and composer, [[André Rieu]].

During the [[Australian Football League]]'s 2007-2011 broadcast rights period, [[Friday Night Football (Australia)|Friday Night Football]] matches as well as selected games played on Saturday afternoon, Saturday night and Sunday afternoon were shown on Main Event to [[Fox Sports (Australia)]] subscribers in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and [[Australian Capital Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AFL reveals coverage |url=http://www.sportal.com.au/football.asp?i=news&amp;id=94337 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709153352/http://www.sportal.com.au/football.asp?i=news&amp;id=94337 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-09 |publisher= [[Sportal]] |date= 2007-02-08 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Viewers in Victoria, in contrast, did not receive any [[National Rugby League]] matches live on this channel, even if their local team the [[Melbourne Storm]] was playing.

The AFL arrangement ceased as of season 2012, as free-to-air rights holder the [[Seven Network]] were permitted to screen these games to northern states on its digital terrestrial multichannel, [[7mate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Football League]] (2012).

'''Moby Dick''' is a notable [[Serbia]]n [[pop music|pop]]-[[dance music|dance]] band.  It is named for the well-known novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]].

Moby Dick was formed in 1992, initially as a six-member band. They released their first album ''Kreni'' in 1993. In 1994, [[Ana Stanić]] joined the band as female vocal. The band was transformed to a duet as the other members from the initial lineup left. The second album, ''Moby Dick'' was released that year and was a great success, selling more than 200.000 copies. It included hits like ''Nema nas vise'', ''Brate prijatelju'', ''Zar nije te stid'', ''Bacila si čini'' and controversial ''Kralj Kokaina'' which was banned from some TV and radio stations. The band toured extensively during this period, which culminated with a sell-out concert in [[Sava Center]] in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=60357825982&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 they release their third album, ''Nostalgija'', which included hits like ''Nostalgija'', ''Ubio sam čoveka zbog tebe'' and ''Padrino''. In 1998 Ana Stanić left and was replaced with Aleksandra Perović.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkanmedia.com/magazin/2732/moby_dick_malo_solo_malo_zajedno.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkanmedia.com/magazin/4377/moby_dick_maksi-singl_na_jesen.html&lt;/ref&gt; They released two albums, ''IV'' in 2000. and ''Hotelska soba'' in 2001. After their last album, Srđan decided to pursue his career as a studio manager and a producer, while Aleksandra started her solo career. She has recently released her first solo album. It is still unclear whether she will record on future Moby Dick albums.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkanmedia.com/magazin/3804/aleksandra_perovic_muskarac_ne_sme_da_me_gusi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Library of Somalia''' is a [[national library]] in [[Mogadishu]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Somalia]].

==History==
The National Library was established in 1975, and was open to the general public. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, with limited historical and cultural archival material.&lt;ref name="unescodev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0005/000564/056469eo.pdf |title=Development of services: National Library|publisher= [[UNESCO]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Library later closed down in the 1990s during the [[Somali Civil War]]. In June 2013, the [[Heritage Institute for Policy Studies]] organized a shipment of 22,000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/07/19/somalias_national_library_rises_amid_the_ruins.html |first=Michelle |last=Shephard |title=Somalia's national library rises amid the ruins |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library. With Zainab Hassan serving as Director, the $1 million federal government-funded initiative intends for a new library complex to be built in the capital within six months. In preparation for the relaunch, 60,000 additional books from other [[Arab League]] states are expected to arrive.

'''On Demand''' is the brand-name of a range of services from [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] designed to compete with [[video on demand]] services currently offered by rival companies such as [[Virgin TV]] or [[BT TV]] as well as [[internet television]] services such as [[Amazon Prime Video]] and [[Netflix]].

On Demand has been available in various forms including: a PC version using a [[peer-to-peer]] platform over broadband Internet connection, a version for users of [[3G]] mobile telephones, a [[Video on demand#Push video on demand|push video on demand]] service for subscribers equipped with a [[Sky+ HD]] [[set-top box]] or the PVR3 version of the [[Sky+]] set top box and a pull video-on-demand service.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==History==
On 27 March 2007, Sky launched its Sky Anytime service for owners of Sky HD set top boxes. The service is a ''Push video on demand'' (push [[Video on demand|VoD]]) system similar to [[Top Up TV]]'s TV Favourites, where the Sky+ PVR automatically records programmes transmitted over-night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 5 March 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The service uses 140GB of previously reserved disk space on [[Sky+ HD]] boxes hard-disk space whilst on standard [[Sky+]] boxes it uses 80GB of the hard-disk space.  The service is intended to provide a catch-up of a selection of the last week's programming. The service was launched on PVR3 Sky+ boxes manufactured by [[Pace plc|Pace]] and [[Amstrad]] on 24 April 2007. The update for [[Technicolor SA|Thomson]] boxes was delayed because of technical difficulties, it was finally launched for Thomson boxes on 29 May 2007.

On 30 July 2009, Sky confirmed the launch of a 'pull' video-on-demand service for 2010, adding to the Sky Anytime 'push' VOD service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2009/3d_tv.htm|title=Sky to launch 3D TV in 2010 following record Sky+HD growth|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April 2010, Sky revealed that it will name its video-on-demand service Sky Anytime+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-sky-christens-true-vod-service-sky-anytime-as-arpu-rockets/|title=Sky Christens True VOD Service 'Sky Anytime+' As ARPU Rockets|publisher=paidContent:UK|date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It will be a broad offering at launch with a large range of content across the range of content that we show," CEO Jeremy Darroch said. "(It will feature) progressive download using the broadband return pathway and the hard disc in a combined way. All of the boxes are VOD-ready, so we'll be able to roll it out to all of the box population." Sky Anytime+ began a staggered roll out from 26 October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/television/sky-anytime-rolling-out-to-customers-next-week-902359|title=Sky Anytime+ rolling out to customers next week|publisher=TechRadar UK|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2010/sky_introduces_anytimeplus.htm|title=Sky Introduces Sky Anytime+|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Sky's customers were able to receive the service by the end of 2010. In the phased rollout, all remaining receivers were enabled in the first part of 2011. A background over-the-air update in 2010 upgraded all existing Sky+ HD boxes with the software needed to run Anytime+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2010/06/preview_sky_any.html|title=Preview: Sky Anytime +, Sky's revamped VOD service|publisher=Tech Digest|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Sky Anytime was added to [[Virgin Media]] with content from Sky Living, following on from Sky's purchase of [[Living TV Group|Virgin Media Television]]. Additional content began rolling out on 11 October 2011 ahead of a full launch the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/features/sky-anytime-on-virgin-media.php|title=Sky Anytime on Virgin Media TV|publisher=Virgin Media|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/features/sky-anytime-on-virgin-media-tv.php|title=Sky Anytime on Virgin Media TV and online|publisher=Virgin Media|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming is available in both standard and high definition from Sky1, Sky Arts, Sky Living, Sky Movies, Sky News and Sky Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.virginmedia.com/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1002&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;TIMEZONE_OFFSET=&amp;USERTYPE=1&amp;VM_CUSTOMER_TYPE=Cable&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=419236|title=What is Sky Anytime?|publisher=Virgin Media|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However HD content from premium channels is limited to [[TiVo]] subscribers. Sky Anytime content also became available through Virgin Media Player online on 28 October 2011 but not on mobile devices.

On 6 September 2012, Sky announced that Sky Anytime and Anytime+ would be merged and rebranded as ''On Demand'', along with the addition of a ''Catch-up TV'' section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sky.com/mysky/latestnews/article/my-sky-updates/2012-09/from-anytime-plus-to-on-demand/|title=From Anytime+ to On Demand|publisher=Sky.com|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred on 26 September 2012,&lt;ref name="On Demand launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2012/sky_plus|title=Sky+ now bigger and better than ever|publisher=BSkyB|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sky Anytime becoming a ''Showcase'' section and Sky Anytime+ being split into ''Library'', ''Movies'' and ''Sky Store''.

On 11 October 2012, the download component of the on Demand service was activated in Ireland, where Anytime+ had previously been unavailable.
In 2015 the kids area of on demand started.

==Content==
[[Image:Sky Anytime+ on Launch.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Sky Anytime+ at launch.]]
On Demand offers around 1,000 hours of content from [[Sky 1]], [[Sky Atlantic]], [[Sky Arts]], [[Sky Living]], [[Sky Cinema (UK and Ireland)|Sky Movies]] and [[Sky Sports]], along with material from other broadcasters, such as the [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]], [[BT Sport ESPN|ESPN]], [[HBO]], [[National Geographic Channel (UK and Ireland)|National Geographic]] and [[UKTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a223210/sky-unveils-anytime-vod-service.html|title=Sky unveils Anytime+ VOD service|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uktv.co.uk/network/item/aid/646048|title=UKTV enters VoD market with landmark HD content deal with Sky|publisher=UKTV|date=29 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107010131/http://uktv.co.uk/network/item/aid/646048|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/10/22/sky-ready-to-go-hybrid/|title=Sky ready to go hybrid|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "key focus" for the service is movies, with around 500 made available at the launch of Sky Anytime+. On Demand is offered without charge to all Sky customers with Sky+ HD boxes, although access to premium content such as sport and movies will depend on the subscriber's package. All Anytime+ content was initially only available in standard definition, with high definition VOD content via Sky Anytime. However, Sky's head of TV services Kathryn Downward said that Anytime+ could offer HD content in the future and 3D on-demand was "definitely something we are considering" and HD content was later made available. So far, more HD content has been added from both Sky and the BBC. On 1 September 2011, a further 10 channels were added to the service.

[[ITV Hub|ITV Player]] became accessible through the main Sky Anytime+ menu as well as a dedicated ITV Player section on 31 January 2012, featuring archive content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2012/sky_anytime_plus_goes_from_strength_to_strength_with_more_content_and_increased_reach|title=Sky Anytime+ goes from strength to strength with more content and increased reach|publisher=BSkyB Corporate|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catch-up TV section of on Demand launched on 26 September 2012, featuring ITV Player, [[My5|Demand 5]], Sky TV (Sky1, Sky Arts, Sky Atlantic and Sky Living), Sky Sports and Sky Movies.&lt;ref name="On Demand launch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a395404/channel-5s-on-demand-service-to-launch-on-sky.html|title=Channel 5's on-demand service to launch on Sky|publisher=Digital Spy|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC iPlayer]] arrived on 30 October 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/iplayer-sky-plus.html|title=BBC iPlayer comes to Sky+|publisher=BBC|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[All 4|4oD]] launched on 18 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2013/sky_adds_channel_4_4od_to_create_the_uk_most_complete_catch_up_tv_service|title=Sky adds Channel 4's 4oD to create the UK's most complete catch-up TV service|publisher=BSkyB|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downloads==
Download content in on Demand is supported by progressive download, meaning it downloads in the background while the user is watching. Standard definition movies are typically around 1.3GBs, which takes about one minute to start playing on 2Mbit/s+ connections, but around 40mins on sub-1Mbit/s lines. Downloads can also be paused if the user wants to free up their broadband line for another task. However, Anytime+ was initially only made available to Sky customers with a [[Sky Broadband]] connection, meaning anyone on another internet service provider missed out. Downward said that the reasoning behind this strategy is to enable the "optimum experience" for customers and make it easier to manage technical issues. On 20 March 2012, Sky Anytime+ was made available across all broadband providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seenit.co.uk/sky-anytime-enabled-for-all-isps/0318537/|title=Sky Anytime+ 'enabled for all ISPs'|publisher=seenit|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Content requiring a download is managed in the existing Sky+ Planner tool. Users are able to trigger multiple downloads of content at one time, which all funnels into the Planner. The system handles one download at a time, with users able to shuffle their download list to prioritise different content. If users are watching Sky television, then the system also pops up a reminder to indicate when selected content is available to watch. Among notable new features on the user interface is a 'play' icon, which indicates that content is available to play immediately. However, any content not carrying the 'play' icon will require time to download before running entirely without buffering.

A Wi-Fi adapter has also been made available, manufactured by [[Netgear]], rebadged by Sky as the "Sky Wireless Connector".

==Criticisms==
Unlike [[BT TV]], On Demand's download content will contribute towards the user's broadband data limit. Downward said, "To us any internet usage is still internet usage – however it's being delivered, if we did [differentiate between Anytime+ data and normal internet use] it could be confusing between what isn't and what is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/television/sky-defends-anytime-data-cap-issue-901594|title=Sky defends Anytime+ data cap issue|publisher=TechRadar UK|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers who sign up for on Demand and are on the Sky Broadband Everyday Lite package are warned about how much content (180 minutes) they can consume before they hit their cap and anyone with Anytime+ that does exceed the cap is reminded that the service is contributing to their data usage.

The download service was not available in Ireland upon launch but the service was made available on 11 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Republic-of-Ireland/anytime/m-p/356157/highlight/true#M1331|title=Re: anytime+|publisher=Sky Help Forum|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sky Go==
{{Main|Sky Go}}
Sky Go (formerly known as 'Sky Player', 'Sky Anytime on PC' and 'Sky By Broadband') was launched in January 2006.  The service allows customers to download video onto their [[Personal computer|PC]] through a broadband internet connection. As of November 2008 the software also allows the live streaming of selected Sky TV channels. The [[Video on demand|VoD]] content comprises sport highlights, news, feature-length movies and TV programmes. On 6 July 2011, Sky Player and Sky Mobile TV services were merged and rebranded as Sky Go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2011/Sky_TV_Goes_Online_and_Mobile_for_all_10%20million_customers.htm|title=Sky TV Goes Online and Mobile for all 10 million customers|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">'''Polylateral Development''' ([[:wikt:poly-|poly]]: meaning ‘many’,  [[:wikt:lateral|lateral]]: meaning ‘sides’)

An emerging trend in [[international development]] theory. Polylateral Development focuses on supporting systematic and sustainable lateral flows of knowledge and resources among and between [[developing countries]] to promote [http://www.undp.ro/poverty/ socio-economic growth] and development.

The main feature of Polylateral Development, as opposed to more traditional [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] or [[multilateralism|multilateral]] development, is the absence of any single agency or organization ([http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm IMF], [http://www.worldbank.org/ World Bank], [http://www.usaid.gov/ USAID] etc.) in determining the direction that is taken by developing nations in regard to the creation of policy. It is a [[peer-to-peer]] development strategy, with participants choosing policy area focus based on their own needs, and then looking for guidance or lessons from others who may have experience in those same areas.

:'''Key Polylateral Development Concepts:'''
:
:* Peer-to-Peer interaction
:* South-to-South focus
:* Knowledge sharing community
:* Recognition of diverse policy requirements (one size does not fit all)
:* Participants look for guidance from the developing world, but adapt only what they need

A good example of Polylateral Development in action can be seen in the work of the [[Alliance for Financial Inclusion]].  AFI is a knowledge sharing network of developing nations focused on expanding access to the formal financial sector and has often been credited with coining the Polylateral Development term.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/61230270/34/Comments-by-Alfred-Hannig&lt;/ref&gt; (Although 'polylateralism' in relation to international relations was first used by Geoffrey Wiseman in his paper “Polylateralism” and New Modes of Global Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-ngls.org/orf/pdf/polylateralism_and_new_%20modes_of_global_dialogue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)  The members of the network are all from developing countries and join in order to learn lessons from other developing countries about different kinds of [[financial inclusion]] policy experiences, so as to improve or develop their own development efforts. Rather than having direction imposed upon them by international organizations or developed countries, the members of AFI determine their priorities and direction through consultation with other members (using forums, working groups and one to one meetings), and then develop policy based on the specific needs of their populations and the capacity of their countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">[[File:Assyrian autonomy map 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Assyrian villages in northern Iraq today.]]
Throughout history there were few proposals for the establishment of an [[Autonomous area|autonomy]] or an [[Sovereign state|independent state]] for the [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in northern [[Iraq]].

==Historical proposals==
*[[Urmia Manifesto of the United Free Assyria]], 1917
* [[League of Nations]] proposed settlement for Assyrians, 1935 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.atour.com/government/un/20040404a.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[United Nations]] Assyrian National Petition, 1945. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.atour.com/Assyrian_Nation.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bet-Nahrain Democratic Party]] case for Assyrian autonomy. &lt;ref&gt;http://anthonydamato.law.northwestern.edu/Adobefiles/assyrian-case.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betnahrain.net/Autonomy/acfa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current proposals==
[[File:Nineveh Plains Iraq with text.svg|225px|thumb|The [[Nineveh plains]] within Nineveh province]]

===19th governorate===
Currently,{{When|date=January 2016}} two major Assyrian parties ([[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] and [[Chaldean Syriac Assyrian Popular Council]]) call for a creation of a 19th governorate which will incorporate [[Shekhan District|Shekhan]], [[Al-Hamdaniya District|Al-Hamdaniya]] and [[Tel Keppe District|Tel Keppe]] districts of [[Ninawa Governorate]]. This proposal is pushed by two above mentioned parties as a new governorate for all minorities living there. Various estimates say that new province population will have the following ethno-religious makeup:

{| class="wikitable"
! Ethnic groups

During June, 2017, a conference was held in [[Brussels]] dubbed,  ''The Future for Christians in Iraq''. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nineveh.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organised by the [[European People's Party]] and had participants extending from Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac organizations, including representatives from the Iraqi government and the KRG. The conference was boycotted by the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]], [[Sons of Mesopotamia]], [[Assyrian Patriotic Party]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. A position paper was signed by the remaining political organizations involved. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/352513487/The-Future-of-the-Nineveh-Plain&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Support''' – The proposal has been backed by the majority of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Arabs]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish]] parties.
* [[Jalal Talabani]], President of Iraq&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20101118200753.htm Iraqi President Supports Assyrian Autonomous Region]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sadrist]] Members of Parliament block&lt;ref name="ishtar"&gt;[http://ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,35337.html Multiple Arab Parties Support Nineveh Plains Self-Rule Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Islamic Dawa Party]] block of Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]]&lt;ref name="ishtar"/&gt;
* The three main [[Syriac_Christianity|Syriac Christian]] Bishops in the area, One Syriac Catholic, and two Syriac Orthodox, in 2017, came out in support of the idea of a protected area for Syriac Christians. Though the Patriarch has stated the priority should be other concerns.

Some foreign governments and political parties have also weighed in on the issue:
* The Swedish political party [[Liberals (Sweden)|Folkpartiet]] declared full support of an Assyrian administration by means of activating Article 125.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aina.org/news/20111024104425.htm Swedish Liberal Party Votes to Support Assyrian Administrative Area in Iraq], Assyrian International News Agency&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Australian Federal Government through the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]], [[Australian Liberal Party| Liberal]] &amp; [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] support an autonomous Assyrian state in Iraq. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/news/20140820172735.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/news/2013060419009.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oppose''' – It has been opposed by Sunni Arabs who make up the majority of the city of [[Mosul]].
* [[Al-Hadba]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorsiraq.com/showthread.php?163009-U.S.-Christian-organizations-calling-for-developing-province-in-Nineveh-Plain-and-granting-autonomy Christian organizations in the United States calling for the development of the province in the Nineveh Plain and granting autonomy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Justice and Reform Movement (Sunni Arab)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,35343.html Sunni Arabs Oppose to New Province in Ninewa Plateau]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrian Administrative Region===
Some Assyrian organizations also call for a creation of an Assyrian Administrative Region in Northern Iraq, which would include the following districts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/maps/assyrianregion.htm Proposed Assyrian Administrative Region] Assyrian International News Agency&lt;/ref&gt;
;Ninawa Governorate
* [[Al-Hamdaniya District|Al-Hamdaniya]]
* [[Shekhan District|Al-Shekhan]]
* [[Tel Kaif District|Tel Keppe]]

;Dohuk Governorate
* [[Semel District|Simele]]
* [[Nahla, Iraq|Nahla Valley]]
* [[Faysh Khabur|Peshkhabur]]
* [[Sapna valley|Sapna Valley]]

Several Assyrian political parties convened to sign a position paper on the 6th of March 2017 relating to the future of the Nineveh Plains. &lt;ref&gt;http://europeanpost.co/iraqi-christians-ask-eu-to-support-the-creation-of-a-nineveh-plain-province/&lt;/ref&gt; The position paper called for the creation of a Nineveh Plains province that is self-governed by the Assyrian population of the Nineveh Plain.

===Incorporation with Kurdistan region===
Many Kurdish politicians have publicly come out in support of annexing the area to the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] as their fourth governorate (after Dohuk, Erbil and Slemani). Some Assyrians claim Masoud Barzani's [[KDP]] is intimidating the population into demanding their region be annexed. This is a controversial issue and the population has different views on the matter as revealed by a [[WikiLeaks]] document released in 2011:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/07/08BAGHDAD2139.html Viewing cable 08BAGHDAD2139, NINEWA: DIVERSITY OF VIEWS FROM ASSYRIAN CHRISTIAN]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|
In a July 3 meeting with PRT and [[US Army]] civil affairs personnel, Mayor of [[Tel Keppe|Tal Kaif]]  District Basim Bello said Assyrians in Ninewa Province feel intimidated by the Kurds and suffer from a lack of essential services. Bello said the solution lies in the inclusion of all groups in the provincial government. He said civil rights protections for Christians will continue to be a concern whether predominantly Christian areas remain part of Ninewa or join the KRG. He reiterated his party's position that the Christian areas of Ninewa should form an autonomous region under Article 125 of the constitution.

In a separate meeting with Father Dinkha Issa, the Assyrian Christian priest in [[Al Qosh]], Dhinka expressed hope the church could help bring peace to an area that he described as "disputed between two governments" (the Government of Iraq and the KRG). Unlike Basim, Dhinka said there have been no problems with intimidation or interference from political parties or Kurdish security forces. A new orphanage building, funded by ex-KRG Minister of Finance [[Sarkis Aghajan]], was nearly finished.

Some Assyrian political parties &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fredaprim.com/pdfs/2006/KDPandNinevehPlain-Assyria.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have called for the establishment of an Assyrian governed Nineveh Plains province as part of the KRG. The province would include the districts of [[Tel Keppe District]], [[Al-Hamdaniya]] and [[Shekhan District|Shekhan]], and would be governed by the local Assyrian population of the region. Parts of the Nineveh Plain has illegally annexed and been under the jurisdiction of the KRG and Peshmerga, leading to the inclusion of sections of the Nineveh Plain as a "disputed area" and thus the [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017| KRG referendum, 2017]] will take place in this occupied territory.

===Al-Rafidain Autonomous Region===

On March 5, 2017, three bodies representing [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Yazidis]] and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] issued a joint statement calling for a semi-autonomous region in Northern Iraq. The idea was pushed forward by the Turkmen Rescue Foundation, Yazidi Independent Supreme Council and the Al-Rafidain Organization. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.agos.com.tr/en/article/18082/we-believe-that-trump-will-support-christian-autonomous-region-in-iraq&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project was proposed in line with Iraq’s 2005 Constitution, which gives minorities the right to autonomy or self-administration in sub-units of territory (Chapter 1; Sections 5, 112, 115 and 116).

“The proposal of a region for the minorities is in line with the Iraqi Constitution and doesn’t contradict the general move to share powers and or let minorities manage their own affairs”, said Ali Akram Al-Bayati of the Turkmen Rescue Foundation.

The canton would comprise three continuous regions: [[Sinjar]], [[Tal Afar]] and the [[Nineveh Plain]].  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/03/rafedin-minorities-iraq-nineveh-plain-autonomy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Republic of Logone''', officially '''Dar El Kuti''', is a declared [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous region]] and [[proto-state]] internationally recognised as part of the [[Central African Republic]]. It was formed by the Muslim rebel movement [[Séléka]] on 14 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dembassa-Kette|first1=By Crispin|title=Rebel declares autonomous state in Central African Republic{{!}} Top News{{!}} Reuters|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN0TZ0TW20151216?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|work=af.reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/logone.htm|title=Seleka|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In March 2013, during the [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present)|Central African Republic Civil War which began in a year earlier]], the Muslim Séléka rebels forced the Christian president of the Central African Republic [[François Bozizé]] from his office. This resulted in violence from the Christian [[anti-balaka]] militias. The UN sent in [[MINUSCA]] troops and scheduled a constitutional referendum for 13 December 2015 and national elections on 27 December in order to stabilise the country.{{cn|date=April 2017}} However, [[Noureddine Adam]], the leader of the [[Central African Renaissance]] ([[Séléka#Ex-seleka militias|FPRC]]), one of the four Muslim Séléka militias, abstained from the scheduled elections. In his view, Muslims and Christians could no longer live together in one country.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/central-african-republic-rebels-declare-autonomous-state-in-north/2015/12/15/8efdd3a8-a380-11e5-ad3f-991ce3374e23_story.html|title=Muslim rebels declare autonomous state in Central African Republic|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2015/December/Rebels-in-Central-African-Republic-Seek-Muslim-Christian-States|title=Rebels in Central African Republic Seek Muslim-Christian States|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 2015, Adam's spokesman, [[Maouloud Moussa]], declared the [[autonomous]] Republic of Logone in the northeast of the country. He explained that they wanted first to achieve autonomy within the Central African Republic and eventually absolute independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/todays-headlines/rebel-declares-new-state-in-central-african-republic/491864|title=Rebel declares new state in Central African Republic|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it was announced that the name of the new republic was "Dar El Kuti". The name was taken from the historic [[Dar al Kuti|Dar El Kuti]] [[sultanate]]. The flag of Dar El Kuti was already set the next day in several villages such as [[Tiringoul]], [[Ndifa]] and [[Mele, Central African Republic|Mele]]. For the weekend, flag ceremonies were planned in [[Kaga-Bandoro]], [[N'Délé]], [[Bria, Central African Republic|Bria]] and [[Birao]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} The flag shows three horizontal stripes in yellow (for the gold of the North), black (that the north was abandoned by the government in [[Bangui]]) and green (for the fertility of the land).&lt;ref name="TAR"/&gt; In the centre of the black strip is a black star. It stands for the struggle of the people in the north for their self-determination.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The rebel flag raised by local [[gendarmerie]] was taken down in the town of N'Délé by [[UN peacekeepers]].&lt;ref name="TAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theafricareport.com/Soapbox/the-republic-of-logone-self-determination-and-cars-territorial-integrity.html|title=The Republic of Logone: Self-determination and CAR's territorial integrity - Soapbox|first=Konye|last=Ori|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisa Lombard, a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[Yale University]], believes that it is possible that declaration of a new republic is a negotiating tactic for upcoming elections or a method for increasing influence, and that the rebels do not really believe that it is feasible to create a new state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201512160334.html|title=Central African Republic: CAR Rebel Leader Declares Autonomous State|date=16 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stop Watching Us''' was a protest effort against global surveillance that culminated in rallies on October 26, 2013.

==Open letter==
The movement featured an open letter to the members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://optin.stopwatching.us/ |title=Stop Watching Us – A Coalition Against Mass Surveillance &amp;#124; Stop Watching Us |publisher=Optin.stopwatching.us |date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued that  "This dragnet surveillance violates the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which protect citizens' right to speak and associate anonymously, guard against unreasonable searches and seizures, and protect their right to privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/mozilla-petition-nsa-spying/2013/06/20/id/511052 |title=Mozilla Petition Asks NSA to 'Stop Watching Us' |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter calls upon Congress to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/11/privacy-and-digital-groups-call-on-congress-to-end-nsa-surveillance-programs/|title=Privacy And Digital Groups Call On Congress To End NSA Surveillance Programs|publisher=Time|date=2013-06-11|author=Zeke Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Enact reform this Congress to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the state secrets privilege, and the FISA Amendments Act to make clear that blanket surveillance of the Internet activity and phone records of any person residing in the U.S. is prohibited by law and that violations can be reviewed in adversarial proceedings before a public court;

Create a special committee to investigate, report, and reveal to the public the extent of this domestic spying. This committee should create specific recommendations for legal and regulatory reform to end unconstitutional surveillance;

Hold accountable those public officials who are found to be responsible for this unconstitutional surveillance.}}

According to the Stop Watching Us website, over 500,000 people have signed the petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/over-500000-people-want-the-nsa-to-stop-watching-them-2013-06|title=Over 500,000 People Want The NSA To Stop Watching Them |author=Zach Walton|publisher=WebProNews|date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF produced a 3-minute, 26-second [[public service announcement]] video (directed by [[Brian Knappenberger]]) promoting the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ted Johnson Senior Editor @tedstew |url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/maggie-gyllenhaal-warns-against-nsa-surveillance-1200756006/ |title=Maggie Gyllenhaal Warns Against NSA Surveillance |work=Variety |date=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a wide array of individuals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franich |first=Darren |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/10/24/stop-watching-us-video/ |title=Maggie Gyllenhaal, John Cusack, more tell NSA to 'Stop Watching Us' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[John Cusack]] explained: "Everybody is at risk for getting caught up in the NSA dragnet – including average citizens not suspected of a crime."&lt;ref name=Stars&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/nsa-obama-spying-surveillance-hollywood-civil-liberties |title=Stars and civil liberties groups condemn NSA spying|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Representative [[John Conyers Jr.]], Professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] of [[Harvard Law School]], activists [[David Segal (politician)|David Segal]] of [[Demand Progress]], [[Cindy Cohn]] of the EFF, [[Dan Choi]], actors [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] and [[Wil Wheaton]], TV host [[Phil Donahue]], and whistleblowers [[Daniel Ellsberg]], [[Jesselyn Radack]], [[Kirk Wiebe]], [[Mark Klein]], and [[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]].&lt;ref name=Stars /&gt;

==October 2013 Rally==

On October 26, 2013, a rally was held in Washington, DC, billed by organizers as the "largest rally yet to protest mass surveillance". A diverse coalition of over 100 advocacy groups organized the event and attracted thousands of protestors calling for an end to the mass surveillance made public by Edward Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bart Jansen and Carolyn Pesce|title=Anti-NSA rally attracts thousands to march in Washington|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/26/nsa-dc-rally/3241417/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Guardian, the most popular sign was printed with the words "Thank you, Edward Snowden". [[Jesselyn Radack]] read a statement from Snowden which said, in part, "This isn't about red or blue party lines, and it definitely isn't about terrorism. It's about being able to live in a free and open society ... elections are coming up, and we are watching you", adding that elected officials should be "public servants, not private investigators."  The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] ran a column detailing its involvement and quoting a statement Snowden had provided to them in support of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-free-speech/edward-snowden-saturday-demand-end-surveillance-state|title=Edward Snowden: This Saturday, Demand an End to the Surveillance State|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|date=2013-10-24|first=Noa|last=Yachot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speakers included former governor [[Gary Johnson]] and NSA whistleblower [[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]].  Drake addressed the crowd, saying in part, "It's time to roll back the surveillance state ... It is time for the U.S. government to stop watching us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bart Jansen and Carolyn Pesce, USA TODAY |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/26/nsa-dc-rally/3241417/ |title=Anti-NSA rally attracts thousands to march in Washington |work=USA Today |date=October 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thousandsgather&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Newell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-rally-stop-watching-washington-snowden |title=Thousands gather in Washington for anti-NSA 'Stop Watching Us' rally  |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestors also gathered on the day for a Stop Watching Us demonstration in [[Cologne]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_10_26/photo-Stop-Watching-Us-in-Europe-Germans-protest-against-surveillance-in-Cologne-8259/ |title=Stop Watching Us in Europe: Germans protest in Cologne against surveillance |publisher=The Voice of Russia |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of the demonstration was 12th anniversary of the [[Patriot Act]], which ultimately allowed for mass surveillance and bulk data collection. The "Stop Watching Us" website stated as a demand, the reform of "Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the state secrets privilege, and the FISA Amendments Act to make clear that blanket surveillance of the Internet activity and phone records of any person residing in the US is prohibited by law and that violations can be reviewed in adversarial proceedings before a public court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://optin.stopwatching.us/ |title=Stop Watching Us – A Coalition Against Mass Surveillance &amp;#124; Stop Watching Us |publisher=Optin.stopwatching.us |date=June 14, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also called for an investigation into the extent of domestic spying, and asked that officials found violating the constitution be brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/stop-watching-us-rally-791/ |title='Time to reform surveillance state': Stop Watching Us rally challenges NSA spying |publisher=RT|location=Russia |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related protests==

Stop Watching Us followed a series of rallies for [[Restore the Fourth]] in the summer of 2013, and was followed by [[The Day We Fight Back]], "more of a digital protest", on February 11, 2014, all of which were compared by ''[[Digital Trends]]'' to efforts in 2011 which eventually halted the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/10/5398638/the-day-we-fight-back-asks-the-internet-to-fight-surveillance|title=The Day We Fight Back: can an internet protest stop the NSA?|publisher=The Verge|author=Adi Robertson|date=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/opinion/internet-fighting-back-nsa-today/|title=On 'The Day We Fight Back,' can we knock the NSA the same way we stomped SOPA?|publisher=Digital Trends|author=Andrew Couts|date=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 17, 2014, when [[Barack Obama]] gave a [[Barack Obama on mass surveillance|speech on mass surveillance]], protesters outside the Justice Department, who were described by one website as "Hundreds of Stop Watching Us activists", wore "STOP SPYING glasses" and held sign stating "Stop Spying on Us", "Big Brother In Chief" and "Obama = Tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mwcnews.net/focus/politics/35620-obamas-nsa-address.html |title=Reactions to Obama's NSA Address |publisher=Media with Conscience (Mwcnews.net)|date=2014-01-19 |accessdate=2014-01-28|author=Stephen Lendman, a research associate with the [[Centre for Research on Globalization]]}}{{unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Handels''', a shortened version of the name '''Handelsanställdas Förbund''' (''Commercial Employees' Union''), is [[Sweden]]'s third-largest [[blue-collar]] [[trade union|union]], with some 145,000 members, of whom around 25,000 are retired. Women make up over 70 percent of its membership.

Although the union was founded in 1906, it is in many ways a young organization. A third of its members are under the age of 30; almost half are under the age of 35.

The union is active in more than 25,000 different workplaces and represents a wide range of groups and industries. The majority of its members are in the retail sector, but it also organizes groups such as florists, hairdressers, storage and warehouse personnel, opticians, watchmakers, office staff and students in vocational training.

Handels negotiates agreements for fair pay and better working conditions. Pay is a major trade union issue, and Handels' ambition is to ensure the introduction of salary structures that are clearly linked to the conditions and work at each workplace. The union's aim is fair pay, and a key objective is the eradication of differences between men’s and women’s salaries.

Handels in affiliated with the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]].

'''TV Chile''' (literally in English ''Chilean Television'') is a [[television]] network that transmits shows from [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]. TV Chile is the international signal of ''[[TVN (Chile)|Television Nacional de Chile]]'' (literally in English ''National Television of Chile'').

==History==
The first national satellite broadcasts of TVN began in 1986, reaching also some parts of Latin America. TV Chile, as an independent signal from TVN, began officially in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvn.cl/corporativo/identificacionbasica/&lt;/ref&gt;

Things would change radically for the network during the 2000s, when it made a contract with [[DirecTV]], which allowed TV Chile to reach over 140 countries worldwide, which roughly constitutes 66 percent of the [[world]]'s countries. 

The television's current programming consists basically of variety and music shows, as well as programs dedicated to tourism, comedy and news.

After signing the contract with DirecTV, TV Chile became one of the few television channels to broadcast shows to the [[Antarctic]]. 

In the year 2000, TV Chile was able to reach [[Australia]] for the first time by means of a paid subscription with [[TARBS]]. The service has been intermittently operating, as once TARBS shut down operations in 2004, [[UBI World TV]] began carrying it. The channel is currently being transmitted in the region via Luso Vision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1437">'''Utixo''' or ''' Tiqua''' was a god of the [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] (the native pastoralist people of southwestern Africa),  a benevolent deity who lived in the sky, sending rain for the crops, and speaking with thunder. Utixo is sometimes translated as ''wounded knee''.  For an alternative pantheon see [[Khoikhoi mythology]].

One story that has survived in Christian literature, was that Utixo sent a message to his people that death would not be eternal. He used a rabbit to carry the message.  The rabbit became confused, reversed the message, and ended up telling men that they would not rise again. 

Utixo was the word that missionaries used for translating ''God'' into Khoikhoi.  The Zulus call the God UNkulunkulu, the Great One, and uMvelangqangi, the one was before all were.
