'''34 (thirty-four)''' is the [[natural number]] following [[33 (number)|33]] and preceding [[35 (number)|35]].

==In mathematics==
34 is the ninth distinct [[semiprime]] and has four [[divisor]]s including one and itself. Its neighbors, 33 and 35, also are distinct semiprimes, having four divisors each, and 34 is the smallest number to be surrounded by numbers with the same number of divisors as it has.

It is the ninth [[Fibonacci number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000045|title=Sloane's A000045 : Fibonacci numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a companion [[Pell number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002203|title=Sloane's A002203 : Companion Pell numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is an odd-indexed Fibonacci number, 34 is a [[Markov number]], appearing in solutions with other Fibonacci numbers, such as (1, 13, 34), (1, 34, 89), etc.

This number is the [[magic constant]] of a 4 by 4 normal [[magic square]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Number Story: From Counting to Cryptography |last=Higgins |first=Peter |year=2008 |publisher=Copernicus |location=New York |isbn=978-1-84800-000-1 |page=53 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algorithm characterizations''' are attempts to formalize the word [[algorithm]]. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers&lt;ref&gt;cf [164] Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich "Algorithms: A Quest for Absolute Definitions" Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science Number 81 (October 2003), pages 195–225. Reprinted in Chapter on Logic in Computer Science Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science World Scientific, 2004, pages 283–311 Reprinted in Church's Thesis After 70 Years Ontos Verlag, 2006, 24–57}, or http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/FutureOfLogic/paper.pdf (cited in a 2007 Dershowitz–Gurevich paper): Samual R. Buss, [[Alexander S. Kechris]], Anand Pillay, and Richard A. Shore, “The Prospects for Mathematical Logic in the Twenty-first Century”.&lt;/ref&gt; are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the "characterizations" of the notion of "algorithm" in more detail.

== The problem of definition ==
Over the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of "algorithm". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of "output" integers from other "input" integers – "input parameters" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable—by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.

The most common number-manipulation schemes—both in formal mathematics and in routine life—are: (1) the [[computable function|recursive functions]] calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the [[Turing machine]] or its Turing equivalents—the primitive [[register machine]] or "counter machine" model, the [[Random Access Machine]] model (RAM), the [[Random access stored program machine]] model (RASP) and its functional equivalent "the [[computer]]".

When we are doing "arithmetic" we are really calculating by the use of "recursive functions" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade-school, for example, adding and subtracting.

The proofs that every "recursive function" we can ''calculate by hand'' we can ''compute by machine'' and vice versa—note the usage of the words ''calculate'' versus ''compute''—is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the ''thesis'' (unproven assertion) that this includes ''every'' calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of [[Turing machine equivalents|Turing-equivalent]] machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of "algorithm" itself often refers back to "the [[Turing machine]]". This is discussed in more detail under '''Stephen Kleene's characterization'''.

The following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements—elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.

[
&lt;small&gt;A mathematical problem and its result can be considered as two points in a space, and the solution consists of a sequence of steps or a path linking them. Quality of the solution is a function of the path. There might be more than one attribute defined for the path, e.g. length, complexity of shape, an ease of generalizing, difficulty, and so on&lt;/small&gt;.
]

== Chomsky hierarchy == &lt;!-- at 1956 --&gt;
There is more consensus on the "characterization" of the notion of "simple algorithm".

All algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the "simplicity notion" arises from the simplicity of the language. The [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky (1956) hierarchy]] is a [[containment hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s that generate [[formal language]]s. It is used for [[Taxonomy (general)|classifying]] of [[programming language]]s and [[abstract machine]]s.

From the ''Chomsky hierarchy'' perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than  unrestricted), it can be  characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical "unrestricted algorithm".

Examples: a "general purpose" macro language, like [[M4 (computer language)|M4]] is unrestricted ([[Turing complete]]), but the [[C preprocessor|C preprocessor macro language]] is not, so any algorithm expressed in ''C preprocessor'' is a "simple algorithm".

== Features of a Good Algorithm == 

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

The following are the features of a good algorithm.
1. Precision: a good algorithm must have a certain outlined steps. The steps should be exact enough, and not varying.
2. Uniqueness: each step taken in the algorithm should give a definite result as stated by the writer of the algorithm. The results should not fluctuate by any means.
3. Feasibility: the algorithm should be possible and practicable in real life. It should not be abstract or imaginary.
4. Input: a good algorithm must be able to accept a set of defined input.
5. Output: a good algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solutions.
6. Finiteness: the algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.
7. Generality: the algorithm must apply to a set of defined inputs.

== 1881 John Venn's negative reaction to W. Stanley Jevons's Logical Machine of 1870 ==
In early 1870 [[W. Stanley Jevons]] presented a "Logical Machine" (Jevons 1880:200) for analyzing a [[syllogism]] or other [[logical form]] e.g. an argument reduced to a [[Boolean equation]]. By means of what Couturat (1914) called a "sort of ''logical piano'' [,] ... the equalities which represent the premises ... are "played" on a keyboard like that of a typewriter. ... When all the premises have been "played", the panel shows only those constituents whose sum is equal to 1, that is, ... its logical whole. This mechanical method has the advantage over VENN's geometrical method..." (Couturat 1914:75).

For his part [[John Venn]], a logician contemporary to Jevons, was less than thrilled, opining that "it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known ''or likely to be discovered'' really deserve the name of logical machines" (italics added, Venn 1881:120). But of historical use to the developing notion of "algorithm" is his explanation for his negative reaction with respect to a machine that "may subserve a really valuable purpose by enabling us to avoid otherwise inevitable labor":
: (1) "There is, first, the statement of our data in accurate logical language",
: (2) "Then secondly, we have to throw these statements into a form fit for the engine to work with – in this case the reduction of each proposition to its elementary denials",
: (3) "Thirdly, there is the combination or further treatment of our premises after such reduction,"
: (4) "Finally, the results have to be interpreted or read off. This last generally gives rise to much opening for skill and sagacity."
He concludes that "I cannot see that any machine can hope to help us except in the third of these steps; so that it seems very doubtful whether any thing of this sort really deserves the name of a logical engine."(Venn 1881:119–121).

== 1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization ==
This section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that ''all'' calculations/computations—of ''every'' sort, the ''totality'' of—can ''equivalently'' be (i) ''calculated'' by use of five "[[primitive recursive]] operators" plus one special operator called the [[mu-operator]], or be (ii) ''computed'' by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.

Furthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of '''algorithm'''.

A reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. ''Calculation'' means done by hand, ''computation'' means done by Turing machine (or equivalent).  (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A "function" can be thought of as an "input-output box" into which a person puts natural numbers called "arguments" or "parameters" (but only the counting numbers including 0—the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called "the answer"). Think of the "function-box" as a little man either calculating by hand using "general recursion" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).

"Effectively calculable/computable" is more generic and means "calculable/computable by ''some'' procedure, method, technique ... whatever...".  "General recursive" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just "recursion"; however, "primitive recursion"—calculation by use of the five recursive operators—is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the "primitive recursive functions."

=== 1943 "Thesis I", 1952 "Church's Thesis" ===
In 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as [[Church's thesis]]:
: "''Thesis I''. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive" (First stated by Kleene in 1943 (reprinted page 274 in Davis, ed. ''The Undecidable''; appears also verbatim in Kleene (1952) p.300)

In a nutshell: to calculate ''any'' function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of "general" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the [[mu recursive function]]s).

Kleene's first statement of this was under the section title "'''12. Algorithmic theories'''". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:
: "Thesis I and its converse provide the exact definition of the notion of a calculation (decision) procedure or '''algorithm''', for the case of a function (predicate) of natural numbers" (p. 301, boldface added for emphasis)

(His use of the word "decision" and "predicate" extends the notion of calculability to the more general manipulation of symbols such as occurs in mathematical "proofs".)

This is not as daunting as it may sound – "general" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five "operators" of the [[primitive recursive function]]s together with the additional [[mu-operator]] as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader—e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see [[primitive recursive function|Some common primitive recursive functions]].
&lt;!--'''Some functions definable by primitive recursion''' (Kleene (1952) pp. 223ff; Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey 2002 pp. 63ff)

In the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be four types (1) numerical in nature – "number-theoretic" or just "functions" { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...}, (2) predicates { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { t, f }, (3) truth-value or propositional connectives { t, f } to { t, f }, and "representing functions" { t, f } to { 0, 1 }. A predicate requires a "representing function" to convert { t, f } to { 0, 1 }: by definition a function φ('''x''') is a "representing function" of the predicate P('''x''') if φ takes only values o and 1 and produces ''0'' when P is true".

(cf §55 General recursive functions p.&amp;nbsp;270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as μ-operator or [[mu-operator]]) because [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann]] (1925) produced a hugely growing function—the [[Ackermann function]]—and [[Rózsa Péter]] (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:
: "...in a certain sense, the length of the computation '''algorithm''' of a recursive function which is not also primitive recursive grows faster with the arguments than the value of any primitive recursive function" (Kleene (1935) reprinted p. 246 in ''The Undecidable'', plus footnote 13 with regards to the need for an additional operator, boldface added).
&lt;!-- Kleene gives a second example using Péter's demonstration that "leads to ... predicates which are not primitive recursive". Specifically:
::All primitive recursive functions of one variable are [[enumerable]]: countable, can be placed one-to-one with the integers. But by the method of [[Cantor]]'s [[diagonal method]] this means that other functions of one variable exist but cannot be generated by primitive recursion. For example, we just add the number 1 to the diagonal number, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(a)+1, and thereby we see a single-variable function exists that cannot be created by primitive recursion alone. --&gt;

But the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. [[super-exponentiation]] ).

=== 1952 "Turing's thesis" ===
[[Turing's Thesis]] hypothesizes the computability of "all computable functions" by the Turing machine model and its equivalents.

To do this in an effective manner, Kleene extended the notion of "computable" by casting the net wider—by allowing into the notion of "functions" both "total functions" and "partial functions". A ''total function'' is one that is defined ''for '''all''' natural numbers'' (positive integers including 0). A partial function is defined for ''some'' natural numbers but not all—the specification of "some" has to come "up front". Thus the inclusion of "partial function" extends the notion of function to "less-perfect" functions. Total- and partial-functions may either be calculated by hand or computed by machine.
: Examples:
:: "Functions": include "common subtraction ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''" and "addition ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''"

:: "Partial function": "Common subtraction" ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'' is undefined when only natural numbers (positive integers and zero) are allowed as input – e.g. 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7 is undefined

:: Total function: "Addition" ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' is defined for all positive integers and zero.

&lt;!-- A partial function is restricted to use only an "''n''-tuple" (a list of input "parameters") defined at the outset:
: Definition: "A partial function is a function which for each ''n''-tuple ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of natural numbers as arguments takes at most one natural number ''φ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) as value" (p.325).
::When an ''n''-tuple produces a value we say its function ''φ'' is defined for that ''n''-tuple; otherwise we say ''φ'' is undefined for that ''n''-tuple.

: Definition: "A partial function of positive integers is one whose domain [i.e. the list of possible "input" positive integers] is something less than the whole set P [of positive integers]" (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) p. 7) --&gt;

We now observe Kleene's definition of "computable" in a formal sense:
: Definition: "A partial function φ is ''computable'', if there is a machine M which computes it" (Kleene (1952) p. 360)

: "Definition 2.5. An ''n''-ary function ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is '''partially computable''' if there exists a Turing machine Z such that
:: ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
: In this case we say that [machine] Z computes ''f''. If, in addition, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a total function, then it is called '''computable'''" (Davis (1958) p. 10)

Thus we have arrived at ''Turing's Thesis'':
: "Every function which would naturally be regarded as computable is computable ... by one of his machines..." (Kleene (1952) p.376)

Although Kleene did not give examples of "computable functions" others have. For example, Davis (1958) gives Turing tables for the Constant, Successor and Identity functions, three of the five operators of the [[primitive recursive functions]]:
: Computable by Turing machine:
:: Addition (also is the Constant function if one operand is 0)
:: Increment (Successor function)
:: Common subtraction (defined only if ''x'' ≥ ''y''). Thus "''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''" is an example of a partially computable function.
:: Proper subtraction ''x''┴''y'' (as defined above)
:: The identity function: for each ''i'', a function U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; =  Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) exists that plucks ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; out of the set of arguments (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
:: Multiplication

Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) give the following as prose descriptions of Turing machines for:
:: Doubling: 2''p''
:: Parity
:: Addition
:: Multiplication

With regards to the [[counter machine]], an [[abstract machine]] model equivalent to the Turing machine:
: Examples Computable by Abacus machine (cf Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002))
:: Addition
:: Multiplication
:: Exponention: (a flow-chart/block diagram description of the algorithm)

Demonstrations of computability by abacus machine (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002)) and by counter machine (Minsky 1967):
: The six recursive function operators:
::# Zero function
::# Successor function
::# Identity function
::# Composition function
::# Primitive recursion (induction)
::# Minimization

The fact that the abacus/[[counter machine models]] can simulate the recursive functions provides the proof that: If a function is "machine computable" then it is "hand-calculable by partial recursion". Kleene's Theorem XXIX :
: "''Theorem XXIX: "Every computable partial function φ is partial recursive...''" (italics in original, p. 374).

The converse appears as his Theorem XXVIII. Together these form the proof of their equivalence, Kleene's Theorem XXX.

=== 1952 Church–Turing Thesis ===
With his Theorem XXX Kleene '''proves''' the ''equivalence'' of the two "Theses"—the Church Thesis and the Turing Thesis. (Kleene can only hypothesize (conjecture) the truth of both thesis – ''these he has not proven''):
: ''THEOREM XXX: The following classes of partial functions ... have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions ..."''(p. 376)

:: Definition of "partial recursive function": "A partial function φ is partial recursive in [the partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; if there is a system of equations E which defines φ recursively from [partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;" (p. 326)

Thus by Kleene's Theorem XXX: either method of making numbers from input-numbers—recursive functions calculated by hand or computated by Turing-machine or equivalent—results in an "''effectively calculable/computable'' function". If we accept the hypothesis that ''every'' calculation/computation can be done by either method equivalently we have accepted both Kleene's Theorem XXX (the equivalence) and the [[Church–Turing Thesis]] (the hypothesis of "every").

=== A note of dissent: "There's more to algorithm..." Blass and Gurevich (2003) ===
The notion of separating out Church's and Turing's theses from the "Church–Turing thesis" appears not only in Kleene (1952) but in Blass-Gurevich (2003) as well. But while there are agreements, there are disagreements too:
: "...we disagree with Kleene that the notion of '''algorithm''' is that well understood. In fact the notion of algorithm is richer these days than it was in Turing's days. And there are algorithms, of modern and classical varieties, not covered directly by Turing's analysis, for example, algorithms that interact with their environments, algorithms whose inputs are abstract structures, and geometric or, more generally, non-discrete algorithms" (Blass-Gurevich (2003) p. 8, boldface added)

== 1954 A. A. Markov's characterization ==

[[A. A. Markov]] (1954) provided the following definition of algorithm:

: "1. In mathematics, "algorithm" is commonly understood to be an exact prescription, defining a computational process, leading from various initial data to the desired result...."

: "The following three features are characteristic of algorithms and determine their role in mathematics:
:: "a) the precision of the prescription, leaving no place to arbitrariness, and its universal comprehensibility -- the definiteness of the algorithm;
:: "b) the possibility of starting out with initial data, which may vary within given limits -- the generality of the algorithm;
:: "c) the orientation of the algorithm toward obtaining some desired result, which is indeed obtained in the end with proper initial data -- the conclusiveness of the algorithm." (p.1)

He admitted that this definition "does not pretend to mathematical precision" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). His 1954 monograph was his attempt to define algorithm more accurately; he saw his resulting definition—his "normal" algorithm—as "equivalent to the concept of a [[recursion|recursive function]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). His definition included four major components (Chapter II.3 pp.&amp;nbsp;63ff):

: "1. Separate  elementary steps, each of which will be performed according to one of [the substitution] rules... [rules given at the outset]

: "2. ... steps of local nature ... [Thus the algorithm won't change more than a certain number of symbols to the left or right of the observed word/symbol]

: "3. Rules for the substitution formulas ... [he called the list of these "the scheme" of the algorithm]

: "4. ...a means to distinguish a "concluding substitution" [i.e. a distinguishable "terminal/final" state or states]

In his Introduction Markov observed that "the entire significance for mathematics" of efforts to define algorithm more precisely would be "in connection with the problem of a constructive foundation for mathematics" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] (cf Encyclopædia Britannica) shares a similar belief: "...constructive analysis is very much in the same algorithmic spirit as computer science...". For more see [[constructive mathematics]] and [[Intuitionism]].

'''Distinguishability and Locality''': Both notions first appeared with Turing (1936–1937) --
: "The new observed squares must be immediately recognizable by the computer [''sic'': a computer was a person in 1936]. I think it reasonable to suppose that they can only be squares whose distance from the closest of the immediately observed squares does not exceed a certain fixed amount. Let us stay that each of the new observed squares is within L squares of one of the previously observed squares." (Turing (1936) p. 136 in Davis ed. ''Undecidable'')

Locality appears prominently in the work of Gurevich and Gandy (1980) (whom Gurevich cites). Gandy's "Fourth Principle for Mechanisms" is "The Principle of Local Causality":
: "We now come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depend only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitiation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance." (Gandy (1980) p. 135 in J. Barwise et al.)

== 1936, 1963, 1964 Gödel's characterization ==
'''1936''': A rather famous quote from [[Kurt Gödel]] appears in a "Remark added in proof [of the original German publication] in his paper "On the Length of Proofs" translated by [[Martin Davis]] appearing on pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83 of ''The Undecidable''. A number of authors—Kleene, Gurevich, Gandy etc. -- have quoted the following:
: "Thus, the concept of "computable" is in a certain definite sense "absolute," while practically all other familiar metamathematical concepts (e.g. provable, definable, etc.) depend quite essentially on the system with respect to which they are defined." (p. 83)

'''1963''': In a "Note" dated 28 August 1963 added to his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions'' (1931) Gödel states (in a footnote) his belief that "[[formal system]]s" have "the characteristic property that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices" (p.&amp;nbsp;616 in van Heijenoort). ". . . due to "A. M. Turing's work a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system can now be given [and] a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible." (p.&amp;nbsp;616). In a 1964 note to another work he expresses the same opinion more strongly and in more detail.

'''1964''': In a Postscriptum, dated 1964, to a paper presented to the Institute for Advanced Study in spring 1934, Gödel amplified his conviction that "formal systems" are those that can be mechanized:
: "In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given . . . Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of "mechanical procedure" (alias "algorithm" or "computational procedure" or "finite combinatorial procedure"). This concept is shown to be equivalent with that of a "Turing machine".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas . . . ." (p. 72 in [[Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable'': "Postscriptum" to "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems" appearing on p. 39, loc. cit.)

The * indicates a footnote in which Gödel cites the papers by [[Alan Turing]] (1937) and [[Emil Post]] (1936) and then goes on to make the following intriguing statement:
: "As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see [[Alonzo Church]], Am. J. Math., vol. 58 (1936) [appearing in ''The Undecidable'' pp. 100-102]).

Church's definitions encompass so-called "[[recursion]]" and the "[[lambda calculus]]" (i.e. the λ-definable functions). His footnote 18 says that he discussed the relationship of "effective calculatibility" and "recursiveness" with Gödel but that he independently questioned "effectively calculability" and "λ-definability":
: "We now define the notion . . . of an effectively calculable function of positive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive function of positive integers&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (or of a λ-definable function of positive integers.
: "It has already been pointed out that, for every function of positive integers which is effectively calculable in the sense just defined, there exists an algorithm for the calculation of its value.
: "Conversely it is true . . ." (p. 100, The Undecidable).

It would appear from this, and the following, that far as Gödel was concerned, the Turing machine was sufficient and the lambda calculus was "much less suitable." He goes on to make the point that, with regards to limitations on human reason, the jury is still out:
: ("Note that the question of whether there exist finite non-mechanical procedures** not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of "formal system" and of "mechanical procedure.") (p. 72, loc. cit.)

: "(For theories and procedures in the more general sense indicated in footnote ** the situation may be different. Note that the results mentioned in the postscript do not establish any bounds for the powers of human reason, but rather for the potentialities of pure formalism in mathematics.) (p. 73 loc. cit.)

: Footnote **: "I.e., such as involve the use of abstract terms on the basis of their meaning. See my paper in Dial. 12(1958), p. 280." (this footnote appears on p. 72, loc. cit).

== 1967 Minsky's characterization ==
Minsky (1967) baldly asserts that "an algorithm is "an effective procedure" and declines to use the word "algorithm" further in his text; in fact his index makes it clear what he feels about "Algorithm, ''synonym'' for Effective procedure"(p.&amp;nbsp;311):
:: "We will use the latter term [an ''effective procedure''] in the sequel. The terms are roughly synonymous, but there are a number of shades of meaning used in different contexts, especially for 'algorithm'" (italics in original, p. 105)

Other writers (see Knuth below) use the word "effective procedure". This leads one to wonder: What is Minsky's notion of "an effective procedure"? He starts off with:
: "...a set of rules which tell us, from moment to moment, precisely how to behave" (p. 106)

But he recognizes that this is subject to a criticism:
: "... the criticism that the interpretation of the rules is left to depend on some person or agent" (p. 106)

His refinement? To "specify, along with the statement of the rules, ''the details of the mechanism that is to interpret them''". To avoid the "cumbersome" process of "having to do this over again for each individual procedure" he hopes to identify a "reasonably ''uniform'' family of rule-obeying mechanisms". His "formulation":
:: "(1) a ''language'' in which sets of behavioral rules are to be expressed, and

:: "(2) a ''single'' machine which can interpret statements in the language and thus carry out the steps of each specified process." (italics in original, all quotes this para. p. 107)

In the end, though, he still worries that "there remains a subjective aspect to the matter. Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective" (p.&amp;nbsp;107)

But Minsky is undeterred. He immediately introduces "Turing's Analysis of Computation Process" (his chapter 5.2). He quotes what he calls "Turing's ''thesis''"
: "Any process which could naturally be called an effective procedure can be realized by a Turing machine" (p. 108. (Minsky comments that in a more general form this is called "''Church's thesis''").

After an analysis of "Turing's Argument" (his chapter 5.3)
he observes that "equivalence of many intuitive formulations" of Turing, Church, Kleene, Post, and Smullyan "...leads us to suppose that there is really here an 'objective' or 'absolute' notion. As Rogers [1959] put it:
:: "In this sense, the notion of effectively computable function is one of the few 'absolute' concepts produced by modern work in the foundations of mathematics'" (Minsky p. 111 quoting Rogers, Hartley Jr (1959) ''The present theory of Turing machine computability'', J. SIAM 7, 114-130.)

== 1967 Rogers' characterization ==
In his 1967 ''Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability'' Hartley Rogers' characterizes "algorithm" roughly as "a clerical (i.e., deterministic, bookkeeping) procedure . . . applied to . . . symbolic ''inputs'' and which will eventually yield, for each such input, a corresponding symbolic ''output''"(p.&amp;nbsp;1). He then goes on to describe the notion "in approximate and intuitive terms" as having 10 "features", 5 of which he asserts that "virtually all mathematicians would agree [to]" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). The remaining 5 he asserts "are less obvious than *1 to *5 and about which we might find less general agreement" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

The 5 "obvious" are:
* 1 An algorithm is a set of instructions of finite size,
* 2 There is a capable computing agent,
* 3 "There are facilities for making, storing, and retrieving steps in a computation"
* 4 Given #1 and #2 the agent computes in "discrete stepwise fashion" without use of continuous methods or analogue devices",
* 5 The computing agent carries the computation forward "without resort to random methods or devices, e.g. , dice" (in a footnote Rogers wonders if #4 and #5 are really the same)

The remaining 5 that he opens to debate, are:
* 6 No fixed bound on the size of the inputs,
* 7 No fixed bound on the size of the set of instructions,
* 8 No fixed bound on the amount of memory storage available,
* 9 A fixed finite bound on the capacity or ability of the computing agent (Rogers illustrates with example simple mechanisms similar to a [[Post–Turing machine]] or a [[counter machine]]),
* 10 A bound on the length of the computation -- "should we have some idea, 'ahead of time', how long the computationwill take?" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Rogers requires "only that a computation terminate after ''some'' finite number of steps; we do not insist on an a priori ability to estimate this number." (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

== 1968, 1973 Knuth's characterization ==
[[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1968, 1973) has given a list of five properties that are widely accepted as requirements for an algorithm:

# '''Finiteness''': "An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps ... a ''very'' finite number, a reasonable number"
# '''Definiteness''': "Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case"
# '''Input''': "...quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins. These inputs are taken from specified sets of objects"
# '''Output''': "...quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs"
# '''Effectiveness''': "... all of the operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using paper and pencil"

Knuth offers as an example the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for determining the [[greatest common divisor]] of two [[natural number]]s (cf. Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;2).

Knuth admits that, while his description of an algorithm may be intuitively clear, it lacks formal rigor, since it is not exactly clear what "precisely defined" means, or "rigorously and unambiguously specified" means, or "sufficiently basic", and so forth. He makes an effort in this direction in his first volume where he defines ''in detail'' what he calls the "[[machine language]]" for his "mythical [[MIX]]...the world's first polyunsaturated computer" (pp.&amp;nbsp;120ff). Many of the algorithms in his books are written in the MIX language. He also uses [[Decision tree|tree diagrams]], [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]]s and [[state diagram]]s.

'''"Goodness" of an algorithm, "best" algorithms''': Knuth states that "In practice, we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms...." He suggests that some criteria of an algorithm's goodness are the number of steps to perform the algorithm, its "adaptability to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc." Given a number of algorithms to perform the same computation, which one is "best"? He calls this sort of inquiry "algorithmic analysis: given an algorithm, to determine its performance characteristcis" (all quotes this paragraph: Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;7)

== 1972 Stone's characterization ==
Stone (1972) and Knuth (1968, 1973) were professors at Stanford University at the same time so it is not surprising if there are similarities in their definitions (boldface added for emphasis):

: "To summarize ... we define an algorithm to be a '''set of rules''' that precisely defines '''a sequence of operations''' such that each rule is '''effective''' and '''definite''' and such that the '''sequence terminates''' in a finite time." (boldface added, p. 8)

Stone is noteworthy because of  his detailed discussion of what constitutes an “effective” rule – his '''robot''', or person-acting-as-robot, must have some '''information and abilities within''' them, and if not '''the information and the ability must be provided''' in "the algorithm":

: "For people to follow the rules of an algorithm, the '''rules''' must be formulated so that they can be '''followed in a robot-like manner''', that is, without the need for thought... however, if the instructions [to solve the quadratic equation, his example] are to be obeyed by someone who knows how to perform arithmetic operations but does not know how to extract a square root, then we must also provide a set of rules for extracting a square root in order to satisfy the definition of algorithm" (p. 4-5)

Furthermore, "...'''not all instructions are acceptable''', because they may require the robot to have '''abilities beyond those that we consider reasonable'''.” He gives the example of a robot confronted with the question is “Henry VIII a King of England?” and to print 1 if yes and 0 if no, but the robot has not been previously provided with this information. And worse, if the robot is asked if Aristotle was a King of England and the robot only had been provided with five names, it would not know how to answer. Thus:
: “an intuitive definition of an acceptable sequence of instructions is one in which '''each instruction is precisely defined''' so that the '''robot is guaranteed to be able to obey it'''” (p. 6)

After providing us with his definition, Stone introduces the [[Turing machine]] model and states that the set of five-tuples that are the machine’s instructions are “an algorithm ... known as a Turing machine program” (p.&amp;nbsp;9). Immediately thereafter he goes on say that a “''computation'' of a Turing machine is ''described'' by stating:
: "1. The tape alphabet
: "2. The '''form''' in which the '''[input] parameters''' are presented on the tape
: "3. The initial state of the Turing machine
: "4. The '''form''' in which '''answers [output]''' will be represented on the tape when the Turing machine halts
: "5. The machine program" (italics added, p. 10)

This precise prescription of what is required for "a computation" is in the spirit of what will follow in the work of Blass and Gurevich.

== 1995 Soare's characterization ==

: "A ''computation'' is a process whereby we proceed from initially given objects, called ''inputs'', according to a fixed set of rules, called a ''program, procedure,'' or '''''algorithm''''', through a series of ''steps'' and arrive at the end of these steps with a final result, called the ''output''. The '''algorithm''', as a set of rules proceeding from inputs to output, must be precise and definite with each successive step clearly determined. The concept of ''computability'' concerns those objects which may be specified in principle by computations . . ."(italics in original, boldface added p. 3)

== 2000 Berlinski's characterization ==

While a student at Princeton in the mid-1960s, David Berlinski was a student of Alonzo Church (cf p.&amp;nbsp;160). His year-2000 book ''The Advent of the Algorithm: The 300-year Journey from an Idea to the Computer'' contains the following definition of '''algorithm''':

: "'''''In the logician's voice:
::: "''an algorithm is
::: ''a finite procedure,
::: ''written in a fixed symbolic vocabulary,
::: ''governed by precise instructions,
::: ''moving in discrete steps, 1, 2, 3, . . .,
::: ''whose execution requires no insight, cleverness,
::: ''intuition, intelligence, or perspicuity,
::: ''and that sooner or later comes to an end.'''" (boldface and italics in the original, p. xviii)

== 2000, 2002 Gurevich's characterization ==
A careful reading of Gurevich 2000 leads one to conclude (infer?) that he believes that "an algorithm" is actually "a Turing machine" or "a [[pointer machine]]" doing a computation. An "algorithm" is not just the symbol-table that guides the behavior of the machine, nor is it just one instance of a machine doing a computation given a particular set of input parameters, nor is it a suitably programmed machine with the power off; rather ''an algorithm is the machine actually doing any computation of which it is capable''. Gurevich does not come right out and say this, so as worded above this conclusion (inference?) is certainly open to debate:

: " . . . every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine . . . a program can be simulated and therefore given a precise meaning by a Turing machine." (p. 1)
&lt;!--:"Can one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine very closely and faithfully?" (italics in original, p. 2)--&gt;

: " It is often thought that the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm was solved by Church [1936] and Turing [1936]. For example, according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational ''process'' defined by a Turing machine. Church and Turing did not solve the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm. Instead they gave (different but equivalent) formalizations of the notion of computable function, and there is more to an algorithm than the function it computes. (italics added p. 3)

: "Of course, the notions of algorithm and computable function are intimately related: by definition, a computable function is a function computable by an algorithm. . . . (p. 4)

&lt;!--:"While Turing analyzed a human computer, Kolmogorov and Uspensky [1958] arrived at their machine model (KU machines) [cf [[Pointer machine]] ] by analyzing cmoputations from the point of view of physics. . . . I attempted to [formulate a thesis for them]: "every computation performing only one restricted local action at a time, can be viewed as (not only being simulated by, but actually being) the computation of an appropriate KU machine" [Gureviceh 1988]. Uspensky [1992, p. 396] agreed". (p. 4; Kolmogorov had died by this time)--&gt;

In Blass and Gurevich 2002 the authors invoke a dialog between "Quisani" ("Q") and "Authors" (A), using Yiannis Moshovakis as a foil, where they come right out and flatly state:
: "'''A:''' To localize the disagreement, let's first mention two points of agreement. First, there are some things that are obviously algorithms by anyone's definition -- Turing machines , sequential-time ASMs [Abstract State Machines], and the like. . . .Second, at the other extreme are specifications that would not be regarded as algorithms under anyone's definition, since they give no indication of how to compute anything . . . The issue is how detailed the information has to be in order to count as an algorithm. . . . Moshovakis allows some things that we would call only declarative specifications, and he would probably use the word "implementation" for things that we call algorithms." (paragraphs joined for ease of readability, 2002:22)

This use of the word "implementation" cuts straight to the heart of the question. Early in the paper, Q states his reading of Moshovakis:
: "...[H]e would probably think that your practical work [Gurevich works for Microsoft] forces you to think of implementations more than of algorithms. He is quite willing to identify implementations with machines, but he says that algorithms are something more general. What it boils down to is that you say an algorithm is a machine and Moschovakis says it is not." (2002:3)

But the authors waffle here, saying "[L]et's stick to "algorithm" and "machine", and the reader is left, again, confused. We have to wait until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the following footnote comment:
: " . . . Nevertheless, if one accepts Moshovakis's point of view, then it is the "implementation" of algorithms that we have set out to characterize."(cf Footnote 9 2007:6)

== 2003 Blass and Gurevich's characterization ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Blass and Gurevich describe their work as evolved from consideration of [[Turing machines]] and [[pointer machine]]s, specifically Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines (KU machines), Schönhage Storage Modification Machines (SMM), and linking automata as defined by Knuth. The work of Gandy and Markov are also described as influential precursors.

Gurevich offers a 'strong' definition of an algorithm (boldface added):

: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: '''every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine'''....In practice, it would be ridiculous...[Nevertheless,] [c]an one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine?...But suppose such generalized Turing machines exist. What would their states be?...a '''first-order structure''' ... a particular '''small instruction set''' suffices in all cases ... '''computation as an evolution of the state''' ... could be nondeterministic... can interact with their environment ... [could be] parallel and multi-agent ... [could have] [[dynamic semantics]] ... [the two underpinings of their work are:] Turing's thesis ...[and] the notion of (first order) structure of [Tarski 1933]" (Gurevich 2000, p. 1-2)

The above phrase '''computation as an evolution of the state''' differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the "algorithm" as a Turing machine program. Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called ''the complete configuration'' (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;118) -- and includes ''both'' the current instruction (state) ''and'' the status of the tape. [cf Kleene (1952) p.&amp;nbsp;375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status].

In [[Algorithm examples]] we see the '''evolution of the state''' first-hand.

== 1995 – Daniel Dennett: evolution as an algorithmic process==
Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] analyses the importance of evolution as an algorithmic process in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. Dennett identifies three key features of an algorithm:
* '''Substrate neutrality''': an algorithm relies on its ''logical'' structure. Thus, the particular form in which an algorithm is manifested is not important (Dennett's example is long division: it works equally well on paper, on parchment, on a computer screen, or using neon lights or in skywriting). (p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Underlying mindlessness''': no matter how complicated the end-product of the algorithmic process may be, each step in the algorithm is sufficiently simple to be performed by a non-sentient, mechanical device. The algorithm does not require a "brain" to maintain or operate it. "The standard textbook analogy notes that algorithms are ''recipes'' of sorts, designed to be followed by ''novice'' cooks."(p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Guaranteed results''': If the algorithm is executed correctly, it will always produce the same results. "An algorithm is a foolproof recipe." (p.&amp;nbsp;51)

It is on the basis of this analysis that Dennett concludes that "According to Darwin, evolution is an algorithmic process". (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

However, in the previous page he has gone out on a much-further limb.{{According to whom|date=February 2013}} In the context of his chapter titled "Processes as Algorithms", he states:
: "But then . . are there any limits at all on what may be considered an algorithmic process? I guess the answer is NO; if you wanted to, you can treat any process at the abstract level as an algorithmic process. . . If what strikes you as puzzling is the uniformity of the [ocean's] sand grains or the strength of the [tempered-steel] blade, an algorithmic explanation is what will satisfy your curiosity -- and it will be the truth. . . .

: "No matter how impressive the products of an algorithm, the underlying process always consists of nothing but a set of {{sic|individualy}} mindless steps succeeding each other without the help of any intelligent supervision; they are 'automatic' by definition: the workings of an automaton." (p. 59)

It is unclear from the above whether Dennett is stating that the physical world by itself and without observers is [[intrinsic]]ally algorithmic (computational) or whether a symbol-processing observer is what is adding "meaning" to the observations.

== 2002 John Searle adds a clarifying caveat to Dennett's characterization ==
[[Daniel Dennett]] is a proponent of [[Computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]]: the idea that the logical structure of an algorithm is sufficient to explain [[mind]]. [[John Searle]], the creator of the [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, claims that "[[syntax]] [that is, logical structure] is by itself not sufficient for [[semantic]] content [that is, meaning]" {{harv|Searle|2002|p=16}}. In other words, the "meaning" of symbols is relative to the mind that is using them; an algorithm—a logical construct—by itself is insufficient for a mind.

Searle cautions those who claim that algorithmic (computational) processes are [[intrinsic]] to nature (for example, cosmologists, physicists, chemists, etc.):
{{quote
| text=Computation [...] is observer-relative, and this is because computation is defined in terms of symbol manipulation, but the notion of a 'symbol' is not a notion of physics or chemistry. Something is a symbol only if it is used, treated or regarded as a symbol. The Chinese room argument showed that semantics is not intrinsic to syntax. But what this shows is that syntax is not intrinsic to physics. [...] Something is a symbol only relative to some observer, user or agent who assigns a symbolic interpretation to it [...] you can assign a computational interpretation to anything. But if the question asks, "Is consciousness intrinsically computational?" the answer is: ''nothing is intrinsically computational'' [italics added for emphasis]. Computation exists only relative to some agent or observer who imposes a computational interpretation on some phenomenon. This is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years ago but I did not.

== 2002: Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey specification of Turing machine calculation ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

An example in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32) demonstrates the precision required in a complete specification of an algorithm, in this case to add two numbers: m+n. It is similar to the Stone requirements above.

(i) They have discussed the role of "number format" in the computation and selected the "tally notation" to represent numbers:
:: "Certainly computation can be harder in practice with some notations than others... But... it is possible in principle to do in any other notation, simply by translating the data... For purposes of framing a rigorously defined notion of computability, it is convenient to use monadic or tally notation" (p. 25-26)

(ii) At the outset of their example they specify the machine to be used in the computation as a [[Turing machine]]. They have previously specified (p.&amp;nbsp;26) that the Turing-machine will be of the 4-tuple, rather than 5-tuple, variety. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]].

(iii) Previously the authors have specified that the tape-head's position will be indicated by a subscript to the ''right'' of the scanned symbol. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]]. (In the following, boldface is added for emphasis):

: "We have not given an official definition of what it is for a numerical function to be computable by a '''Turing machine''', specifying how '''inputs''' or arguments are to be represented on the machine, and how '''outputs''' or values represented. Our specifications for a k-place function from positive integers to positive integers are as follows:
: "(a) ['''Initial number format:'''] The arguments m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,  ... will be represented in monadic [unary] notation by blocks of those numbers of strokes, each block separated from the next by a single blank, on an otherwise blank tape.
:: Example: 3+2, 111B11
: "(b) ['''Initial head location, initial state:'''] Initially, the machine will be scanning the leftmost 1 on the tape, and will be in its initial state, state 1.
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;111B11
: "(c) ['''Successful computation -- number format at Halt:'''] If the function to be computed assigns a value n to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine will eventually halt on a tape containing a block of strokes, and otherwise blank...
:: Example: 3+2, 11111
: "(d) ['''Successful computation -- head location at Halt:'''] In this case [c] the machine will halt scanning the left-most 1 on the tape...
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;1111
: "(e) ['''Unsuccessful computation -- failure to Halt or Halt with non-standard number format:'''] If the function that is to be computed assigns no value to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine either will never halt, or will halt in some nonstandard configuration..."(ibid)
:: Example: B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;11111 or B11&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;111 or B11111&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

This specification is incomplete: it requires the location of where the instructions are to be placed and their format in the machine--
: (iv) in the finite state machine's TABLE or, in the case of a [[Universal Turing machine]] on the tape, and
: (v) the Table of instructions in a specified format

This later point is important. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey give a demonstration (p.&amp;nbsp;36) that the predictability of the entries in the table allow one to "shrink" the table by putting the entries in sequence and omitting the input state and the symbol. Indeed, the example Turing machine computation required only the 4 columns as shown in the table below (but note: these were presented to the machine in ''rows''):

== 2006: Sipser's assertion and his three levels of description ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

Sipser begins by defining '"algorithm" as follows:
: "Informally speaking, an ''algorithm'' is a collection of simple instructions for carrying out some task. Commonplace in everyday life, algorithms sometimes are called ''procedures'' or ''recipes'' (italics in original, p. 154)

: "...our real focus from now on is on algorithms. That is, the Turing machine merely serves as a precise model for the definition of algorithm .... we need only to be comfortable enough with Turing machines to believe that they capture all algorithms" ( p. 156)

Does Sipser mean that "algorithm" is just "instructions" for a Turing machine, or is the combination of "instructions + a (specific variety of) Turing machine"? For example, he defines the two standard variants (multi-tape and non-deterministic) of his particular variant (not the same as Turing's original) and goes on, in his Problems (pages 160-161), to describes four more variants (write-once, doubly infinite tape (i.e. left- and right-infinite), left reset, and "stay put instead of left). In addition, he imposes some constraints. First, the input must be encoded as a string (p. 157) and says of numeric encodings in the context of complexity theory:
: "But note that unary notation for encoding numbers (as in the number 17 encoded by the uary string 11111111111111111) isn't reasonable because it is exponentially larger than truly reasonable encodings, such as base ''k'' notation for any ''k'' ≥ 2."(p. 259)

van Emde Boas comments on a similar problem with respect to the [[random access machine]] (RAM) abstract model of computation sometimes used in place of the Turing machine when doing "analysis of algorithms":
"The absence or presence of multiplicative and parallel bit manipulation operations is of relevance for the correct understanding of some results in the analysis of algorithms.

". . . [T]here hardly exists such as a thing as an "innocent" extension of the standard RAM model in the uniform time measures; either one only has additive arithmetic or one might as well include all reasonable multiplicative and/or bitwise Boolean instructions on small operands." (van Emde Boas, 1990:26)

With regards to a "description language" for algorithms Sipser finishes the job that Stone and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey started (boldface added). He offers us three levels of description of Turing machine algorithms (p.&amp;nbsp;157):
: '''High-level description''': "wherein we use ... prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."

: '''Implementation description''': "in which we use ... prose to describe the way that the Turing machine moves its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function."

: '''Formal description''': "... the lowest, most detailed, level of description... that spells out in full the Turing machine's states, transition function, and so on."

Given a morphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, any [[vector bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; on ''Y'', or more generally any sheaf in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_Y&lt;/math&gt; modules, ''e.g.'' a [[coherent sheaf]], can be [[pullback|pulled back]] to ''X'', (see [[Inverse image functor]]). This construction preserves the condition of being a [[line bundle]], and more generally the rank.

The notions described in this article are related to this construction in the case of morphisms to projective spaces 
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to \mathbb P^N,  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F = \mathcal O(1) \in \mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb P^N)&lt;/math&gt;,
the line bundle corresponding to the [[hyperplane divisor]], whose [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s are the 1-homogeneous regular functions. See [[Algebraic geometry of projective spaces#Divisors and twisting sheaves]].

=== Sheaves generated by their global sections ===

Let ''X'' be a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] or a [[complex manifold]] and ''F'' a sheaf on ''X''. One says that ''F'' is '''generated by (finitely many) global sections''' &lt;math&gt; a_i \in F(X)&lt;/math&gt;, if every [[stalks of a sheaf|stalk]] of ''F'' is generated as a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over the stalk of the [[structure sheaf]] by the [[germ (mathematics)|germ]]s of the ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. For example, if ''F'' happens to be a line bundle, i.e. locally free of rank 1, this amounts to having finitely many [[global section]]s, such that for any point ''x'' in ''X'', there is at least one section not vanishing at this point. In this case a choice of such global generators ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; gives a morphism
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{n},\ x \mapsto [a_0(x): \dotsb : a_n(x)],&lt;/math&gt;
such that the pullback ''f''*(''O''(1)) is ''F'' (Note that this evaluation makes sense when ''F'' is a subsheaf of the [[constant sheaf]] of [[rational function]]s on ''X''). The converse statement is also true: given such a morphism ''f'', the pullback of ''O''(1) is generated by its global sections (on ''X'').

More generally, a '''sheaf generated by global sections''' is a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] ''F'' on a [[locally ringed space]] ''X'', with structure sheaf ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; that is of a rather simple type. Assume ''F'' is a sheaf of [[abelian group]]s. Then it is asserted that if ''A'' is the abelian group of [[global section]]s, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;A = \Gamma(F,X)&lt;/math&gt;

then for any [[open set]] ''U'' of ''X'', ρ(''A'') spans ''F''(''U'') as an ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;-module. Here

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho_{X,U}&lt;/math&gt;

is the restriction map. In words, all sections of ''F'' are locally generated by the global sections.

An example of such a sheaf is that associated in [[algebraic geometry]] to an ''R''-module ''M'', ''R'' being any [[commutative ring]], on the [[spectrum of a ring]] ''Spec''(''R'').
Another example: according to [[Cartan's theorem A]], any [[coherent sheaf]] on a [[Stein manifold]] is spanned by global sections.

=== Very ample line bundles ===
Given a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'' over a base scheme ''S'' or a complex manifold, a line bundle (or in other words an [[invertible sheaf]], that is, a locally free sheaf of rank one) ''L'' on ''X'' is said to be '''very ample''', if there is an embedding ''i : X → '''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''n''-dimensional projective space over ''S'' for some ''n'', such that the [[inverse image functor|pullback]] of the [[Serre twist sheaf|standard twisting sheaf]] ''O''(1) on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''L'':
:&lt;math&gt; i^{*}(\mathcal{O}(1)) \cong L.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence this notion is a special case of the previous one, namely a line bundle is very ample if it is globally generated and the morphism given by some global generators is an embedding.

Given a very ample sheaf ''L'' on ''X'' and a [[coherent sheaf]] ''F'', a theorem of [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] shows that (the coherent sheaf) ''F ⊗ L&lt;sup&gt;⊗n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is generated by finitely many global sections for sufficiently large ''n''. This in turn implies that global sections and higher (Zariski) [[Sheaf cohomology|cohomology]] groups 
&lt;math&gt;H^i(X, F)&lt;/math&gt;
are finitely generated. This is a distinctive feature of the projective situation. For example, for the affine ''n''-space ''A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' over a field ''k'', global sections of the [[structure sheaf]] ''O'' are polynomials in ''n'' variables, thus not a finitely generated ''k''-vector space, whereas for '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, global sections are just constant functions, a one-dimensional ''k''-vector space.

== Definitions ==
The notion of '''ample line bundles''' ''L'' is slightly weaker than very ample line bundles: a line bundle ''L'' is ample if for any coherent sheaf ''F'' on ''X'', there exists an integer ''n(F)'', such that ''F'' ⊗ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is generated by its global sections for ''n &gt; n(F)''.

An equivalent, maybe more intuitive, definition of the ampleness of the line bundle &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; is its having a positive tensorial power that is very ample. In other words, for &lt;math&gt;n \gg 0 &lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[projective embedding]] &lt;math&gt;j: X \to \mathbb P^N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L^{\otimes n} = j^* (\mathcal O(1))&lt;/math&gt;, that is the zero divisors of global sections of  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L^{\otimes n}&lt;/math&gt;
are hyperplane sections.

This definition makes sense for the underlying ''divisors'' ([[Cartier divisor]]s) &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;; an ample &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is one where &lt;math&gt;nD&lt;/math&gt; ''moves in a large enough [[linear system of divisors|linear system]]''. Such divisors form a [[cone (topology)|cone]] in all divisors of those that are, in some sense, ''positive enough''. The relationship with projective space is that the &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; for a very ample &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[hyperplane section]]s (intersection with some [[hyperplane]]) of the embedded &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The equivalence between the two definitions is credited to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in [[Faisceaux algébriques cohérents]].

Amplitude is an open condition under small perturbations of a divisor. If ''H'' is an ample ''Q''-divisor on ''X'', and ''E'' an arbitrary ''Q-divisor.'' Then &lt;math&gt;H+\epsilon E&lt;/math&gt; is ample for all sufficiently small rational numbers &lt;math&gt;0\leq |\epsilon|\ll 1&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples/Non-examples ==
* The line bundle &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2)&lt;/math&gt; defines an embedding into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^2&lt;/math&gt; by the map &lt;math&gt;[s:t] \mapsto [s^2:st:t^2]&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2)) = \mathbb{k}\cdot s^2 \oplus \mathbb{k}\cdot st \oplus \mathbb{k} \cdot t^2&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the closed subscheme of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\text{Proj}(\mathbb{k}[x,y,z]/(xz - y^2))&lt;/math&gt;.
* Restricting an ample line bundle to a closed subscheme is still an ample line bundle since the global sections induce an embedding into projective space. For instance, given a plane curve &lt;math&gt;C \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(2)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; gives a smooth curve in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^5&lt;/math&gt;which is not a complete intersection curve.
* The line bundle &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_{x,y}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1_{s,t}}(0,2)&lt;/math&gt; is not ample.

==Criteria for ampleness of line bundles==

===Intersection theory===
{{see|intersection theory#Intersection theory in algebraic geometry}}

To decide in practice when a [[Cartier divisor]] ''D'' corresponds to an ample line bundle, there are some geometric criteria.

For curves, a divisor ''D'' is very ample if and only if
''l''(''D'') = 2 + ''l''(''D'' &amp;minus; ''A'' &amp;minus; ''B'') whenever ''A'' and ''B'' are points. By the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] every divisor of degree
at least 2''g''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 satisfies this condition so is very ample. This implies that a divisor is ample if and only if it has positive degree. The [[canonical divisor]] of degree 2''g''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 is very ample if and only if the curve is not
a [[hyperelliptic curve]].

The '''Nakai–Moishezon criterion''' ({{harvnb|Nakai|1963}}, {{harvnb|Moishezon|1964}}) states that a Cartier divisor ''D'' on a proper scheme ''X'' over an [[algebraically closed field]] is ample if and only if ''D''&lt;sup&gt;dim(''Y'')&lt;/sup&gt;.''Y'' &gt; 0 for every closed integral [[subscheme]] ''Y'' of ''X''. In the special case of curves this says that a divisor is ample if and only if it has positive degree, and for a smooth projective [[algebraic surface]] ''S'', the Nakai–Moishezon criterion states that ''D'' is ample if and only if its [[self-intersection number]] ''D''.''D'' is strictly positive, and for any [[Irreducible component|irreducible]] curve ''C'' on ''S'' we have ''D''.''C'' &gt; 0.

For an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-divisor ''D'' Nakai criterion is slightly more subtle. In fact, if ''D'' is an ample &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; divisor, then certainly we have Nakai inequality, but it is no longer clear that Nakai inequality characterize amplitude. In the case when ''X'' is projective, then Nakai inequality characterize amplitude. 


The '''Kleiman condition''' states that for any [[projective variety|projective]] scheme ''X'', a divisor ''D'' on ''X'' is ample if and only if ''D''.''C'' &gt; 0 for any nonzero element ''C'' in the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of NE(''X''), the [[cone of curves]] of ''X''. In other words, a divisor is ample if and only if it is in the interior of the real cone generated by [[nef divisor]]s.

{{harvtxt|Nagata|1959}} constructed divisors on surfaces that have positive intersection with every curve, but are not ample.
This shows that the condition ''D''.''D''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 cannot be omitted in the Nakai–Moishezon criterion, and it is necessary to use the closure of NE(''X'') rather than NE(''X'') in the Kleiman condition.

{{harvtxt|Seshadri|1972|loc=Remark 7.1, p. 549}} showed that a line bundle ''L'' on a complete algebraic scheme is ample if and only if there is some positive ε such that 
deg(''L''|&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ ε''m''(''C'') for all integral curves ''C'' in ''X'', where ''m''(''C'') is the
maximum of the multiplicities at the points of ''C''.

===Sheaf cohomology===

The theorem of [[Henri Cartan|Cartan]]-[[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]-[[Grothendieck]] states that for a line bundle &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; on a variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the following conditions are equivalent:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; is ample
* for ''m'' big enough, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L^{\otimes m}&lt;/math&gt; is very ample
* for any coherent sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'', the sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F \otimes \mathcal L^{\otimes m}&lt;/math&gt; is generated by global sections, for ''m'' big enough

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is proper over some noetherian ring, this is also equivalent to:
* for any coherent sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'', the [[sheaf cohomology|higher cohomology groups]] &lt;math&gt;H^i(X, \mathcal F \otimes \mathcal L^{\otimes m}), \ i \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; vanish for ''m'' big enough. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Kleiman's characterizations of amplitude===

Let ''D'' be a Cartier divisor on a projective algebraic scheme ''X''. Then ''D'' is ample if and only if it satisfies either of the following properties:

(I). For every irreducible subvariety &lt;math&gt;V\sub X&lt;/math&gt; of positive dimension, there is a positive integer ''m'', together with a non-zero section &lt;math&gt;0\neq s=s_V\in H^0(V,\mathcal O_V(mD))&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''s'' vanishes at some point of ''V''.

(II) For every irreducible subvariety &lt;math&gt;V\sub X&lt;/math&gt; of positive dimension,

&lt;math&gt;\chi(V,\mathcal O_V(mD))\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; m\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

=== Vector bundles of higher rank ===
A [[locally free sheaf]] ([[vector bundle]]) &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on a variety is called '''ample''' if the [[invertible sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(1)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(F)&lt;/math&gt; is ample {{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1966}}.

Ample vector bundles inherit many of the properties of ample line bundles.

===Big line bundles===
{{main| Iitaka dimension}}
An important generalization, notably in [[birational geometry]], is that of a '''big line bundle'''. A line bundle &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'' is said to be big if the equivalent following conditions are satisfied:
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; is the tensor product of an ample line bundle and an effective line bundle
*the [[Hilbert polynomial]] of the finitely generated [[graded ring]] &lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty \Gamma (X, \mathcal L ^{\otimes k})&lt;/math&gt; has degree the dimension of ''X''
*the rational mapping of the [[linear system of divisors|total system of divisors]] &lt;math&gt;X \to \mathbb P \Gamma (X, \mathcal L^{\otimes k})&lt;/math&gt; is [[birational]] on its image for &lt;math&gt;k \gg 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The interest of this notion is its stability with respect to rational transformations.

In [[graph theory]], the '''bipartite half''' or '''half-square''' of a [[bipartite graph]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''U'',''V'',''E'') is a graph whose vertex set is one of the two sides of the bipartition ([[without loss of generality]], ''U'') and in which there is an edge ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for each two vertices ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''U'' that are at distance two from each other in ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Topics in Algebraic Graph Theory|volume=102|series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications|first=Robin J.|last=Wilson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521801973|page=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=z2K26gZLC1MC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, in a more compact notation, the bipartite half is ''G''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[''U''] where the superscript 2 denotes the [[Graph power|square of a graph]] and the square brackets denote an [[induced subgraph]].

For instance, the bipartite half of the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and the bipartite half of the [[hypercube graph]] is the [[halved cube graph]].
When ''G'' is a [[distance-regular graph]], its two bipartite halves are both distance-regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[File:Works of Archimedes Lemmas.PNG|thumb|The first page of the ''Book of Lemmas'' as seen in ''The Works of Archimedes'' (1897).]]

The '''''Book of Lemmas''''' is a book attributed to [[Archimedes]] by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]], though the [[authorship]] of the book is questionable. It consists of fifteen propositions ([[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]]) on [[circles]].&lt;ref name=Heath/&gt;

==History==

===Translations===
The ''Book of Lemmas'' was first introduced in [[Arabic]] by Thābit ibn Qurra; he attributed the work to Archimedes. In 1661, the Arabic manuscript was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Abraham Ecchellensis]] and edited by [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Giovanni A. Borelli]]. The Latin version was published under the name ''Liber Assumptorum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/math/nofr.html| title=From Euclid to Newton| accessdate=2008-06-24| publisher=[[Brown University]]| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224140809/http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/math/nofr.html| archivedate=2008-02-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T.

===Authorship===
{{see also|Pseudo-Archimedes}}

The original authorship of the ''Book of Lemmas'' has been in question because in proposition four, the book refers to Archimedes in [[Grammatical person|third person]]; however, it has been suggested that it may have been added by the translator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bogomolny| first=A |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/BookOfLemmas/index.shtml| title=Archimedes' Book of Lemmas| accessdate=2008-06-19| publisher=[[Cut-the-Knot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that the ''Book of Lemmas'' may be a collection of propositions by Archimedes later collected by a Greek writer.&lt;ref name=Heath&gt;{{Citation| last = Heath| first = Thomas Little| year = 1897| title = The Works of Archimedes| publication-place = Cambridge University| pages = ''xxxii'', 301–318| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bTEPAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage| accessdate = 2008-06-15| publisher = University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New geometrical figures==
The Book of Lemmas introduces several new [[geometrical figure]]s.

===Arbelos===
{{main|Arbelos}}
[[File:Arbelos.svg|thumb|200px|left|The arbelos is the shaded region (grey).]]
Archimedes first introduced the arbelos in proposition four of his book:
{{cquote|If AB be the diameter of a [[semicircle]] and N any point on AB, and if semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AN, BN as diameters respectively, the figure included between the circumferences of the three semicircles is "what Archimedes called αρβηλος"; and its area is equal to the circle on PN as diameter, where PN is perpendicular to AB and meets the original semicircle in P.&lt;ref name=Heath/&gt;}}
The figure is used in propositions four through eight. In propositions five, Archimedes introduces the [[Archimedes's twin circles]], and in proposition eight, he makes use what would be the [[Pappus chain]], formally introduced by [[Pappus of Alexandria]].

===Salinon===
{{main|Salinon}}
[[File:Salinon shaded.svg|thumb|200px|left|The salinon is the blue shaded region.]]
Archimedes first introduced the salinon in proposition fourteen of his book:
{{cquote|Let ACB be a semicircle on AB as diameter, and let AD, BE be equal lengths measured along AB from A, B respectively. On AD, BE as diameters describe semicircles on the side towards C, and on DE as diameter a semicircle on the opposite side. Let the perpendicular to AB through O, the centre of the first semicircle, meet the opposite semicircles in C, F respectively. Then shall the area of the figure bounded by the circumferences of all the semicircles be equal to the area of the circle on CF as diameter.&lt;ref name=Heath/&gt;}}
Archimedes proved that the salinon and the circle are equal in area.

==Propositions==
#If two circles touch at A, and if CD, EF be parallel diameters in them, ADF is a straight line.
#Let AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and let the tangents to it at B and at any other point D on it meet in T. If now DE be drawn perpendicular to AB, and if AT, DE meet in F, then DF&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FE.
#Let P be any point on a segment of a circle whose base is AB, and let PN be perpendicular to AB. Take D on AB so that AN&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ND. If now PQ be an arc equal to the arc PA, and BQ be joined, then BQ, BD shall be equal.
#If AB be the diameter of a semicircle and N any point on AB, and if semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AN, BN as diameters respectively, the figure included between the circumferences of the three semicircles is "what Archimedes called αρβηλος"; and its area is equal to the circle on PN as diameter, where PN is perpendicular to AB and meets the original semicircle in P.
#Let AB be the diameter of a semicircle, C any point on AB, and CD perpendicular to it, and let semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AC, CB as diameters. Then if two circles be drawn touching CD on different sides and each touching two of the semicircles, the circles so drawn will be equal.
#Let AB, the diameter of a semicircle, be divided at C so that AC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3/2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;CB [or in any ratio]. Describe semicircles within the first semicircle and on AC, CB as diameters, and suppose a circle drawn touching the all three semicircles. If GH be the diameter of this circle, to find relation between GH and AB.
#If circles are circumscribed about and inscribed in a square, the circumscribed circle is double of the inscribed square.
#If AB be any chord of a circle whose centre is O, and if AB be produced to C so that BC is equal to the radius; if further CO meets the circle in D and be produced to meet the circle the second time in E, the arc AE will be equal to three times the arc BD.
#If in a circle two chords AB, CD which do not pass through the centre intersect at right angles, then (arc AD)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(arc CB)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(arc AC)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(arc DB).
#Suppose that TA, TB are two tangents to a circle, while TC cuts it. Let BD be the chord through B parallel to TC, and let AD meet TC in E. Then, if EH be drawn perpendicular to BD, it will bisect it in H.
#If two chords AB, CD in a circle intersect at right angles in a point O, not being the centre, then AO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + BO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + DO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (diameter)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#If AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and TP, TQ the tangents to it from any point T, and if AQ, BP be joined meeting in R, then TR is perpendicular to AB.
#If a diameter AB of a circle meet any chord CD, not a diameter, in E, and if AM, BN be drawn perpendicular to CD, then CN&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DM.
#Let ACB be a semicircle on AB as diameter, and let AD, BE be equal lengths measured along AB from A, B respectively. On AD, BE as diameters describe semicircles on the side towards C, and on DE as diameter a semicircle on the opposite side. Let the perpendicular to AB through O, the centre of the first semicircle, meet the opposite semicircles in C, F respectively. Then shall the area of the figure bounded by the circumferences of all the semicircles be equal to the area of the circle on CF as diameter.
#Let AB be the diameter of a circle., AC a side of an inscribed regular pentagon, D the middle point of the arc AC. Join CD and produce it to meet BA produced in E; join AC, DB meeting in F, and Draw FM perpendicular to AB. Then EM&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(radius of circle).&lt;ref name=Heath/&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''Bragg plane''' is a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in [[reciprocal space]] which bisects a reciprocal lattice vector, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;, at right angles.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bragg plane is defined as part of the Von Laue condition for [[Interference (wave propagation)|diffraction peaks]] in [[X-ray crystallography|x-ray diffraction crystallography]].

Considering the adjacent diagram, the arriving [[x-ray]] [[plane wave]] is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \cos {(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r})} + i\sin {(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r})}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the incident wave vector given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the incident [[photon]]. While the [[Bragg's law|Bragg formulation]] assumes a unique choice of direct lattice planes and [[specular reflection]] of the incident X-rays, the Von Laue formula only assumes monochromatic light and that each scattering center acts as a source of secondary wavelets as described by the [[Huygens principle]]. Each scattered wave contributes to a new plane wave given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k^\prime} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\hat{n}^\prime&lt;/math&gt;

The condition for constructive interference in the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{n}^\prime&lt;/math&gt; direction is that the path difference between the photons is an integer multiple (m) of their wavelength. We know then that for constructive interference we have:

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{d}|\cos{\theta} + |\mathbf{d}|\cos{\theta^\prime} = \mathbf{d} \cdot (\hat{n} - \hat{n}^\prime) = m\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m ~\in~ \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying the above by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; we formulate the condition in terms of the wave vectors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d} \cdot (\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k^\prime}) = 2\pi m&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Bragg plane_illustration.png|thumb|300px|The Bragg plane in blue, with its associated reciprocal lattice vector K.]]

Now consider that a crystal is an array of scattering centres, each at a point in the [[Bravais lattice]]. We can set one of the scattering centres as the origin of an array. Since the lattice points are displaced by the Bravais lattice vectors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, scattered waves interfere constructively when the above condition holds simultaneously for all values of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; which are Bravais lattice vectors, the condition then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \cdot \left(\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k^\prime}\right) = 2\pi m&lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent statement (see [[Reciprocal lattice#Mathematical description|mathematical description of the reciprocal lattice]]) is to say that:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k^\prime}) \cdot \mathbf{R}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this equation with the definition of a reciprocal lattice vector, we see that constructive interference occurs if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{K} ~=~ \mathbf{k} \,-\, \mathbf{k^\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of the reciprocal lattice. We notice that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k^\prime}&lt;/math&gt; have the same magnitude, we can restate the Von Laue formulation as requiring that the tip of incident wave vector, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;, must lie in the plane that is a perpendicular bisector of the reciprocal lattice vector, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;. This reciprocal space plane is the ''Bragg plane''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">In [[mathematics]], the base-''b'' '''cologarithm''',&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; sometimes shortened to '''colog''',&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; of a number is the base-''b'' [[logarithm]] of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the number. It is equal to the ''negative'' base-''b'' logarithm of the number.

:{{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{colog}_b (x) = \log_b \left(\frac{1}{x} \right) = \log_b (1) - \log_b (x) = -\log_b (x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;}}

The cologarithm in base b of a number is also equal to the logarithm of the same number having the reciprocal of b as the base:

:{{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{colog}_b (x) = \log_{\frac{1}{b}} \left(x \right)&lt;/math&gt;}}

In [[chemistry]], a decimal cologarithm is indicated by the letter p. This usage originated with the quantity [[pH]], defined as –log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Based on pH, the quantity [[acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] was later defined as –log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2574">'''Consumer math''' comprises practical [[mathematics|mathematical]] techniques used in [[commerce]] and everyday life.  In the United States, consumer math is typically offered in [[high school]]s, some [[elementary school]]s, or in some colleges which grant [[associate's degrees]]. 

A U.S. consumer math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include: changing money, [[checking accounts]], [[budgeting]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and markdowns]], [[payroll]] calculations, investing ([[interest|simple and compound interest]]),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[taxes]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]].

The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. For instance, while computational formulas are covered in the material on interest and mortgages, the use of prepared tables based on those formulas is also presented and emphasized.

Some consumer math courses are designed to simulate a real life environment.  At ConsumerMath.org, high school students are able to "purchase" their grades instead of working for points.  Students earn money by completing assignments, and paying their bills.  Students must learn to stay out of debt as they buy cars, pay for insurance, and learn about credit cards.  Success is determined by the student successfully staying out of debt during the course.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], a '''cosmic space''' is any [[topological space]] that is a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of some [[Separable space|separable]] [[metric space]]. Equivalently (for [[regular space|regular]] [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces]] but not in general), a space is cosmic if and only if it has a [[countable]] network; namely a [[countable set|countable]] collection of [[subset]]s of the space such that any [[open set]] is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of a subcollection of these sets.

Cosmic spaces have several interesting properties. There are a number of unsolved problems about them.

==Examples and properties==

* Any open subset of a cosmic space is cosmic since open subsets of separable spaces are separable.
* Separable metric spaces are trivially cosmic.

==Unsolved problems==

It is unknown as to whether ''X'' is cosmic if:

a) ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; contains no uncountable [[discrete space]];

b) the countable product of ''X'' with itself is hereditarily separable and hereditarily [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3645">A '''credal set''' is a set of [[probability distribution]]s&lt;ref&gt;Levi, I. (1980). ''The Enterprise of Knowledge''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. &lt;/ref&gt; or, more generally, a set of (possibly finitely additive) [[probability measure]]s.  A credal set is often assumed or constructed to be a [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] [[convex set]].  It is intended to express [[uncertainty]] or doubt about the probability model that should be used, or to convey the beliefs of a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] agent about the possible states of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cozman, F. (1999). [http://www.poli.usp.br/p/fabio.cozman/Research/CredalSetsTutorial/Nutshell/index.html Theory of Sets of Probabilities (and related models) in a Nutshell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192633/http://www.poli.usp.br/p/fabio.cozman/Research/CredalSetsTutorial/Nutshell/index.html |date=2011-07-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a credal set &lt;math&gt;K(X)&lt;/math&gt; is closed and convex, then, by the [[Krein–Milman theorem]], it can be equivalently described by its [[extreme point]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ext}[K(X)]&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the expectation for a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the credal set &lt;math&gt;K(X)&lt;/math&gt; forms a closed interval &lt;math&gt;[\underline{E}[f],\overline{E}[f]]&lt;/math&gt;, whose lower bound is called the lower prevision of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and whose upper bound is called the upper prevision of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="WALLEY1991"&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{E}[f]=\min_{\mu\in K(X)} \int f \, d\mu=\min_{\mu\in \mathrm{ext}[K(X)]} \int f \, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[probability measure]], and with a similar expression for &lt;math&gt;\overline{E}[f]&lt;/math&gt; (just replace &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; in the above expression).

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[categorical variable]], then the credal set &lt;math&gt;K(X)&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a set of [[probability mass function]]s over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="TROFFAESDECOOMAN2014"&gt;{{cite book

If additionally &lt;math&gt;K(X)&lt;/math&gt; is also closed and convex, then the lower prevision of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be simply evaluated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{E}[f]=\min_{p\in \mathrm{ext}[K(X)]} \sum_x f(x) p(x)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[probability mass function]].
It is easy to see that a credal set over a [[Boolean variable]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot have more than two extreme points (because the only closed convex sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are closed intervals), while credal sets over variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that can take three or more values can have any arbitrary number of extreme points.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22253">'''DNA sequencing theory''' is the broad body of work that attempts to lay analytical foundations for determining the order of specific [[nucleotide]]s in a sequence of [[DNA]], otherwise known as [[DNA sequencing]]. The practical aspects revolve around designing and optimizing sequencing projects (known as "strategic genomics"), predicting project performance, troubleshooting experimental results, characterizing factors such as sequence bias and the effects of software processing algorithms, and comparing various sequencing methods to one another. In this sense, it could be considered a branch of [[systems engineering]] or [[operations research]]. The permanent archive of work is primarily mathematical, although numerical calculations are often conducted for particular problems too. DNA sequencing theory addresses ''physical processes'' related to sequencing DNA and should not be confused with theories of analyzing resultant DNA sequences, e.g. [[sequence alignment]]. Publications&lt;ref name="waterman95"&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterman |first=Michael S. |authorlink=Michael Waterman |year=1995 |title=Introduction to Computational Biology |publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-0-412-99391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes do not make a careful distinction, but the latter are primarily concerned with [[algorithm]]ic issues. Sequencing theory is based on elements of [[mathematics]], [[biology]], and [[systems engineering]], so it is highly interdisciplinary. The subject may be studied within the context of [[computational biology]].

==Theory and sequencing strategies==

===Sequencing as a covering problem===

All mainstream methods of [[DNA sequencing]] rely on reading small fragments of DNA and subsequently reconstructing these data to infer the original DNA target, either via [[sequence assembly|assembly]] or [[Sequence alignment|alignment]] to a reference. The [[abstraction]] common to these methods is that of a mathematical [[Cover (topology)|covering problem]].&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=P. |year=1988 |title=Introduction to the Theory of Coverage Processes |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-85702-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can imagine a line segment representing the target and a subsequent process where smaller segments are "dropped" onto random locations of the target. The target is considered "sequenced" when adequate coverage accumulates (e.g., when no gaps remain).

The abstract properties of covering have been studied by mathematicians for over a century.&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=H. |year=1978 |title=Geometric Probability |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-898-71025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, direct application of these results has not generally been possible. Closed-form mathematical solutions, especially for probability distributions, often cannot be readily evaluated. That is, they involve inordinately large amounts of computer time for parameters characteristic of [[DNA sequencing]]. Stevens' configuration is one such example.&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens WL |year=1939 |title=Solution to a Geometrical Problem in Probability |journal=Annals of Eugenics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=315–320 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1939.tb02216.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results obtained from the perspective of [[pure mathematics]] also do not account for factors that are actually important in sequencing, for instance detectable overlap in sequencing fragments, double-stranding, edge-effects, and target multiplicity. Consequently, development of sequencing theory has proceeded more according to the philosophy of [[applied mathematics]]. In particular, it has been problem-focused and makes expedient use of approximations, simulations, etc.

===Early uses derived from elementary probability theory===

The earliest result may be found directly from elementary probability theory. Suppose we model the above process taking &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as the fragment length and target length, respectively. The probability of "covering" any given location on the target ''with one particular fragment'' is then &lt;math&gt;L / G&lt;/math&gt;. (This presumes &lt;math&gt;L \ll G&lt;/math&gt;, which is valid often, but not for all real-world cases.) The probability of a single fragment '''not''' covering a given location on the target is therefore &lt;math&gt;1 - L / G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\left[1 - L / G\right]^N&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; fragments. The probability of covering a given location on the target with ''at least one'' fragment is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;P = 1 - \left[1 - \frac{L}{G}\right]^N.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation was first used to characterize plasmid libraries,&lt;ref name="clarkecarbon"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke L, Carbon J |year=1976 |title=A colony bank containing synthetic Col-El hybrid plasmids representative of the entire E. coli genome |journal=Cell |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=91–99 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(76)90055-6 |pmid=788919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it may appear in a modified form. For most projects &lt;math&gt;N \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that, to a good degree of approximation

:&lt;math&gt;\left[1 - \frac{L}{G}\right]^N \sim \exp(-NL/G),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R = NL/G&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''redundancy''. Note the significance of redundancy as representing the average number of times a position is covered with fragments. Note also that in considering the covering process over all positions in the target, this probability is identical to the [[expected value]] of the random variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of the target coverage. The final result,

:&lt;math&gt;E\langle C \rangle = 1 - e^{-R},&lt;/math&gt;

remains in widespread use as a "[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|back of the envelope]]" estimator and predicts that coverage for all projects evolves along a universal curve that is a function only of the redundancy.

===Lander-Waterman theory===

In 1988, [[Eric Lander]] and [[Michael Waterman]] published an important paper&lt;ref name="landerwaterman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Eric Lander|Lander ES]], [[Michael Waterman|Waterman MS]] |year=1988 |title=Genomic mapping by fingerprinting random clones: a mathematical analysis |journal=Genomics |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=231–239 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(88)90007-9 |pmid=3294162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; examining the covering problem from the standpoint of gaps. Although they focused on the so-called [[Gene mapping|mapping problem]], the abstraction to sequencing is much the same. They furnished a number of useful results that were adopted as the standard theory from the earliest days of "large-scale" genome sequencing.&lt;ref name="fleischmann"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fleischmann RD |year=1995 |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |pmid=7542800 |bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their model was also used in designing the [[Human Genome Project]] and continues to play an important role in DNA sequencing.

Ultimately, the main goal of a sequencing project is to close all gaps, so the "gap perspective" was a logical basis of developing a sequencing model. One of the more frequently used results from this model is the expected number of [[contig]]s, given the number of fragments sequenced. If one neglects the amount of sequence that is essentially "wasted" by having to detect overlaps, their theory yields

:&lt;math&gt;E\langle contigs \rangle = N e^{-R}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1995, Roach&lt;ref name="roach95"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roach JC |year=1995 |title=Random subcloning |journal=Genome Research |volume=5 |issue=5|pages=464–473 |doi=10.1101/gr.5.5.464 |pmid=8808467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published improvements to this theory, enabling it to be applied to sequencing projects in which the goal was to completely sequence a target genome. [[Michael Christopher Wendl|Michael Wendl]] and [[Bob Waterston]]&lt;ref name="wendl02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]], [[Bob Waterston|Waterston RH]] |year=2002 |title=Generalized gap model for bacterial artificial chromosome clone fingerprint mapping and shotgun sequencing |journal=Genome Research |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1943–1949 |doi=10.1101/gr.655102 |pmid=12466299 |pmc=187573}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed, based on Stevens' method,&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt; that both models produced similar results when the number of contigs was substantial, such as in low coverage mapping or sequencing projects. As sequencing projects ramped up in the 1990s, and projects approached completion, low coverage approximations became inadequate, and the exact model of Roach was necessary. However, as the cost of sequencing dropped, parameters of sequencing projects became easier to directly test empirically, and interest and funding for strategic genomics diminished

The basic ideas of Lander–Waterman theory led to a number of additional results for particular variations in mapping techniques.&lt;ref name="arratia"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Richard Arratia|Arratia R]] |year=1991 |title=Genomic mapping by anchoring random clones: a mathematical analysis |journal=Genomics |volume=11 |pages=806–827 |issue=4 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(91)90004-X |pmid=1783390 |display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.80.8788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="port"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Port E |year=1995 |title=Genomic mapping by end-characterized random clones: a mathematical analysis |journal=Genomics |volume=26 |pages=84–100 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(95)80086-2 |pmid=7782090 |display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.74.4380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang MQ, Marr TG |year=1993 |title=Genome mapping by nonrandom anchoring: a discrete theoretical analysis |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=600–604 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.2.600 |pmid=8421694 |bibcode = 1993PNAS...90..600Z |pmc=45711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological advancements have rendered mapping theories largely obsolete except in organisms other than highly studied model organisms (e.g., yeast, flies, mice, and humans).

===Parking strategy===

The parking strategy for sequencing resembles the process of parking cars along a curb. Each car is a sequenced clone, and the curb is the genomic target.&lt;ref name="roach2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roach JC |year=2000 |title=Parking strategies for genome sequencing |doi=10.1101/gr.10.7.1020 |journal=Genome Research |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1020–1030 |pmid=10899151 |pmc=310895|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each clone sequenced is screened to ensure that subsequently sequenced clones do not overlap any previously sequenced clone. No sequencing effort is redundant in this strategy. However, much like the gaps between parked cars, unsequenced gaps less than the length of a clone accumulate between sequenced clones. There can be considerable cost to close such gaps.

===Pairwise end-sequencing===

In 1995, Roach ''et al.''&lt;ref name="roach1995b"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roach JC, Boysen C, Wang K, [[Leroy Hood|Hood L]] |year=1995 |title=Pairwise end sequencing: a unified approach to genomic mapping and sequencing |journal=Genomics |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=345–353 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(95)80219-C |pmid=7601461}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed and demonstrated through simulations a generalization of a set of strategies explored earlier by Edwards and Caskey.&lt;ref name="edwards91"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Edwards, A. |author2=Caskey, T. |year=1991 |title=Closure strategies for random DNA sequencing |publisher=A Companion to Methods in Enzymology |volume=3 |pages=41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|whole-genome sequencing]] method became immensely popular as it was championed by Celera and used to sequence several model organisms before Celera applied it to the human genome. Today, most sequencing projects employ this strategy, often called paired end sequencing.

==Post Human Genome Project advancements==

The physical processes and protocols of DNA sequencing have continued to evolve, largely driven by advancements in bio-chemical methods, instrumentation, and automation techniques. There is now a wide range of problems that [[DNA sequencing]] has made in-roads into, including [[metagenomics]] and [[Cancer Genome Project|medical (cancer) sequencing]]. There are important factors in these scenarios that classical theory does not account for. Recent work has begun to focus on resolving the effects of some of these issues. The level of mathematics becomes commensurately more sophisticated.

===Various artifacts of large-insert sequencing===

Biologists have developed methods to filter highly-repetitive, essentially un-sequenceable regions of genomes. These procedures are important for organisms whose genomes consist mostly of such DNA, for example corn. They yield multitudes of small islands of sequenceable DNA products. Wendl and Barbazuk&lt;ref name="wendl05"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]], Barbazuk WB |year=2005 |title=Extension of Lander–Waterman Theory for sequencing filtered DNA libraries |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=6 |pages=article 245 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-6-245 |pmid=16216129 |pmc=1280921}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an extension to Lander–Waterman Theory to account for "gaps" in the target due to filtering and the so-called "edge-effect". The latter is a position-specific sampling bias, for example the terminal base position has only a &lt;math&gt;1 / G&lt;/math&gt; chance of being covered, as opposed to &lt;math&gt;L / G&lt;/math&gt; for interior positions. For &lt;math&gt;R &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, classical Lander–Waterman Theory still gives good predictions, but dynamics change for higher redundancies.

Modern sequencing methods usually sequence both ends of a larger fragment, which provides linking information for ''de novo'' assembly and improved probabilities for alignment to reference sequence. Researchers generally believe that longer lengths of data (read lengths) enhance performance for very large DNA targets, an idea consistent with predictions from distribution models.&lt;ref name="wendl06distrib"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]] |year=2006 |title=Occupancy modeling of coverage distribution for whole genome shotgun DNA sequencing |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |volume=68 |issue=1|pages=179–196 |doi=10.1007/s11538-005-9021-4 |pmid=16794926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wendl&lt;ref name="wendl06gen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]] |year=2006 |title=A general coverage theory for shotgun DNA sequencing |journal=Journal of Computational Biology |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1196 |doi=10.1089/cmb.2006.13.1177 |pmid=16901236 |url=https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5754&amp;context=open_access_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that smaller fragments provide better coverage on small, linear targets because they reduce the edge effect in linear molecules. These findings have implications for sequencing the products of DNA filtering procedures. Read-pairing and fragment size evidently have negligible influence for large, whole-genome class targets.

===Individual and population sequencing===

Sequencing is emerging as an important tool in medicine, for example in cancer research. Here, the ability to detect [[Loss of heterozygosity|heterozygous mutations]] is important and this can only be done if the sequence of the [[Diploid#Diploid|diploid genome]] is obtained. In the pioneering efforts to sequence individuals, Levy ''et al.''&lt;ref name="levy07"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levy S |year=2007 |title=The diploid genome sequence of an individual human |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=article e254 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254 |pmid=17803354 |pmc=1964779|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wheeler ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="wheeler08"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheeler DA |year=2008 |title=The complete genome of an individual by massively parallel DNA sequencing |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7189 |pages=872–876 |doi=10.1038/nature06884 |pmid=18421352 |bibcode=2008Natur.452..872W|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sequenced [[Craig Venter]] and [[James D. Watson|Jim Watson]], respectively, outlined models for covering both alleles in a genome. Wendl and Wilson&lt;ref name="wendl08"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]], [[Richard K. Wilson|Wilson RK]] |year=2008 |title=Aspects of coverage in medical DNA sequencing |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=9 |pages=article 239 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-239 |pmid=18485222 |pmc=2430974}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed with a more general theory that allowed for an arbitrary number of coverings of each allele and arbitrary [[ploidy]]. These results point to the general conclusion that the amount of data needed for such projects is significantly higher than for traditional haploid projects. Generally, at least 30-fold redundancy, i.e. each nucleotide spanned by an average of 30 sequence reads, is now standard.&lt;ref name="ley2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Timothy Ley|Ley TJ]] |year=2008 |title=DNA sequencing of a cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia genome |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218|pages=66–72 |doi=10.1038/nature07485 |pmid=18987736|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...66L |pmc=2603574|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, requirements can be even greater, depending upon what kinds of genomic events are to be found. For example, in the so-called "discordant read pairs method", DNA insertions can be inferred if the distance between read pairs is larger than expected. Calculations show that around 50-fold redundancy is needed to avoid [[False positive rate|false-positive errors]] at 1% threshold.&lt;ref name="wendl09a"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]], [[Richard K. Wilson|Wilson RK]] |year=2009 |title=Statistical aspects of discerning indel-type structural variation via DNA sequence alignment |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=10 |pages=article 359 |pmid=19656394 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-359 |pmc=2748092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]] has also made large-scale population sequencing feasible, for example the [[1000 Genomes Project]] to characterize variation in human population groups. While common variation is easily captured, rare variation poses a design challenge: too few samples with significant sequence redundancy risks not having a variant in the sample group, but large samples with light redundancy risk not capturing a variant in the read set that is actually in the sample group. Wendl and Wilson&lt;ref name="wendl09b"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]], [[Richard K. Wilson|Wilson RK]] |year=2009 |title=The theory of discovering rare variants via DNA sequencing |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=10 |pages=article 485 |pmid=19843339 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-485 |pmc=2778663}}&lt;/ref&gt; report a simple set of optimization rules that maximize the probability of discovery for a given set of parameters. For example, for observing a rare allele at least twice (to eliminate the possibility is unique to an individual) a little less than 4-fold redundancy should be used, regardless of the sample size.

===Metagenomic sequencing===

Next-generation instruments are now also enabling the sequencing of whole uncultured metagenomic communities. The sequencing scenario is more complicated here and there are various ways of framing design theories for a given project. For example, Stanhope&lt;ref name="stanhope2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stanhope SA |year=2010 |title=Occupancy modeling maximum contig size probabilities and designing metagenomics experiments |journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5 |pages=article e11652 |pmid= 20686599 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011652|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511652S |issue=7 |pmc=2912229}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a probabilistic model for the amount of sequence needed to obtain at least one contig of a given size from each novel organism of the community, while Wendl et al. reported analysis for the average contig size or the probability of completely recovering a novel organism for a given rareness within the community.&lt;ref name="wendl2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Christopher Wendl|Wendl MC]]|year=2012 |title=Coverage theories for metagenomic DNA sequencing based on a generalization of Stevens' theorem |journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology |pmid= 22965653 |doi=10.1007/s00285-012-0586-x |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1141–1161|display-authors=etal|pmc=3795925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Hooper et al. propose a semi-empirical model based on the [[gamma distribution]].&lt;ref name="hooper2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hooper SD|year=2010 |title=Estimating DNA coverage and abundance in metagenomes using a gamma approximation |journal=Bioinformatics|volume=26 |pages=295–301 |pmid= 20008478 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp687 |issue=3 |pmc=2815663|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

DNA sequencing theories often invoke the assumption that certain random variables in a model are [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]]. For example, in Lander–Waterman Theory, a sequenced fragment is presumed to have the same probability of covering each region of a genome and all fragments are assumed to be independent of one another. In actuality, sequencing projects are subject to various types of bias, including differences of how well regions can be cloned, sequencing anomalies, biases in the target sequence (which is ''not'' random), and software-dependent errors and biases. In general, theory will agree well with observation up to the point that enough data have been generated to expose latent biases.&lt;ref name="wendl08"/&gt; The kinds of biases related to the underlying target sequence are particularly difficult to model, since the sequence itself may not be known ''a priori''. This presents a type of [[Catch-22 (logic)]] problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">In [[differential geometry]], a '''differentiable stack''' is a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] over the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[differentiable manifold]]s (with the usual open [[Cover (topology)|covering topology]]) which admits an atlas.  In other words, a differentiable stack is a stack that can be represented by a [[Lie groupoid]].

==Connection with Lie groupoids==
Every [[Lie groupoid]] Γ gives rise to a differentiable stack that is the category of Γ-[[torsor]]s. In fact, every differentiable stack is of this form. Hence, roughly, "a differentiable stack is a Lie groupoid up to [[Morita equivalence]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Behrend–Xu|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential space==
A '''differentiable space''' is a differentiable stack with trivial stabilizers. For example, if a [[Lie group]] [[Lie group action|acts]] freely but not necessarily properly on a manifold, then the quotient by it is in general not a manifold but a differentiable space.

==With Grothendieck topology==
A differentiable stack ''X'' may be equipped with [[Grothendieck topology]] in a certain way (see the reference). This gives the notion of a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] over ''X''. For example, the sheaf &lt;math&gt;\Omega_X^p&lt;/math&gt; of differential ''p''-forms over ''X'' is given by, for any ''x'' in ''X'' over a manifold ''U'', letting &lt;math&gt;\Omega_X^p(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the space of ''p''-forms on ''U''. The sheaf &lt;math&gt;\Omega_X^0&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[structure sheaf]] on ''X'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Omega_X^*&lt;/math&gt; comes with [[exterior derivative]] and thus is a [[complex of sheaves]] of [[vector space]]s over ''X'': one thus has the notion of [[de Rham cohomology]] of ''X''.

==Gerbes==
An epimorphism between differentiable stacks &lt;math&gt;G \to X&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[gerbe]] over ''X'' if &lt;math&gt;G \to G \times_X G&lt;/math&gt; is also an epimorphism. For example, if ''X'' is a stack, &lt;math&gt;BS^1 \times X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is a gerbe. A theorem of Giraud says that &lt;math&gt;H^2(X, S^1)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds one-to-one to the set of gerbes over ''X'' that are locally isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;BS^1 \times X \to X&lt;/math&gt; and that come with trivializations of their [[band (geometry)|band]]s.

In [[mathematics]], a '''double Mersenne number''' is a [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;M_{M_p} = 2^{2^p-1}-1&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is prime.

== Examples ==

== Double Mersenne primes ==

A double Mersenne number that is [[prime number|prime]] is called a '''double Mersenne prime'''. Since a Mersenne number ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; can be prime only if ''p'' is prime, (see [[Mersenne prime]] for a proof), a double Mersenne number &lt;math&gt;M_{M_p}&lt;/math&gt; can be prime only if ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is itself a Mersenne prime. For the first values of ''p'' for which ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is prime, &lt;math&gt;M_{M_{p}}&lt;/math&gt; is known to be prime for ''p'' = 2, 3, 5, 7 while explicit factors of &lt;math&gt;M_{M_{p}}&lt;/math&gt; have been found for ''p'' = 13, 17, 19, and 31.

==Catalan–Mersenne number conjecture==

Write &lt;math&gt;M(p)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;M_p&lt;/math&gt;. A special case of the double Mersenne numbers, namely the [[Recursion|recursively]] defined sequence
: 2, ''M''(2), ''M''(''M''(2)), ''M''(''M''(''M''(2))), ''M''(''M''(''M''(''M''(2)))), ... {{OEIS|id=A007013}} 
is called the '''Catalan–Mersenne numbers'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Catalan-MersenneNumber|title=Catalan-Mersenne Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Charles Catalan|Catalan]] came up with this sequence after the discovery of the primality of ''M''(127)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''(''M''(''M''(''M''(2)))) by [[Édouard Lucas|Lucas]] in 1876.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Questions proposées |journal=Nouvelle correspondance mathématique |volume=2 |year=1876 |pages=94–96 |url=https://archive.org/stream/nouvellecorresp01mansgoog#page/n353/mode/2up}} (probably collected by the editor). Almost all of the questions are signed by Édouard Lucas as is number 92: {{quote|Prouver que 2&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 et 2&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 sont des nombres premiers. (É. L.) (*).}} The footnote (indicated by the star) written by the editor Eugène Catalan, is as follows: {{quote|(*) Si l'on admet ces deux propositions, et si l'on observe que 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 sont aussi des nombres premiers, on a ce ''théorème empirique: Jusqu'à une certaine limite, si'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 ''est un nombre premier'' ''p'', 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 ''est un nombre premier'' ''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 ''est un nombre premier'' p", etc. Cette proposition a quelque analogie avec le théorème suivant, énoncé par Fermat, et dont Euler a montré l'inexactitude: ''Si n est une puissance de 2, 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 est un nombre premier.'' (E. C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalan conjectured that they are prime "up to a certain limit". Although the first five terms (below ''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;) are prime, no known methods can prove that any further terms are prime (in any reasonable time) simply because they are too huge. However, if ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is not prime, there is a chance to discover this by computing ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] some small prime ''p'' (using recursive [[modular exponentiation]]. If the resulting residue is zero, ''p'' represents a factor of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and thus would disprove its primality. Since ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Mersenne number]], such prime factor ''p'' must be of the form 2·''k''·''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;+1.)

==In popular culture==
In the [[Futurama]] movie [[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|''The Beast with a Billion Backs'']], the double Mersenne number &lt;math&gt;M_{M_7}&lt;/math&gt; is briefly seen in "an elementary proof of the [[Goldbach conjecture]]". In the movie, this number is known as a "martian prime".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10728">The '''Engel expansion''' of a positive [[real number]] ''x'' is the unique non-decreasing sequence of [[natural number|positive integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{a_1}+\frac{1}{a_1a_2}+\frac{1}{a_1a_2a_3}+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's constant ''e'']] has the Engel expansion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|A028310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...
corresponding to the [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]]
:&lt;math&gt;e=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1\cdot 2}+\frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3}+\frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

[[Rational number]]s have a finite Engel expansion, while [[irrational number]]s have an infinite Engel expansion. If ''x'' is rational, its Engel expansion provides a representation of ''x'' as an [[Egyptian fraction]]. Engel expansions are named after [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]], who studied them in 1913.

An expansion analogous to an '''Engel expansion''', in which alternating terms are negative, is called a [[Pierce expansion]].

== Engel expansions, continued fractions, and Fibonacci ==

{{harvtxt|Kraaikamp|Wu|2004}} observe that an Engel expansion can also be written as an ascending variant of a [[continued fraction]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\displaystyle 1+\frac{\displaystyle 1+\frac{\displaystyle 1+\cdots}{\displaystyle a_3}}{\displaystyle a_2}}{\displaystyle a_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

They claim that ascending continued fractions such as this have been studied as early as [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' (1202). This claim appears to refer to Fibonacci's compound fraction notation in which a sequence of numerators and denominators sharing the same fraction bar represents an ascending continued fraction:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a\ b\ c\ d}{e\ f\ g\ h} = \dfrac{d+\dfrac{c+\dfrac{b+\dfrac{a}{e}}{f}}{g}}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

If such a notation has all numerators 0 or 1, as occurs in several instances in ''Liber Abaci'', the result is an Engel expansion. However, Engel expansion as a general technique does not seem to be described by Fibonacci.

==Algorithm for computing Engel expansions==
To find the Engel expansion of ''x'', let

:&lt;math&gt;u_1=x,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=\left \lceil \frac{1}{u_k} \right \rceil,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; u_{k+1}=u_ka_k-1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left \lceil r \right \rceil&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function#The ceiling function|ceiling function]] (the smallest integer not less than ''r'').

If &lt;math&gt;u_i=0&lt;/math&gt; for any ''i'', halt the algorithm. 
==Iterated functions for computing Engel expansions==
Another equivalent method is to consider the map &lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|A220335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = x \left( 1+\left\lfloor {x}^{-1}\right\rfloor \right) -1&lt;/math&gt;

and set

:&lt;math&gt;u_k = 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{g^{(n - 1)} (x)} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; 
where
:&lt;math&gt;g^{(n)} (x) = g (g^{(n - 1)} (x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^{(0)} (x) = x&lt;/math&gt;

Yet another equivalent method, called the modified Engel expansion calculated by 

&lt;math&gt;h (x) = \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor g (x) = \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor
\left( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor + x - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;u_k = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
  1 + \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor &amp; n = 1\\
  \lfloor \frac{1}{h^{(k - 2)} (x)} \rfloor \left( 1 + \lfloor \frac{1}{h^{(k
  - 1)} (x)} \rfloor \right) &amp; n \geqslant 2
\end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
=== The [[Transfer operator]] of the Engel map ===
The Frobenius-Perron [[Transfer operator]] of the Engel map &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; acts on functions &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with

&lt;math&gt;
  [\mathcal{L}_g f] (x) = \sum_{y : g (y) = x} \frac{f (y)}{\left|
  \frac{d}{d z} g (z) \right|_{z = y}} = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}
  \frac{f \left( \frac{x + 1}{n + 1} \right)}{n + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

since

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d x} (x (n + 1) - 1) = n + 1&lt;/math&gt; and the inverse of the n-th component is &lt;math&gt;\frac{x + 1}{n + 1}&lt;/math&gt; which is found by solving &lt;math&gt;x (n + 1)- 1 = y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relation to the Riemann &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; function ==
The [[Mellin transform]] of the map &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the Riemann zeta function by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;  \begin{array}{ll}
    \int_0^1 g (x) x^{s - 1} d x &amp; = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}
    \int_{\frac{1}{n + 1}}^{\frac{1}{n}} (x (n + 1) - 1) x^{s - 1} d x\\
    &amp; = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n^{- s} (s - 1) + (n + 1)^{- s - 1} (n^2
    + 2 n + 1) + n^{- s - 1} s - n^{1 - s}}{(s + 1) s (n + 1)}\\
    &amp; = \frac{\zeta (s)}{s + 1} - \frac{1}{s (s + 1)}
  \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
To find the Engel expansion of 1.175, we perform the following steps.

:&lt;math&gt;u_1 = 1.175, a_1=\left \lceil \frac{1}{1.175} \right\rceil = 1; &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_2 = u_1a_1-1=1.175\cdot1-1=0.175, a_2=\left\lceil\frac{1}{0.175}\right\rceil=6 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_3 = u_2a_2-1=0.175\cdot6-1=0.05, a_3=\left\lceil\frac{1}{0.05}\right\rceil=20 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_4 = u_3a_3-1=0.05\cdot20-1=0 &lt;/math&gt;

The series ends here. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;1.175=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1\cdot6}+\frac{1}{1\cdot6\cdot20}&lt;/math&gt;

and the Engel expansion of 1.175 is&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;20}.

==Engel expansions of rational numbers==

Every positive rational number has a unique finite Engel expansion. In the algorithm for Engel expansion, if ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a rational number ''x''/''y'', then ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;minus;''y'' mod ''x'')/''y''. Therefore, at each step, the numerator in the remaining fraction ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' decreases and the process of constructing the Engel expansion must terminate in a finite number of steps. Every rational number also has a unique infinite Engel expansion: using the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)^r}.&lt;/math&gt;

the final digit ''n'' in a finite Engel expansion can be replaced by an infinite sequence of (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)s without changing its value. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;1.175=\{1,6,20\}=\{1,6,21,21,21,\dots\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is analogous to the fact that any rational number with a finite decimal representation also has an infinite decimal representation (see [[0.999...]]).
An infinite Engel expansion in which all terms are equal is a [[geometric series]].

[[Paul Erdős|Erdős]], [[Alfréd Rényi|Rényi]], and Szüsz asked for nontrivial bounds on the length of the finite Engel expansion of a rational number ''x''/''y''; this question was answered by Erdős and [[Jeffrey Shallit|Shallit]], who proved that the number of terms in the expansion is O(''y''&lt;sup&gt;1/3 + ε&lt;/sup&gt;) for any ε &amp;gt; 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|Rényi|Szüsz|1958}}; {{harvtxt|Erdős|Shallit|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engel expansions for some well-known constants==
:&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; = {1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 17, 19, 300, 1991, 2492,...} {{OEIS|id=A006784}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; = {1, 3, 5, 5, 16, 18, 78, 102, 120, 144,...} {{OEIS|id=A028254}}

:&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,...} {{OEIS|id=A028310}}

And in general,

:&lt;math&gt;e^{1/r}-1=\{1r, 2r, 3r, 4r, 5r, 6r, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

More Engel expansions for constants can be found [http://oeis.org/wiki/Index_to_OEIS:_Section_El#Engel here].

==Growth rate of the expansion terms==
The coefficients ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the Engel expansion typically exhibit [[exponential growth]]; more precisely, for [[almost all]] numbers in the interval (0,1], the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is equal to [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]. However, the subset of the interval for which this is not the case is still large enough that its [[Hausdorff dimension]] is one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wu|2000}}. Wu credits the result that the limit is almost always ''e'' to [[Janos Galambos]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The same typical growth rate applies to the terms in expansion generated by the [[greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions]]. However, the set of real numbers in the interval (0,1] whose Engel expansions coincide with their greedy expansions has measure zero, and Hausdorff dimension 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wu|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''epitome''', in [[data processing]], is a condensed digital representation of the essential [[Statistics|statistical]] properties of ordered [[dataset]]s such as [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that represent [[image]]s, [[audio signal]]s, [[video]]s or [[genetic sequence]]s. Although much smaller than the data, the epitome contains many of its smaller overlapping parts with much less repetition and with some level of generalization. As such, it can be used in tasks such as [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] and [[signal processing]].

The first use of '''epitomic analysis''' was with [[image texture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.microsoft.com/~jojic/epitome.html Nebojsa Jojic's image epitome website]&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of [[Image processing|image parsing]]. Epitomes have also been used in [[video processing]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vincentcheung.ca/research/videoepitome.html Vincent Cheung's video epitome website]&lt;/ref&gt; to replace, remove or [[Superresolution|superresolve]] imagery.

Epitomes are also being investigated as tools for [[vaccine design]].{{cn|date=August 2014}}

[[Image:Evolute1.gif|right|thumb|The evolute of a curve (in this case, an ellipse) is the envelope of its normals.]]
In the [[differential geometry of curves]], the '''evolute''' of a [[curve]] is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all its [[Osculating circle|centers of curvature]]. That is to say that when the center of curvature of each point on a curve is drawn, the resultant shape will be the evolute of that curve. The evolute of a circle is therefore a single point at its center.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Circle Evolute|id=CircleEvolute|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalently, an evolute is the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the [[perpendicular|normals]] to a curve.

The evolute of a curve, a surface, or more generally a [[submanifold]], is the [[caustic (mathematics)|caustic]] of the normal map. Let {{mvar|M}} be a smooth, regular submanifold in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For each point {{mvar|p}} in {{mvar|M}} and each vector {{math|'''v'''}}, based at {{mvar|p}} and normal to {{mvar|M}}, we associate the point {{math|''p'' + '''v'''}}. This defines a [[Lagrangian map]], called the normal map. The caustic of the normal map is the evolute of {{mvar|M}}.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|first=V. I.|last=Arnold|first2=A.

Evolutes are closely connected to [[involute]]s: A curve is the evolute of any of its involutes.

== History ==
[[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] ({{circa}} 200&amp;nbsp;BC) discussed evolutes in Book V of his ''Conics''. However, [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] is sometimes credited with being the first to study them (1673). Huygens formulated his theory of evolutes sometime around 1659 to help solve the problem of finding the [[tautochrone curve]], which in turn helped him construct an isochronous pendulum. This was because the tautochrone curve is a [[cycloid]], and the cycloid has the unique property that its evolute is also a cycloid. The theory of evolutes, in fact, allowed Huygens to achieve many results that would later be found using calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoder|first=Joella G.|title=Unrolling Time: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematization of Nature|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolute of a parametric curve ==
If &lt;math&gt;\vec x= \vec c(t),\; t\in [t_1,t_2]&lt;/math&gt; is the parametric representation of a [[regular curve]] in the plane with its curvature nowhere 0 and &lt;math&gt;\rho(t)&lt;/math&gt; its curvature radius and &lt;math&gt;\vec n(t)&lt;/math&gt; the unit normal pointing to the curvature center, then
* &lt;math&gt;\vec E(t)=\vec c(t) +\rho (t)\vec n(t)&lt;/math&gt;
describes the  '''evolute''' of the given curve.

For &lt;math&gt;\vec c(t)=(x(t),y(t))^T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec E=(X,Y)^T&lt;/math&gt; one gets
* &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X(t) = x(t) - \frac{y'(t) \cdot \Big(x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2\Big)}{x'(t) \cdot y''(t) - x''(t) \cdot y'(t)}\quad&lt;/math&gt; and
: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle Y(t) = y(t) + \frac{x'(t) \cdot \Big(x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2\Big)}{x'(t) \cdot y''(t) - x''(t) \cdot y'(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties of the evolute ==
[[File:Evolute-parab-2-e.svg|thumb|The normal at point P is the tangent at the curvature center C.]]
In order to derive properties of a regular curve it is advantageous to use the [[arc length]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of the given curve as  its parameter, because of &lt;math&gt;\;|\vec c'|=1\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;\vec n'=-\vec c'/\rho\;&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Frenet–Serret formulas]]). Hence the tangent vector of the evolute &lt;math&gt;\;\vec E=\vec c +\rho \vec n \;&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec E'=\vec c' +\rho'\vec n +\rho\vec n'=\rho'\vec n\ .&lt;/math&gt;
From this equation one gets the following properties of the evolute:
*At points with &lt;math&gt;\rho'=0&lt;/math&gt; the evolute is ''not regular''. That means: at points with maximal or minimal curvature the evolute has ''cusps'' (s. parabola, ellipse, nephroid).
*The normals of the given curve are tangents to the evolute. Hence: the evolute is the ''envelope of the normals'' of the given curve. 
*At sections of the curve with &lt;math&gt;\rho'&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\rho'&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; the curve is an ''involute'' of its evolute. (In the diagram: The blue parabola is an involute of the red semicubic parabola, which is actually the evolute of the blue parabola.)

''Proof'' of the last property:&lt;br /&gt;
Let be &lt;math&gt;\rho'&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at the section of consideration. An [[involute]] of the evolute can be described as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec C_0=\vec E -\frac{\vec E'}{|\vec E'|}\;\Big(\int_0^s|\vec E'(w)|\; \mathrm dw+l_0\;\Big)\; ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed string extension (see [[involute#Involute of a parameterized curve|Involute of a parameterized curve]] ).&lt;br /&gt;
With &lt;math&gt;\vec E=\vec c +\rho\vec n\; ,\; \vec E'=\rho'\vec n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho'&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; one gets 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec C_0 = \vec c +\rho\vec n-\vec n \;\Big(\int_0^s\rho'(w)\; \mathrm dw\;+l_0\Big)= \vec c +(\rho(0)-l_0)\; \vec n\; .&lt;/math&gt;
That means: For the string extension &lt;math&gt;l_0=\rho(0)&lt;/math&gt; the given curve is reproduced.

*''Parallel curves'' have the same evolute.
''Proof:'' A parallel curve with distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; off the given curve has the parametric representation &lt;math&gt;\vec c_d =\vec c +d\vec n&lt;/math&gt; and the radius of curvature &lt;math&gt;\rho_d=\rho -d&lt;/math&gt; (see [[parallel curve#Parallel curve of a parametricaly given curve|parallel curve]]). Hence the evolute of the parallel curve is &lt;math&gt;\vec E_d=\vec c_d +\rho_d \vec n=\vec c +d\vec n +(\rho -d)\vec n=\vec c +\rho \vec n = \vec E\; .&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Evolute of a parabola ===
For the parabola with the parametric representation &lt;math&gt;(t,t^2)&lt;/math&gt; one gets from the formulae above the equations:
:&lt;math&gt;X=\cdots=-4t^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y=\cdots=\frac{1}{2}+3t^2 \; ,&lt;/math&gt;
which describes a [[semicubic parabola]]

[[File:Evolute-elli.svg|thumb|Evolute (red) of an ellipse]]
=== Evolute of an ellipse ===
For the ellipse with the parametric representation &lt;math&gt;(a\cos t, b\sin t)&lt;/math&gt; one gets:&lt;ref&gt;R.Courant: ''Vorlesungen über Differential- und Integralrechnung.'' Band 1, Springer-Verlag, 1955, S. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X=\cdots = \frac{a^2-b^2}{a}\cos ^3t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y=\cdots = \frac{a^2-b^2}{b}\sin ^3t \; .&lt;/math&gt;
These are the equations of a non symmetric [[astroid]]. 
Eliminating parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; leads to the implicit representation
* &lt;math&gt;(aX)^{\tfrac{2}{3}} +(bY)^{\tfrac{2}{3}}=(a^2-b^2)^{\tfrac{2}{3}}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Cycloid osculating circle evolute 2.gif|300px|thumb|Cycloid (blue), it's osculating circle (red) and evolute (green).]]

=== Evolute of a cycloid===
For the [[cycloid]] with the parametric representation &lt;math&gt;(r(t - \sin t), r(1 - \cos t))&lt;/math&gt; the evolute will be:&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Cycloid Evolute |id=CycloidEvolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X=\cdots=r(t + \sin t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y=\cdots=r(\cos t - 1)&lt;/math&gt;
which describes a transposed replica of itself.
[[File:Nephroide-evolute-e.svg|300px|thumb|The evolute of the large nephroid (blue) is the small nephroid (red).]]
== Evolutes of some curves ==
The evolute 
* of a [[parabola]] is a semicubic parabola (see above), 
* of an [[ellipse]] is a non symmetric astroid (see above),
* of a [[nephroid]] is a nephroid (half as large, see diagram),
* of an [[astroid]] is an astroid (twice as large),
* of a [[cardioid]] is a cardioid (one third as large),
* of a [[circle]] is its midpoint,
* of a [[Deltoid curve|deltoid]] is a deltoid (three times as large),
* of a [[cycloid]] is a congruent cycloid,
* of a [[logarithmic spiral]] is the same logarithmic spiral,
* of a [[tractrix]] is a catenary.

== Radial curve ==
A curve with a similar definition is the '''radial''' of a given curve. For each point on the curve take the vector from the point to the center of curvature and translate it so that it begins at the origin. Then the locus of points at the end of such vectors is called the radial of the curve. The equation for the radial is obtained by removing the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} terms from the equation of the evolute. This produces

:&lt;math&gt;(X, Y)= \left(-y'\frac{{x'}^2+{y'}^2}{x'y''-x''y'}\; ,\; x'\frac{{x'}^2+{y'}^2}{x'y''-x''y'}\right)\; .&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3294">In [[mathematics education]], '''Finite Mathematics''' is a [[syllabus]] in college and university mathematics that is independent of [[calculus]]. A course in [[precalculus]] may be a prerequisite for Finite Mathematics.

Contents of the course include an eclectic selection of topics often applied in social science and business, such as finite [[probability space]]s, [[matrix multiplication]], [[Markov process]]es, finite [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, or [[mathematical model]]s. These topics were used in Finite Mathematics courses at [[Dartmouth College]] (home of [[Tuck School of Business]]) as developed by [[John G. Kemeny]], [[Gerald L. Thompson]], and [[J. Laurie Snell]] and published by [[Prentice-Hall]]. Other publishers followed with their own topics. With the arrival of [[software]] to facilitate computations, teaching and usage shifted from a broad-spectrum Finite Mathematics with paper and pen, into development and usage of software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21220">{{About|the large number named after Ronald Graham|the investing term named after Benjamin Graham|Graham number}}
'''Graham's number''' is an [[Large numbers|enormous number]] that arises as an [[upper bound]] on the answer of a problem in the mathematical field of [[Ramsey theory]]. It is named after mathematician [[Ronald Graham]], who used the number as a simplified explanation of the upper bounds of the problem he was working on in conversations with [[popular science]] writer [[Martin Gardner]]. Gardner later described the number in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1977, introducing it to the general public.  At the time of its introduction, it was the largest specific positive integer ever to have been used in a published mathematical proof.  The number was published in the 1980 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', adding to its popular interest.  Other specific integers (such as [[Kruskal's tree theorem#TREE(3)|TREE(3)]]) known to be far larger than Graham's number have since appeared in many serious mathematical proofs, for example in connection with [[Harvey Friedman]]'s various finite forms of [[Kruskal's theorem#Friedman's finite form|Kruskal's theorem]]. Additionally, smaller upper bounds on the Ramsey theory problem from which Graham's number derived have since been proven to be valid.

Graham's number is much larger than many other [[large numbers]] such as [[Skewes' number]] and [[Moser's number]], both of which are in turn much larger than a [[googolplex]]. As with these, it is so large that the [[observable universe]] is far too small to contain an ordinary [[Numerical digit|digital representation]] of Graham's number, assuming that each digit occupies one [[Planck units#Derived units|Planck volume]], possibly the smallest measurable space. But even the number of digits in this digital representation of Graham's number would itself be a number so large that its digital representation cannot be represented in the observable universe.  Nor even can the number of digits of ''that'' number—and so forth, for a number of times far exceeding the total number of Planck volumes in the observable universe. Thus Graham's number cannot even be expressed in this way by [[Tetration|power towers]] of the form &lt;math&gt;a ^{ b ^{ c ^{ \cdot ^{ \cdot ^{ \cdot}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;.  

However, Graham's number can be explicitly given by [[computable function|computable]] recursive formulas using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] or equivalent, as was done by Graham.  As there is a recursive formula to define it, it is much smaller than typical [[busy beaver]] numbers.  Though too large to be computed in full, the sequence of digits of Graham's number can be computed explicitly through simple algorithms. The last 12 digits are ...262464195387.  With Knuth's up-arrow notation, Graham's number is &lt;math&gt;g_{64}&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
  g_n =
  \left\{
   \begin{matrix}
    3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow3, &amp; n=1 \\
    3\uparrow^{g_{n-1}}3, &amp; n \ge 2, n \in \mathbb{N}
   \end{matrix}
  \right.
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Context==
[[Image:GrahamCube.svg|right|thumb|Example of a 2-colored 3-dimensional cube containing one single-coloured 4-vertex coplanar complete subgraph. The subgraph is shown below the cube. Note that this cube would contain no such subgraph if, for example, the bottom edge in the present subgraph were replaced by a blue edge – thus proving by counterexample that ''N''* &gt; 3.]]
Graham's number is connected to the following problem in [[Ramsey theory]]:
{{quote|Connect each pair of [[vertex (geometry)|geometric vertices]] of an ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]] to obtain a [[complete graph]] on 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. Colour each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of ''n'' for which ''every'' such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on four [[coplanar]] vertices?}}

In 1971, Graham and Rothschild proved that this problem has a solution ''N*'', giving as a bound 6 ≤ ''N*'' ≤ ''N'', with ''N'' being a large but explicitly defined number &lt;math&gt;F^7(12) = F(F(F(F(F(F(F(12)))))))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F(n) = 2\uparrow^n 3&lt;/math&gt; in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]; the number is between 4 → 2 → 8 → 2 and 2 → 3 → 9 → 2 in [[Conway chained arrow notation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iteror.org/big/Source/Graham-Gardner/GrahamsNumber.html |title=Graham's number records |publisher=Iteror.org |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reduced in 2014 via upper bounds on the [[Hales–Jewett theorem|Hales–Jewett number]] to &lt;math&gt;N' = 2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow6&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lavrov|first1=Mikhail |last2=Lee|first2=Mitchell |last3=Mackey|first3=John |date=2014 |title=Improved upper and lower bounds on a geometric Ramsey problem |journal=European Journal of Combinatorics |volume=42 |pages=135–144 |doi=10.1016/j.ejc.2014.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower bound of 6 was later improved to 11 by Geoffrey Exoo in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Exoo |first=Geoffrey |date=2003 |title=A Euclidean Ramsey Problem |journal=Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=223–227 |doi=10.1007/s00454-002-0780-5}} Exoo refers to the Graham &amp; Rothschild upper bound ''N'' by the term "Graham's number". This is not the "Graham's number" ''G'' published by Martin Gardner.&lt;/ref&gt; and to 13 by Jerome Barkley in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0811.1055 |last1=Barkley |first1=Jerome |title=Improved lower bound on an Euclidean Ramsey problem |class=math.CO |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the best known bounds for ''N*'' are 13 ≤ ''N*'' ≤ ''N'''.

Graham's number, ''G'', is much larger than ''N'': &lt;math&gt;f^{64}(4)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 3 \uparrow^n 3&lt;/math&gt;. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner]] (1977) [http://iteror.org/big/Source/Graham-Gardner/GrahamsNumber.html "In which joining sets of points leads into diverse (and diverting) paths"]. Scientific American, November 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The number gained a degree of popular attention when [[Martin Gardner]] described it in the "Mathematical Games" section of ''[[Scientific American]]'' in November 1977, writing that Graham had recently established, in an unpublished proof, "a bound so vast that it holds the record for the largest number ever used in a serious mathematical proof." The 1980 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' repeated Gardner's claim, adding to the popular interest in this number. According to physicist [[John C. Baez|John Baez]], Graham invented the quantity now known as Graham's number in conversation with Gardner. While Graham was trying to explain a result in Ramsey theory which he had derived with his collaborator [[Bruce Lee Rothschild]], Graham found that the quantity now known as Graham's number was easier to explain than the actual number appearing in the proof. Because the number which Graham described to Gardner is larger than the number in the paper itself, both are valid upper bounds for the solution to the problem studied by Graham and Rothschild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/KJTgfjkTZCQ | author = [[John C. Baez|John Baez]] | year = 2013 | title = A while back I told you about Graham's number...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]], Graham's number ''G'' (as defined in Gardner's ''Scientific American'' article) is
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\left.
 \begin{matrix}
  G &amp;=&amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp; &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp; &amp; \underbrace{\qquad \quad \vdots \qquad \quad} \\
    &amp; &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots \cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp; &amp;3\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow3
 \end{matrix}
\right \} \text{64 layers}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the number of ''arrows'' in each subsequent layer is specified by the value of the next layer below it; that is,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;G = g_{64},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_1=3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;g_n = 3\uparrow^{g_{n-1}}3,&lt;/math&gt;

and where a superscript on an up-arrow indicates how many arrows there are. In other words, ''G'' is calculated in 64 steps: the first step is to calculate ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with four up-arrows between 3s; the second step is to calculate ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; up-arrows between 3s; the third step is to calculate ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up-arrows between 3s; and so on, until finally calculating ''G'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt; with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt; up-arrows between 3s.

Equivalently,
&lt;math display="block"&gt;G = f^{64}(4),\text{ where }f(n) = 3 \uparrow^n 3,&lt;/math&gt;

and the superscript on ''f'' indicates an [[Iterated function|iteration of the function]], e.g., &lt;math&gt; f^4(n) = f(f(f(f(n))))&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in terms of the family of [[hyperoperation]]s &lt;math&gt; \text{H}_0, \text{H}_1, \text{H}_2, \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, the function ''f'' is the particular sequence &lt;math&gt;f(n) = \text{H}_{n+2}(3,3)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a version of the rapidly growing [[Ackermann function]] ''A''(''n'', ''n''). (In fact, &lt;math&gt;f(n) &gt; A(n, n)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''.)  The function ''f'' can also be expressed in [[Conway chained arrow notation#Graham's number|Conway chained arrow notation]] as &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow n&lt;/math&gt;, and this notation also provides the following bounds on ''G'':

&lt;math display="block"&gt; 3\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 64\rightarrow 2 &lt; G &lt; 3\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 65\rightarrow 2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Magnitude===
To convey the difficulty of appreciating the enormous size of Graham's number, it may be helpful to express—in terms of exponentiation alone—just the first term (''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of the rapidly growing 64-term sequence.  First, in terms of [[tetration]] (&lt;math&gt; \uparrow\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;) alone:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
 g_1
  = 3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3
  = 3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow (3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3)
  = 3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow \ \dots \ (3 \uparrow\uparrow 3) \dots ))
&lt;/math&gt;

where the number of 3s in the expression on the right is
&lt;math display="block"&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3  =  3 \uparrow \uparrow (3 \uparrow \uparrow 3).&lt;/math&gt;

Now each tetration (&lt;math&gt;\uparrow\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;) operation reduces to a power tower (&lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;) according to the definition
&lt;math display="block"&gt;3 \uparrow\uparrow X  =  3 \uparrow (3 \uparrow (3 \uparrow \dots (3 \uparrow 3) \dots ))  =  3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}}&lt;/math&gt; where there are ''X'' 3s.

Thus,
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
 g_1
  = 3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow \ \dots \ (3 \uparrow\uparrow 3) \dots ))
  \quad \text{where the number of 3s is}
  \quad 3 \uparrow \uparrow (3 \uparrow \uparrow 3)
&lt;/math&gt;

becomes, solely in terms of repeated "exponentiation towers",
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
 g_1 =
  \left.
    \begin{matrix}3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}}}\end{matrix}
  \right \}
  \left.
    \begin{matrix}3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}}\end{matrix}
  \right \}
    \dots
  \left.
    \begin{matrix}3^{3^3}\end{matrix}
  \right \}
    3
  \quad \text{where the number of towers is} \quad
  \left.
    \begin{matrix}3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}}\end{matrix}
  \right \}
  \left.
    \begin{matrix}3^{3^3}\end{matrix}
  \right \}
    3
&lt;/math&gt;

and where the number of 3s in each tower, starting from the leftmost tower, is specified by the value of the next tower to the right.

In other words, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is computed by first calculating the number of towers, &lt;math&gt; n = 3\uparrow 3\uparrow 3\ \dots\ \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt; (where the number of 3s is &lt;math&gt; 3\uparrow 3\uparrow 3 = 7625597484987&lt;/math&gt;), and then computing the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; tower in the following sequence:

       1st tower:  &lt;u&gt;3&lt;/u&gt;
      
       2nd tower:  3↑3↑3 (number of 3s is &lt;u&gt;3&lt;/u&gt;) = &lt;u&gt;7625597484987&lt;/u&gt;
      
       3rd tower:  3↑3↑3↑3↑...↑3 (number of 3s is &lt;u&gt;7625597484987&lt;/u&gt;) = …
      
       ⋮
      
  ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; tower:  3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑...↑3 (number of 3s is given by the &lt;u&gt;''n-1''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; tower&lt;/u&gt;)

where the number of 3s in each successive tower is given by the tower just before it.  Note that the result of calculating the third tower is the value of ''n'', the number of towers for ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The magnitude of this first term, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is so large that it is practically incomprehensible, even though the above display is relatively easy to comprehend.  Even ''n'', the mere ''number of towers'' in this formula for ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is far greater than the number of Planck volumes (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;185&lt;/sup&gt; of them) into which one can imagine subdividing the [[observable universe]]. And after this first term, still another 63 terms remain in the rapidly growing ''g'' sequence before Graham's number ''G'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt; is reached. To illustrate just how fast this sequence grows, while ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt; with only four up arrows, the number of up arrows in ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is this incomprehensibly large number ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Rightmost decimal digits==
Graham's number is a "power tower" of the form 3↑↑''n'' (with a very large value of ''n''), so its rightmost decimal digits must satisfy certain properties common to all such towers.  One of these properties is that ''all such towers of height greater than d (say), have the same sequence of d rightmost decimal digits''. This is a special case of a more general property: The ''d'' rightmost decimal digits of all such towers of height greater than ''d''+2, are ''independent'' of the topmost "3" in the tower; i.e., the topmost "3" can be changed to any other [[Non-negative number|non-negative]] integer without affecting the ''d'' rightmost digits.

The following table illustrates, for a few values of ''d'', how this happens.  For a given height of tower and number of digits ''d'', the full range of ''d''-digit numbers (10&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; of them) does ''not'' occur; instead, a certain smaller subset of values repeats itself in a cycle.  The length of the cycle and some of the values (in parentheses) are shown in each cell of this table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" cellpadding="5"

|}

The particular rightmost ''d'' digits that are ultimately shared by all sufficiently tall towers of 3s are in bold text, and can be seen developing as the tower height increases.  For any fixed number of digits ''d'' (row in the table), the number of values possible for 3&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;3↑…3↑''x'' mod 10&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, as ''x'' ranges over all nonnegative integers, is seen to decrease steadily as the height increases, until eventually reducing the "possibility set" to a single number (colored cells) when the height exceeds ''d''+2.

A simple algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51625.html |title=The Math Forum @ Drexel ("Last Eight Digits of Z") |publisher=Mathforum.org |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; for computing these digits may be described as follows: let x = 3, then iterate, ''d'' times, the [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] ''x'' = 3&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; mod 10&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. Except for omitting any leading 0s, the final value assigned to ''x'' (as a base-ten numeral) is then composed of the ''d'' rightmost decimal digits of 3↑↑''n'', for all ''n'' &gt; ''d''.  (If the final value of ''x'' has fewer than ''d'' digits, then the required number of leading 0s must be added.)

Let ''k'' be the numerousness of these ''stable'' digits, which satisfy the congruence relation G(mod 10&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)≡[G&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;](mod 10&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).

''k''=''t''-1, where G(''t''):=3↑↑''t''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ripà, Marco |year=2011|title=La strana coda della serie n^n^...^n|isbn=978-88-6178-789-6|publisher=UNI Service |language=it }}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that, {{nowrap|g&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt; ≪ k ≪ g&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The algorithm above produces the following 500 rightmost decimal digits of Graham's number (or of any tower of more than 500 3s):

In [[graph theory]], the '''Gyárfás–Sumner conjecture''' asks whether, for every [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and [[complete graph]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the graphs with neither &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; as [[induced subgraph]]s have can be [[graph coloring|properly colored]] using only a constant number of colors. Equivalently, it asks whether the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;-free graphs are [[χ-bounded|&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;-bounded]].{{r|s97}}
It is named after [[András Gyárfás]] and [[David Sumner]], who formulated it independently in 1975 and 1981 respectively.{{r|g75|s81}} It remains unproven.{{r|cs14}}

In this conjecture, it is not possible to replace &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by a graph with cycles. As [[Paul Erdős]] and [[András Hajnal]] have shown, there exist [[triangle-free graph]]s with arbitrarily large chromatic number and, at the same time, arbitrarily large [[girth (graph theory)|girth]].{{r|eh66}} Using these graphs, one can obtain graphs that avoid any fixed choice of a cyclic graph and clique (of more than two vertices) as induced subgraphs, and exceed any fixed bound on the chromatic number.{{r|s97}}

The conjecture is known to be true for certain special choices of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, including [[path graph|paths]],{{r|g87}} [[star (graph theory)|stars]], and trees of radius two.{{r|kp94}}
It is also known that, for any tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the graphs that do not contain a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;-bounded.{{r|s97}}

In [[constructive mathematics]], '''indecomposability''' or '''indivisibility''' ({{lang-de|Unzerlegbarkeit}}, from the adjective  ''unzerlegbar'') is the principle that the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] cannot be [[partition of a set|partitioned]] into two nonempty pieces. This principle was established by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] in 1928 using [[constructivist analysis|intuitionistic principles]], and can also be proven using [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Church's thesis]]. The analogous property in classical [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] is the fact that any continuous function from the continuum to {0,1} is constant.

It follows from the indecomposability principle that any property of real numbers that is ''decided'' (each real number either has or does not have that property) is in fact [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] (either all the real numbers have that property, or else none of them do). Conversely, if a property of real numbers is not trivial, then the property is not decided for all real numbers. This contradicts the [[law of the excluded middle]], according to which every property of the real numbers is decided; so, since there are many nontrivial properties, there are many nontrivial partitions of the continuum.

In [[constructive set theory|CZF]], it is consistent to assume the universe of all sets is indecomposable—so that any class for which membership is decided (every set is either a member of the class, or else not a member of the class) is either empty or the entire universe.

In philosophy and theology, '''infinity''' is explored in articles under headings such as [[the Ultimate (philosophy)|the Ultimate]], the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[God]], and [[Zeno's paradoxes]]. In [[Greek philosophy]], for example in [[Anaximander]], 'the Boundless' is the origin of all that is. He took the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (ἄπειρον, ''apeiron''). The [[Jainism|Jain]] metaphysics and mathematics was the first to define and delineate different "types" of infinities. The work of the mathematician [[Georg Cantor]] first placed infinity into a coherent mathematical framework. Keenly aware of his departure from traditional wisdom, Cantor also presented a comprehensive historical and philosophical discussion of infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newstead|first=A.|title=Cantor on Infinity in Nature, Number, and the Divine Mind|journal=American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly|publication-date=2009|volume=83|issue=4|page=|pages=533–553.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judeo-Christian]] theology, for example in the work of [[Duns Scotus]], the infinite nature of God invokes a sense of being without constraint, rather than a sense of being unlimited in quantity. In [[ethics]] infinity plays an important role designating that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.

''Main: [[Heh (god)|Ḥeḥu and Ḥeḥut]]'' - [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch|(Brugsch 1885)]]

{{quote|...how sad is the descent in the land of silence, the wakeful sleeps, he who did not slumber at night lies still forever. The scorners say: The dwelling place of the inhabitants of the West is deep and dark, it has no door, no window, no light to illuminate it, no north wind to refresh the heart, the sun does not rise there, but they lie every day in darkness - the guardian has been taken away to the land of infinity...|an Egyptian mourner &lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Frankfort]] citing ''Kees, Zeitschrift für aegyptische Sprache'' in  - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jy_DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jy_DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Infinity+in+Ancient+Egyptian+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQnJPPgNzTAhUKVxoKHfiDDUsQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Infinity%20in%20Ancient%20Egyptian%20thought&amp;f=false p.108], [[Courier Corporation]], 22 June 2012, {{ISBN|048614495X}} Consulted 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Greek===
====Anaximander====

An early engagement with the idea of infinity was made by [[Anaximander]] who considered infinity to be a foundational and primitive basis of reality.&lt;ref name="F. LeRon Shults"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4o4Rgh8RWMC&amp;pg=PA99|author=F. LeRon Shults|title=Reforming the Doctrine of God (footnote 4. of page 99)|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1 Nov 2005, 326 pages, {{ISBN|0802829880}}|accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander was the first in the Greek philosophical tradition to propose that the universe was infinite.&lt;ref name="A.A.Long  "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4m2GP9eJmIC&amp;pg=PA127 |author=A.A.

====Anaxagoras====

[[Anaxagoras]] (500–428 BCE) was of the opinion that matter of the universe had an innate capacity for infinite division.&lt;ref name="  James Fieser "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/110/1-presocratics.htm |author= James Fieser |title=The History of Philosophy: A Short Survey |publisher=The University of Tennessee at Martin |date=2008 |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Atomists====

A group of thinkers of ancient Greece (later identified as [[Atomism|the Atomists]]) all similarly considered matter to be made of an infinite number of structures as considered by imagining an dividing or separating matter from itself an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name=" J J O'Connor and E F Robertson "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Infinity.html |author=J.J. O'Connor, E.F. Robertson |title=Infinity |publisher=School of Computer Science - University of St Andrews|date=February 2002 |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle and after====

Aristotle, alive for the period 384–322 BCE, is credited with being the root of a field of thought, in his influence of succeeding thinking for a period spanning more than one subsequent millennium, by his rejection of the idea of [[actual infinity]].&lt;ref name=" Rudy Rucker "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/infinity-mathematics |author=Rudy Rucker |title=Infinity: Mathematics |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book 3 of the work entitled [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]], written by [[Aristotle]], Aristotle deals with the [[concept]] of infinity in terms of his notion of [[actuality]] and of [[potentiality]].&lt;ref name="[[Wolfgang Achtner]]"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Aristotle+Infinity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gT2HVdSWNoPTU_LhgIAF&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20Infinity&amp;f=false|author=[[Wolfgang Achtner]]|title=Infinity: New Research Frontiers - Chapter 1 : Infinity as a Transformative concept in Science and Theology (p.22) |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 7 Feb 2011 {{ISBN|1139495569}},  edited by [[Michał Heller|Revd Dr Michael Heller]], [[W. Hugh Woodin|Dr W. Hugh Woodin]]|accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Z. Bechler"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1E619rAJGoC&amp;pg=PA119|author=Z. Bechler|title=Aristotle's Theory of Actuality (p.119)|publisher=SUNY Press, 1995,  270 pages, ''SUNY series in ancient Greek philosophy'', {{ISBN|0791422399}}|accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Bowin"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~jbowin/BOWA-2.1.pdf|author=John Bowin|title=Aristotelian Infinity|publisher=[http://people.ucsc.edu/ University of California - Santa Cruz]|accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|... It is always possible to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be bisected is infinite.  Hence the infinite is potential, never actual; the number of parts that can be taken always surpasses any assigned number.|''Physics'' 207b8}}

This is often called potential infinity; however, there are two ideas mixed up with this. One is that it is always possible to find a number of things that surpasses any given number, even if there are not actually such things. The other is that we may quantify over infinite sets without restriction. For example, &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} (\exists m \in \mathbb{Z} [m &gt; n \wedge P(m)] )&lt;/math&gt;, which reads, "for any [[integer]] n, there exists an integer m &gt; n such that P(m)". The second view is found in a clearer form by medieval writers such as [[William of Ockham]]:

{{quotation|''Sed omne continuum est actualiter existens. Igitur quaelibet pars sua est vere existens in rerum natura. Sed partes continui sunt infinitae quia non tot quin plures, igitur partes infinitae sunt actualiter existentes.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But every continuum is actually existent. Therefore any of its parts is really existent in nature. But the parts of the continuum are infinite because there are not so many that there are not more, and therefore the infinite parts are actually existent.}}

The parts are actually there, in some sense. However, on this view, no infinite magnitude can have a number, for whatever number we can imagine, there is always a larger one: "There are not so many (in number) that there are no more."

Aristotle's views on the continuum foreshadow some topological aspects of modern mathematical theories of the continuum. Aristotle's emphasis on the connectedness of the continuum may have inspired—in different ways—modern philosophers and mathematicians such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Cantor, and LEJ Brouwer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aristotle and modern mathematical theories of the continuum, in Aristotle and Contemporary Science II|last=Newstead|first=A.G.J.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2001|isbn=|location=Frankfurt|pages=113–129.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Continuous and the Discrete|last=White|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the scholastics, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] also argued against the idea that infinity could be in any sense complete or a totality.

Aristotle deals with infinity in the context of the [[prime mover theory|prime mover]], in Book 7 of the same work, the reasoning of which was later studied and commented on by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].&lt;ref name="R. Sorabji (C. Hagen)"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JcjAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=R. Sorabji (C.

===Roman===
====Plotinus====

[[Plotinus]] considered infinity, while he was alive, during the 3rd century A.D.&lt;ref name="F. LeRon Shults"/&gt;

====Simplicius====

Simplicius,&lt;ref name=" Dr Adam Drozdek "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1kaVPxXJ4IC&amp;pg=PA85 |author=Dr Adam Drozdek |title=Greek Philosophers as Theologians: The Divine Arche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |date=2013-05-28 |isbn=1409477576 |page=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; alive circa 490 to 560 AD,&lt;ref name=" J J O'Connor and E F Robertson 2 "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Simplicius.html |author=J.J.

====Augustine====

[[Augustine]] thought infinity to be "incomprehensible for the human mind".&lt;ref name=" Dr Adam Drozdek "/&gt;

===Early Indian thinking===

The [[Jainism|Jain]] upanga [[Jain Agamas|āgama]] [[Sūryaprajñapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 400 BC) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:

* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

[[File:Number theory 1.jpg|thumb|Jain theory of numbers (See IIIrd section for various infinities)]]
The Jains were the first to discard the idea that all infinities were the same or equal. They recognized different types of infinities: infinite in length (one [[dimension]]), infinite in area (two dimensions), infinite in volume (three dimensions), and infinite perpetually (infinite number of dimensions).

According to Singh (1987), Joseph (2000) and Agrawal (2000), the highest enumerable number ''N'' of the Jains corresponds to the modern concept of [[Aleph number|aleph-null]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (the [[cardinal number]] of the infinite set of integers 1, 2, ...), the smallest cardinal [[transfinite number]]. The Jains also defined a whole system of infinite cardinal numbers, of which the highest enumerable number ''N'' is the smallest.

In the Jaina work on the [[Set theory|theory of sets]], two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between {{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}} ("countless, innumerable") and ''ananta'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.

==Views from the Renaissance to modern times==

===Galileo===
{{main article|Galileo's paradox}}

[[Galileo Galilei]] (February 1564 - January 1642 &lt;ref name=" O'Connor, Robertson "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Galileo.html |author=J.J.  O'Connor, E.F. Robertson|title=Galileo Galilei|publisher=St Andrews University|date=2002|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)   discussed the example of comparing the [[square number]]s {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} with the [[natural number]]s {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as follows:
: 1 → 1&lt;br&gt; 2 → 4&lt;br&gt; 3 → 9&lt;br&gt; 4 → 16&lt;br&gt; …

It appeared by this reasoning as though a "set" (Galileo did not use the terminology) which is naturally smaller than the "set" of which it is a part (since it does not contain all the members) is in some sense the same "size". Galileo found no way around this problem:

{{quotation|So far as I see we can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes "equal," "greater," and "less," are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities.|''On two New Sciences'', 1638}}

The idea that size can be measured by one-to-one correspondence is today known as [[Hume's principle]], although Hume, like Galileo, believed the principle could not be applied to the infinite. The same concept, applied by [[Georg Cantor]], is used in relation to infinite sets.

===Thomas Hobbes===
Famously, the ultra-empiricist [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] ( April 1588 -  December 1679 &lt;ref name="  Sorell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes|author=T. Sorell |title=Thomas Hobbes (English philosopher)|publisher=Britannica |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)  tried to defend the idea of a potential infinity in light of the discovery, by [[Evangelista Torricelli]], of a figure ([[Gabriel's Horn]]) whose [[surface area]] is infinite, but whose [[volume]] is finite.  Not reported, this motivation of Hobbes came too late as [[curve]]s having infinite length yet bounding finite areas were known much before.

===John Locke===
[[John Locke|Locke]] ( August 1632 - October 1704  &lt;ref name=" Rogers214 "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Locke |author=G.A.J. Rogers |title=John Locke, English philosopher |publisher=Brittanica |date=2015-12-14 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in common with most of the [[empiricist]] philosophers, also believed that we can have no proper idea of the infinite.  They believed all our ideas were derived from [[sense data]] or "impressions," and since all sensory impressions are inherently finite, so too are our thoughts and ideas.  Our idea of infinity is merely negative or privative.

{{quotation|Whatever ''positive'' ideas we have in our minds of any space, duration, or number, let them be never so great, they are still finite; but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder, from which we remove all bounds, and wherein we allow the mind an endless progression of thought, without ever completing the idea, there we have our idea of infinity... yet when we would frame in our minds the idea of an infinite space or duration, that idea is very obscure and confused, because it is made up of two parts very different, if not inconsistent.  For let a man frame in his mind an idea of any space or number, as great as he will, it is plain the mind rests and terminates in that idea; which is contrary to the idea of infinity, which consists in a supposed endless progression.|Essay,  II. xvii. 7., author's emphasis}}

He considered that in considerations on the subject of eternity, which he classified as an infinity, humans are likely to make mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GZkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Locke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5DIXVZa1LtT3ar-qgOgP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Locke&amp;f=false Philosophical beauties selected from the works of John Locke - p.237] T.Hurst 1802 [Retrieved 2015-3-28](ed. Locke writes: And hence it is, that in disputes and reasonings concerning eternity, or any other infinite, we are apt to blunder, and involve ourselves in manifest absurdities...)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern philosophical views==
Modern discussion of the infinite is now regarded as part of set theory and mathematics. Contemporary philosophers of mathematics engage with the topic of infinity and generally acknowledge its role in mathematical practice. But, although set theory is now widely accepted, this was not always so.  Influenced by L.E.J Brouwer and verificationism in part, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] (April 1889  Vienna - April  1951 Cambridge, England &lt;ref name="  Monk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Wittgenstein|author=R. Monk|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, British philosopher|publisher=Britannica |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), made an impassioned attack upon [[axiomatic set theory]], and upon the idea of the actual infinite, during his "middle period".&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web | title=  Logic of antinomies | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093891610 | accessdate=July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Does the relation &lt;math&gt;m = 2n&lt;/math&gt; correlate the class of all numbers with one of its subclasses? No. It correlates any arbitrary number with another, and in that way we arrive at infinitely many pairs of classes, of which one is correlated with the other, but which are never related as class and subclass.  Neither is this infinite process itself in some sense or other such a pair of classes... In the superstition that &lt;math&gt;m = 2n&lt;/math&gt; correlates a class with its subclass, we merely have yet another case of ambiguous grammar.|''Philosophical Remarks'' § 141, cf ''Philosophical Grammar'' p. 465}}

Unlike the traditional empiricists, he thought that the infinite was in some way given to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]].

{{quotation|... I can see in space the possibility of any finite experience... we recognize [the] essential infinity of space in its smallest part."  "[Time] is infinite in the same sense as the three-dimensional space of sight and movement is infinite, even if in fact I can only see as far as the walls of my room.}}

{{quotation|... what is infinite about endlessness is only the endlessness itself.}}

===Emmanuel Levinas===
The philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] ( January 1906, Lithuania -   December 25 1995, Paris    &lt;ref name="  Bergo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/#LifCar |author=Bergo, Bettina|title=Emmanual Levinas |publisher=Stanford University |date=23 July 2006 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; )  uses infinity to designate that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.  In Levinas' magnum opus [[Totality and Infinity]] he says :

{{quotation|
...infinity is produced in the relationship of the same with the other, and how the particular and the personal, which are unsurpassable, as it were magnetize the very field in which the production of infinity is enacted...

The idea of infinity is not an incidental notion forged by a subjectivity to reflect the case of an entity encountering on the outside nothing that limits it, overflowing every limit, and thereby infinite.  The production of the infinite entity is inseparable from the idea of infinity, for it is precisely in the disproportion between the idea of infinity and the infinity of which it is the idea that this exceeding of limits is produced.  The idea of infinity is the mode of being, the infinition, of infinity... All knowing qua intentionality already presupposes the idea of infinity, which is preeminently non-adequation.|p. 26-27}}

Levinas also wrote a work entitled ''Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity'', which was published during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levinas - [https://books.google.com/books?id=kH9vvm-AHfUC&amp;pg=PA47 Collected Philosophical Papers (p.47)] (Translated by A. Lingis) Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 31 March 1987 {{ISBN|9024733952}} [Retrieved 2015-05-01]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Infinity Mirror Effect.jpg|thumb|An infinity mirror effect viewed ''between'' the mirrors]]&lt;!-- This is the best image that could be found in a quick search; a clearer image would be  useful  --&gt;
In a classic self-contained infinity mirror, a set of light bulbs, [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], or other point-source lights are placed around the periphery of a fully reflective mirror, and a second, partially reflective "[[one-way mirror]]" is placed a short distance in front of it, in a  [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] alignment. When an outside observer looks into the surface of the partially reflective mirror, the lights appear to recede into infinity, creating the appearance of a tunnel of lights of great depth.&lt;ref name="Finio" /&gt;

Alternatively, this effect can also be seen when an observer stands ''between'' two parallel fully reflective mirrors, as in some [[dressing room]]s, some [[elevator]]s, or a [[house of mirrors]].&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt; A weaker version of this effect can be seen by standing between any two parallel reflective surfaces, such as the glass walls of a small entry lobby into some buildings. The partially reflective glass produces this sensation, diluted by the [[visual noise]] of the views through the glass into the surrounding environment.

== Explanation of effect ==
[[File:Venus in Mirrors.jpg|thumb|Computer simulation image of repeatedly reflected shapes]]
The 3D illusion  mirror effect is produced whenever there are two parallel reflective surfaces which can bounce a beam of light back and forth an indefinite (theoretically infinite) number of times. The reflections appear to recede into the distance because the light actually is traversing the distance it appears to be traveling.  

For example, in a two-centimeter-thick infinity mirror, with the light sources halfway between, light from the source initially travels one centimeter.  The first reflection travels one centimeter to the rear mirror and then two centimeters to, and through the front mirror, a total of three centimeters.  The second reflection travels two centimeters from front mirror to back mirror, and again two centimeters from the back mirror to, and through the front mirror, totaling four centimeters, plus the first reflection (three centimeters) making the second reflection seven centimeters away from the front mirror.  Each successive reflection adds four more centimeters to the total (the third reflection appears 11 centimeters deep, fourth 15 centimeters deep, and so on).&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ExpSnack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Look Into Infinity|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/look_into_infinity/|website=Exploratorium Snacks|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each additional reflection adds length to the path the light must travel before exiting the mirror. If the mirrors are not precisely parallel, but instead are canted at a slight angle, the "visual tunnel" will be perceived to be curved (off to one side) as it recedes into infinity.

When studied using the principles of [[geometrical optics]], the series of repeating images forms the infinite mathematical surface known as [[Gabriel's Horn]], or [[Torricelli's Trumpet]], named in honor of Italian mathematician [[Evangelista Torricelli]], who first studied it. In theory, such a surface is infinite in area, but encloses a finite volume.&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt;

==Cultural references==
Visual artists, especially contemporary [[sculpture|sculptors]], have made use of infinity mirrors. [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Josiah McElheny]], [[Ivan Navarro (artist)|Ivan Navarro]], and [[Taylor Davis (sculptor)|Taylor Davis]] have all produced works that use the infinity mirror to expand the sensation of unlimited space in their artworks.

Some [[amusement park]] [[dark ride]]s, such as Disney's "[[Space Mountain]]" roller coaster attraction, use infinity mirrors to create the impression of flying through space.

'''Jesse Douglas''' (3 July 1897&amp;nbsp;– 7 September 1965) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[Fields Medal]]ist known for his general solution of the [[Plateau problem|Problem of Plateau]].

==Life and career==
He was born in [[New York City]], the son of Sarah (née Kommel) and Louis Douglas. He attended [[City College of New York]] as an undergraduate, graduating with honors in Mathematics in 1916.  He then moved to [[Columbia University]] as a graduate student, obtaining a [[PhD]] in mathematics in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Douglas.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas was one of two winners of the first [[Fields Medal]]s, awarded in 1936. He was honored for solving, in 1930, the [[Plateau problem|problem of Plateau]], which asks whether a minimal surface exists for a given boundary. The problem, open since 1760 when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] raised it, is part of the [[calculus of variations]] and is also known as the ''[[soap bubble]] problem''. Douglas also made significant contributions to the [[inverse problem for Lagrangian mechanics|inverse problem of the calculus of variations]]. The [[American Mathematical Society]] awarded him the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] in 1943.

Douglas later became a full professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), where he taught until his death. At the time CCNY only offered undergraduate degrees and Professor Douglas taught the advanced calculus course. Sophomores (and freshmen with advanced placement) were privileged to get their introduction to [[real analysis]] from a Fields medalist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8194">A '''Keynesian beauty contest''' is a concept developed by [[John Maynard Keynes]] and introduced in Chapter 12 of his work, ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' (1936), to explain [[market trend|price fluctuations]] in [[stock|equity]] [[stock market|markets]].

==Overview==
Keynes described the action of rational agents in a market using an analogy based on a fictional newspaper contest, in which entrants are asked to choose the six most attractive faces from a hundred photographs.  Those who picked the most popular faces are then eligible for a prize.

A naive strategy would be to choose the face that, in the opinion of the entrant, is the most handsome.  A more sophisticated contest entrant, wishing to maximize the chances of winning a prize, would think about what the majority perception of attractive is, and then make a selection based on some inference from his knowledge of public perceptions.  This can be carried one step further to take into account the fact that other entrants would each have their own opinion of what public perceptions are.  Thus the strategy can be extended to the next order and the next and so on, at each level attempting to predict the eventual outcome of the process based on the reasoning of other [[rational agent]]s.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is not a case of choosing those [faces] that, to the best of one's judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees." (Keynes, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1936).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keynes believed that similar behavior was at work within the [[stock market]].  This would have people pricing shares not based on what they think their [[Intrinsic value (finance)|fundamental value]] is, but rather on what they think everyone else thinks their value is, or what everybody else would predict the average assessment of value to be.

[[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Planet Money]]'' tested the theory by having its listeners select the cutest of three animal videos. The listeners were broken into two groups. One selected the animal they thought was cutest, and the other selected the one they thought most participants would think was the cutest. The results showed significant differences between the groups. Fifty percent of the first group selected a video with a kitten, compared to seventy-six percent of the second selecting the same video. Individuals in the second group were generally able to disregard their own preferences and accurately make a decision based on the expected preferences of others. The results were considered to be consistent with Keynes' theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kestenbaum|first=David|title=Ranking Cute Animals: A Stock Market Experiment|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/01/14/132906135/ranking-cute-animals-a-stock-market-experiment|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent theory==
{{further|Guess 2/3 of the average}}
Other, more explicit scenarios help to convey the notion of the contest as a convergence to [[Nash Equilibrium]]. For instance in the ''p''-beauty contest game (Moulin 1986), all participants are asked to simultaneously pick a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the contest is the person(s) whose number is closest to p times the average of all numbers submitted, where p is some fraction, typically 2/3 or 1/2. If there are only two players and p&lt;1, the only Nash equilibrium solution is for all to guess 0 or 1. By contrast, in Keynes' formulation, p=1 and there are many possible Nash equilibria.

In play of the p-beauty contest game (where p differs from 1), players exhibit distinct, boundedly rational levels of reasoning as first documented in an experimental test by Nagel (1995). The lowest, 'Level 0' players, choose numbers randomly from the interval [0,100]. The next higher, 'Level 1' players believe that all other players are Level 0.  These Level 1 players therefore reason that the average of all numbers submitted should be around 50. If p=2/3, for instance, these Level 1 players choose, as their number, 2/3 of 50, or 33. Similarly, the next higher 'Level 2' players in the 2/3-the average game believe that all other players are Level 1 players. These Level 2 players therefore reason that the average of all numbers submitted should be around 33, and so they choose, as their number, 2/3 of 33 or 22. Similarly, the next higher 'Level 3' players play a [[best response]] to the play of Level 2 players and so on. The Nash equilibrium of this game, where all players choose the number 0, is thus associated with an infinite level of reasoning.  Empirically, in a single play of the game, the typical finding is that most participants can be classified from their choice of numbers as members of the lowest Level types 0, 1, 2 or 3, in line with Keynes' observation.

In another variation of reasoning towards the beauty contest, the players may begin to judge contestants based on the most distinguishable unique property found scarcely clustered in the group.  As an analogy, imagine the contest where the player is instructed to choose the most attractive six faces out of a set of hundred faces.  Under special circumstances, the player may ignore all judgment-based instructions in a search for the six most unusual faces (interchanging concepts of high demand and low supply).  Ironic to the situation, if the player finds it much easier to find a consensus solution for judging the six ugliest contestants, she may apply this property instead of attractiveness level in choosing six faces.  In this line of reasoning, the player is looking for other players overlooking the instructions (which can often be based on random selection) to a transformed set of instructions only elite players would solicit, giving them an advantage.  As an example, imagine a contest where contestants are asked to pick the two best numbers in the list: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2345, 6435, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}.  All judgment based instructions can likely be ignored since by consensus two of the numbers do not belong in the set.

''For Lebesgue's lemma for open covers of compact spaces in topology see [[Lebesgue's number lemma]]''

In [[mathematics]], '''Lebesgue's lemma''' is an important statement in [[approximation theory]].  It provides a bound for the projection error.

==Statement==
Let (''V'', ||·||) be a [[normed vector space]], ''U'' be a subspace of ''V'' and let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a [[projection (linear algebra)|linear projector]] on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, for each ''v'' in ''V'':
:&lt;math&gt; \|v-Pv\|\leq (1+\|P\|)\inf_{u\in U}\|v-u\|.&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Notices of the American Mathematical Society''''' is the membership [[Academic journal|journal]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), published monthly except for the combined June/July issue. The first volume appeared in 1953.  Each issue of the magazine since January 1995 is available in its entirety on the journal web site. Articles are peer-reviewed by an editorial board of mathematical experts. Since 2016, the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Frank Morgan (mathematician)|Frank Morgan]]. The cover regularly features [[mathematical visualization]]s.

The ''Notices'' is the world's most widely read mathematical journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/about.html About ''Notices of the AMS'']&lt;/ref&gt; As the membership journal of the American Mathematical Society, the ''Notices'' is sent to the approximately 30,000 AMS members worldwide, one-third of whom reside outside the United States. By publishing high-level exposition, the ''Notices'' provides opportunities for mathematicians to find out what is going on in the field. Each issue contains one or two such expository articles that describe current developments in mathematical research, written by professional mathematicians. The ''Notices'' also carries articles on the history of mathematics, mathematics education, and professional issues facing mathematicians, as well as reviews of books and other works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11692">{{Algebraic structures}}

In [[mathematics]], there are many types of [[algebraic structure]]s which are studied. [[Abstract algebra]] is primarily the study of specific algebraic structures and their properties. Algebraic structures may be viewed in different ways, however the common starting point of algebra texts is that an algebraic object incorporates one or more [[set theory|set]]s with one or more [[binary operation]]s or [[unary operation]]s satisfying a collection of [[axiom]]s.

Another branch of mathematics known as [[universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures in general.   From the universal algebra viewpoint, most structures can be divided into [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] and [[quasivariety|quasivarieties]] depending on the axioms used. Some [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called ''nonvarieties'', are sometimes included among the algebraic structures by tradition.

Concrete examples of each structure will be found in the articles listed.

Algebraic structures are so numerous today that this article will inevitably be incomplete. In addition to this, there are sometimes multiple names for the same structure, and sometimes one name will be defined by disagreeing axioms by different authors. Most structures appearing on this page will be common ones which most authors agree on. Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include [http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php Jipsen] and [http://planetmath.org/browse/objects/ PlanetMath.] These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Study of algebraic structures ==

Algebraic structures appear in most branches of mathematics, and one can encounter them in many different ways.
*Beginning study: In American universities, [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s are generally the first structures encountered in subjects such as [[linear algebra]]. They are usually introduced as sets with certain axioms.
*Advanced study:
**[[Abstract algebra]] studies properties of specific algebraic structures.
**[[Universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures abstractly, rather than specific types of structures. 
***[[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]]
**[[Category theory]] studies interrelationships between different structures, algebraic and non-algebraic. To study a non-algebraic object, it is often useful to use category theory to relate the object to an algebraic structure. 
***Example: The [[fundamental group]] of a [[topological space]] gives information about the topological space.

== Types of algebraic structures ==

In full generality, an algebraic structure may use any number of sets and any number of axioms in its definition. The most commonly studied structures, however, usually involve only one or two sets and one or two [[binary operation]]s. The structures below are organized by how many sets are involved, and how many binary operations are used. Increased indentation is meant to indicate a more exotic structure, and the least indented levels are the most basic.

===One binary operation on one set===
{{Group-like structures}}
The following structures consist of a set with a binary operation. The most common structure is that of a ''group''. Other structures involve weakening or strengthening the axioms for groups, and may additionally use unary operations.

*[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s are key structures. [[Abelian group]]s are an important special type of group.
**[[semigroup]]s and [[monoid]]s: These are like groups, except the operation need not have inverse elements.
**[[quasigroup]]s and [[quasigroup|loops]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative.
**[[Magma (algebra)|Magmas]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative or have inverse elements.
*[[Semilattice]]: This is basically "half" of a lattice structure (see below).

===Two binary operations on one set===
The main types of structures with one set having two binary operations are ''rings'' and ''lattices''. The axioms defining many of the other structures are modifications of the axioms for rings and lattices. One major difference between rings and lattices is that their two operations are related to each other in different ways. In ring-like structures, the two operations are linked by the [[distributive law]]; in lattice-like structures, the operations are linked by the [[absorption law]].

*[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s: The two operations are usually called addition and multiplication. [[Commutative ring]]s are an especially important type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. [[Integral domain]]s and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are especially important types of commutative rings.
**[[Nonassociative ring]]s: These are like rings, but the multiplication operation need not be associative.
***[[Lie ring]]s and [[Jordan ring]]s are special examples of nonassociative rings.
**[[semiring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not have inverses.
**[[nearring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not be commutative.
**[[*-ring]]s: These are rings with an additional unary operation known as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]].
*[[lattice (order theory)|Lattice]]s: The two operations are usually called [[meet and join]].
**[[Latticoid]]: meet and join [[Commutativity|commute]] but need not [[Integral domain|associate]].
**[[Skew lattice]]: meet and join associate but need not commute.

===Two binary operations and two sets===
The following structures have the common feature of having two sets, ''A'' and ''B'', so that there is a binary operation from ''A''×''A'' into ''A'' and another operation from ''A''×''B'' into ''A''.

*[[Vector space]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, and the set ''B'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].
**[[Graded vector space]]s: Vector spaces which are equipped with a [[direct sum]] decomposition into subspaces.
*[[module (mathematics)|Module]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, but the ''B'' is only a general ring and not necessarily a field.
**Special types of modules, including [[free module]]s, [[projective module]]s, [[injective module]]s and [[flat module]]s are studied in abstract algebra.
*[[Group with operators]]: In this case, the set ''A'' is a group, and the set ''B'' is just a set.

===Three binary operations and two sets===
Many structures here are actually hybrid structures of the previously mentioned ones.

*[[Algebra over a field]]: This is a ring which is also a vector space over a field. There are axioms governing the interaction of the two structures. Multiplication is usually assumed to be associative.
**[[Algebra over a ring]]: These are defined the same way as algebras over fields, except that the field may now be any commutative ring.
**[[Graded algebra]]: These algebras are equipped with a decomposition into ''grades''.
*[[Non-associative algebra]]s: These are algebras for which the associativity of ring multiplication is relaxed. 
**[[Lie algebra]]s and [[Jordan algebra]]s are special examples of non-associative algebras.
*[[Coalgebra]]: This structure has axioms which make its multiplication [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to those of an associative algebra.
**[[Bialgebra]]: These structures are simultaneously algebras and coalgebras whose operations are compatible. There are actually four operations for this structure.

==Algebraic structures with additional non-algebraic structure==
There are many examples of mathematical structures where algebraic structure exists alongside non-algebraic structure.

*[[Topological vector space]]s are vector spaces with a compatible [[topology]].
*[[Lie group]]s: These are topological manifolds that also carry a compatible group structure.
*[[Ordered group]]s, [[ordered ring]]s and [[ordered field]]s have algebraic structure compatible with an [[order theory|order]] on the set.
*[[Von Neumann algebra]]s: these are *-algebras on a [[Hilbert space]] which are equipped with the [[weak operator topology]].

==Algebraic structures in different disciplines==
Some algebraic structures find uses in disciplines outside of abstract algebra. The following is meant to demonstrate some specific applications in other fields.

In [[Physics]]:
*[[Lie group]]s are used extensively in physics. A few well-known ones include the [[orthogonal group]]s and the [[unitary group]]s.
*[[Lie algebra]]s
*[[Inner product space]]s
*[[Kac–Moody algebra]]
*The [[quaternions]] and more generally [[geometric algebra]]s

In [[Mathematical logic]]:
*[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are both rings and lattices, under their two operations.
**[[Heyting algebra]]s are a special example of boolean algebras.
*[[Peano arithmetic]]
*[[Boundary algebra]]

==First rule: the radius ratio rule==

For typical ionic solids, the [[cation]]s are smaller than the [[anion]]s, and each cation is surrounded by [[coordination complex|coordinated]] anions which form a [[polyhedron]]. The sum of the [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] determines the cation-anion distance, while the [[cation-anion radius ratio]] &lt;math&gt;r_+ / r_-&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;r_c / r_a&lt;/math&gt;) determines the [[coordination number]] (C.N.) of the cation, as well as the shape of the coordinated polyhedron of anions.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling (1960) p.524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Housecroft&gt;Housecroft C.E. and Sharpe A.G. ''Inorganic Chemistry'' (2nd ed., Pearson Prentice-Hall 2005) p.145 {{ISBN|0130-39913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the coordination numbers and corresponding polyhedra in the table below, Pauling mathematically derived the ''minimum'' radius ratio for which the cation is in contact with the given number of anions (considering the ions as rigid spheres). If the cation is smaller, it will not be in contact with the anions which results in instability leading to a lower coordination number.

[[Image:Criticalradiusratio.png|thumb|300px|right|''Critical Radius Ratio''. This diagram is for coordination number six: 4 anions in the plane shown, 1 above the plane and 1 below. The stability limit is at r&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.414]]

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Polyhedron and minimum radius ratio for each coordination number
!  C.N.!! Polyhedron !! Radius ratio
|-
| 3 ||[[trigonal planar molecular geometry|triangular]] ||0.155  
|-
| 4 ||[[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedron]] ||0.225  
|-

|-

|}

The three diagrams at right correspond to octahedral coordination with a coordination number of six: four anions in the plane of the diagrams, and two (not shown) above and below this plane. The central diagram shows the minimal radius ratio. The cation and any two anions form a [[right triangle]], with &lt;math&gt;2r_- = \sqrt 2(r_- + r_+)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2 r_- = r_- + r_+&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;r_+ = (\sqrt 2 - 1)r_- = 0.414 r_-&lt;/math&gt;. Similar geometrical proofs yield the minimum radius ratios for the highly symmetrical cases C.N. = 3, 4 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan J. (1994) [[Journal of Chemical Education|J. Chem. Educ.]] 71 (9), 147 (and Erratum p.749) ''A Simple Expression between Critical Radius Ratio and Coordination Numbers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NaCl polyhedra.png|200px|thumb|left|The NaCl crystal structure. Each Na atom has six nearest neighbors, with octahedral geometry.]]

[[Image:CsCl crystal.png|125px|thumb|right|The CsCl unit cell. Each Cs atom has eight nearest neighbors, with cubic geometry.]]

For C.N. = 6 and a radius ratio greater than the minimum, the crystal is more stable since the cation is still in contact with six anions, but the anions are further from each other so that their mutual repulsion is reduced. An octahedron may then form with a radius ratio greater than or equal to .414, but as the ratio rises above .732, a cubic geometry becomes more stable. This explains why Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in NaCl with a radius ratio of 0.55 has octahedral coordination, whereas Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in CsCl with a radius ratio of 0.93 has cubic coordination.&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Petrucci, W.S. Harwood and F.G. Herring, General Chemistry (8th ed., Prentice-Hall 2002) p.518 {{ISBN|0-13-014329-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the radius ratio is less than the minimum, two anions will tend to depart and the remaining four will rearrange into a tetrahedral geometry where they are all in contact with the cation.

The radius ratio rules are a first approximation which have some success in predicting coordination numbers, but many exceptions do exist.&lt;ref name=Housecroft/&gt;

==Second rule: the electrostatic valence rule==

For a given cation, Pauling defined&lt;ref name=Pauling1960/&gt; the ''electrostatic bond strength'' to each coordinated anion as &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{z}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, where z is the cation charge and ν is the cation coordination number. A stable ionic structure is arranged to preserve ''local electroneutrality'', so that the sum of the strengths of the electrostatic bonds to an anion equals the [[electric charge|charge]] on that anion.

:&lt;math&gt; \xi = \sum_{i} s_i &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \xi &lt;/math&gt; is the anion charge and the summation is over the adjacent cations. For simple solids, the &lt;math&gt; s_i &lt;/math&gt; are equal for all cations coordinated to a given anion, so that the anion coordination number is the anion charge divided by each electrostatic bond strength. Some examples are given in the table.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Cations with oxide O&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ion

| Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; || 0.34||4|| 0.25||8
|-
| Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; || 0.47||6||0.33||6
|-
| Sc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ||0.60|| 6||0.5||4
|}

Pauling showed that this rule is useful in limiting the possible structures to consider for more complex crystals such as the [[aluminosilicate]] mineral [[orthoclase]], KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, with three different cations.&lt;ref name=Pauling1960/&gt;

==Third rule: sharing of polyhedron corners, edges and faces==
The sharing of edges and particularly faces by two anion polyhedra decreases the stability of an ionic structure. Sharing of corners does not decrease stability as much, so (for example) octahedra may share corners with one another.&lt;ref name=Pauling559&gt;Pauling (1960) p.559&lt;/ref&gt;

The decrease in stability is due to the fact that sharing edges and faces places cations in closer proximity to each other, so that cation-cation electrostatic repulsion is increased. The effect is largest for cations with high charge and low C.N. (especially when r+/r- approaches the lower limit of the polyhedral stability).

As one example, Pauling considered the three mineral forms of [[titanium dioxide]], each with a coordination number of 6 for the Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations. The most stable (and most abundant) form is [[rutile]], in which the coordination octahedra are arranged so that each one shares only two edges (and no faces) with adjoining octahedra. The other two, less stable, forms are [[brookite]] and [[anatase]], in which each octahedron shares three and four edges respectively with adjoining octahedra.&lt;ref name=Pauling559/&gt;

==Fourth rule: crystals containing different cations==
[[File:Atomic structure of olivine 1.png|thumb|right|Structure of olivine. M (Mg or Fe) = blue spheres, Si = pink tetrahedra, O = red spheres.]]
In a [[crystal]] containing different cations, those of high [[valency (chemistry)|valency]] and small coordination number tend not to share polyhedron elements with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling (1960), p.561&lt;/ref&gt; This rule tends to increase the distance between highly charged cations, so as to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between them.

One of Pauling's examples is [[olivine]], M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where M is a mixture of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at some sites and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at others. The structure contains distinct SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra which do not share any oxygens (at corners, edges or faces) with each other. The lower-valence Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations are surrounded by polyhedra which do share oxygens.

==Fifth rule: the rule of parsimony==
The number of essentially different kinds of constituents in a crystal tends to be small.  The repeating units will tend to be identical because each atom in the structure is most stable in a specific environment.  There may be two or three types of polyhedra, such as tetrahedra or octahedra, but there will not be many different types.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">In [[image processing]] and [[image recognition]], '''pixel connectivity''' is the way in which [[pixels]] in 2-dimensional (or [[voxels]] in 3-dimensional) images relate to their neighbors.

==Types of connectivity==

===2-dimensional===
[[File:Sasiedztwa 4 8.svg|thumb|right|Example of neighborhood of pixels - association of eight and four pixels]]

====4-connected====
4-connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their edges. These pixels are [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] horizontally and vertically. In terms of pixel coordinates, every pixel that has the coordinates

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y\pm1)&lt;/math&gt;

is connected to the pixel at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{See also|Von Neumann neighborhood}}

==== 6-connected ====
6-connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their corners (which includes pixels that touch one of their edges) in a [[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal]] grid or [[stretcher bond]] rectangular grid.

There are several ways to map hexagonal tiles to integer pixel coordinates. With one method, in addition to the 4-connected pixels, the two pixels at coordinates &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x+1,y+1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x-1,y-1)&lt;/math&gt; are connected to the pixel at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

====8-connected====
8-connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their edges or corners. These pixels are connected horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. In addition to 4-connected pixels, each pixel with coordinates &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1,y\pm1)&lt;/math&gt; is connected to the pixel at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{See also|Moore neighborhood}}

===3-dimensional===

====6-connected====
6-connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their faces. These pixels are connected along one of the [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|primary axes]]. Each pixel with coordinates &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y\pm1, z)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y, z\pm1)&lt;/math&gt; is connected to the pixel at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;.

====18-connected====
18-connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their faces or edges. These pixels are connected along either one or two of the primary axes. In addition to 6-connected pixels, each pixel with coordinates &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y\pm1, z)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y\mp1, z)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y, z\pm1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y, z\mp1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y\pm1, z\pm1)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y\pm1, z\mp1)&lt;/math&gt; is connected to the pixel at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;.

====26-connected====
26-connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their faces, edges, or corners. These pixels are connected along either one, two, or all three of the primary axes. In addition to 18-connected pixels, each pixel with coordinates &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y\pm1, z\pm1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y\pm1, z\mp1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\pm1, y\mp1, z\pm1)&lt;/math&gt;,  or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x\mp1, y\pm1, z\pm1)&lt;/math&gt; is connected to the pixel at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15797">In [[graph theory]], '''reachability''' refers to the ability to get from one [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] to another within a graph. A vertex &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; can reach a vertex &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is reachable from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;) if there exists a sequence of [[Glossary of graph theory#Basics|adjacent]] vertices (i.e. a [[Glossary of graph theory#Walks|path]]) which starts with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and ends with &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

In an undirected graph, reachability between all pairs of vertices can be determined by identifying the [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the graph. Any pair of vertices in such a graph can reach each other if and only if they belong to the same connected component. The connected components of an undirected graph can be identified in linear time. The remainder of this article focuses on the more difficult problem of determining pairwise reachability in a [[directed graph]].

== Definition ==
For a directed graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt;, with vertex set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, the reachability [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, which is to say the set of all ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; of vertices in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; for which there exists a sequence of vertices &lt;math&gt;v_0 = s, v_1, v_2, ..., v_k = t&lt;/math&gt; such that the edge &lt;math&gt;(v_{i-1},v_i)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="skiena"&gt;{{citation

 | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]], then its reachability relation is a [[partial order]]; any partial order may be defined in this way, for instance as the reachability relation of its [[transitive reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = Basic Algebra: Groups, Rings, and Fields
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VESm0MJOiDQC&amp;pg=PA17
 | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A noteworthy consequence of this is that since partial orders are anti-symmetric, if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; can reach &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, then we know that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; ''cannot'' reach &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, if we could travel from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and back to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; would contain a cycle, contradicting that it is acyclic.
If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is directed but ''not'' acyclic (i.e. it contains at least one cycle), then its reachability relation will correspond to a [[preorder]] instead of a partial order.

== Algorithms ==
Algorithms for determining reachability fall into two classes: those that require [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]] and those that do not.

If you have only one (or a few) queries to make, it may be more efficient to forgo the use of more complex data structures and compute the reachability of the desired pair directly.  This can be accomplished in [[linear time]] using algorithms such as [[breadth first search]] or [[iterative deepening depth-first search]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | edition = 6th

 | title = Mathematical Structures for Computer Science
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lvAo3AeJikQC&amp;pg=PA519
 | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If you will be making many queries, then a more sophisticated method may be used; the exact choice of method depends on the nature of the graph being analysed. In exchange for preprocessing time and some extra storage space, we can create a data structure which can then answer reachability queries on any pair of vertices in as low as &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.  Three different algorithms and data structures for three different, increasingly specialized situations are outlined below.

can be used to compute the transitive closure of any directed graph, which gives rise to the reachability relation as in the definition, above.

The algorithm requires &lt;math&gt;O(|V|^3)&lt;/math&gt; time and &lt;math&gt;O(|V|^2)&lt;/math&gt; space in the worst case. This algorithm is not solely interested in reachability as it also computes the shortest path distance between all pairs of vertices. For graphs containing negative cycles, shortest paths may be undefined, but reachability between pairs can still be noted.

=== Thorup's Algorithm ===

For [[Planar Graph|planar]] [[Directed graph|digraphs]], a much faster method is available, as described by [[Mikkel Thorup]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

This method can answer reachability queries on a planar graph in
&lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time after spending &lt;math&gt;O(n \log{n})&lt;/math&gt; preprocessing time to create a data
structure of &lt;math&gt;O(n \log{n})&lt;/math&gt; size. This algorithm can also supply approximate
shortest path distances, as well as route information.

The overall approach is to associate with each vertex a relatively small set of
so-called separator paths such that any path from a vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to any other
vertex &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; must go through at least one of the separators associated with &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; or
&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  An outline of the reachability related sections follows.

Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm begins by organizing the vertices into layers starting from an
arbitrary vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The layers are built in alternating steps by first
considering all vertices reachable ''from'' the previous step (starting with
just &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;) and then all vertices which reach ''to'' the previous step until
all vertices have been assigned to a layer. By construction of the layers, every
vertex appears at most two layers, and every [[Path (graph theory)#Different types of paths|directed path]], or dipath, in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is contained within
two adjacent layers &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be the last layer created, that
is, the lowest value for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i=0}^{k} = V&lt;/math&gt;.

The graph is then re-expressed as a series of digraphs &lt;math&gt;G_0, G_1, \ldots,
G_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;G_i = r_i \cup L_i \cup L_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the
contraction of all previous levels &lt;math&gt;L_0 \ldots L_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; into a single vertex.
Because every dipath appears in at most two consecutive layers, and because
each &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; is formed by two consecutive layers, every dipath in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; appears in
its entirety in at least one &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; (and no more than 2 consecutive such graphs)

For each &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt;, three separators are identified which, when removed, break the
graph into three components which each contain at most &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; the vertices of the
original. As &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; is built from two layers of opposed dipaths, each separator
may consist of up to 2 dipaths, for a total of up to 6 dipaths over all of the
separators. Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be this set of dipaths. The proof that such separators can always be
found is related to the [[Planar Separator Theorem]] of Lipton and Tarjan, and these
separators can be located in linear time.

For each &lt;math&gt;Q \in S&lt;/math&gt;, the directed nature of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; provides for a natural indexing
of its vertices from the start to the end of the path. For each vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
in &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt;, we locate the first vertex in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; reachable by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and the last
vertex in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; that reaches to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, we are looking at how early into &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; we can get from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and how far
we can stay in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and still get back to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This information is stored with
each &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any pair of vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; can reach &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; ''via'' &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; connects to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; earlier than &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; connects from &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Every vertex is labelled as above for each step of the recursion which builds
&lt;math&gt;G_0 \ldots, G_k&lt;/math&gt;. As this recursion has logarithmic depth, a total of
&lt;math&gt;O(\log{n})&lt;/math&gt; extra information is stored per vertex. From this point, a
logarithmic time query for reachability is as simple as looking over each pair
of labels for a common, suitable &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. The original paper then works to tune the
query time down to &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

In summarizing the analysis of this method, first consider that the layering
approach partitions the vertices so that each vertex is considered only &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;
times. The separator phase of the algorithm breaks the graph into components
which are at most &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; the size of the original graph, resulting in a
logarithmic recursion depth.  At each level of the recursion, only linear work
is needed to identify the separators as well as the connections possible between
vertices. The overall result is &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; preprocessing time with only
&lt;math&gt;O(\log{n})&lt;/math&gt; additional information stored for each vertex.

=== Kameda's Algorithm ===

[[File:Graph suitable for Kameda's method.svg|thumb|right|200px|A suitable digraph for Kameda's method with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; added.]]

[[File:Kameda's algorithm run.svg|thumb|right|200px|The same graph as above after Kameda's algorithm has run, showing the DFS labels for each vertex]]

An even faster method for pre-processing, due to T. Kameda in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

can be used if the graph is [[Planar graph|planar]], [[Directed acyclic graph|acyclic]], and also exhibits the following additional properties: all 0-[[Directed graph#Indegree and outdegree|indegree]] and all 0-[[Directed graph#Indegree and outdegree|outdegree]] vertices appear on the same [[Glossary of graph theory#Genus|face]] (often assumed to be the outer face), and it is possible to partition the boundary of that face into two parts such that all 0-indegree vertices appear on one part, and all
0-outdegree vertices appear on the other (i.e. the two types of vertices do not alternate).

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; exhibits these properties, then we can preprocess the graph in only
&lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time, and store only &lt;math&gt;O(\log{n})&lt;/math&gt; extra bits per vertex, answering
reachability queries for any pair of vertices in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time with a simple
comparison.

Preprocessing performs the following steps. We add a new vertex &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; which has an edge to each 0-indegree vertex, and another new vertex &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with edges from each 0-outdegree vertex. Note that the properties of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; allow us to do so while maintaining planarity, that is, there will still be no edge crossings after these additions. For each vertex we store the list of adjacencies (out-edges) in order of the planarity of the graph (for example, clockwise with respect to the graph's embedding). We then initialize a counter &lt;math&gt;i = n + 1&lt;/math&gt; and begin a Depth-First Traversal from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. During this traversal, the adjacency list of each vertex is visited from left-to-right as needed.  As vertices are popped from the traversal's stack, they are labelled with the value &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is then decremented. Note that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is always labelled with the value &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is always labelled with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  The depth-first traversal is then repeated, but this time the adjacency list of each vertex is visited from right-to-left.

When completed, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and their incident edges, are removed. Each
remaining vertex stores a 2-dimensional label with values from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
Given two vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and their labels &lt;math&gt;L(u) = (a_1, a_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(v) =(b_1, b_2)&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;L(u) &lt; L(v)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a_1 \leq b_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2 \leq
b_2&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists at least one component &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; which is strictly
less than &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

The main result of this method then states that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is reachable from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; if and
only if &lt;math&gt;L(u) &lt; L(v)&lt;/math&gt;, which is easily calculated in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.

== Related problems ==

A related problem is to solve reachability queries with some number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of vertex failures. For example: "Can vertex &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; still reach vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; even though vertices &lt;math&gt;s_1, s_2, ..., s_k&lt;/math&gt; have failed and can no longer be used?" A similar problem may consider edge failures rather than vertex failures, or a mix of the two. The breadth-first search technique works just as well on such queries, but constructing an efficient oracle is more challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Another problem related to reachability queries is in quickly recalculating changes to reachability relationships when some portion of the graph is changed. For example, this is a relevant concern to [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] which needs to balance the reclamation of memory (so that it may be reallocated) with the performance concerns of the running application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4701">'''SQLf''' is a [[SQL]] extended with [[Fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] application for expressing flexible ([[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]]) queries to traditional (or ″Regular″) Relational Databases. Among the known extensions proposed to SQL, at the present time, this is the most complete, because it allows the use of diverse fuzzy elements in all the constructions of the language SQL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=SQLf: a relational database language for fuzzy querying|journal=IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems|date=1995|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1109/91.366566|issn=1063-6706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=Knowledge Management in Fuzzy Databases|date=2000|publisher=Physica-Verlag HD|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-7908-1865-9|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQLf is the only known proposal of flexible query system allowing linguistic quantification over set of rows in queries, achieved through the extension of SQL nesting and partitioning structures with fuzzy quantifiers. It also allows the use of quantifiers to qualify the quantity of search criteria satisfied by single rows. Several mechanisms are proposed for query evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=SQLf Query Functionality on Top of a Regular Relational Database Management System|date=2000|pages=171–190|doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-1865-9_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most important being the one based on the derivation principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=On the efficiency of the alpha-cut distribution method to evaluate simple fuzzy relational queries|journal=World Scientific Publishing|date=1995|pages=251–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consists in deriving classic queries that produce, given a threshold ''t'', a ''t''-cut of the result of the fuzzy query, so that the additional processing cost of using a fuzzy language is diminished.

== Basic block ==
The fundamental querying structure of SQLf is the multi-relational block. The conception of this structure is based on the three basic operations of the [[relational algebra]]: [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]], [[cartesian product]] and [[Selection (relational algebra)|selection]], and the application of fuzzy sets’ concepts. The result of a SQLf query is a fuzzy set of rows that is a fuzzy relation instead of a regular relation.
A basic block in SQLf consists of a &lt;code&gt;[[Select (SQL)|SELECT]]&lt;/code&gt; clause, a &lt;code&gt;[[From (SQL)|FROM]]&lt;/code&gt; clause and an optional &lt;code&gt;[[Where (SQL)|WHERE]]&lt;/code&gt; clause. The semantic of this query structure is:
* The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the projection. It specifies the relations’ attributes (or attribute expressions) that will be selected. The resulting table is a fuzzy set and it is given in decreasing ordered of satisfaction degree. 
* The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause specifies also a calibration that is intended to restrict the set of rows retrieved. There are two kinds of calibrations: quantitative and qualitative. In quantitative calibration the user specifies the number of results to be retrieved, so that the query will retrieve the rows with highest membership degrees up to the number of required answers. In qualitative calibration the user specifies a minim level of satisfaction that must have any retrieved row.
* The &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the Cartesian Product. The consult is made on the Cartesian Product of the relations that are specified in this clause. 
* The &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the selection. It specifies the condition for which the satisfaction degree will be calculated. Rows that do not satisfy at all the condition are rejected. This condition is a fuzzy predicate that may involve any attribute of the relations.

The following is an example of a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; query that returns a list of hotels that are cheap. The query retrieves all rows from the ''Hotels'' table that satisfice the fuzzy predicate ''cheap'' defined by the fuzzy set &lt;big&gt;μ&lt;/big&gt;=({{math|∞|size=100%}}, {{math|∞|size=100%}}, 25, 30). The result is sorted in descending order by the membership degree of the query.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT name, address
  FROM  Hotels
  WHERE price = cheap;
&lt;/source&gt;

for ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, where π(''x'') denotes the [[prime-counting function]], giving the number of prime numbers up to and including ''x''.

This means that the number of primes from ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' is always less than or equal to the number of primes from 1 to&amp;nbsp;''y''. This was proved to be inconsistent with the [[first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture]] on prime ''k''-tuples, and the first violation is expected to likely occur for very large values of ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Douglas | last=Hensley | first2=Ian | last2=Richards | title=Primes in intervals | journal=Acta Arith. | volume=25 | issue=1973/74 | pages=375–391 | mr=396440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ian | last=Richards | title=On the Incompatibility of Two Conjectures Concerning Primes | journal=Bull.

A '''shop drawing''' is a drawing or set of drawings produced by the [[General contractor|contractor]], [[Distributor (business)|supplier]], [[manufacturer]], [[subcontractor]], or [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricator]].&lt;ref name=shopdrawing/&gt; Shop drawings are typically required for [[prefabricate]]d components. Examples of these include: elevators, structural steel, trusses, pre-cast concrete, windows, appliances, cabinets, air handling units, and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. Also critical are the installation and coordination shop drawings of the [[Architectural engineering#Mechanical.2C Electrical and Plumbing .28MEP.29|MEP]] trades such as sheet metal ductwork, piping, plumbing, fire protection, and electrical. Shop drawings are produced by [[contractors]] and [[suppliers]] under their contract with the owner. The shop drawing is the manufacturer’s or the contractor’s drawn version of information shown in the construction documents.&lt;ref name=shopdrawing/&gt; The shop drawing normally shows more detail than the construction documents. It is drawn to explain the fabrication and/or installation of the items to the manufacturer’s production crew or contractor's installation crews. The style of the shop drawing is usually very different from that of the architect’s drawing. The shop drawing’s primary emphasis is on the particular product or installation and excludes [[notation]] concerning other products and installations, unless integration with the subject product is necessary.&lt;ref name=shopdrawing&gt;{{cite journal |author = R Pietroforte |title = Construction Management &amp; Economics |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1997 |url = http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/NK64AXLX9821K3M4.pdf | format =  [[PDF]] |accessdate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information required to be included in Shop Drawings==

===Comparison information for the architect and engineer===
The shop drawings should include information for the architect and engineer to compare to the [[specifications]] and [[drawings]]. The shop drawing should address the appearance, [[performance]], and [[prescriptive]] descriptions in the specifications and construction drawings.&lt;ref name = information&gt;{{cite journal |author1=RM Crowder |author2=W Hall |author3=I Heath |author4=R Bernard |author5=D Gaskell |title= A hypermedia maintenance information system |version= |publisher= Computing &amp; Control Engineering Journal |year= 1996 |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=503166 |accessdate= 2007-02-23 |doi= 10.1049/ccej:19960305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shop drawing often is more detailed than the information shown in the construction documents to give the architect and engineer the opportunity to review the [[fabricator’s version]] of the product, prior to fabrication. References to the construction documents, drawings, and specifications assist the architect and engineer in their review of the shop drawings. Attachment of manufacturer’s material specifications, “catalog cut sheets,” and other manufacturer’s information may be helpful to accompany these drawings. Because shop drawings facilitate the architect’s and engineer’s approval of the product, they should be as clear and complete as possible.

===Notes of changes or alterations from the construction documents===
Notes concerning changes or differences from the original documents should be made on the shop drawing for the architect’s and engineer’s approval. Ultimately, they are responsible for changes in these drawings and should have the opportunity to analyze any modifications. A dialogue should occur between the fabricator and the architect and engineer about any areas needing clarification. Successful installations are the result of collaboration between the [[designer]], fabricator, and contractor.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Information needed to fabricate the product===
Dimensions, manufacturing conventions, and special fabrication instructions should be included on the shop drawing. It should be clear to fabrication personnel what will be manufactured from the shop drawings alone. The construction documents are rarely used as a reference in fabrication, with the fabricators relying on the shop drawing for all information.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Indication of dimensions needing verification from the jobsite===
Most jobsite dimensions, such as the dimensions between two surfaces on the jobsite, need to be verified. A dimension may be shown on the construction drawings, but the actual dimension may vary, from very small to large increments, depending on jobsite conditions. It is extremely important that the fabricated item arrive on the jobsite ready to be installed without field modification. Special care must be taken by the contractor to measure and verify dimensions. In new construction, plan dimensions usually are sufficient for ordering many fabricated items such as [[structural steel]] or [[precast concrete]].&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

In [[remodeling]] and [[renovation]] work, it is essential that field dimensions be verified prior to fabrication. Some fabricators, such as [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] and casework suppliers, prefer not to rely on the contractor’s verification and will verify the dimensions with their own personnel.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Placement or installation information===
Some fabricators and manufacturers will provide symbols, data, or instructions concerning installation. This can include a list of other materials, such as [[fastener]]s or [[adhesive]]s, appropriate but not included for the product.

Third party review may be required for major building systems. An example of this would be a commercial chiller which would be furnished by the mechanical contractor, but would require electrical connections, plumbing, rigging, insulation and commissioning. Various third parties will need to review the installation information and confirm they are furnishing compatible equipment and proper layout of services. Review of installation information for major equipment should be reviewed with field supervisors including the project superintendent, trade foremen and field engineer. Installation of major equipment will dictate structural clearances and temporary openings.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Samples===
Some fabrications will require a [[sample submittal]] with the shop drawing, primarily for [[color]] and [[wikt:texture|texture]] selection of finishes.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Computer-aided Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Design Coordination===
Problems with design coordination, such as time consumption and ineffectiveness related to the current 2D paper-based process, are some of the top concerns of a general contractor, since late conflict correction increases the potential for errors in the field. In order to address this issue, there have been an increasing number of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) firms utilizing building information models (BIM) in their coordination and clash detection processes, which according to practitioners, allows for increased coordination and fewer field problems. Leite et al.&lt;ref&gt;Leite, F.; Akinci, B.; Garrett, J. (2009) Identification of data items needed for automatic clash detection in MEP design coordination. In: Proceedings of the 2009 Construction Research Congress, Seattle, WA.&lt;/ref&gt; compared types of clashes identified in a manual coordination process (overlay of 2D drawings on a light table by pairs of subcontractors) and through automatic clash detection using a [[Building information modeling|Building Information Model]] (BIM). The automatic clash detection identified several clashes that were missed by the subcontractors, who were performing this task manually. Also, the manual clash detection identified clashes which could not possibly be found by the automatic clash detection software, since one of the clashing objects (e.g. cable trays) was not modeled in the BIM. This study also included site observations of field detected clashes, some of which were not identified in either manual or automatic processes. Leite noted that the combination of clashes identified in coordination meetings, those automatically detected, as well as those identified in the field enable identification of objects that need to be modeled in order to capture the largest possible number of clashes. This paper was limited to the comparison of types of clashes identified in each of the three methods during a specific project. Although their results cannot be generalized, they still provide insight towards the need to identify what needs to be modeled in a BIM for MEP coordination prior to the start of the coordination process.

==Reviews==
Because writing comments on eight to ten copies is a tedious process and an inefficient use of the architect and engineer's time, they will frequently specify other 
methods for distributing comments. Quick review is essential during the approval process.&lt;ref name=reviews&gt;{{cite journal |author1= S Shahid |author2= T Froese |title= Project Management Information Control Systems |publisher= Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |year= 1998 |url= http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;journal=cjce&amp;volume=25&amp;calyLang=fra&amp;articleFile=l98-012.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-02-23 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20061028115230/http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/rpviewdoc?_handler_=handleinitialget&amp;journal=cjce&amp;volume=25&amp;calylang=fra&amp;articlefile=l98-012.pdf |archivedate= 2006-10-28 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any method that facilitates this, while providing ample opportunity for comment and complete distribution, should be considered. Although a procedure may be specified in the contract drawings, most architects and engineers are open to suggestions and innovations that speed up the process.

===Number of copies===
Shop drawings are required, in various forms, depending upon the practice of the 
architect and engineer. A specific number of copies may be required by the 
specification. An example distribution of the completed and corrected shop 
drawings may include the:

*Owner—file or inspection copy
*Architect—file copy
*Architect—field copy or inspection copy
*Consulting engineer—file copy
*Consulting engineer—inspection copy
*Contractor—file copy
*Contractor—field copy
*Supplier—original copy or one copy

===Submittal of one or two copies of the shop drawing===
Corrections are made by the architect and engineer, and the shop drawing is corrected by the supplier, then the appropriate number of copies is distributed. This method can be time consuming, as the shop drawing is not approved until the corrections are made on it.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;

===Submittal of a copy that can be reproduced ===
The architect and engineer make comments on the reproducible, then copies are distributed. This method facilitates the timely approval and distribution of the shop drawing. Review comments usually are obvious on the reproducible copy. When [[sepia tone|sepia]] copies are used, 
the reproduction of the sepia often is not as clear as a normal blue-line print.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;

===Compatible CAD software===
When the supplier and designer have compatible [[CAD software]] or when universal file formats such as [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]], [[PDF]] or [[DWG]] are utilized, the review can be made from a CD, [[email]] or [[FTP]] transfer. Comments can be made by the designer in a bold font or changes can be boxed for emphasis.

Popular CAD platforms used for generating shop drawings are [[Advance Steel]], [[AutoCAD]], [[Revit]], [[CATIA]], [[Creo Elements/Pro]], [[Autodesk Inventor|Inventor]], [[Solidworks]] and [[Tekla Structures]].

==Shop drawings in concrete reinforcing==
Concrete reinforcing is one of the many items requiring specialized shop drawings for the fabrication of the material. Concrete reinforcing is custom-fabricated from 60-foot-long [[reinforcing bar]]s.&lt;ref name = concrete&gt;{{cite journal |author= VKR Kodur |title= Performance-based fire resistance design of concrete-filled steel columns |publisher= Journal of Constructional Steel Research |year= 1999 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143974X99000036 |accessdate= 2007-02-23 |doi=10.1016/S0143-974X(99)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reinforcing bars are cut to length and bent to specific configurations. The shop drawing and the accompanying “cut sheet” lists the quantity, sizes, lengths, and shapes of the reinforcing bar.&lt;ref name = concrete/&gt; This information is provided for review by the [[structural engineer]] to ensure that sufficient reinforcing is being supplied; fabrication of the bar by the supplier’s shop; an [[inventory]] list for the contractor, upon delivery the typical project has thousands of pieces of reinforcing steel that need to be organized for storage and installation; and placement by the ironworker. The [[Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute]] (CRSI) has developed standard symbols, graphics, and formats for shop drawings and cut sheets that generally are used by reinforcing steel fabricators.&lt;ref name = concrete/&gt; Each fabricator, has particular style for shop drawings and cut sheets, depending on the draftspeople and [[Computer-aided design]] systems. Examples of software used are [[Advance Concrete]], [[AutoCAD]], [[MicroStation]], ProConcrete and [[Tekla Structures]].

'''Sir Jonathan Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (23 September 1783 – 28 August 1870) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] lawyer and [[Tory]] politician.

==Background and education==
Pollock was the son of David Pollock, of [[Charing Cross]], [[London]], and the elder brother of Field Marshal [[Sir George Pollock, 1st Baronet]]. He was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PLK802JF|name=Pollock, Jonathan Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Senior Wrangler]] at [[Cambridge University]]. He is also thought to be one of the founding members of the [[Cambridge Union Society]], along with [[Henry Bickersteth]] and [[Edward Hall Alderson|Sir Edward Hall Alderson]], both of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]].

==Political, legal and mathematical careers==
Pollock was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1831 to 1844. He served as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] between 1834 and 1835 and 1841 and 1844 in the [[Tory]] administrations of [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]]. In 1841 he was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and appointed [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], a post he held until 1868. Having been [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] on 29 December 1834,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=19237 |date=6 February 1935 |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock was created a '''Baronet''', of [[Hatton, London|Hatton]] in the [[County of Middlesex]], on 2 August 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23143 |date=24 July 1866 |page=4164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his political and legal career Pollock was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1816.  He contributed a number of papers in mathematics to the [[Royal Society]], including one on what is now known as the [[Pollock's conjecture]].

==Family==
Pollock died in August 1870, aged 86, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, William. His fourth son, [[Charles Edward Pollock]], apprenticed to his father, had no university education. He became a law reporter then co-serving [[Baron of the Court of Exchequer]], becoming the last in that appeal court.

Two of Pollock's grandsons became prominent lawyers: [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet]] (d.1937), was Professor of Jurisprudence at the [[University of Oxford]]; [[Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth]] (d.1936), served as [[Master of the Rolls]].

{{about|cuts that form complete bipartite graphs|graphs that can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set|split graph}}
In [[graph theory]], a '''split''' of an [[undirected graph]] is a [[Cut (graph theory)|cut]] whose cut-set forms a [[complete bipartite graph]]. A graph is '''prime''' if it has no splits. The splits of a graph can be collected into a tree-like structure called the '''split decomposition''' or '''join decomposition''', which can be constructed in linear time. This decomposition has been used for fast recognition of [[circle graph]]s and [[distance-hereditary graph]]s, as well as for other problems in graph algorithms.

Splits and split decompositions were first introduced by {{harvtxt|Cunningham|1982}}, who also studied variants of the same notions  for [[directed graph]]s.&lt;ref name="c82"&gt;{{citation

==Definitions==
A [[Cut (graph theory)|cut]] of an undirected graph is a partition of the vertices into two nonempty subsets, the sides of the cut. The subset of edges that have one endpoint in each side is called a cut-set. When a cut-set forms a [[complete bipartite graph]], its cut is called a split. Thus, a split can be described as a partition of the vertices of the graph into two subsets {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}}, such that every neighbor of {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|Y}} is adjacent to every neighbor of {{mvar|Y}} in {{mvar|X}}.&lt;ref name="ltsdr"&gt;{{citation

A cut or split is trivial when one of its two sides has only one vertex in it; every trivial cut is a split. A graph is said to be prime (with respect to splits) if it has no nontrivial splits.&lt;ref name="ltsdr"/&gt;

Two splits are said to cross if each side of one split has a non-empty intersection with each side of the other split. A split is called strong when it is not crossed by any other split. As a special case, every trivial split is strong. The strong splits of a graph give rise to a structure called the split decomposition or join decomposition of the graph. This decomposition can be represented by a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] whose leaves correspond one-to-one with the given graph, and whose edges correspond one-to-one with the strong splits of the graph, such that the partition of leaves formed by removing any edge from the tree is the same as the partition of vertices given by the associated strong split.&lt;ref name="ltsdr"/&gt;

Each internal node {{mvar|i}} of the split decomposition tree of a graph {{mvar|G}} is associated with a graph {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, called the quotient graph for node&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|i}}. The quotient graph can be formed by deleting {{mvar|i}} from the tree, forming subsets of vertices in {{mvar|G}} corresponding to the leaves in each of the resulting subtrees, and collapsing each of these vertex sets into a single vertex. Every quotient graph has one of three forms: it may be a prime graph, a [[complete graph]], or a [[star (graph theory)|star]].&lt;ref name="ltsdr"/&gt;

A graph may have exponentially many different splits, but they are all represented in the split decomposition tree, either as an edge of the tree (for a strong split) or as an arbitrary partition of a complete or star quotient graph (for a split that is not strong).&lt;ref name="ltsdr"/&gt;

==Examples==
In a [[complete graph]] or [[complete bipartite graph]], every cut is a split.

In a [[cycle graph]] of length four, the partition of the vertices given by [[graph coloring|2-coloring]] the cycle is a nontrivial split, but for cycles of any longer length there are no nontrivial splits.

A [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridge]] of a graph that is not [[k-edge-connected graph|2-edge-connected]] corresponds to a split, with each side of the split formed by the vertices on one side of the bridge. The cut-set of the split is just the single bridge edge, which is a special case of a complete bipartite subgraph. Similarly, if {{mvar|v}} is an [[articulation point]] of a graph that is not [[k-vertex-connected graph|2-vertex-connected]], then the graph has multiple splits in which {{mvar|v}} and some but not all of the components formed by its deletion are on one side, and the remaining components are on the other side. In these examples, the cut-set of the split forms a [[star (graph theory)|star]].

==Algorithms==

==Applications==
Split decomposition has been applied in the recognition of several important graph classes:
*A [[distance-hereditary graph]] is a graph whose split decomposition contains no prime quotients. Based on this characterization, it is possible to use the split decomposition to recognize distance-hereditary graphs in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

*A [[circle graph]] is the intersection graph of a family of chords of a circle. A given graph is a circle graph if and only if each of the quotients of its split decomposition is a circle graph, so testing whether a graph is a circle graph can be reduced to the same problem on the prime quotient graphs of the graph. More, when a circle graph is prime, the combinatorial structure of the set of chords representing it is uniquely determined, which simplifies the task of recognizing this structure. Based on these ideas, it is possible to recognize circle graphs in polynomial time.&lt;ref name="gsh"/&gt;

Split decomposition has also been used to simplify the solution of some problems that are NP-hard on arbitrary graphs:&lt;ref name="r08"&gt;{{citation

 | title = Solving some NP-complete problems using split decomposition
 | volume = 156
 | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*As {{harvtxt|Cunningham|1982}} already observed, the maximum independent set of any graph may be found by a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm on a bottom-up traversal of its split decomposition tree. At each node we choose the maximum weight independent set on its quotient graph, weighted by the sizes of the independent sets already computed at child nodes.&lt;ref name="c82"/&gt;
*Although another algorithm given by {{harvtxt|Cunningham|1982}} is flawed, a similar bottom-up traversal can be used to compute the [[maximum clique]] of a graph by combining computations of weighted maximum cliques in its quotient graphs.&lt;ref name="r08"/&gt;
*{{harvtxt|Rao|2008}} also presents algorithms for connected [[dominating set]]s, complete dominating sets, and [[graph coloring]].&lt;ref name="r08"/&gt;
These methods can lead to polynomial time algorithms for graphs in which each quotient graph has a simple structure that allows its subproblem to be computed efficiently. For instance, this is true of the graphs in which each quotient graph has constant size.&lt;ref name="r08"/&gt;

In [[polyhedral combinatorics]], a branch of mathematics, '''Steinitz's theorem''' is a characterization of the [[undirected graph]]s formed by the edges and vertices of three-dimensional [[convex polyhedron|convex polyhedra]]: they are exactly the ([[simple graph|simple]]) [[vertex connectivity|3-vertex-connected]] [[planar graph]]s (with at least four 
vertices). That is, every convex polyhedron forms a 3-connected planar graph, and every 3-connected planar graph can be represented as the graph of a convex polyhedron. For this reason, the 3-connected planar graphs are also known as [[polyhedral graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld | urlname = PolyhedralGraph | title = Polyhedral graph}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Branko Grünbaum]] has called this theorem “the most important and deepest known result on [[3-polytope]]s.”&lt;ref name="grun"/&gt;

The theorem appears in a 1922 paper of [[Ernst Steinitz]], after whom it is named. It can be proven by [[mathematical induction]] (as Steinitz did), by finding the minimum-energy state of a two-dimensional spring system into three dimensions, or by using the [[circle packing theorem]].
Several extensions of the theorem are known, in which the polyhedron that realizes a given graph has additional constraints; for instance, every polyhedral graph is the graph of a convex polyhedron with integer coordinates, or the graph of a convex polyhedron all of whose edges are tangent to a common [[midsphere]].

In higher dimensions, the problem of characterizing the graphs of [[convex polytope]]s remains open.

==Definitions and statement of the theorem==
[[File:Schegel diagram as shadow.png|thumb|Illuminating the skeleton of a convex polyhedron from a light source close to one of its faces causes its shadows to form a planar [[Schlegel diagram]].]]
An [[undirected graph]] is a system of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and [[edge (graph theory)|edges]], each edge connecting two of the vertices. From any polyhedron one can form a graph, by letting the vertices of the graph correspond to the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the polyhedron and by connecting any two graph vertices by an edge whenever the corresponding two polyhedron vertices are the endpoints of an edge of the polyhedron. This graph is known as the [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of the polyhedron.

A graph is [[planar graph|planar]] if it can be drawn with its vertices as points in the [[Euclidean plane]], and its edges as curves that connect these points, such that no two edge curves cross each other and such that the point representing a vertex lies on the curve representing an edge only when the vertex is an endpoint of the edge. By [[Fáry's theorem]], it is sufficient to consider only planar drawings in which the curves representing the edges are [[line segment]]s. A graph is [[vertex connectivity|3-connected]] if, after the removal of any two of its vertices, any other pair of vertices remain connected by a path.
Steinitz's theorem states that these two conditions are both [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient]] to characterize the skeletons of three-dimensional convex polyhedra: a given graph {{mvar|G}} is the graph of a convex three-dimensional polyhedron, if and only if {{mvar|G}} is planar and 3-vertex-connected.&lt;ref name="lop"&gt;''Lectures on Polytopes'', by [[Günter M. Ziegler]] (1995) {{isbn|0-387-94365-X}} , Chapter 4 "Steinitz' Theorem for 3-Polytopes", p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grun&gt;[[Branko Grünbaum]], ''Convex Polytopes'', 2nd edition, prepared by Volker Kaibel, [[Victor Klee]], and [[Günter M. Ziegler]], 2003, {{isbn|0-387-40409-0}}, {{isbn|978-0-387-40409-7}}, 466pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and naming==
Steinitz's theorem is named after [[Ernst Steinitz]], who submitted its first proof for publication in 1916.&lt;ref name="steinitz"&gt;{{citation|first=Ernst|last=Steinitz|authorlink=Ernst Steinitz|contribution=Polyeder und Raumeinteilungen|title=[[Klein's encyclopedia|Encyclopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften]], Band 3 (Geometries)|year=1922|quote=Abgeschlossen am 31.

The name "Steinitz's theorem" has also been applied to other results of Steinitz:

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs==
One direction of Steinitz's theorem (the easier direction to prove) states that the graph of every convex polyhedron is planar and 3-connected. As shown in the illustration, planarity can be shown by using a [[Schlegel diagram]]: if one places a light source near one face of the polyhedron, and a plane on the other side, the shadows of the polyhedron edges will form a planar graph, embedded in such a way that the edges are straight line segments. The 3-connectivity of a polyhedral graph is a special case of [[Balinski's theorem]] that the graph of any ''k''-dimensional [[convex polytope]] is ''k''-connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The other, more difficult, direction of Steinitz's theorem states that every planar 3-connected graph is the graph of a convex polyhedron. There are three standard approaches for this part: proofs by induction, lifting two-dimensional [[Tutte embedding]]s into three dimensions using the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, and methods using the [[circle packing theorem]] to generate a [[midsphere|canonical polyhedron]].

===Induction===
[[File:Polyhedral Delta-Y.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms of a polyhedron]]
Steinitz' original proof involved finding a sequence of [[Y-Δ transform|Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms]] that reduce any 3-connected planar graph to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the graph of the tetrahedron. A Y-Δ transform removes a degree-three vertex from a graph, adding edges between all of its former neighbors if those edges did not already exist; the reverse transformation, a Δ-Y transform, removes the edges of a triangle from a graph and replaces them by a new degree-three vertex adjacent to the same three vertices. Once such a sequence is found, it can be reversed to give a sequence of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms that build up the desired polyhedron step by step starting from a polyhedron. Each Y-Δ transform in this sequence can be performed by slicing off a degree-three vertex from a polyhedron. A Δ-Y transform can be performed by removing a triangular face from a polyhedron and extending its neighboring faces until the point where they meet, but only when that triple intersection point of the three neighboring faces is on the correct side of the polyhedron; when the triple intersection point is not on the correct side, a [[projective transformation]] of the polyhedron suffices to move it to the correct side. Therefore, by induction on the number of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms needed to reduce a given graph to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, every polyhedral graph can be realized as a polyhedron.&lt;ref name="steinitz"/&gt;

A later work by Epifanov strengthened Steinitz's proof that every polyhedral graph can be reduced to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms. Epifanov proved that if two vertices are specified in a planar graph, then the graph can be reduced to a single edge between those terminals by combining Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms with [[series-parallel graph|series-parallel reductions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Truemper observed that every [[grid graph]] is reducible by Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms in this way, that this reducibility is preserved by graph minors, and that every planar graph is a minor of a grid graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

More precisely, ''&amp;Omega;''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) steps are sometimes necessary, and the best known [[upper bound]] on the number of steps is even worse, ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Electrical reduction, homotopy moves, and defect|first1=Hsien-Chih|last1=Chang|first2=Jeff|last2=Erickson|date=September 27, 2015|url=http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/pubs/defect.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative form of induction proof is based on removing edges (and compressing out the degree-two vertices that might be performed by this removal) or contracting edges and forming a minor of the given planar graph. Any polyhedral graph can be reduced to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by a linear number of these operations, and again the operations can be reversed and the reversed operations performed geometrically, giving a polyhedral realization of the graph. However, while it is simpler to prove that a reduction sequence exists for this type of argument, and the reduction sequences are shorter, the geometric steps needed to reverse the sequence are more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Lifting===
[[File:Equilibrium stress.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|An equilibrium stress on the graph of a cube, corresponding to a lift of this drawing to a three-dimensional [[frustum]]]]
If a graph is [[graph drawing|drawn]] in the plane with straight line edges, then an equilibrium stress is defined as an assignment of nonzero real numbers (weights) to the edges, with the property that each vertex is in the position given by the weighted sum of its neighbors. According to the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, an equilibrium stress can be lifted to a piecewise linear continuous three-dimensional surface such that the edges forming the boundaries between the flat parts of the surface project to the given drawing. The weight and length of each edge determines the difference in slopes of the surface on either side of the edge, and the condition that each vertex is in equilibrium with its neighbors is equivalent to the condition that these slope differences cause the surface to meet up with itself correctly in the neighborhood of the vertex. Positive weights translate to convex dihedral angles between two faces of the piecewise linear surface, and negative weights translate to concave dihedral angles. Conversely, every continuous piecewise-linear surface comes from an equilibrium stress in this way. If a finite planar graph is drawn and given an equilibrium stress in such a way that all interior edges of the drawing have positive weights, and all exterior edges have negative weights, then by translating this stress into a three-dimensional surface in this way, and then replacing the flat surface representing the exterior of the graph by its complement in the same plane, one obtains a convex poyhedron, with the additional property that its perpendicular projection onto the plane has no crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Maxwell–Cremona correspondence has been used to obtain polyhedral realizations of polyhedral graphs by combining it with a planar [[graph drawing]] method of [[W. T. Tutte]], the [[Tutte embedding]]. Tutte's method begins by fixing one face of a polyhedral graph into [[convex position]] in the plane. This face will become the outer face of a drawing of a graph. The method continues by setting up a system of linear equations in the vertex coordinates, according to which each remaining vertex should be placed at the average of its neighbors. Then as Tutte showed, this system of equations will have a unique solution in which each face of the graph is drawn as a convex polygon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s3-13.1.743}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is almost an equilibrium stress: if one assigns weight one to each interior edge, then each interior vertex of the drawing is in equilibrium. However, it is not always possible to assign negative numbers to the exterior edges so that they, too, are in equilibrium.
Such an assignment is always possible when the outer face is a triangle, and so this method can be used to realize any polyhedral graph that has a triangular face.
If a polyhedral graph does not contain a triangular face, its [[dual graph]] does contain a triangle and is also polyhedral, so one can realize the dual in this way and then realize the original graph as the [[Dual polyhedron#Polar reciprocation|polar polyhedron]] of the dual realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Circle packing===
[[File:Midsphere.png|thumb|A polyhedron realized from a circle packing. The circles representing the vertices of the polyhedron are their horizons on the sphere, and the circles representing the faces (dual vertices) are the intersections of the sphere with the face planes.]]
According to one variant of the [[circle packing theorem]], for every polyhedral graph and its [[dual graph]], there exists a system of circles in the plane or on any sphere,
representing the vertices of both graphs, so that two adjacent vertices in the same graph are represented by [[tangent circles]], a primal and dual vertex that represent a vertex and face that touch each other are represented by orthogonal circles, and all remaining pairs of circles are disjoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 214–229
 | title = Representations of planar graphs
 | volume = 6
 | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From such a representation on a sphere, one can find a polyhedral realization of the given graph as the intersection of a collection of halfspaces, one for each circle that represents a dual vertex, with the boundary of the halfspace containing the circle. Alternatively and equivalently, one can find the same polyhedron as the [[convex hull]] of a collection of points (its vertices), such that the horizon seen when viewing the sphere from any vertex equals the circle that corresponds to that vertex. The sphere becomes the [[midsphere]] of the realization: each edge of the polyhedron is tangent to it, at the point where two tangent primal circles and two dual circles orthogonal to the primal circles and tangent to each other all meet.&lt;ref name="zgc"/&gt;

==Realizations with additional properties==

===Integer coordinates===
It is possible to prove a stronger form of Steinitz's theorem, that any polyhedral graph can be realized by a convex polyhedron for which all of the vertex coordinates are integers. For instance,
Steinitz's original induction-based proof can be strengthened in this way. However, the integers that would result from this construction are [[double exponential function|doubly exponential]] in the number of vertices of the given polyhedral graph. Writing down numbers of this magnitude in [[binary notation]] would require an exponential number of bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Planar graphs and Steinitz's theorem|first=Suresh|last=Venkatasubramanian|year=2006|url=http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/planar-graphs-and-steinitzs-theorem.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent researchers have found lifting-based realization algorithms that use only O(''n'') bits per vertex.&lt;ref name="rmrs"&gt;{{citation|first1=Ares|last1=Ribó Mor|first2=Günter|last2=Rote|first3=André|last3=Schulz|title=Small Grid Embeddings of 3-Polytopes|journal=[[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]|volume=45|issue=1|pages=65–87|doi=10.1007/s00454-010-9301-0|year=2011|arxiv=0908.0488}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Kevin|last1=Buchin|first2=André|last2=Schulz|year=2010|contribution=On the number of spanning trees a planar graph can have|title=Algorithms – 18th Annual European Symposium (ESA 2010)|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=6346|pages=110–121|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15775-2|bibcode=2010LNCS.6346.....D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to relax the requirement that the coordinates be integers, and assign coordinates in such a way that the ''x''-coordinates of the vertices are distinct integers in the range [0,2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4] and the other two coordinates are real numbers in the range [0,1], so that each edge has length at least one while the overall polyhedron has volume O(''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=André|last=Schulz|title=Drawing 3-polytopes with good vertex resolution|journal=[[Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications]] |year=2011|volume=15|issue=1|pages=33–52|url=http://jgaa.info/accepted/2011/Schulz2011.15.1.pdf|doi=10.7155/jgaa.00216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some polyhedral graphs are known to be realizable on grids of only polynomial size; in particular this is true for the pyramids (realizations of [[wheel graph]]s), prisms (realizations of [[prism graph]]s), and [[stacked polytope|stacked polyhedra]] (realizations of [[Apollonian network]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Equal slopes===
A [[Halin graph]] is a planar graph formed from a planar-embedded [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] (with no degree-two vertices) by connecting the leaves of the tree into a [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]. Every Halin graph can be realized by a polyhedron in which this cycle forms a horizontal base face, every other face lies directly above the base face (as in the polyhedra realized through lifting), and every face has the same slope. Equivalently, the [[straight skeleton]] of the base face is combinatorially equivalent to the tree from which the Halin graph was formed. The proof of this result uses induction: any rooted tree may reduced to a smaller tree by removing the leaves from an internal node whose children are all leaves, the Halin graph formed from the smaller tree has a realization by the induction hypothesis, and it is possible to modify this realization in order to add any number of leaf children to the tree node whose children were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Specifying the shape of a face===
In any polyhedron that represents a given polyhedral graph ''G'', the faces of ''G'' are exactly the [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]] in ''G'' that do not separate ''G'' into two components: that is, removing a facial cycle from ''G'' leaves the rest of ''G'' as a connected subgraph. Thus, the faces are uniquely determined from the graph structure.
Another strengthening of Steinitz's theorem, by Barnette and Grünbaum, states that for any polyhedral graph, any face of the graph, and any convex polygon representing that face, it is possible to find a polyhedral realization of the whole graph that has the specified shape for the designated face. This is related to a theorem of Tutte, that any polyhedral graph can be drawn in the plane with all faces convex and any specified shape for its outer face. However, the planar [[graph drawing]]s produced by Tutte's method do not necessarily lift to convex polyhedra. Instead, Barnette and Grünbaum prove this result using an inductive method&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Tangent spheres===
The [[Paul Koebe|Koebe]]–Andreev–[[William Thurston|Thurston]] [[circle packing theorem]] can be interpreted as providing another strengthening of Steinitz's theorem, that every 3-connected planar graph may be represented as a convex polyhedron in such a way that all of its edges are tangent to the same [[unit sphere]].&lt;ref name="zgc"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Convex polytopes: extremal constructions and ''f''-vector shapes.

Circle packing methods can also be used to characterize the graphs of polyhedra that have a [[circumsphere]] or [[insphere]]. The characterization involves edge weights, constrained by systems of linear inequalities. These weights correspond to the angles made by adjacent circles in a system of circles, made by the intersections of the faces of the polyhedron with their circumsphere or the horizons of the vertices of the polyhedron on its insphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Finite cyclic groups==
For every finite group ''G'' of order ''n'', the following statements are equivalent:
* ''G'' is cyclic.
* For every divisor ''d'' of ''n'', ''G'' has exactly one subgroup of order ''d''.
* For every divisor ''d'' of ''n'', ''G'' has at most one subgroup of order ''d''.
This statement is known by various names such as '''characterization by subgroups'''.&lt;ref name="Roman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Roman|title=Fundamentals of Group Theory: An Advanced Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWkqG0aiVsMC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-8176-8300-9|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balakrishnan1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=V. K. Balakrishnan|title=Schaum's Outline of Combinatorics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=di0WSsXV74wC&amp;pg=PA155|year=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill Prof Med/Tech|isbn=978-0-07-003575-1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stroppel2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Markus Stroppel|title=Locally Compact Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_BPupMDRr8C&amp;pg=PA64|year=2006|publisher=European Mathematical Society|isbn=978-3-03719-016-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[cyclic group]] for some characterization.)&lt;!-- if I remember correctly, an abelian group is cyclic if every Sylow subgroup is cyclic. --&gt;

There exist finite groups other than cyclic groups with the property that all proper subgroups are cyclic; the [[Klein group]] is an example. However, the Klein group has more than one subgroup of order 2, so it does not meet the conditions of the characterization.

==The infinite cyclic group==
The infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive subgroup '''Z''' of the integers. There is one subgroup ''d'''''Z''' for each integer ''d'' (consisting of the multiples of ''d''), and with the exception of the trivial group (generated by ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) every such subgroup is itself an infinite cyclic group. Because the infinite cyclic group is a [[free group]] on one generator (and the trivial group is a free group on no generators), this result can be seen as a special case of the [[Nielsen–Schreier theorem]] that every subgroup of a free group is itself free.&lt;ref name="aluffi"&gt;{{citation|title=Algebra, Chapter 0|volume=104|series=Graduate Studies in Mathematics|first=Paolo|last=Aluffi|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821847817|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deWkZWYbyHQC&amp;pg=PA82|pages=82–84|contribution=6.4 Example: Subgroups of Cyclic Groups}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental theorem for finite cyclic groups can be established from the same theorem for the infinite cyclic groups, by viewing each finite cyclic group as a [[quotient group]] of the infinite cyclic group.&lt;ref name="aluffi"/&gt;

==Lattice of subgroups==
In both the finite and the infinite case, the [[lattice of subgroups]] of a cyclic group is isomorphic to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of a [[divisibility]] lattice. In the finite case, the lattice of subgroups of a cyclic group of order ''n'' is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of divisors of ''n'', with a subgroup of order ''n''/''d'' for each divisor ''d''. The subgroup of order ''n''/''d'' is a subgroup of the subgroup of order ''n''/''e'' if and only if ''e'' is a divisor of ''d''. The lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group can be described in the same way, as the dual of the divisibility lattice of all positive integers. If the infinite cyclic group is represented as the additive group on the integers, then the subgroup generated by ''d'' is a subgroup of the subgroup generated by ''e'' if and only if ''e'' is a divisor of ''d''.&lt;ref name="aluffi"/&gt;

Divisibility lattices are [[distributive lattice]]s, and therefore so are the lattices of subgroups of cyclic groups. This provides another alternative characterization of the finite cyclic groups: they are exactly the finite groups whose lattices of subgroups are distributive. More generally, a [[finitely generated group]] is cyclic if and only if its lattice of subgroups is distributive and an arbitrary group is [[locally cyclic group|locally cyclic]] if and only its lattice of subgroups is distributive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A geometric object has '''symmetry''' if there is an "operation" or "transformation" (such as an [[isometry]] or [[affine map]]) that maps the figure/object onto itself; i.e., it is said that the object has an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] under the transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Martin, G. | year=1996 | title=Transformation Geometry: An Introduction to Symmetry | publisher=Springer | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a circle rotated about its center will have the same shape and size as the original circle—all points before and after the transform would be indistinguishable. A circle is said to be ''symmetric under rotation'' or to have ''rotational symmetry''. If the isometry is the reflection of a [[plane figure]], the figure is said to have [[reflectional symmetry]] or [[line symmetry]]; moreover, it is possible for a figure/object to have more than one line of symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Freitag, Mark | year=2013 | title=Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers: A Process Approach | publisher=Cengage Learning | page=721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of symmetries that are possible for a geometric object depend on the set of geometric transforms available, and on what object properties should remain unchanged after a transform. Because the composition of two transforms is also a transform and every transform has an inverse transform that undoes it, the set of transforms under which an object is symmetric form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]], the [[symmetry group]] of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Willard Jr. | year=1972 | title=Symmetry Groups and Their Applications | publisher=Academic Press | location=New York | oclc=589081 | url=http://www.ima.umn.edu/~miller/symmetrygroups.html | accessdate=2009-09-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217091244/http://www.ima.umn.edu/~miller/symmetrygroups.html | archivedate=2010-02-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euclidean symmetries in general==
The most common group of transforms applied to objects are termed the [[Euclidean group]] of "[[isometry|isometries]]," which are distance-preserving transformations in space commonly referred to as two-dimensional or three-dimensional (i.e., in [[plane geometry]] or [[solid geometry]] [[Euclidean space]]s). These isometries consist of [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s, [[rotation]]s, [[translation]]s, and combinations of these basic operations.&lt;ref name="Higher dimensional group theory'"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/hdaweb2.htm Higher dimensional group theory | title=Higher Dimensional Group Theory | accessdate=2013-04-16 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723235509/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/hdaweb2.htm | archivedate=2012-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under an isometric transformation, a geometric object is said to be symmetric if, after transformation, the object is indistinguishable{{clarification needed|date=September 2017}} from the object before the transformation. A geometric object is typically symmetric only under a subset or "[[subgroup]]" of all isometries. The kinds of isometry subgroups are described below, followed by other kinds of transform groups and by the types of object invariance that are possible in geometry.

By the [[Cartan–Dieudonné theorem]], an [[orthogonal transformation]] in ''n''-dimensional space can be represented by the composition of at most ''n'' reflections.

==Reflectional symmetry==
{{Main|Reflectional symmetry}}

Reflectional symmetry, linear symmetry, mirror symmetry, mirror-image symmetry, or [[bilateral symmetry]] is symmetry with respect to reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symmetry |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |authorlink=Hermann Weyl |year=1982 |origyear=1952 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton | isbn=0-691-02374-3 |pages= |url= |ref=Weyl 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one dimension, there is a point of symmetry about which reflection takes place; in two dimensions there is an axis of symmetry, and in three dimensions there is a plane of symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowin |first1=Stephen C. |last2=Doty |first2=Stephen B. |year=2007 |title=Tissue Mechanics |publisher=Springer |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; An object or figure for which every point has a one-to-one mapping onto another, equidistant from and on opposite sides of a common plane is called mirror symmetric (see [[mirror image]]).

The axis of symmetry of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a [[perpendicular]] is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the axis of symmetry are identical. Another way to think about it is that if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a [[square (geometry)|square]] has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A [[circle]] has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Caldecott, Stratford  | year=2009 | title=Beauty for Truth's Sake: On the Re-enchantment of Education | publisher=Brazos Press |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the letter T is reflected along a vertical axis, it appears the same. This is sometimes called vertical symmetry. One can better use an unambiguous formulation; e.g., "T has a vertical symmetry axis" or "T has left-right symmetry".

The [[triangle]]s with reflection symmetry are [[isosceles]], the [[quadrilateral]]s with this symmetry are the [[Kite (geometry)|kites]] and the isosceles [[trapezoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers | author=Bassarear, Tom  |edition=5 | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2011 |page =499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each line or plane of reflection, the [[symmetry group]] is [[isomorphic]] with C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[point group]]s in three dimensions), one of the three types of order two ([[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s), hence algebraically isomorphic to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[fundamental domain]] is a [[half-plane]] or [[half-space (geometry)|half-space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Norman Johnson (mathematician) | author=Johnson, N. W. Johnson | title=Geometries and Transformations | year=2018 | chapter=11: Finite symmetry groups | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point reflection and other involutive isometries==
[[File:Point Reflection.png|thumb|upright=0.6|In 2 dimensions, a point reflection is a 180 degree rotation.]]
{{Main|Point reflection}}

Reflection symmetry can be generalized to other [[isometry|isometries]] of {{mvar|m}}-dimensional space which are [[involution (mathematics)|involutions]], such as
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) ↦ (−''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., −''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

in a certain system of [[Cartesian coordinates]]. This reflects the space along an {{math|(''m''−''k'')}}-dimensional [[affine subspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hertrich-Jeromin, Udo | year=2003 | title=Introduction to Möbius Differential Geometry | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{mvar|k}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|m}}, then such a transformation is known as a [[point reflection]], or an ''inversion through a point''. On the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] ({{mvar|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) a point reflection is the same as a half-[[turn (geometry)|turn]] (180°) rotation; see below. ''Antipodal symmetry'' is an alternative name for a point reflection symmetry through the origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dieck |first=Tammo |title=Algebraic Topology |year=2008 |publisher=European Mathematical Society |isbn=9783037190487 |pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a "reflection" preserves [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] if and only if {{mvar|k}} is an [[even number|even]] number.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Barker, Roger Howe ''Continuous Symmetry: From Euclid to Klein (Google eBook)'' American Mathematical Soc&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that for [[three-dimensional space|{{mvar|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3]] (as well as for other odd&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|m}}) a point reflection changes the orientation of the space, like a mirror-image symmetry. That is why in physics the term ''P-[[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]'' is used for both point reflection and mirror symmetry (P stands for [[parity (physics)|parity]]). As a point reflection in three dimensions changes a [[left-handed coordinate system]] into a [[right-handed coordinate system]], symmetry under a point reflection is also called a left-right symmetry.&lt;ref name=Gibson1980&gt;{{cite book |author1=W.M. Gibson  |author2=B.R. Pollard  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Symmetry principles in elementary particle physics |year=1980 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0 521 29964 0 |pages=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotational symmetry==
{{Main|Rotational symmetry}}
[[File:The armoured triskelion on the flag of the Isle of Man.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The [[triskelion]] has 3-fold rotational symmetry.]]

Rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in {{mvar|m}}-dimensional Euclidean space. Rotations are [[SE(n)|direct isometries]]; i.e., isometries preserving [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir G. Ivancevic, Tijana T. Ivancevic (2005) ''Natural Biodynamics'' World Scientific&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of the special Euclidean group [[SE(3)|E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{mvar|m}})]].

Symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations (because translations are compositions of rotations about distinct points),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Singer, David A. | year=1998 | title=Geometry: Plane and Fancy | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the symmetry group is the whole E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{mvar|m}}). This does not apply for objects because it makes space homogeneous, but it may apply for physical laws.

For symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin. These rotations form the [[special orthogonal group]] SO({{mvar|m}}), which can be represented by the group of {{math|''m'' × ''m''}} [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] with [[determinant]]&amp;nbsp;1. For {{mvar|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 this is the [[rotation group SO(3)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Joshi, A. W. | title=Elements of Group Theory for Physicists | year=2007 | publisher=New Age International | pages=111ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another meaning of the word, the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{mvar|m}}), the group of rigid motions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hartshorne, Robin | year=2000 | title=Geometry: Euclid and Beyond | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of rigid motions. For chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.

Laws of physics are SO(3)-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space. Because of [[Noether's theorem]], rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the [[angular momentum]] [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]].&lt;ref name=Noether&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kosmann-Schwarzbach | first = Yvette | authorlink = Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach | title = The Noether theorems: Invariance and conservation laws in the twentieth century | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] | series = Sources and Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-387-87867-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[rotational invariance]].

==Translational symmetry==
[[File:Frieze hop.png|thumb|A [[frieze pattern]] with translational symmetry]]
{{Main|Translational symmetry}}
Translational symmetry leaves an object invariant under a discrete or continuous group of [[translation (geometry)|translations]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_a(p) \;=\; p \,+\, a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stenger, Victor J. (2000) and Mahou Shiro (2007). ''Timeless Reality''. Prometheus Books. Especially chapter 12. Nontechnical.&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration on the right shows four congruent triangles generated by translations along the arrow. If the line of triangles extended to infinity in both directions, they would have a discrete translational symmetry; any translation that mapped one triangle onto another would leave the whole line unchanged.

==Glide reflection symmetry==
[[File:Frieze step.png|thumb|A [[frieze pattern]] with glide reflection symmetry]]
{{Main|Glide reflection}}
In 2D, a '''glide reflection''' symmetry (in 3D it is called a [[glide plane]] symmetry, and  a '''transflection''' in general) means that a reflection in a line or plane combined with a translation along the line / in the plane, results in the same object.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Transformation Geometry: An Introduction to Symmetry |series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] |first=George E. |last=Martin |publisher=Springer |year=1982 |isbn=9780387906362 |page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KW4EwONsQJgC&amp;pg=PA64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of two glide reflections results in a translation symmetry with twice the translation vector.  The symmetry group comprising glide reflections and associated translations  is the [[frieze group]] '''p11g''' and is isomorphic with the infinite cyclic group '''Z'''.

===Rotoreflection symmetry===
[[File:Rotoreflection example antiprism.png|thumb|upright=0.8|A [[pentagonal antiprism]] with marked edges shows rotoreflectional symmetry, with an order of 10.]]
{{Main|improper rotation}}
In 3D, a '''rotary reflection''', '''rotoreflection''' or '''improper rotation''' is a rotation about an axis combined with reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Gould, Steffen Borchardt-Ott (2011)''Crystallography: An Introduction'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetry groups associated with rotoreflections include:
* if the rotation angle has no common divisor with 360°, the symmetry group is not discrete
* if the rotoreflection has a 2''n''-fold rotation angle (angle of 180°/''n''), the symmetry group is ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of order 2''n'' (not to be confused with [[symmetric group]]s, for which the same notation is used; the abstract group is ''C&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''). A special case is ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, an [[Inversion in a point|inversion]], because it does not depend on the axis and the plane, it is characterized by just the point of inversion.
* the group ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' (angle of 360°/''n''); for odd ''n'' this is generated by a single symmetry, and the abstract group is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for even ''n'' this is not a basic symmetry but a combination. {{See also|point groups in three dimensions}}

==Helical symmetry==
{{See also|Screw axis}}

In 3D geometry and higher, a screw axis (or rotary translation) is a combination of a rotation and a translation along the rotation axis.&lt;ref&gt;Bottema, O, and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics,'' Dover Publications (September 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helix|Helical]] symmetry is the kind of symmetry seen in such everyday objects as [[spring (device)|springs]], [[Slinky]] toys, [[drill bits]], and [[auger (drill)|auger]]s. The concept of helical symmetry can be visualized as the tracing in three-dimensional space that results from rotating an object at a constant [[angular speed]] while simultaneously translating at a constant linear speed along its axis of rotation. At any one point in time, these two motions combine to give a ''coiling angle'' that helps define the properties of the traced helix.&lt;ref&gt;George R. McGhee (2006) ''The Geometry of Evolution: Adaptive Landscapes and Theoretical Morphospaces'' Cambridge University Press p.64&lt;/ref&gt; When the tracing object rotates quickly and translates slowly, the coiling angle will be close to 0°. Conversely, if the rotation is slow and the translation is speedy, the coiling angle will approach 90°.
[[File:Helix.svg|150px|thumb|left|A continuous helix]]
Three main classes of helical symmetry can be distinguished based on the interplay of the angle of coiling and translation symmetries along the axis:
[[File:Triangular helix.png|thumb|A regular skew-[[apeirogon]] has a discrete (3-fold here) screw-axis symmetry, drawn in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].]]
[[File:Coxeter helix 3 colors.png|thumb|The [[Boerdijk–Coxeter helix]], constructed by augmented regular tetrahedra, is an example of a screw axis symmetry that is nonperiodic.]]
* '''Infinite helical symmetry''': If there are no distinguishing features along the length of a [[helix]] or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Ursyn(2012) ''Biologically-inspired Computing for the Arts: Scientific Data Through Graphics'' IGI Global Snippet p.209 {{clarify|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point along the length of the object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or screw bit that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.
*'''''n''-fold helical symmetry''': If the requirement that every cross section of the helical object be identical is relaxed, additional lesser helical symmetries become possible. For example, the cross section of the helical object may change, but still repeats itself in a regular fashion along the axis of the helical object. Consequently, objects of this type will exhibit a symmetry after a rotation by some fixed angle&amp;nbsp;θ and a translation by some fixed distance, but will not in general be invariant for any rotation angle. If the angle (rotation) at which the symmetry occurs divides evenly into a full circle (360°), the result is the helical equivalent of a regular polygon. This case is called ''n-fold helical symmetry'', where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;360°; for example, a [[double helix]]. This concept can be further generalized to include cases where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of [[turn (geometry)|360°]] – that is, the cycle does eventually repeat, but only after more than one full rotation of the helical object.
* '''Non-repeating helical symmetry''': This is the case in which the angle of rotation&amp;nbsp;θ required to observe the symmetry is [[irrational angle|irrational]]. The angle of rotation never repeats exactly no matter how many times the helix is rotated. Such symmetries are created by using a non-repeating [[Point group#In two dimensions|point group in two dimensions]]. [[DNA]], with approximately 10.5 [[base pair]]s per turn, is an example of this type of non-repeating helical symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinden |first=Richard R. |title=DNA structure and function |year=1994 |publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing |isbn=9780126457506 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double rotation symmetry==
[[File:Torus vectors oblique.jpg|thumb|A 4D [[clifford torus]], stereographically projected into 3D, looks like a [[torus]]. A double rotation can be seen as a helical path.]]
{{See also|Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space#Double rotations}}

In 4D, a double rotation symmetry can be generated as the composite of two orthogonal rotations.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Howard Hinton
 (1906) ''The Fourth Dimension (Google eBook)'' S. Sonnenschein &amp; Company p.223&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to 3D screw axis which is the composite of a rotation and an orthogonal translation.

==Non-isometric symmetries==

A wider definition of geometric symmetry allows operations from a larger group than the Euclidean group of isometries. Examples of larger geometric symmetry groups are:
*The group of [[Similarity transformation (geometry)|similarity transformation]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[[H.S.M. Coxeter]] (1961,9) ''Introduction to Geometry'', §5 Similarity in the Euclidean Plane, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–76, §7 Isometry and Similarity in Euclidean Space, pp 96–104, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., [[affine transformation]]s represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|A}} that is a scalar times an [[orthogonal matrix]]. Thus [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] is added, [[self-similarity]] is considered a symmetry.
*The group of affine transformations represented by a matrix&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|A}} with determinant 1 or −1; i.e., the transformations which preserve area.&lt;ref&gt;William Thurston. ''Three-dimensional geometry and topology. Vol. 1''. Edited by Silvio Levy. Princeton Mathematical Series, 35. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1997. x+311 pp. {{isbn|0-691-08304-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*: This adds, e.g., oblique [[reflection symmetry]].
*The group of all bijective [[affine transformation]]s.
*The group of [[Möbius transformation]]s which preserve [[cross-ratio]]s.
*: This adds, e.g., [[inversive geometry|inversive]] reflections such as [[circle]] reflection on the plane.
In [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]], each possible group of symmetries defines a geometry in which objects that are related by a member of the symmetry group are considered to be equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Klein|Klein, Felix]], 1872. "Vergleichende Betrachtungen über neuere geometrische Forschungen" ('A comparative review of recent researches in geometry'), Mathematische Annalen, 43 (1893) pp.&amp;nbsp;63–100 (Also: Gesammelte Abh. Vol. 1, Springer, 1921, pp.&amp;nbsp;460–497).
:An English translation by Mellen Haskell appeared in ''Bull. N. Y. Math. Soc'' 2 (1892–1893): 215–249.
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Euclidean group defines [[Euclidean geometry]], whereas the group of Möbius transformations defines [[projective geometry]].

==Scale symmetry and fractals==
[[File:Julia set (ice).png|thumb|A [[Julia set]] has scale symmetry]]

Scale symmetry means that if an object is expanded or reduced in size, the new object has the same properties as the original.&lt;ref&gt;Tian Yu Cao ''Conceptual Foundations of Quantum Field Theory'' Cambridge University Press p.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; This is ''not'' true of most physical systems, as witness the difference in the shape of the legs of an [[elephant]] and a [[mouse]] (so-called [[allometric scaling]]). Similarly, if a soft wax candle were enlarged to the size of a tall tree, it would immediately collapse under its own weight.

A more subtle form of scale symmetry is demonstrated by [[fractal]]s. As conceived by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], fractals are a mathematical concept in which the structure of a complex form looks similar at any degree of [[magnification]],&lt;ref name="Gouyet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gouyet | first = Jean-François | title = Physics and fractal structures | publisher = Masson Springer | location = Paris/New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-387-94153-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; well seen in the [[Mandelbrot set]]. A [[coast]] is an example of a naturally occurring fractal, since it retains similar-appearing complexity at every level from the view of a satellite to a microscopic examination of how the water laps up against individual grains of sand. The branching of trees, which enables small twigs to stand in for full trees in [[diorama]]s, is another example.

Because fractals can generate the appearance of [[patterns in nature]], they have a beauty and familiarity not typically seen with mathematically generated functions. Fractals have also found a place in [[Computer generated imagery|computer-generated movie effects]], where their ability to create complex curves with fractal symmetries results in more realistic [[virtual world]]s.

==Abstract symmetry==

===Klein's view===
With every geometry, [[Felix Klein]] associated an underlying [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]]. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these [[group (mathematics)|groups]], and hierarchy of their [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]]. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean group]] of symmetries, while only the [[incidence structure]] and the [[cross-ratio]] are preserved under the most general [[projective geometry|projective transformations]]. A concept of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]ism, which is preserved in [[affine geometry]], is not meaningful in [[projective geometry]]. Then, by abstracting the underlying [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a [[subgroup]] of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is ''a priori'' meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).

===Thurston's view===
[[William Thurston]] introduced a similar version of symmetries in geometry. A '''model geometry''' is a [[simply connected]] [[smooth manifold]] ''X'' together with a transitive action of a [[Lie group]] ''G'' on ''X'' with compact stabilizers. The [[Lie group]] can be thought of as the group of symmetries of the geometry.

A model geometry is called '''maximal''' if ''G'' is maximal among groups acting smoothly and transitively on ''X'' with compact stabilizers, i.e. if it is the maximal group of symmetries. Sometimes this condition is included in the definition of a model geometry.

A '''geometric structure''' on a manifold  ''M'' is a diffeomorphism from ''M'' to  ''X''/Γ for some model geometry ''X'', where Γ is a discrete subgroup of ''G'' acting freely on ''X''. If a given manifold admits a geometric structure, then it admits one whose model is maximal.

A [[Geometrization conjecture|3-dimensional model geometry]] ''X'' is relevant to the geometrization conjecture if it is maximal  and if there is at least one compact manifold with a geometric structure modelled on ''X''. Thurston classified the 8 model geometries satisfying these conditions; they are listed below and are sometimes called '''Thurston geometries'''. (There are also uncountably many model geometries without compact quotients.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7279">In [[graph theory]], a '''voltage graph''' is a [[directed graph]] whose edges are labelled invertibly by elements of a [[group (mathematics)|group]].  It is formally identical to a [[gain graph]], but it is generally used in [[topological graph theory]] as a concise way to specify another [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] called the [[derived graph]] of the voltage graph.

Typical choices of the groups used for voltage graphs include the two-element group ℤ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (for defining the [[bipartite double cover]] of a graph), [[free group]]s (for defining the [[covering graph|universal cover]] of a graph), ''d''-dimensional [[integer lattice]]s ℤ&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; (viewed as a group under vector addition, for defining periodic structures in ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]),&lt;ref name="periodic"&gt;{{harvtxt|Iwano|Steiglitz|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Kosaraju|Sullivan|1988}}; {{harvtxt|Cohen|Megiddo|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and finite [[cyclic group]]s ℤ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;2. When &amp;Pi; is a cyclic group, the voltage graph may be called a ''cyclic-voltage graph''.

==Definition==
Formal definition of a &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt;-voltage graph, for a given group &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt;:
* Begin with a [[digraph (mathematics)|digraph]] ''G''.  (The direction is solely for convenience in notation.)
* A &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt;-voltage on an arc of ''G'' is a label of the arc by an element ''x'' of &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt;. For instance, in the case where &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ℤ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the label is a number ''i''&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''n'').
* A &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt;-voltage assignment is a function &lt;math&gt;\alpha : E(G) \rightarrow \Pi&lt;/math&gt; that labels each arc of ''G'' with a Π-voltage.
* A &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt;-voltage graph is a pair &lt;math&gt;( G, \alpha: E(G) \rightarrow \Pi )&lt;/math&gt; such that ''G'' is a digraph and &amp;alpha; is a voltage assignment.
* The '''voltage group''' of a voltage graph &lt;math&gt;( G, \alpha: E(G) \rightarrow \Pi )&lt;/math&gt; is the group &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;Π&lt;/span&gt; from which the voltages are assigned.

Note that the voltages of a voltage graph need not satisfy [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)|Kirchhoff's voltage law]], that the sum of voltages around a closed path is 0 (the identity element of the group), although this law does hold for the derived graphs described below.  Thus, the name may be somewhat misleading.  It results from the origin of voltage graphs as dual to the [[current graph]]s of [[topological graph theory]].

==The derived graph==
The '''derived graph''' of a voltage graph &lt;math&gt;( G, \alpha: E(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n} )&lt;/math&gt; is the graph &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; whose vertex set is &lt;math&gt;\tilde V = V \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; and whose edge set is &lt;math&gt;\tilde E = E \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where the endpoints of an edge (''e'', ''k'') such that ''e'' has tail ''v'' and head ''w'' are &lt;math&gt;(v,\ k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(w,\ k+\alpha(e))&lt;/math&gt;.

Although voltage graphs are defined for digraphs, they may be extended to [[undirected graph]]s by replacing each undirected edge by a pair of oppositely ordered directed edges and by requiring that these edges have labels that are inverse to each other in the group structure. In this case, the derived graph will also have the property that its directed edges form pairs of oppositely oriented edges, so the derived graph may itself be interpreted as being an undirected graph.

The derived graph is a [[covering graph]] of the given voltage graph. If no edge label of the voltage graph is the identity element, then the group elements associated with the vertices of the derived graph provide a [[graph coloring|coloring]] of the derived graph with a number of colors equal to the group order. An important special case is the [[bipartite double cover]], the derived graph of a voltage graph in which all edges are labeled with the non-identity element of a two-element group. Because the order of the group is two, the derived graph in this case is guaranteed to be [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].

[[Polynomial time]] [[algorithm]]s are known for determining whether the derived graph of a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt;-voltage graph contains any directed cycles.&lt;ref name="periodic"/&gt;

==Examples==
Any [[Cayley graph]] of a group &amp;Pi;, with a given set &amp;Gamma; of generators, may be defined as the derived graph for a &amp;Pi;-voltage graph having one vertex and |&amp;Gamma;| self-loops, each labeled with one of the generators in &amp;Gamma;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gross|Tucker|1987}}, Theorem 2.2.3, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Petersen graph]] is the derived graph for a ℤ&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-voltage graph in the shape of a dumbbell with two vertices and three edges: one edge connecting the two vertices, and one self-loop on each vertex. One self-loop is labeled with 1, the other with 2, and the edge connecting the two vertices is labeled 0. More generally, the same construction allows any [[generalized Petersen graph]] GP(''n'',''k'') to be constructed as a derived graph of the same dumbbell graph with labels 1, 0, and ''k'' in the group ℤ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gross|Tucker|1987}}, Example 2.1.2, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vertices and edges of any periodic [[tessellation]] of the plane may be formed as the derived graph of a finite graph, with voltages in ℤ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], in particular in [[differential geometry]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[representation theory]] a '''Weitzenböck identity''', named after [[Roland Weitzenböck]], expresses a relationship between two second-order [[elliptic operator]]s on a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] with the same leading symbol.  (The origins of this terminology seem doubtful, however, as there does not seem to be any evidence that such identities ever appeared in Weitzenböck's work.) Usually Weitzenböck formulae are implemented for ''G''-invariant self-adjoint operators between vector bundles associated to some [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]], although the precise conditions under which such a formula exists are difficult to formulate.  This article focuses on three examples of Weitzenböck identities:  from Riemannian geometry, spin geometry, and complex analysis.

==Riemannian geometry==
In [[Riemannian geometry]] there are two notions of the [[Laplacian]] on [[differential forms]] over an oriented compact Riemannian manifold ''M''.  The first definition uses the [[divergence|divergence operator]] ''δ'' defined as the formal adjoint of the de Rham operator ''d'':
::&lt;math&gt;\int_M \langle \alpha,\delta\beta\rangle := \int_M\langle d\alpha,\beta\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where ''α'' is any ''p''-form and ''β'' is any ({{nowrap|''p'' + 1}})-form, and &lt;math&gt;\langle -,-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the metric induced on the bundle of ({{nowrap|''p'' + 1}})-forms.  The usual '''form Laplacian''' is then given by

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta = d\delta +\delta d.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the [[Levi-Civita connection]] supplies a differential operator

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla:\Omega^pM\rightarrow T^*M\otimes\Omega^pM ,&lt;/math&gt;

where Ω&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is the bundle of ''p''-forms and ''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M''.  The '''Bochner Laplacian''' is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta'=\nabla^*\nabla&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla^*&lt;/math&gt; is the adjoint of &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.

The Weitzenböck formula then asserts that

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta' - \Delta = A&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a linear operator of order zero involving only the curvature.

The precise form of ''A'' is given, up to an overall sign depending on curvature conventions, by

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{2}\langle R(\theta,\theta)\#,\#\rangle + \operatorname{Ric}(\theta,\#) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:*''R'' is the Riemann curvature tensor,
:* Ric is the Ricci tensor,
:* &lt;math&gt;\theta:T^*M\otimes\Omega^pM\rightarrow\Omega^{p+1}M&lt;/math&gt; is the map that takes the wedge product of a 1-form and ''p''-form and gives a (''p''+1)-form,
:* &lt;math&gt;\#:\Omega^{p+1}M\rightarrow T^*M\otimes\Omega^pM&lt;/math&gt; is the universal derivation inverse to ''θ'' on 1-forms.

==Spin geometry==
If ''M'' is an oriented [[spin manifold]] with [[Dirac operator]] ð, then one may form the spin Laplacian Δ = ð&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the spin bundle.  On the other hand, the Levi-Civita connection extends to the spin bundle to yield a differential operator
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla:SM\rightarrow T^*M\otimes SM.&lt;/math&gt;
As in the case of Riemannian manifolds, let &lt;math&gt;\Delta'=\nabla^*\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.  This is another self-adjoint operator and, moreover, has the same leading symbol as the spin Laplacian.  The Weitzenböck formula yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta'-\Delta=-\frac{1}{4}Sc&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Sc'' is the scalar curvature.  This result is also known as the [[Lichnerowicz formula]].

==Complex differential geometry==
If ''M'' is a compact [[Kähler manifold]], there is a Weitzenböck formula relating the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;-Laplacian (see [[Dolbeault complex]]) and the Euclidean Laplacian on [[complex differential form|(''p'',''q'')-forms]].  Specifically, let

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\bar{\partial}^*\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\bar{\partial}^*&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta'=-\sum_k\nabla_k\nabla_{\bar{k}}&lt;/math&gt; in a unitary frame at each point.

According to the Weitzenböck formula, if α&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;Ω&lt;sup&gt;(''p'',''q'')&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', then

: &amp;Delta;'&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&amp;alpha; = ''A''(&amp;alpha;)

where ''A'' is an operator of order zero involving the curvature.  Specifically,
::if &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\alpha_{i_1i_2\dots i_p\bar{j}_1\bar{j}_2\dots\bar{j}_q}&lt;/math&gt; in a unitary frame, then
::&lt;math&gt;A(\alpha)=-\sum_{k,j_s} \operatorname{Ric}_{\bar{j}_\alpha}^{\bar{k}}\alpha_{i_1i_2\dots i_p\bar{j}_1\bar{j}_2\dots\bar{k}\dots\bar{j}_q}&lt;/math&gt; with ''k'' in the ''s''-th place.

==Other Weitzenböck identities==
*In [[conformal geometry]] there is a Weitzenböck formula relating a particular pair of differential operators defined on the [[tractor bundle]].  See Branson, T. and Gover, A.R., "Conformally Invariant Operators, Differential Forms, Cohomology and a Generalisation of Q-Curvature", ''Communications in Partial Differential Equations'', '''30''' (2005) 1611–1669.
