[[Acyl-CoA oxidase]] deficiency (ACOX1 deficiency) is a rare disorder that leads to significant damage and deterioration of nervous system functions ([[neurodegeneration]]).&lt;ref name=GHR&gt;{{cite web |title=Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/peroxisomal-acyl-coa-oxidase-deficiency |publisher=Genetics Home Reference, NIH |language=en |date=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is caused by pathogenic variants in ''[[ACOX1]]'', which codes for the production of an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1).&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt; This specific enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of [[Very long chain fatty acid|very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs)]].&lt;ref name=Thomas2018&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Janet A. |last2=Lam |first2=Christina |last3=Berry |first3=Gerard T. |title=Avery's Diseases of the Newborn |date=2018 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-40139-5 |pages=253–272.e3 |edition= Tenth |language=en |chapter=Chapter 23: Lysosomal Storage, Peroxisomal, and Glycosylation Disorders and Smith–Lemli–Opitz Syndrome Presenting in the Neonate|chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323401395000231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defective function of the ACOX1 enzyme prevents proper breakdown of these VLCFAs, leading to accumulation and interference with the nervous system.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt;  Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency affects a person from birth, and most newborns affected with this condition will not survive past early childhood.&lt;ref name = GHR /&gt;  Affected individuals can be born with [[hypotonia]], seizures, and dysmorphic features, such as widely spaced eyes, a low nasal bridge and low set ears.   [[Polydactyly]] and [[hepatomegaly]] have also been described.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt; Most babies will learn to walk and begin speaking, before experiencing a rapid decline in motor function between the ages of 1 and 3.&lt;ref name=Aubourg2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aubourg |first1=P |last2=Wanders |first2=R |title=Peroxisomal disorders. |journal=Handbook of clinical neurology |date=2013 |volume=113 |pages=1593-609 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00028-9 |pmid=23622381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the person ages, and the conditions worsens, they begin to experience exaggerated reflexes ([[hyperreflexia]]), more severe and frequent seizures, and gradual loss of vision and hearing.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt;
There is no cure for this condition, however there are a range of symptom-based treatments, used to provide supportive care.

==Signs and symptoms==
Children are born with this condition and their symptoms can be seen immediately.&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt; In the early stages these can appear quite mild; weak muscle tone (often extreme hypotonia), lack of [[Primitive reflexes|neonatal reflexes]], seizures and abnormal (dysmorphic) facial features such as widely spaced eyes, a low nasal bridge, low set ears and an abnormally large forehead.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt;  Due to the nature of the disease, in the build-up of VLCFAs, symptoms worsen progressively over time.&lt;ref name=omim /&gt;  Children can often reach the stage at which they begin to walk and talk, before experiencing a rapid decline in motor skills due to [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and subsequent nerve damage.&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aubourg2013/&gt;  A hearing deficit may develop, eyesight and response to visual and physical stimuli begins to diminish and eventually becomes non-existent.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt; The life expectancy of an individual with ACOX1 deficiency is 5 years.&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aubourg2013/&gt;

==Genetics==
[[File:PDB 2ddh EBI.jpg|thumb|Acyl CoA oxidase enzyme]]
Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ''ACOX1.''&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt; This is the gene that codes for the production of an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase which is responsible for the breakdown of VLCFAs.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2018/&gt; It is not completely clear how the build-up of these VLCFAs causes the symptoms seen with this condition, however research suggests that this abnormal accumulation triggers an inflammation in the nervous system which leads to [[demyelination]].&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;  Demyelination leads to the loss of white matter, [[leukodystrophy]], in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt; It is this leukodystrophy that is related to the development of neurological abnormalities in people with Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency.&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt;  Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency is an extremely rare condition.&lt;ref name = GHR /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can be done both prenatally based on family history and after birth based on clinical suspicion.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt;  The primary prenatal diagnosis techniques involve the assessment of [[amniotic fluid]] for an abnormal elevation in VLCFAs, and a reduced presence (or in some cases complete absence) of acyl-CoA oxidase in [[Fibroblast|fibroblasts]].  If the causative variants in a family are known, prenatal diagnosis can be performed by molecular testing.&lt;ref name=omim&gt;{{cite web|title=264470 - Peroxisomal Acyl-CoA Oxidase Deficiency |url = https://www.omim.org/entry/264470 | accessdate = 2018-10-25 | publisher = OMIM, Johns Hopkins University|date=September 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After birth, there are a number of diagnostic techniques available for use. A blood sample can be taken, from which the serum levels of VLCFAs and acyl-CoA oxidase activity can be assessed.  Analysis of VLCFAs is important for the identification of ACOX1 deficiency, if a leukodystrophy has been identified&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt;  Since the condition is genetic, and is caused by pathogenic variants in ''ACOX1'', it can be confirmed by sequence or copy number analysis.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;  Due to the rarity of this condition, people who have it may not be diagnosed early in their disease progression. As a result, acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency may be misdiagnosed as similar conditions such as [[Usher syndrome]] and [[neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy]].&lt;ref name=GeneReviews&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanderver |first1=Adeline |last2=Tonduti |first2=Davide |last3=Schiffmann |first3=Raphael |last4=Schmidt |first4=Johanna |last5=van der Knaap |first5=Marjo S. |title=Leukodystrophy Overview |journal=GeneReviews |date=6 February 2014 |pmid=24501781 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK184570/ |publisher=University of Washington, Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parikh2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parikh |first1=S |last2=Bernard |first2=G |last3=Leventer |first3=RJ |last4=van der Knaap |first4=MS |last5=van Hove |first5=J |last6=Pizzino |first6=A |last7=McNeill |first7=NH |last8=Helman |first8=G |last9=Simons |first9=C |last10=Schmidt |first10=JL |last11=Rizzo |first11=WB |last12=Patterson |first12=MC |last13=Taft |first13=RJ |last14=Vanderver |first14=A |last15=GLIA |first15=Consortium. |title=A clinical approach to the diagnosis of patients with leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephelopathies. |journal=Molecular genetics and metabolism |date=April 2015 |volume=114 |issue=4 |pages=501-515 |doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2014.12.434 |pmid=25655951 |pmc=4390485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and management==
There are no cures for ACOX1 deficiency, supportive care is used to manage specific clinical symptoms for affected individuals.&lt;ref name=GHR/&gt;  Treatment is based upon symptoms, with the aim the provide some relief.&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt;  Pharmacologic agents are used to help improve muscle tone (management of dystonia) and to block neurological signalling to the muscle. Physical therapy is used to improve movement and function.&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt;  For the specific treatment of recurrent seizures, there are both pharmaceutical and surgical options.&lt;ref name=GeneReviews/&gt;

== Embryology ==
Different body systems in the infant grow, mature and develop at specific times during gestation. The consumption of alcohol during one or more of these developmental stages may only result in one or few conditions.&lt;ref name = cdc1&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/documents/fasdbrochure_final.pdf |accessdate = 10 August 2017 |date = |publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title = An Alcohol-free pregnancy is the best choice for your baby}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first weeks of pregnancy babies grow at a rapid pace, even before the mothers know they are pregnant. From conception and to the third week, the most susceptible systems and organs are the brain, spinal cord, and heart. These crucial organs start forming in early stages of pregnancy, which are very sensitive and critical periods in human development. Though these body systems complete their development later in the pregnancy, the effects of alcohol consumption early in the pregnancy can result in defects to these systems and organs.&lt;ref name = cdc1/&gt; During the fourth week of gestation, the limbs are being formed and it is at this point that alcohol can effect the development of arms, legs, fingers and toes. The eyes and ears also form during the fourth week and are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name = cdc1/&gt; By the sixth week of gestation, the teeth and palate are forming and alcohol consumption at this time will affect these structures.&lt;ref name = cdc1/&gt; Alcohol use in this window is responsible for many of the facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome. By the 20th week of gestation the formation of organs and organ systems is well-developed. The infant is still susceptible to the damaging effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name = cdc1/&gt; Therefore, it would be safer for women to stop drinking prior to trying to conceive. 

The baby’s brain, body, and organs are developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at any time.  Because every pregnancy is different, drinking alcohol may hurt one baby more than another. A child that has been affected by alcohol before birth may be appear 'normal' at birth. Intellectual disabilities may not appear until the child begins school.&lt;ref name = cdc1/&gt;

== Alcohol during pregnancy ==
The developing fetus is exposed to the alcohol through placenta and umbilical cord. Alcohol metabolizes slowly in fetus and remains for a longer time when compared to an adult because of re-uptake of alcohol-containing amniotic fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhuvaneswar|first=Chaya G.|last2=Chang|first2=Grace|last3=Epstein|first3=Lucy A.|last4=Stern|first4=Theodore A.|date=2007|title=Alcohol Use During Pregnancy: Prevalence and Impact|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2139915/|journal=Primary Care Companion to The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=9|issue=6|pages=455–460|issn=1523-5998|pmc=2139915|pmid=18185825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burd|first=L|last2=Blair|first2=J|last3=Dropps|first3=K|date=2012-05-17|title=Prenatal alcohol exposure, blood alcohol concentrations and alcohol elimination rates for the mother, fetus and newborn|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/jp201257|journal=Journal of Perinatology|language=En|volume=32|issue=9|pages=652–659|doi=10.1038/jp.2012.57|issn=0743-8346}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Alcohol exposure has serious implication on developing fetus as well as mother. When a woman is planning for pregnancy, she should keep in mind that no safe limit for any type of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/fasd/index.html|title=Disease of the Week - Alcohol and Pregnancy|date=2018-09-14|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhuvaneswar|first=Chaya G.|last2=Chang|first2=Grace|last3=Epstein|first3=Lucy A.|last4=Stern|first4=Theodore A.|date=2007|title=Alcohol Use During Pregnancy: Prevalence and Impact|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2139915/|journal=Primary Care Companion to The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=9|issue=6|pages=455–460|issn=1523-5998|pmc=2139915|pmid=18185825}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can lead to premature birth which manifests later as child continues to grow. One of the main outcome in developing baby is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which is characterized by: cleft palate and/or cleft lip, unproportionate physical development of the body, various disabilities like attention deficiency, memory and coordination power is low and improper functioning of various body organs like kidney, heart and bones. Miscarriage,low birth weight and stillbirth are other common outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/alcohol-use.html|title=Alcohol Use in Pregnancy|date=2018-07-17|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These effects can be magnified specially during the first and third trimester of pregnancy when the baby is growing rapidly. Alcohol consumption specially in the first trimester of pregnancy, which is a crucial developmental stage of fetal growth, can have serious consequences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/318074/Prevention-harm-caused-alcohol-exposure-pregnancy.pdf|title=Prevention of Harm caused by Alcohol Exposure during Pregnancy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Developing fetus can be exposed to alcohol in the earliest weeks of pregnancy. In the third week, alcohol can affect the heart and central nervous system of the fetus. If mother continues to drink, fetus's eyes, legs and arms can be adversely affected. Continuous exposure further through sixth week can further have negative impact on ear and teeth development. Fetus's palate and external genitalia can be affected if the mother persists drinking. During the twelfth week, frequent alcohol exposure can negatively impact the brain development which affects cognitive, learning and behavioral skills before birth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/dangers-pregnancy/?utm_source=social|title=What are the Effects &amp; Dangers of Alcohol During Pregnancy?|work=American Addiction Centers|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alcohol during pregnancy not only affects the developing fetus, but it has adverse health outcomes on pregnant mother as well&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/pregnancy_substance_use/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Substance use in pregnancy|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It can harm the fertility of women who are planning for pregnancy. Mother could easily get injured from falls under the influence of alcohol which can eventually lead to miscarriage. Alcohol adverse effects can lead to malnutrition, seizures, vomiting and dehydration. Mother can suffer from anxiety, depression which can result in child abuse/neglect. It has also been observed that while the pregnant mother withdraws from alcohol, its effects are visible on the infant as well. The baby remains in an irritated mood, cries frequently, doesn’t sleep properly, weakening of sucking ability and increased hunger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/drinking-while-pregnant/|title=Dangers of Drinking While Pregnant - DrugAbuse.com|website=drugabuse.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increases the risk that the child will develop acute myeloid leukemia at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latino-Martel|first=Paule|last2=Chan|first2=Doris S.

== Signs and Symptoms ==
When an infant is born and appears to be healthy, the baby may still have non-visible disorders and organ defects due to exposure to alcohol during the pregnancy.&lt;ref name = cdc1/&gt; Social problems in the child have been found to be associated with alcohol use during gestation.&lt;ref name = who2/&gt; Alcohol is a cause of microcephaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/microcephaly/en/|title=Microcephaly|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol use during pregnancy does not effect the ability to breastfeed the infant. In addition, an infant may breastfeed even if the mother continues to consume alcohol after the birth. An infant born to a mother that has an alcohol dependency may go through alcohol withdrawal after the birth.&lt;ref name = who2/&gt;

One of the major effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders(FASDs). Of which, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome(FAS) is the most severe form. It is shown that small amounts of alcohol consumed during pregnancy does not show any health related issues in the face, but behavioral issues can be seen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

There is a wide range of symptoms seen in persons suffering from FASDs which include: 

•Abnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip (this ridge is called the philtrum) 

•Small head size 

•Shorter-than-average height 

•Low body weight 

•Poor coordination 

•Hyperactive behavior 

•Difficulty with attention 

•Poor memory 

•Difficulty in school (especially with math) 

•Learning disabilities 

•Speech and language delays 

•Intellectual disability or low IQ 

•Poor reasoning and judgment skills 

•Sleep and sucking problems as a baby 

•Vision or hearing problems 

•Problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|title=Basics about FASDs|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four types of FASDs depending on the symptoms: (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome(FAS), (2) Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder(ARND), (3) Alcohol-Related Birth Defects(ARBD), (4) Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure(ND-PAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|title=Basics about FAS|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches to treatment of FAS: 

(1) At Home- A stable and loving home along with a regular routine, simple rules to follow and where rewards are given for positive behavior is a good environment for children with FAS. 

(2) Medications- Medications are used to specifically treat symptoms of FASDs and not FAS entirely. Some of the medications used are antidepressants, stimulants, neuroleptics and anti-anxiety drugs. 

(3) Counseling- Children with FAS benefit from behavioral and functional training, social skill training and tutoring. Support groups and talk therapy not only help the children suffering from FAS, but also help the parents and siblings of these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/fetal-alcohol-syndrome|title=Fetal Alcohol Syndrome|website=healthline.com|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A woman may elect to discontinue alcohol once she knows that she is pregnant. A woman can have serious symptoms that accompany alcohol withdrawal during pregnancy. These symptoms can be treated during pregnancy with benzodiazepine.&lt;ref name = who2/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
One out of 67 women who drink alcohol during pregnancy will have a child with a birth defect. The five countries with the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy were Ireland (about 60%), Belarus (47%), Denmark (46%), the UK (41%) and the Russian Federation (37%). The lowest prevalence is in those nations whose religious beliefs govern their alcohol consumption. Birth defects caused by alcohol consumption may be up to 1% in many places. This may mean that FASD may be higher than anencephaly, Down syndrome, spina bifida and trisomy 18. Globally, one in 10 women drink alcohol during pregnancy. Out of this population, 20% [[binge drink]] and have four or more alcoholic drinks per single occasion.&lt;ref name = who1/&gt; "Binge drinking is the direct cause of FAS or FASD. These findings are alarming because half of the pregnancies in developed countries and over 80% in developing countries are unplanned. That means that many women don’t realize they are pregnant during the early stages and that they continue drinking when pregnant."&lt;ref name = who1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/5/17-030517/en/|title=Counting the costs of drinking alcohol during pregnancy|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health recommendations ==
Starting in 1981, the [[surgeon general]] of the United States started releasing a warning asking pregnant women to [[Teetotalism|abstain from alcohol]] for the remainder of gestation.&lt;ref name="MD2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Lissa |title=Fertility, Pregnancy, and Childbirth|date=23 August 2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781429959322|page=14|quote=In 1981, the surgeon general put out the now-ubiquitous warning about alcohol and pregnancy. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] issued set of recommendations in 2015: "During pregnancy no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk; and binge drinking poses dose-related risk to the developing fetus."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] has advised that women abstain from alcohol entirely during the first three months of gestation, and that if women do choose to drink they should drink no more than one or two drinks once or twice a week.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===
There is some controversy surrounding the "zero-tolerance" approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The assertion that moderate drinking causes FAS is said to lack strong evidence and, in fact, the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social, legal, and health impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=EM|date=2000|title=Fetal alcohol syndrome: the origins of a moral panic |url=https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/35/3/276/208920 |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=276–282|doi=10.1093/alcalc/35.3.276|issn=0735-0414|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331002011/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3/276.full|archive-date=2015-03-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 an infographic created by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] caused controversy because it recommended that women of child-bearing age abstain from alcohol if they were not on birth control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/VitalSigns/Fasd/infographic.html#graphic2|title=Alcohol and Pregnancy {{!}} VitalSigns {{!}} CDC|date=2017-03-20|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the window for developing fetal alcohol syndrome is very early, before women may know they're pregnant. However, the recommendation was seen as onerous or overly broad with some sources claiming it "shamed women." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4209491/cdc-alcohol-pregnancy/|title=The CDC's Alcohol and Pregnancy Warning Shames Women|website=Time|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-backlash-telling-women-avoid-alcohol-if-not-using-birth-control/|title=CDC faces backlash over alcohol warning to women|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cdc-alcohol-young-women-pregnancy-warning_us_56b22f03e4b04f9b57d805bc|title=No, The CDC Did Not Tell Women To Stop Drinking|last=Schumaker|first=E|date=2016|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by Galen Research and published in 2003,&lt;ref name="DowardSp" /&gt; the ASQoL has been used in clinical studies worldwide.  The content for the measure was drawn from [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews that were conducted with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients.  The draft version of the ASQoL was created and then went through several stages of testing to ensure it had good face validity, content validity, reproducibility and construct validity.&lt;ref name="DowardSp" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1620">The '''Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts''' was established in 1867 to support the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] that were passed by the British Parliament in 1864. The acts legalized prostitution and put the women involved under police and medical control. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be extended outside of the naval and army barracks and be made effective to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution.

The supporters of the acts were opposed by the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], which was led by [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy|Elizabeth Wolstenholme]] and [[Josephine Butler]].

== Contagious Diseases Acts ==
The [[Contagious Diseases Act]] was a law passed by Parliament in 1864. It was replaced by acts of 1866 and 1869 giving even more powers to the police, and covering additional districts. It caused demand not only for extension of the acts to the rest of the country, but also for the repeal of the acts.&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:US Navy 080812-N-9774H-106 Hospitalman Michael Hagglund, an optometrist technician embarked aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD 3), uses an auto refractor to help determine eye prescriptions on a patient at Ju.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Navy]] optometrist technician using an autorefractor during a humanitarian assistance project in [[Nicaragua]] in 2008]]
An '''autorefractor''' or '''automated refractor''' is a computer-controlled machine used during an [[eye examination]] to provide an objective measurement of a person's [[Refraction error|refractive error]] and [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] for [[glasses]] or [[contact lenses]].  This is achieved by measuring how light is changed as it enters a person's eye.

==Technique==
The majority of autorefractors calculate the vision correction a patient needs (refraction) by using sensors that detect the reflections from a cone of infrared light. These reflections are used to determine the size and shape of a ring in the retina at the back of the eye. By measuring this zone, the autorefractor can determine when a patient’s eye properly focuses an image. The instrument changes its magnification until the image comes into focus. The process is repeated in at least three meridians of the eye and the autorefractor calculates the refraction of the eye, sphere, cylinder and axis. Modern autorefractors are based on the idea patented by Medina.&lt;ref name="Medina "&gt;[http://www.espatentes.com/pdf/8100872_A1.pdf Medina A.: "Refractometro Electronico (Electronic Refractor)". Spanish patent. Jul 1979.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
In some offices, this process is used to provide the starting point for the [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] in subjective refraction tests.  Here, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] are switched in and out of a [[phoropter]] and the patient is asked "which looks better" while looking at a chart.  This feedback refines the prescription to one which provides the patient with the best vision.

Automated refraction is particularly useful when dealing with non-communicative people such as young children or those with disabilities.

==Retinoscopy==
[[Retinoscopy]] performed by an experienced clinician has been found to provide a more accurate estimation of refractive error than autorefraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge J, Queiros A, Almeida JB, Parafita MA. "Retinoscopy/autorefraction: which is the best starting point for a noncycloplegic refraction?" ''Optom Vis Sci.'' 2005 Jan;82(1):64-8. {{PMID|15630406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies report that autorefractor measurements without application of [[Cycloplegia#Cycloplegic medication|cycloplegia medication]] can result in significant overestimation of [[myopia]].&lt;ref&gt;Choong YF, Chen AH, Goh PP.: A comparison of autorefraction and subjective refraction with and without cycloplegia in primary school children. Am J Ophthalmol. 2006 Jul;142(1):68-74. {{PMID|16815252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fotedar R, Rochtchina E, Morgan I, Wang JJ, Mitchell P, Rose KA.: Necessity of cycloplegia for assessing refractive error in 12-year-old children: a population-based study.

Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. is a medical technology [[Startup company | startup]] headquartered in [[California]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Peter Andrey|title=A Do-It-Yourself Revolution in Diabetes Care|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/health/a-do-it-yourself-revolution-in-diabetes-care.html|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=The New York Times|date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded by parents of children with [[Diabetes_mellitus_type_1 | Type 1 Diabetes]] (T1D): [[Jeffrey Brewer]], Bryan Mazlish, and Lane Desborough.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knutson|first1=Ryan|title=Computer Experts Deliver Insulin to Diabetic Kids|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-experts-deliver-insulin-to-diabetic-kids-1433805697|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early History==

The company’s start may be traced back to 2011, when [[Quantitative_analyst#Algorithmic_trading | quantitative trader]] Bryan Mazlish’s son received his diagnosis of T1D. He developed a control [[algorithm]] to drive the first&lt;ref name="Welkin"&gt;{{cite web|title=No More Sleepless Nights: The Relationship Between Innovative Therapies for Parents of Children with Type 1 Diabetes|url=https://welkinhealth.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/no-more-sleepless-nights-the-relationship-between-innovative-therapies-for-parents-of-children-with-type-1-diabetes/|website=Welkin Health|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; automated and [[Cloud computing | cloud-connected]], [[Control theory | closed-loop]], [[artificial pancreas]] device for his wife and son, who have been using the closed-loop automation of [[insulin]] delivery since 2013.&lt;ref name="Disc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hurley|first1=Dan|title=Artificial Pancreas Makers Race to Market|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2016/may/13-priming-the-pump|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=Discover Magazine|issue=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this “homebrew artificial pancreas” was kept from the press and the subject of rumor, earning Mazlish the nickname Bigfoot from author Dan Hurley in a piece for Wired Magazine in 2014.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hurley|first1=Dan|title=Diabetes Patients are Hacking Their Way Toward a Bionic Pancreas|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/diabetes-patients-hacking-together-diy-bionic-pancreases/|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=Wired Magazine|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, Mazlish joined with Brewer and Desborough to form Bigfoot Biomedical in order to scale and commercialize the technology, calling the company Bigfoot Biomedical.&lt;ref name="Disc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Rogene|title=Ones to Watch, ten companies we’re keeping an eye on|url=http://www.medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com/ones-watch-ten-companies-keeping-eye/|website=Medical Design and Outsourcing|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, it was reported that, Bigfoot Biomedical received investment from the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] (JDRF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/bigfoot-biomedical-gets-investment-jdrfs-new-venture-fund-smart-automated-insulin-delivery|title=Bigfoot Biomedical gets investment from JDRF's new venture fund for smart automated insulin delivery system|date=2017-01-30|work=MobiHealthNews|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the team from Patients Pending LTD, makers of the Timesulin smart insulin pen, including CEO John Sjölund joined Bigfoot Biomedical to lead the development of a smart pen solution for people utilizing multiple daily injections to manage their diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bigfootbiomedical.com/bigfoot-acquires-timesulin/|title=Bigfoot Biomedical acquires Timesulin|date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisitions and Collaborations==

In May 2015, Bigfoot acquired all the assets of Asante Solutions, former manufacturer of the Snap [[insulin pump]]. Later that month, Bigfoot announced a development agreement with [[Dexcom]] in June 2015, securing the technology needed for the [[Blood_glucose_monitoring#Continuous_glucose_monitoring | continuous glucose monitoring]] component of the system.&lt;ref name="MPO"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bigfoot Biomedical Ups its Game Through Recent Acquisition and Partnership|url=http://www.mpo-mag.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2015-06-08/bigfood-biomedical-ups-its-game-through-recent-acquisition-and-partnership|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=Medical Product Outsourcing|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Bigfoot announced the acquisition of London-based startup Patients Pending, LTD, maker of the Timesulin smart insulin pen tracker,&lt;ref name="DMine17"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoskins|first1=Mike|title=NEWS: Bigfoot Closed Loop to Use Next-Gen Abbott FreeStyle Libre|url=http://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/bigfoot-abbott-libre-news|website=DiabetesMine|publisher=Healthline|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company's Bluetooth-enabled insulin pen dose capture technology, with the goal being to use Patients Pending's Bluetooth-enabled dose capture technology to provide people on injection therapy with dose titration decision support,&lt;ref name="DDaily17"&gt;{{cite web|last1=K|first1=Sarah|title=Bigfoot Biomedical Aims to Take Multiple Daily Injections to the Next Level with Timesulin Acquisition|url=https://www.diabetesdaily.com/blog/bigfoot-biomedical-aims-to-take-multiple-daily-injections-to-the-next-level-with-timesulin-acquisition-435398/|website=Diabetes Daily|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving smart dosing guidance based on previous glucose trends and insulin doses captured from the cap with a commercial launch possible in 2019.&lt;ref name="diaTribe17"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Brian|title=What's Making a Splash in Diabetes Technology This Summer?|url=https://diatribe.org/diabetes-technology-making-a-splash-this-summer|website=diaTribe.org|publisher=diaTribe|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 2017 saw Bigfoot announce a collaboration with [[Abbott_Laboratories | Abbott Laboratories]] to integrate Abbott’s FreeStyle® Libre glucose sensing technology with Bigfoot’s insulin delivery solutions in the United States.&lt;ref name="MedCity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parmar|first1=Arundhati|title=New Abbott diabetes deal is a “missed opportunity” for DexCom|url=http://medcitynews.com/2017/07/new-abbott-diabetes-deal-missed-opportunity-dexcom/|website=MedCity News|publisher=Breaking Media, Inc.|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement allows for Bigfoot's use of a "next generation" version of the Libre sensor system that allows for continuous glucose transmission.&lt;ref name="diatribeLibre"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Lynn|title=Bigfoot &amp; Abbott to Automate Insulin Delivery Without Fingersticks|url=https://diatribe.org/bigfoot-and-abbott-to-automate-insulin-delivery-without-fingersticks|website=diaTribe.org|publisher=diaTribe|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbott FreeStyle® Libre does not require users to prick their finger to retrieve glucose values or calibrate the sensor. For Bigfoot, the deal offers an opportunity to disrupt the automated insulin delivery field with the first integration of a sensor technology designed to eliminate the need for fingerstick calibrations and aids Bigfoot in its goal of creating patient-friendly technologies.&lt;ref name="MTS17"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Mary|title=Bigfoot and Abbott: A Match Made in Heaven?

==System Components==

The Bigfoot automated insulin delivery system will combine an insulin pump programmed with a proprietary control algorithm, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor and transmitter, and a commercial off-the-shelf smartphone. It will also integrate data generated from a [[Bluetooth]] connected blood [[glucose meter]].&lt;ref name="dia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Adam|title=Bigfoot Biomedical Reveals Its Automated Insulin Delivery System!|url=http://diatribe.org/bigfoot-biomedical-reveals-its-automated-insulin-delivery-system|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=diaTribe|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Americans hardly drank bottled water—just one gallon of bottled water per person per year on average. By 2005, it had grown to ~26 gallons (98.5 L) per person per year.

Standards of identity define types of water for labeling purposes:
* To be called [[groundwater|ground water]], the water must not be under the direct influence of [[surface water]].
* Water containing more than 250 parts per million of total dissolved solids is [[mineral water]].
* [[Artesian aquifer|Artesian water]] comes from a well tapping a confined aquifer in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer; it may be collected with the assistance of external force to enhance the natural underground pressure.
* Water that has been produced by [[distillation]], [[deionization]], [[reverse osmosis]] or similar processes is [[purified water|purified]] or [[demineralized]] water.
* [[Carbonated water|Sparkling water]] contains the same amount of [[carbon dioxide]] that it had at emergence from the source, although it may be removed and replenished in treatment.
* [[Spring water]] must be derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface.
* [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterile water]] meets the requirements under "sterility tests" in the United States [[United States Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopoeia]].
* [[Water well|Well water]] is water that has been removed from a hole bored or drilled in the ground which taps into an aquifer.

Standards of quality regulate acceptable levels of the water's [[turbidity]], color and odor, according to sample analysis. Exemptions are made according to aesthetically based allowable levels, and do not relate to health concerns. An example is mineral water, which is exempt from allowable color levels.&lt;ref name="FDA2"/&gt;

'''''Breaking the Habit''''' is a 1964 American &lt;!--animated?--&gt;short [[documentary film]] directed by [[John Korty]] about [[cigarette smoking]] and [[lung cancer]]. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short]].

==Content==
Two men are discussing about the benefits of giving up smoking, while themselves puffing cigarettes.&lt;ref name="KDF"&gt;{{cite news|title=Film Program Is Launched By ACS|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18582877/film_program_is_launched_by_acs/|accessdate=March 24, 2018|work=[[Daily Freeman|The Kingston Daily Freeman]]|date=June 9, 1965|location=Kingston, New York|page=14|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Freelance animator Korty moved to [[Stinson Beach, California]], where one day he met sound artist [[Henry Jacobs]] who had prepared the soundtrack for a future short film about smoking, sponsored by the California division of [[American Cancer Society]]. Korty began work on the film under his own company Korty Films, employing [[cutout animation]], conceptualized the characters and prepared the animation frames in his home studio and finally shooting them using a homemade camera stand.&lt;ref name="KDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL"&gt;{{cite news|title=After 50 years in film, John Korty is still true|url=https://www.ptreyeslight.com/article/after-50-years-film-john-korty-still-true|accessdate=March 24, 2018|work=[[The Point Reyes Light]]|date=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking the Habit (1964)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69847388|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jessen|first1=Taylor|title=Damsel in Distress Currently on Fire: 20 Years later, ''Twice Upon a Time'' still burns|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ironybread/20yrs.htm|accessdate=April 2, 2018|work=Animation Blast|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Korty Shorts Program|url=https://www.bam.org/film/2015/john-korty-shorts-program|publisher=[[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Talking Picture Service distributed the film.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beck|first1=Jerry|authorlink1=Jerry Beck|title=Cartoons Considered For An Academy Award 1964|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/cartoons-considered-for-an-academy-award-1964/|publisher=Cartoonresearch.com|accessdate=March 24, 2018|date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Described variously as "[d]one in semi-surrealistic style" and having "deadpan dialogue with a minimalist animation style", ''Breaking the Habit'' received a nomination at the [[37th Academy Awards]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary (Short Subject)]] category but lost to ''[[Nine from Little Rock]]''.&lt;ref name="KDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oscars1965"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1965 |title=The 37th Academy Awards (1965) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=August 24, 2011|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[The Kingston Daily Freeman]]'' stated that the film "reveals both the danger and the essential silliness of smoking".&lt;ref name="KDF" /&gt;

      <comment>A caseworker is not a social worker.  I explained the difference.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15292">In [[social work]], a '''caseworker''' is similar to a type of [[social worker]] who is employed by a [[government agency]], [[non-profit organization]], or another group to take on the cases of individuals and provide them with [[advocacy]], information or other services. They are not required to have a social work degree or licensure as do Social Workers. Also, in [[political]] arenas, caseworkers are employed as a type of [[legislature|legislative]] staffer by legislators to provide service to their [[electoral district|constituents]] such as dealing with individual or family concerns and obtaining [[social services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.capwiz.com/congressorg/issues/basics/?style=staff Summary of congressional staffer positions]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, [[Roll Call]]&lt;/ref&gt; British [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and members of the [[United States Congress]] often provide constituent services through caseworkers for better use of their allotted funds.

== History of the term ==
The history of social casework is closely tied to the advent of [[social work]] as a general professional discipline. In the late nineteenth century, the formation of the [[Charity Organization Society]], and the [[Settlement movement]] represented the beginning of efforts towards alleviating industrial poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/settlement.html|title=Open Collections Program: Immigration to the US, Settlement House Movement|website=ocp.hul.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While social casework was a primary method of intervention, it was not until [[Mary Richmond]] published ''Social Diagnosis'' in 1917 that a formal definition for social casework began to formulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137855|title=Theories of social casework.|date=1970|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Towle, Charlotte., Roberts, Robert W.,, Nee, Robert H.,, University of Chicago. School of Social Service Administration.|isbn=0226721051|location=Chicago,|oclc=137855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Social Diagnosis'', Richmond advocated for working ''with'' clients, rather than on them, and for gaining "sympathetic understanding of the old world backgrounds from which the client came" in lieu of making generalizations or assumptions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62162050|title=Generalist case management : a method of human service delivery|last=Marianne.|first=Woodside,|date=2006|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole|others=McClam, Tricia.|isbn=049500488X|edition= 3rd |location=Belmont, CA|oclc=62162050}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term social diagnosis came to refer to "a systematic way for helping professionals to gather information and study client problems" based on each client's unique background, problems, and individualized needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social casework ==
Social casework is the method employed by social workers to help individuals find solutions to problems of social adjustment that are difficult for individuals to navigate on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Hollis, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Social casework is a primary approach and method of social work, concerned with the adjustment and development of the individual and, in some instances, couples, towards more satisfying human [[Interpersonal relationship|relations]]. In social casework, the relationship between a caseworker and their client is one of support, focused on "enabling an individual in solving a problem through self-efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ignou.ac.in/upload/bswe-02-block1-unit-1-small-size.pdf|title=Introduction to Social Casework: Historical Development|last=|first=|date=|website=Indira Gandhi National Open University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social casework relationship is a dynamic interaction of attitudes and emotions between the social caseworker and the client with the purpose of satisfying the clients psychosocial needs to achieve a better intrapersonal (interactions and transactions) adjustment by the client within the respective environment.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Robinson, ''A Changing Psychology in Social Case Work'', 1939&lt;/ref&gt; Psychosocial assessment is a key tool used in casework; it is the initial assessment of a client's current, relevant past, and possible future modes of adaptation to both stressful situations and normal living situations. Problem solving is the intent behind every social casework process; the caseworker doesn't solve the problem for the client, but helps the person in the situation to be equipped in solving or facing the problem adequately within the individual's weaknesses and [[Strength-based practice|strengths]] to the end of overall development.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Harris Perlman, ''Social Casework: A Problem-Solving Process'', 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Values in social casework ===
The social casework profession is focused on one primary goal: "to enhance human well-being and help meet the basic human needs of all people, with particular attention to the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty." Values maintained in casework are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dhawan, Nitesh|title=Social Work for UGC NET Paper II (Core)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yml4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|isbn=978-93-329-0119-3|pages=11+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Every individual has inherent worth and dignity.
# Every individual has the right to self-determination.
# Every individual is the primary concern of society, has potential for and the right to growth.
# Every individual, in turn, has to contribute to the society's development by assuming his social responsibility.
# The individual and society in which one lives are interdependent.
# Basic human needs have to be met by services which are not dependent upon in accord either to moral behaviour or to race, nationality, or caste.

=== Stages in social casework process ===
The stages are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.977.1625&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf A model of case management: toward empirically based practice (Jack Rothman, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intake and Rapport building
* Clinical exploration of the problem
* Assessment
* Intervention/ Treatment
* Monitoring and Evaluation
* Follow-up and Termination

=== Case management ===
{{further|Case management (mental health)}}

Social work case management is a process of linking clients to services that enhance their functional capacity, from assessment to comprehensive intervention for equitable client care.&lt;ref name="WoodsideMcClam16"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marianne R.

It is a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual's health needs through communication and provision of available resources to promote qualitative cost effective outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;National Standards of Practice for Case Management, cmsa.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; Here, health needs are within the social model of health which includes addressing the social and environmental determinants of health-the psycho-social, recreational, cultural and language needs in tandem with physical/biological and medical factors. These needs are defined by a problem's context, formulation, and definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Case management has alternatively been known as "service coordination" or "care coordination" since the late 1980s. Care coordination is defined by NASW as "a client-centered, assessment based, interdisciplinary approach to integrating health care and psychosocial support services in which a care coordinator develops and implements a comprehensive care plan that addresses the client's needs, strengths, and goals."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130222202805/https://www.socialworkers.org/advocacy/briefing/CareCoordinationBriefingPaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of case management one is based on objective aims of the service organization and the other is dependent on the individual or group who benefits the service. Case management differs from one setting to another depending upon the policies, tolerance and objectives however efficiency in services is a common element.&lt;ref name=WoodsideMcClam16/&gt; One such element that affects efficiency is caseloads. Department of Children and Families, United States recommends no more than 12–15 open/active cases and 8–10 new referrals per month when it comes to caseload and efficient management of workload. This post-2008 allocation of caseload management showed 90% efficiency in services and quality of practice by Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP), 2009. A general work load hours that takes for Case management is 3.30 hrs in which 1.45 hrs takes for case intake; Traditional individual – family assessment takes 3.45 hrs – 12.45 hrs as per Minnesota Workload Analytics for evidence based stabilizing and strengthening the workforce. To increase handling caseloads over-hiring and expanding employee benefits is a practice used by social services. Though Arizona's Department of Economic Security surveys show increasing caseloads alone above 35 cases per caseworker a month attracted repeated maltreatment reports and the ideal clients per case manager ratio suggested is 10:1. To reduce the caseload they focused on expanding prevention services which showed a positive effect.&lt;ref&gt;Child Welfare Information Gateway&lt;/ref&gt; Larger the caseload lesser the direct care will be and the services will be more of brokerage and crisis management.&lt;ref name="Davis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Davis|title=Community Mental Health in Canada, Revised and Expanded Edition: Theory, Policy, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XXQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249|year=2013|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2700-3|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case management is a part of direct social work practice, it involves development and implementation of the case plan and administration of case management systems for effective service delivery. This makes the case manager involve in resource development, service management, lean leadership, cost control, resource distribution, and use of authority. Due to the resource control aspect a Case manager's activity is also known as service management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betsy Vourlekis|author2=Roberta R. Greene|title=Social Work Case Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiAxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-48933-1|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic phases of case management are similar to the casework process:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abistafftraining.info/PDF/Case_Management_Practice_Guide_7_Phases_March2010.pdf Human Services Manual, NSW Government]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Screening and rapport building
* Psycho-social assessment and problem conceptualization
* Care planning within the prioritization of needs
* Specific resource allocation
* Implementation of a plan; service co-ordination
* Monitoring and review 
* Termination/Closure or re-assessment

In case management practice there are different models used:
# Case management – Assessment, monitoring, referral and coordination plus direct service role.
# Case monitoring model – Assessment, monitoring, referral and coordination only.
# Brokerage – Assessment, sub-contract/support services, monitor outcomes.
# Advocacy – Assessment, advocate for services, monitor outcomes.
# Managerial case management – Reviewing assessment and management plans submitted by caseworkers, monitoring costs, authorizing expenditure.

== Multicultural prevalence and acceptability ==
Caseworkers are employed by a large number of organizations in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], especially in the voluntary and public sectors. In the [[United States]], most government agencies that provide social services to children in poor or troubled families have a staff of caseworkers, each of whom is assigned a proportion of the cases under review at any given time. In [[Australia]], caseworkers may be assigned to work in [[child protection]], drug and alcohol services or community health organizations. As of 2004, there were approximately 876,000 child welfare caseworkers in the United States. Seventy-two percent are women, and the mean salary for all caseworkers was $64,590.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aecf.org/upload/publicationfiles/the%20unsolved%20challenge.pdf The Unsolved Challenge of System Reform] p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Foster_care_reform/foster_care_voices_021804.pdf Foster Care: Voices from the Inside] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028093929/http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Foster_care_reform/foster_care_voices_021804.pdf |date=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chronic mountain sickness''' ('''CMS''' or '''Monge's disease''') is a disease in which the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells increases ([[polycythaemia]]) and there is an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood ([[hypoxaemia]]). CMS typically develops after extended time living at high altitude (over {{conv|2500|metres|feet}}). It is most common amongst native populations of high altitude nations.&lt;ref name="Leon" /&gt; The most frequent symptoms of CMS are headache, dizziness, [[tinnitus]], [[Dyspnoea|breathlessness]], [[palpitations]], sleep disturbance, fatigue, [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], confusion, [[cyanosis]], and dilation of veins.&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=TY|title=Chronic mountain sickness on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.|journal=Chinese medical journal|date=20 January 2005|volume=118|issue=2|pages=161–8|pmid=15667803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMS was first described in 1925 by [[Carlos Monge Medrano]], a [[Peru]]vian doctor who specialised in diseases of high altitude.&lt;ref name="Monge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monge|first1=CC|last2=Whittembury|first2=J|title=Chronic mountain sickness.|journal=The Johns Hopkins medical journal|date=December 1976|volume=139 SUPPL|pages=87–9|pmid=1011412}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Altitude sickness|acute mountain sickness]] is experienced shortly after ascent to high altitude, chronic mountain sickness may develop only after many years of living at high altitude. In medicine, high altitude is defined as over {{conv|2500|metres|feet}}, but most cases of CMS occur at over {{conv|3000|metres|feet}}.

It has recently been correlated with increased expression of the genes ''[[ANP32D]]'' and ''[[SENP1]]''.&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=D|last2=Udpa|first2=N|last3=Ronen|first3=R|last4=Stobdan|first4=T|last5=Liang|first5=J|display-authors=etal|title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders.|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=5 September 2013|volume=93|issue=3|pages=452–62|pmid=23954164|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|pmc=3769925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=AM|last2=Petousi|first2=N|last3=Cavalleri|first3=GL|last4=Robbins|first4=PA|title=Genetic variation in SENP1 and ANP32D as predictors of chronic mountain sickness.|journal=High altitude medicine &amp; biology|date=December 2014|volume=15|issue=4|pages=497–9|pmid=25225945|doi=10.1089/ham.2014.1036|pmc=4273201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Although CMS generally affects people native to altitudes higher than {{conv|3000|metres|feet}}, it does not affect populations around the world equally. A recent study by Sahota and Panwar (2013)&lt;ref name="Sahota"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sahota|first1=I|last2=Panwar|first2=N|title=Prevalence of Chronic Mountain Sickness in high altitude districts of Himachal Pradesh |journal=Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |date=September 2013 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=94–100|doi= 10.4103/0019-5278.130839 |pmid=24872667 |pmc=4035612}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed CMS [[prevalence rate]]s around the world and found the highest rates were found in Andean countries of South America and the lowest rates in people native to the [[East African Mountains]] of Ethiopia. CMS prevalence rates reported from the study are summarised below:

* Ethiopia [3600–4100&amp;nbsp;m]: 0%
* Tibetan Plateau (Tibetans): 0.91–1.2%
* Indian Himalayas [3000–4200&amp;nbsp;m]: 4–7%
* Kyrgyzstan [3000–4200&amp;nbsp;m]: 4.6%
* Tibetan Plateau (Han Chinese): 5.6%
* La Paz, Bolivia [3600&amp;nbsp;m]: 6% to 8%
* Bolivia: 8–10%
* Cerro de Pasco, Peru [4300&amp;nbsp;m]: 14.8–18.2%

== Diagnosis ==
CMS is characterised by [[polycythaemia]] (with subsequent increased [[haematocrit]]) and [[hypoxaemia]]; raised blood pressure in the lungs ([[pulmonary hypertension]]) can develop over time and in some cases progress to heart failure ([[cor pulmonale]]).&lt;ref name="Leon" /&gt; CMS is believed to arise because of an excessive production of red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]) due to the low oxygen levels at altitude, which increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood{{ref|O2}}. The increased levels of erythrocytes causes increased blood viscosity and uneven blood flow through the lungs ([[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|V/Q mismatch]]). However, CMS is also considered an adaptation of pulmonary and heart disease to life under chronic hypoxia at altitude.&lt;ref name="Zub"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zubieta-Castillo G|first1=Sr|last2=Zubieta-Calleja GR|first2=Jr|last3=Zubieta-Calleja|first3=L|title=Chronic mountain sickness: the reaction of physical disorders to chronic hypoxia.|journal=Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology|date=September 2006|volume=57 Suppl 4|pages=431–42|pmid=17072074|url=http://www.altitudeclinic.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensus for clinical diagnosis of CMS use laboratory values: [[haemoglobin]] in Males ≥ 21 g/dL; Females ≥ 19 g/dL, [[haematocrit]] &gt; 65%, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) &lt; 85% in both genders.&lt;ref name="Leon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=León-Velarde|first1=F|last2=Maggiorini|first2=M|last3=Reeves|first3=JT|last4=Aldashev|first4=A|last5=Asmus|first5=I|display-authors=etal|title=Consensus statement on chronic and subacute high altitude diseases.|journal=High altitude medicine &amp; biology|date=2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=147–57|doi=10.1089/ham.2005.6.147|pmid=16060849|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Almaz_Aldashev/publication/7686405_Consensus_Statement_on_Chronic_and_Subacute_High_Altitude_Diseases/links/0912f51014ab6bf540000000/Consensus-Statement-on-Chronic-and-Subacute-High-Altitude-Diseases.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Migration to low altitude is curative, though not immediate, as the body adapts to the normal oxygen level near sea-level and the haematocrit normalises. Alternatively, bloodletting ([[phlebotomy]]) can be performed to lower the haematocrit temporarily; when combined with volume replacement with fluids this can have a longer effect.&lt;ref name="Leon" /&gt;

Medication with [[acetazolamide]], a [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]], has been shown to improve chronic mountain sickness by reducing [[erythropoietin]] and the resulting polycythaemia, which results in better arterial oxygenation and a lower heart rate.&lt;ref name="Richalet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richalet|first1=JP|last2=Rivera|first2=M|last3=Bouchet|first3=P|last4=Chirinos|first4=E|last5=Onnen|first5=I|display-authors=etal|title=Acetazolamide: a treatment for chronic mountain sickness.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=1 December 2005|volume=172|issue=11|pages=1427–33|doi=10.1164/rccm.200505-807OC|pmid=16126936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen therapy and training in slow breathing techniques has been shown to reduce symptoms through increasing blood oxygenation.&lt;ref name="Leon" /&gt;

==History==

===Timeline of Community Hospital of San Bernardino===

'''1909:''' Dr. Henry William Mills and [[Ralph E. Swing]] purchased the site of an old adobe saloon at 4th St. and Arrowhead Avenue, and began construction of a 2-story stucco hospital building.

'''1910:''' 42-bed Ramona Hospital opened.

'''1932:''' Bank took over operation of Ramona Hospital due to financial losses suffered during the [[Great Depression]].  16 Doctors, a Dentist, and a layman formed the Ramona Hospital Association, donating over $40,000 to buy the hospital back from the bank.

'''1938:''' Ramona Hospital Association reorganized into a charitable non-profit corporation with a new name - "San Bernardino Community Hospital".

'''1953:''' San Bernardino Community Hospital purchased property at the current location of 17th St. and Western Avenue.

The '''Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996''' is a bill (S. 1965) enacted into law (PL 104-237) by the [[104th Congress]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1965:|title=Bill Text Versions 104th Congress (1995-1996) S.1965|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It mandated registration of persons trading in list I chemicals from the [[DEA list of chemicals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1997/02/10/97-3086/comprehensive-methamphetamine-control-act-of-1996-possession-of-list-i-chemicals-definitions-record|title=Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996; Possession of List I Chemicals, Definitions, Record Retention, and Temporary Exemption From Chemical Registration for Distributors of Combination Ephedrine Products|publisher=Federal Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fee for such registration was initially $595 but later reduced to $116.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/dojmeth2.txt|title= Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act FAQ|date=1998-01-07|publisher=Erowid}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is regarded as one of the major [[drug laws]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facultypages.morris.umn.edu/~ratliffj/psy1081/drug_laws.htm|title=History of drug laws and restrictions in U.S.|author=Jeff Ratliff-Crain|publisher=University of Minnesota (Psy 1081 course)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==

The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act was composed as five titles sanctioning legislative authority for the control, exportation, importation, and manufacturing of methamphetamine substances and [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor chemicals]].

:Congressional assessment with regards to methamphetamine substances and precursor chemicals -

::The 104th U.S. Congress finds the following :
:::(1) Methamphetamine is a very dangerous and harmful drug. It is highly addictive and is associated with permanent [[brain damage]] in long-term users.
:::(2) The abuse of methamphetamine has increased dramatically since 1990. This increased use has led to devastating effects on individuals and the community, including —
::::(A) dramatic increase in deaths associated with methamphetamine ingestion
::::(B) increase in the number of violent crimes associated with methamphetamine ingestion
::::(C) increase in criminal activity associated with the [[Illegal drug trade|illegal importation]] of methamphetamine and precursor compounds to support the growing appetite for this drug in the United States
:::(3) Illegal methamphetamine manufacture and abuse presents an imminent public health threat that warrants aggressive law enforcement action, increased research on methamphetamine and other substance abuse, increased coordinated efforts to prevent methamphetamine abuse, and increased monitoring of the public health threat methamphetamine presents to the communities of the United States.

===Title I - Importation of Methamphetamine and Precursor Chemicals===

====Support for International  Efforts to Control Drugs====

:[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], in consultation with the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], shall coordinate international drug enforcement efforts to decrease the movement of methamphetamine and methamphetamine precursors into the United States.

===Title II - Provisions to Control the Manufacture of Methamphetamine===

====Seizure and Forfeiture of Regulated Chemicals====

:It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess any list I chemical obtained pursuant to or under authority of a registration issued to that person if that registration has been revoked or suspended, if that registration has expired, or if the registrant has ceased to do business in the manner contemplated by the registration.

====Study and Report on Measures to Prevent Sales of Agents used in Methamphetamine Production====

:(a) STUDY — The Attorney General of the United States shall conduct a study on possible measures to effectively prevent the diversion of [[Phosphorus|red phosphorus]], [[iodine]], [[Hydrogen chloride|hydrochloric gas]], and other agents for use in the production of methamphetamine. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Attorney General from taking any action the Attorney General already is authorized to take with regard to the regulation of listed chemicals under current law.
:(b) REPORT — Not later than January 1, 1998, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Congress of its findings pursuant to the study conducted on the need for and advisability of preventive measures.
:(c) CONSIDERATIONS — In developing recommendations, the Attorney General shall consider —
::(1) the use of red phosphorus, iodine, hydrogen chloride, and other agents in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine
::(2) the use of red phosphorus, iodine, hydrogen chloride, and other agents for legitimate and legal purposes, and the impact any regulations may have on these legitimate purposes
::(3) comments and recommendations from law enforcement, manufacturers of such chemicals, and the consumers of such chemicals for legitimate and legal purposes

====Increased Penalties for Manufacture and Possession of Equipment Used to Make Controlled Substances====

:Any person who, with the intent to manufacture or to facilitate the manufacture of methamphetamine, shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years, a fine of not more than $30,000, or both; except that if any person commits such a violation after one or more prior convictions of that person.
:Under any other law of the United States or any State relating to [[controlled substance]]s or listed chemicals, has become fined, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than twenty years, a fine of not more than $60,000, or both.

As used, the term 'laboratory supply' means a listed chemical or any chemical, substance, or item on a special surveillance list published by the Attorney General, which contains chemicals, products, materials, or equipment used in the manufacture of controlled substances and listed chemicals. There is a rebuttable presumption of reckless disregard at trial if the Attorney General notifies a firm in writing that a laboratory supply sold by the firm, or any other person or firm, has been used by a customer of the notified firm, or distributed further by that customer, for the unlawful production of controlled substances or listed chemicals a firm distributes and two weeks or more after the notification the notified firm distributes a laboratory supply to the customer.
:(b) CIVIL PENALTY — Penalties set forth elsewhere in this title or title III, any business that violates shall, with respect to the first such violation, be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $250,000, but shall not be subject to criminal penalties, and shall, for any succeeding violation, be subject to a civil fine of not more than $250,000 or double the last previously imposed penalty, whichever is greater.

====Injunctive Relief====

:INJUNCTIONS — In addition to any penalty, the Attorney General is authorized to commence a civil action for appropriate declaratory or [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] relating to violations.

====Restitution for Cleanup of Clandestine Laboratory Sites====

:The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under this title or title III involving the manufacture of methamphetamine, may order the defendant to reimburse the United States for the costs incurred by the United States for the [[Clandestine chemistry|clandestine chemical]] cleanup associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine by the defendant.

===Title III - Increased Penalties for Trafficking and Manufacture of Methamphetamine and Precursors===

====Penalty Increases for Trafficking in Methamphetamine====

:(a) DIRECTIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION — Pursuant to its authority, the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] shall review and amend its guidelines and its policy statements to provide for increased penalties for unlawful manufacturing, importing, exporting, and trafficking of methamphetamine, and other similar offenses, including unlawful possession with intent to commit any of those offenses, and attempt and conspiracy to commit any of those offenses. The Commission shall submit to Congress explanations therefor and any additional policy recommendations for combating methamphetamine offenses.
:(b) IN GENERAL — Any recommendations submitted under such subsection reflect the heinous nature of such offenses, the need for aggressive law enforcement action to fight such offenses, and the extreme dangers associated with unlawful activity involving methamphetamine, including —
::(1) rapidly growing incidence of methamphetamine abuse and the threat to public safety such abuse poses
::(2) high risk of methamphetamine addiction
::(3) increased risk of violence associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse
::(4) recent increase in the illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals

====Enhanced Penalties for Offenses Involving Certain Listed Chemicals====

:The United States Sentencing Commission shall amend the sentencing guidelines to increase by at least two levels the offense level for offenses involving list I chemicals.

===Title IV - Legal Manufacture, Distribution, and Sale of Precursor Chemicals===

:[[Pseudoephedrine]] or its salts, [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]], or salts of optical isomers, or [[phenylpropanolamine]] or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers unless otherwise provided by regulation of the Attorney General.

{{refimprove|date = August 2014}}
A '''data monitoring committee''' ('''DMC''') – sometimes called a '''data and safety monitoring board''' ('''DSMB''') – is an independent group of experts who monitor patient safety and treatment efficacy data while a [[clinical trial]] is ongoing.

== Need for a DMC ==

Many [[randomized clinical trial]]s are [[double blind]] &amp;ndash; no one involved with the trial knows what treatment is to be given to each trial participant. Blinding includes the participant, their doctor, and even the study personnel at the company or organization sponsoring the trial. Blinding is breached and true assignments disclosed only after the trial database is finalized.

Clinical trials may test an unknown procedure or may continue for years, and there is justifiable concern about enrolling participants and exposing them to an unproven treatment without ongoing oversight of the preliminary results. The DMC is a group (typically 3 to 7 members) who are independent of the entity conducting the trial.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} At least one DMC member will be a [[statistician]]. Clinicians knowledgeable about the disease indication should be represented, as well as clinicians knowledgeable in the fields of any major suspected safety effects. Ethicists or representatives from a patient advocacy group may be included, particularly for research involving [[Respect for persons|vulnerable populations]]. The DMC will convene at predetermined intervals (depending on the type of study) to review unblinded results.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The DMC has the power to recommend continuation or termination of the study based on the evaluation of these results. There are typically three reasons a DMC might recommend termination of the study: safety concerns, outstanding benefit, and futility.

== Safety concerns ==

The primary mandate of the DMC is to protect patient safety.  If [[adverse event]]s of a particularly serious type are more common in the experimental arm compared to the control arm, then the DMC would have to strongly consider termination of the study.  This evaluation has to be made in consideration of risk/benefit.  In many cases, the experimental arm could cause serious adverse events (chemotherapy, for example), but the resulting improvement in survival outweighs these adverse events.

== Overwhelming benefit ==

In the fortunate situation that the experimental arm is shown to be undeniably superior to the control arm the DMC may recommend termination of the trial.  This would allow the company sponsoring the trial to get regulatory approval earlier and to allow the superior treatment to get to the patient population earlier.  There are cautions here though.  The statistical evidence needs to be very high indeed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Also, there might be other reasons to continue, such as collecting more long-term safety data.

== Futility ==
Futility is not as widely recognized as safety and benefit, but actually can be the most common reason to stop a trial.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  As an example, suppose a trial is one-half completed, but the experimental arm and the control arm have nearly identical results.  It's likely in no one's interest to have this trial continue.  It is extremely unlikely that the trial, should it continue to its normal end, would have the statistical evidence needed to convince a regulatory agency to approve the treatment.  The company sponsoring the study could save money for other projects by abandoning this trial.  Also, current and potential trial participants could be freed to take other treatments, rather than this experimental treatment which is unlikely to benefit them.

The '''dental care in adolescent Australians''' is overall good. Studies have shown that the majority of the children in some regions of Australia are receiving the dental care that they need. However, other studies have shown that the children and young adults still encounter poor quality dental care, and some do not have access to a dentist due to financial barriers. Children in the lower income groups were the most likely to not receive the dental care they needed because of the cost of the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;"Financial Burden Of Dental Care Among Australian Children." ''Australian Dental Journal'' 59.2 (2014): 268-272 5p. ''CINAHL Complete''. Web. 23 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several things that the adolescents can do in order to stay proactive in healthy dental hygiene. Young Australians today have less tooth decay because of fluoride. Natural fluoride found in water has significantly increased the dental health of the adolescents, and decreased the tooth-aches. For those that do not have access to water with fluoride due to the area in which they live in, they can use alternatives such as toothpaste that does contain fluoride.

== Statistics ==

The [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] conducts periodical surveys of the dental health of Australian children and teenagers.  The Institute's 2010 survey&lt;ref name="Harford"&gt;Harford J.E. &amp; Luzzi L. (2013). Child and teenager oral health and dental visiting: Results from the
National Dental Telephone Interview Survey 2010. Dental Statistics and Research Series no. 64.
Cat. no DEN 226. Canberra: AIHW.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the majority of Australian children had good dental health, with 70% of children making a dental visit in the previous 12 months, and 84% of these visiting for a check-up.  However, it also found that:

* 7% of children had experienced toothache, and 10% avoided certain foods during the previous 12 months.
* Children from low income households were more likely to experience toothache and fair or poor oral health than were children from high income households, and children from these low income households were less likely to have visited a dentist. They were also 7 times more likely to have avoided or delayed dental visits due to cost.
* Less than one third of pre-school aged children had ever visited a dentist.

Levels of dental health also vary across demographics.  In particular, Indigenous Australians tend to score worse on almost every dental health indicator, relative to their non-Indigenous counterparts.&lt;ref name="Jamieson"&gt;Jamieson, L. M., Roberts-Thomson, K. F., &amp; Sayers, S. M. (2010). Dental caries risk indicators among Australian Aboriginal young adults. Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology, 38(3), 213-221. doi:10.1111/j.1600-0528.2009.00519.x&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Healthy Smiling Teeth.png|thumb|Example of a healthy adolescent smile]]

== Factors influencing dental health ==

Carbohydrate intake, accumulation and retention of plaque, frequency of exposure to dietary acids, exposure to fluoride and other trace elements, and natural protective factors such as saliva are five of the key factors that influence dental decay.&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Mount, G. &amp; Hume, W. (2005). Preservation and restoration of tooth structure, 2nd edn. Sandgate, Queensland: Knowledge Books.&lt;/ref&gt;   Dental health is also affected by the dental, diet, and lifestyle habits of individuals, and by the fluoridation of toothpaste and drinking water.

===Dental habits===

Early childhood is an important time to establish good dental health habits (including brushing and dental visits), reducing the risk of disease and leading to better health in adulthood.&lt;ref name="NSW"&gt;NSW Department of Health Centre for Oral Health Strategy. (2014).  Early Childhood Oral Health Guidelines for Child Health Professionals, 3rd Edition. Melbourne, New South Wales: Government of New South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, financial constraints can lead to children in lower income households being less likely to access dental care than those in higher income households.&lt;ref name="Harford" /&gt;

===Dietary habits===

High-sugar foods such muesli bars, [[candy|lollies]], and sugary drinks and juices can contribute to dental decay, as can refined carbohydrates found in crackers and chips.  The Australian Dental Association recommends that parents limit their children's intake of these foods, in favour of healthier snacks.&lt;ref name="ADA"&gt;Australian Dental Association [http://www.ada.org.au/app_cmslib/media/lib/0711/m102959_v1_healthyeating_factsheet.pdf "Health eating equals healthy teeth"] Retrieved on 19 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

International studies have also found eating disorders in adolescents can result in negative dental health consequences.&lt;ref name="Hermont"&gt;Hermont, A. P., Pordeus, I. A., Paiva, S. M., Abreu, M. H. N. G., &amp; Auad, S. M.  (2013). Eating disorder risk behavior and dental implications among adolescents. International Journal of Eating Disorders, 46(7), 677-683.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 paper suggests that the prevalence of eating disorders among Australian adolescents may be as much as 15% in females and 3% in males.&lt;ref name="Hay"&gt;Hay, P., Girosi, F., &amp; Mond, J. (2015). Prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of DSM-5 eating disorders in the Australian population. Journal of eating disorders, 3(1), 19. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug and alcohol use===

Smoking, and consumption of alcohol and other drugs can begin to have a negative impact on oral health as children enter adolescence.  Regular consumption of alcohol can lead to tooth decay, and smoking can result in gum damage and future oral cancers.&lt;ref name="Vic"&gt;Government of Victoria [http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Teeth_and_drug_use "Teeth and drug use"] Retrieved on 19 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluoridation===

[[Australian]]s born after 1967 were named the "Fluoride Generation" because they had been exposed to [[fluoridated water]] and [[Toothpaste#Fluorides|toothpaste that contained fluoride]] since birth.  [[Longitudinal studies]] have found that as young adults, this generation experienced half the level of decay observed in their parents' generation at the same age, and that much of the benefit of fluoridation was accrued in childhood rather than later life.&lt;ref name="Mejia"&gt;Mejia, G., G. D. Slade, and A. J. Spencer. "Australia’s dental generations: the National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004–06." (2007): 37-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2007}}, around 80% of Australians had access to fluoridated water, although this statistic varied significantly across jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;Government of the Northern Territory [http://www.health.nt.gov.au/library/scripts/objectifyMedia.aspx?file=pdf/64/53.pdf&amp;siteID=1&amp;str_title=Water%20Fluoridation%20and%20Disinfection%20Information%20FAQ.pdf "Water Fluoridation and Disinfection Information"] Retrieved on 19 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Enquiry into the Cost of the National Health Service''''', known popularly as the '''Guillebaud Report''', was a 1956 report of the [[UK Parliament]] into the financial efficiency of the [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Means|first=Robin|title=From Poor Law to community care : the development of welfare services for elderly people 1939-1971|year=1998|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781861340856|page=174|edition=2nd|author2=Smith, Randall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chair of the independent Committee of Enquiry, and lead author of the report, was the Cambridge economist [[C. W. Guillebaud]].&lt;ref name=chester&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chester|first=T. E.|title=The Guillebaud Report|journal=Public Administration|date=June 1956|volume=34|issue=2|pages=199–210|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1956.tb01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The enquiry was called by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Peter|title=The NHS in the UK : a pocket guide 2007/08|year=2007|publisher=NHS Confederation|location=London|isbn=9781859471364|page=206|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced on 1 April 1953 by the then Health Minister, [[Iain Macleod]].&lt;ref name=chester /&gt; The National Health Service (NHS) had been established in 1948 and, in its first few years, costs had risen faster than anticipated. The independent enquiry would examine the long-term issues of funding the Service. The terms of reference were to examine the present and prospective financial situation of the NHS, to recommend structural changes that would improve efficiency, and to advise and recommend how the Service could maintain quality without escalating expense.&lt;ref name=chester /&gt;  Guillebaud had been Macleod's tutor at Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kynaston|first1=David|authorlink = David Kynaston|title=Family Britain 1951-7|date=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747583851|page=253}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committee ==
In addition to Guillebaud, the committee included:&lt;ref name=chester /&gt;
* J. W. Cook, Professor of Chemistry at [[Glasgow University]]
* [[Anne Godwin]], Assistant General Secretary of the [[Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union]]
* Sir John Maude, past Permanent Secretary of the [[Ministry of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]]
* Sir [[Geoffrey Vickers]] of the [[National Coal Board]]

For statistical background, the committee used a memorandum published by [[Cambridge University Press]]: "The Cost of the National Health Service in England and Wales" by [[Brian Abel-Smith]] and [[Richard Titmuss]].&lt;ref name="Klein2010" /&gt;

== Findings ==
The published report found no extravagance or inefficiency beyond the inevitable imperfections of any organisation. It recommended no structural changes to the National Health Service.&lt;ref name="Klein2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nochange" /&gt; It found that the cost of the Service was not escalating as rapidly as had been feared, once [[inflation]] was taken into account.&lt;ref name="Klein2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rudolf Klein|title=The New Politics of the NHS: From Creation to Reinvention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSqJR-Oxv3AC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2010|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|isbn=978-1-84619-409-2|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for more public funding for hospital modernisation, recommending [[Pounds Sterling|£]]30 million pounds per year for seven years from 1958 onwards.&lt;ref name="nochange" /&gt; It also recommended increased funding for [[Care in the Community|community care]].&lt;ref name="nochange" /&gt;

The committee concluded that charges for dental treatment and for spectacles were undesirable. Citing the shortage of dentists, the report recommended keeping the dental charges but reducing the charges for spectacles as soon as resources allowed. The committee were divided about [[prescription charges]] that the Government had introduced in 1952. The report said that they "hindered the proper use of the Service by at least the great majority of its potential users" but still recommended that they be kept.&lt;ref name="Klein2010" /&gt;

The committee rejected the idea that there was a natural limit to the demand on the NHS. Instead they argued that the "acceptable" level of performance would rise indefinitely: "The advance of medical science continually places new demands on the Service, and the standards expected by the public also continue to rise."&lt;ref name="Klein2010" /&gt;

== Reaction ==
On its publication in 1956, Minister for Health [[Robin Turton, Baron Tranmire|Robin Turton]] told Parliament that the Government "broadly accepted" the conclusions of the Enquiry.&lt;ref name="nochange"&gt;[http://0-find.galegroup.com.catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wellcome&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS136926778&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "No Change In N.H.S."] ''Times'' [London, England] 26 Jan. 1956: 8. ''The Times Digital Archive''. Web. 26 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The Times]]'' said the report might superficially seem to be "a bluebook 
full of hogwash" but that in fact the committee had "argued their case with considerable thoroughness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://0-find.galegroup.com.catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wellcome&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS151475770&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "Budgeting for Health."] ''Times'' [London, England] 26 Jan. 1956: 9.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Ethylene glycol poisoning''' is [[poisoning]] caused by drinking [[ethylene glycol]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Early symptoms include [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[vomiting]] and [[abdominal pain]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Later symptoms may include a [[decreased level of consciousness]], [[headache]], and [[seizures]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Long term outcomes may include [[kidney failure]] and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Toxicity and death may occur after drinking even a small amount.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, commonly found in [[antifreeze]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully in an [[suicide|attempt to cause death]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; When broken down by the body it results in [[glycolic acid]] and [[oxalic acid]] which cause most of the toxicity.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; The diagnosis may be suspected when [[calcium oxalate crystals]] are seen in the urine or when [[acidosis]] or an increased [[osmol gap]] is present in the blood.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many [[hospital]]s do not have the ability to perform this test.&lt;ref name=Kr2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruse|first1=JA|title=Methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication.|journal=Critical Care Clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=661–711|pmid=22998995|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;

* Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of [[neurological]] and [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s and looks similar to alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Poisoned individuals may appear to be [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]], [[dizziness|dizzy]], [[ataxia|lacking coordination of muscle movements]], [[drooling]], [[depression (mood)|depressed]],&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; and have [[slurred speech]], [[seizure|seizuring]], [[pathologic nystagmus|abnormal eye movements]], [[headache]]s, and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Irritation to the stomach may cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; Also seen are excessive thirst and urination.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Over time, the body [[Metabolism|metabolizes]] ethylene glycol into other toxins.
* Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of "alcohol" poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; An [[tachycardia|elevated heart rate]], [[hyperventilation]] or increased breathing effort, and [[dehydration]] may start to develop, along with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[metabolic acidosis]].&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; These symptoms are a result of accumulation of [[organic acid]]s formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally [[hypocalcemia|low calcium concentrations in the blood]], [[hyperreflexia|overactive muscle reflexes]], [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[QT interval]] prolongation, and [[congestive heart failure]] may occur.

==Sources==
The most common source of ethylene glycol is automotive [[antifreeze]] or radiator coolant, where concentrations are high.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;  Other sources of ethylene glycol include windshield deicing agents, [[brake fluid]], motor oil, developing solutions for hobby photographers, wood stains, solvents, and paints.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Some people put antifreeze into their cabin’s toilet to prevent it from freezing during the winter, resulting in toxicities when animals drink from the toilet.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Small amounts of ethylene glycol may be contained in holiday ornaments such as [[snow globes]].&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;

The most significant source of ethylene glycol is from aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations, where it is released onto land and eventually to waterways near airports experiencing cold winter climates.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; It is also used in manufacturing polyester products.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; In 2006, approximately 1540 kilotonnes of ethylene glycol were manufactured in Canada by three companies in Alberta, with most of the production destined for export.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Glycolic acid3d.png|thumb|right|[[Glycolic acid]] is the major metabolite of ethylene glycol responsible for toxicity]]
The three main systems affected by ethylene glycol poisoning are the [[central nervous system]], [[metabolic]] processes, and the [[kidney]]s.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The central nervous system is affected early in the course of poisoning as the result of a direct action of ethylene glycol. Similar to [[ethanol]], it causes intoxication, followed by [[drowsiness]] or [[coma]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; [[Seizure]]s may occur due to a direct effect.&lt;ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"/&gt; The toxic mechanism of ethylene glycol poisoning is mainly due to the metabolites of ethylene glycol. Initially it is [[metabolized]] by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] to [[glycolaldehyde]], which is then oxidized to [[glycolic acid]] by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;  The increase in metabolites may cause [[encephalopathy]] or [[cerebral edema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maier W |title=Cerebral computed tomography of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6828232 |doi= 10.1007/BF00347839 |issn=0028-3940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic effects occur 12 to 36 hours post ingestion, causing primarily [[metabolic acidosis]] which is due mainly to accumulated glycolic acid. Additionally, as a side effect of the first two steps of metabolism, an increase in the blood concentration of [[lactic acid]] occurs contributing to [[lactic acidosis]]. The formation of acid metabolites also causes inhibition of other [[metabolic pathway]]s, such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;

The kidney toxicity of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and is caused by a direct [[cytotoxic]] effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to [[glyoxylic acid]] and finally to [[oxalic acid]]. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form [[calcium oxalate]] crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to [[oliguric]] or [[Anuria|anuric]] [[acute kidney failure]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid.&lt;ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R |title=Organic acids in ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=16–20 |date=July 1986 |pmid=3717806 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-105-1-16|url= |issn=0003-4819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clay KL, Murphy RC |title=On the metabolic acidosis of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=[[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |date=January 1977 |pmid=14421 |doi= 10.1016/0041-008X(77)90175-2|url= |issn=0041-008X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toxicity ===
Ethylene glycol has been shown to be toxic to humans&lt;ref name="Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ 1962 891–902"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ |title=Consequences of ethylene glycol poisoning.

A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg [[body weight]] (mL/kg) of [[Chemical substance|pure substance]]. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&amp;nbsp;kg adult and 4 mL for a 20&amp;nbsp;kg child. [[Poison control center]]s often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.&lt;ref name="Caravati"/&gt;

The orally [[lethal dose]] in humans has been reported as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&amp;nbsp;kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20&amp;nbsp;kg child. Although survival with medical treatment has occurred with doses much higher than this, death has occurred with 30 mL of the concentrate in an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eder AF, McGrath CM, Dowdy YG, Tomaszewski JE, Rosenberg FM, Wilson RB, Wolf BA, Shaw LM |title=Ethylene glycol poisoning: toxicokinetic and analytical factors affecting laboratory diagnosis |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=168–77 |date=January 1998 |pmid=9550575 |doi= |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9550575 |issn=0009-9147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Field DL |title=Acute ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=872–3 |date=October 1985 |pmid=4028762 |doi= 10.1097/00003246-198510000-00024|url= |issn=0090-3493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amathieu R, Merouani M, Borron SW, Lapostolle F, Smail N, Adnet F |title=Prehospital diagnosis of massive ethylene glycol poisoning and use of an early antidote |journal=Resuscitation |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=285–6 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16808995 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2005.12.014 |url= |issn=0300-9572}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|EU classification of dangerous substances]] it is 'harmful' (Xn) while more toxic substances are classified as 'toxic' (T) or 'very toxic' (T+).

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Calcium oxalate crystals in urine.jpg|thumb|Urine microscopy showing [[calcium oxalate]] crystals in the urine]]

As many of the [[Medical sign|clinical signs]] and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hall TL |title=Fomepizole in the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Canadian Journal of Emergency Medical Care |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=199–204 |date=May 2002 |pmid=17609006 |doi=10.1017/s1481803500006382 |url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf |issn=1481-8035 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m71phrDu?url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the [[Blood plasma|blood]] ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by [[gas chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aarstad K, Dale O, Aakervik O, Ovrebø S, Zahlsen K |title=A rapid gas chromatographic method for determination of ethylene glycol in serum and urine |journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8371550 |doi= 10.1093/jat/17.4.218|issn=0146-4760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this [[blood test]] and in the absence of this test the diagnosis must be made based on the clinical presentation of the patient.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the [[osmol gap|osmolal gap]]. The patients' serum [[osmolality]] is measured by [[freezing point depression]] and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured [[sodium]], [[glucose]], [[blood urea nitrogen]], and any [[ethanol]] that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffman RS, Smilkstein MJ, Howland MA, Goldfrank LR |title=Osmol gaps revisited: normal values and limitations |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |year=1993 |pmid=8433417 |doi=10.3109/15563659309000375 |url= |issn=0731-3810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased osmolal gap is caused by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Glaser DS |title=Utility of the serum osmol gap in the diagnosis of methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=343–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8599495 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(96)70271-8|url= |issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], or [[methanol]] or conditions such as [[Ketoacidosis|alcoholic]] or [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[lactic acidosis]], or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;

Other laboratory abnormalities may suggest poisoning, especially the presence of a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large [[anion gap]]. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of [[differential diagnosis]], including poisoning from methanol, [[salicylate]]s, [[Iron poisoning|iron]], [[isoniazid]], [[paracetamol]], [[theophylline]], or from conditions such as [[uremia]] or diabetic and [[alcoholic ketoacidosis]]. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; Urine [[microscopy]] can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen D, Akesson I, Shefter E |title=Urinary calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=231–4 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7134806 |doi= 10.3109/00365518209168078|url= |issn=0036-5513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many commercial radiator [[antifreeze]] products have [[fluorescein]] added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a [[Wood's lamp]]. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, [[vomitus]], or [[urine]] which can help to diagnose poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Winter ML, Ellis MD, Snodgrass WR |title=Urine fluorescence using a Wood's lamp to detect the antifreeze additive sodium fluorescein: a qualitative adjunctive test in suspected ethylene glycol ingestions |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=663–7 |date=June 1990 |pmid=2344083 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(05)82472-2|url= |issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace KL, Suchard JR, Curry SC, Reagan C |title=Diagnostic use of physicians' detection of urine fluorescence in a simulated ingestion of sodium fluorescein-containing antifreeze |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11423812 |doi=10.1067/mem.2001.115531 |url= |issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Antifreeze products for automotive use containing [[propylene glycol]] in place of ethylene glycol are available, and are generally considered safer to use, as it possesses an unpleasant taste in contrast to the perceived "sweet" taste of toxic ethylene glycol-based coolants, and only produces [[lactic acid]] in an animal's body, as their muscles do when exercised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |title=Ethylene Glycol Poisoning |author=Pieter Klapwijk |date=January 27, 2010 |work= |publisher=The Rested Dog Inn |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126003300/http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |archivedate=January 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2012}}

When using antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol, recommended safety measures include:
* Cleaning up any spill immediately&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt; and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material directly on the spill.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;
* Checking vehicles regularly for leaks.&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt;
* Storing antifreeze in clearly marked original sealed containers, in areas that are inaccessible to pets&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt; or small children.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;
* Keeping pets and small children away from the area when draining the car radiator.&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt;
* Disposing of used antifreeze only by taking to a service station.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;
* If antifreeze is placed in toilets, ensuring the lid is down and the door closed.&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;

== Treatment ==

=== Stabilization and decontamination ===
The most important initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, [[gastric]] decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, [[gastric lavage]] or [[nasogastric aspiration]] of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vale JA, Kulig K |title=Position paper: gastric lavage |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=933–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15641639 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200045006 |url= |issn=0731-3810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syrup of ipecac|Ipecac]]-induced [[vomiting]] is not recommended.

If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt; [[Intubation]] and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with [[hypotension]] require treatment with [[intravenous]] fluids and possibly [[vasopressor]]s.&lt;ref name="Brent-2009"/&gt;

=== Antidotes ===
Following decontamination and the institution of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using [[antidote]]s. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are [[ethanol]] and [[fomepizole]]. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning.  The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid.  The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites.  Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway.  Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation.  Without oxalic acid formation, the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body.  It is eventually excreted in the urine, but supportive therapy for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits.  Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% [[dextrose]], but it is also sometimes given orally in the form of a strong spirit such as [[whisky]], [[vodka]], or [[gin]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;

Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block the formation of the toxic metabolites.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=21 |pages=2216–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19458366 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806112 |issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEJM-Brent"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent J, McMartin K, Phillips S, Burkhart K, Donovan J, Wells M, Kulig K | title = Fomepizole for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning.

Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, [[hypoglycemia]] in children, and possible [[liver]] toxicity.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"/&gt; Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic]] ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an [[intensive care unit]]. Alternatively, the adverse [[adverse effect|side effects]] of fomepizole are minimal{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shannon M |title=Toxicology reviews: fomepizole--a new antidote |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=170–2 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9583406 |doi= 10.1097/00006565-199804000-00021|url= |issn=0749-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scalley RD, Ferguson DR, Piccaro JC, Smart ML, Archie TE |title=Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=American Family Physician|volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=807–12 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12322772 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=12322772 |issn=0002-838X |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning.&lt;ref name="NEJM-Brent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borron-Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borron SW, Mégarbane B, Baud FJ |title=Fomepizole in treatment of uncomplicated ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=The Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9181 |pages=831 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10485727 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)80015-4 |url= |issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjunct agents including [[thiamine]] and [[pyridoxine]] are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or [[alcoholic]] patients.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt;

=== Hemodialysis ===
In addition to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning is the use of [[hemodialysis]]. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It has been shown to be highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood.&lt;ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreau CL, Kerns W, Tomaszewski CA, McMartin KE, Rose SR, Ford MD, Brent J |title=Glycolate kinetics and hemodialysis clearance in ethylene glycol poisoning.

Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood [[pH]] less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe [[electrolyte imbalance]], or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment.&lt;ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt; Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; If hemodialysis is not available, then [[peritoneal dialysis]] also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aakervik O, Svendsen J, Jacobsen D |title=[Severe ethylene glycol poisoning treated with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole)] |language=Norwegian |journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske lægeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny række |volume=122 |issue=25 |pages=2444–6 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12448112 |doi= |issn=0029-2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Treatment for antifreeze poisoning needs to be started as soon after ingestion as possible to be effective; the earlier treatment is started, the greater the chance of survival.&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinical Chemistry"/&gt; Cats must be treated within 3 hours of ingesting of antifreeze to be effective, while dogs must be treated within 8–12 hours of ingestion.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Once kidney failure develops, the prognosis is poor.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;

Ethylene glycol was once thought innocuous; in 1931 it was suggested as being suitable for use as a vehicle or solvent for injectable pharmaceutical preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Hanzlik PJ, Seidenfeld MA, Johnson CC|title= General properties, irritant and toxic actions of ethylene glycol|journal= The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 387–406|year= 1931|doi= |url= http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/4/387|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081013202204/http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/4/387|archivedate= 2008-10-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported since then, and it has been shown to be toxic to humans.&lt;ref name="Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ 1962 891–902"/&gt;

==Environmental effects==
Ethylene glycol involved in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations is released onto land and eventually to waterways.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; A report prepared for the World Health Organization in 2000 stated that laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have shown toxic effects and death (p.&amp;nbsp;12).&lt;ref name="WHO Report"/&gt; Field studies in the vicinity of an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity, although those effects could not definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol (p.&amp;nbsp;12).&lt;ref name="WHO Report"/&gt; The process of biodegrading of glycols also increases the risk to organisms, as oxygen levels become depleted in surface waters (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref name="WHO Report"/&gt; Another study found the toxicity to aquatic and other organisms was relatively low, but the oxygen-depletion effect of biodegradation was more serious (p.&amp;nbsp;245).&lt;ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/&gt; Further, "Anaerobic biodegradation may also release relatively toxic byproducts such as acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetate, and methane (p. 245)."&lt;ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/&gt;

In Canada, [[Environment Canada]] reports that "in recent years, management practices at Canada’s major airports have improved with the installation of new ethylene glycol application and mitigation facilities or improvements to existing ones."&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; Since 1994, federal airports must comply with the Glycol Guidelines of the [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999|Canadian Environmental Protection Act]], monitoring and reporting on concentrations of glycols in surface water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=FD028E79-1 "Glycol Guidelines"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913080539/https://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=FD028E79-1 |date=2014-09-13 }}, Government of Canada, Environment Canada, Jan. 20, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed mitigation plans include storage and handling issues (p.&amp;nbsp;27), spill response procedures, and measures taken to reduce volumes of fluid (p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name="Canadian glycol mitigation at airports"/&gt; Considering factors such as the "seasonal nature of releases, ambient temperatures, metabolic rates and duration of exposure", [[Environment Canada]] stated in 2014 that "it is proposed that ethylene glycol is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity".&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt;

In the U.S., airports are required to obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated.&lt;ref name="US airport deicing"/&gt; Large new airports may be required to collect 60 percent of aircraft [[deicing fluid]] after deicing.&lt;ref name="US airport deicing"/&gt; Airports that discharge the collected aircraft [[deicing fluid]] directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand.&lt;ref name="US airport deicing"/&gt; A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.&amp;nbsp;213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.&amp;nbsp;I-3).&lt;ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/&gt;

==Other animals==
Once kidney failure has developed in dogs and cats, the outcome is poor.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24187">Uganda's health system is composed of health services delivered to the public sector, by private providers, and by traditional and [[complementary health]] practitioners. It also includes community-based health care and health promotion activities.

== Structure of health system ==

The not-for-profit providers are run on a national and local basis and 78% are [[religion|religiously]] based.&lt;ref name="Fiscal Space"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The World Bank|first=|year=2010|title=Fiscal Space for Health in Uganda|url=|journal=Africa Human Development Series|volume=186|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three main providers include the [[Uganda Catholic Medical Bureau]], [[Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau]], and the [[Uganda Muslim Medical Bureau]].&lt;ref name="Fiscal Space"/&gt;  [[Non-governmental organization|Nongovernmental organizations]]&amp;nbsp;have emerged as the prominent not-for-profit organizations for HIV/AIDS counseling and treatment.&lt;ref name="USAID"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=USAID|first=|year=2012|title=Uganda Health System Assessment 2011|url=|journal=Health Systems|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The for-profit providers include clinics and informal drug stores. Formal providers include medical and dental practitioners, [[Nursing|nurses]] and [[Midwife|midwives]], pharmacies, and&amp;nbsp;[[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref name="USAID"/&gt; Traditional providers include&amp;nbsp;[[Herbalism|herbalists]],&amp;nbsp;[[Energy medicine|spiritual healers]],&amp;nbsp;[[traditional birth attendant]]s,&amp;nbsp;[[Hydrotherapy|hydro therapists]], etc.&lt;ref name="Fiscal Space"/&gt;

Uganda's health system is divided into national and district-based levels. At the national level are the national referral hospitals, regional referral hospitals, and semi-autonomous institutions including the Uganda Blood Transfusion Services, the [[Uganda National Medical Stores]], the Uganda Public Health Laboratories and the Uganda National Health Research Organization (UNHRO).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|location=Kampala | url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s18426en/s18426en.pdf|title=The Second National Health Policy: Promoting People's Health to Enhance Socio-Economic Development", Uganda Ministry of Health, July 2010|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Quoting [[Ministry of Health (Uganda)]] |author=Stephen Mallinga
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of Uganda's health system is to deliver the national minimum health care package. Uganda runs a decentralized health system with national and district levels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The lowest rung of the district-based health system consists of Village Health Teams (VHTs). These are volunteer [[community health workers]] who deliver predominantly [[health education]], [[preventive healthcare|preventive services]], and simple [[curative care|curative services]] in communities. They constitute level 1 health services. The next level is Health Center II, which is an out patient service run by a nurse. It is intended to serve 5000 people. Next in level is Health Center III (HCIII) which serves 10,000 people and provides in addition to HC II services, in patient, simple diagnostic, and [[maternal health]] services. It is managed by a [[clinical officer]]. Above HC III is the Health Center IV, run by a medical doctor and providing surgical services in addition to all the services provided at HC III. HC IV is also intended to provide [[blood transfusion]] services and comprehensive emergency [[obstetrics|obstetric]] care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=16 October 2016 | date=2000 | format=PDF | url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/383606-1201883571938/Uganda_HSSP.pdf | title=Uganda Ministry of Health: Health Sector Strategic Plan 2000/01 – 2004/05 | publisher=[[World Bank]] Quoting [[Ministry of Health (Uganda)]] (MHU) | location=Kampala| last=MHU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of governance, the MOH is currently implementing the HSSIP, which is the third iteration of health sector strategies. The MOH coordinates stakeholders and is responsible for planning, budgeting, policy formulation, and regulation.&lt;ref name="Apply"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/meeting-the-challenges-of-decentralised-health-service-delivery-in-uganda-as-a-component-of-broader-health-sector-reforms|title=Meeting the challenges of decentralised health service delivery in Uganda as a component of broader health sector reforms|date=1 January 2006|publisher=[[Department for International Development]]|location=London|accessdate=17 October 2016|author=Tashobya C.|author2=Nabyonga J.|author3=Murindwa G.|author4=Kyabaggu J.|author5=Rutebemberwa E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 published report, the health sector at the district and sub-district level is governed by the district health management team (DHMT). The DHMT is led by the district health officer (DHO) and consists of managers of various health departments in the district. The heads of health sub-districts (HC IV managers) are included on the DHMT. The DHMT oversees implementation of health services in the district, ensuring coherence with national policies. A Health Unit Management Committee (HUMC) composed of health staff, civil society, and community leaders is charged with linking health facility governance with community needs.&lt;ref name="Apply" /&gt;

In addition, the [[Uganda Medical Association]] (UMA) seeks to "provide programs that support the social welfare and professional interests of medical doctors in Uganda and to  promote universal access to quality health and health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uma.ug/who-we-are/about-uma|title=Uganda Medical Association - About UMA|last=User|first=Super|website=www.uma.ug|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government's failure to improve the compensation of doctors , as well as failing to conduct a review of the supply of medicines and other equipment in health centres across the country, led to a UMA strike in November 2017, effectively paralysing Uganda's health system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/16/costing-lives-doctors-strike-health-service-uganda|title=Uganda brought to its knees as doctors' strike paralyses health service|last=Okiror|first=Samuel|date=2017-11-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health system reforms==

At the beginning of the 21st century, the government of Uganda began implementing a series of [[health care reform|health sector reforms]] that were aimed at improving the poor health indicators prevailing at the time. A [[Sector-Wide Approach]] (SWAp) was introduced in 2001 to consolidate health financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=12406470 | title=SWAp dynamics in a decentralized context: experiences from Uganda | author=Jeppsson A | journal=Social Science and Medicine | date=December 2002 | volume=55 | issue=11 | pages=2053–2060 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00345-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another demand side reform introduced in the same year was the abolition of [[user fee]]s at public health facilities, which triggered a surge in outpatient attendances across the country.&lt;ref name="Free"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/11/07-049197/en/ | title=The impact of user fees on health service utilization in low- and middle-income countries: how strong is the evidence? | author=Mylene Lagarde | author2=Natasha Palmer | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization | accessdate=16 October 2016 | location=Geneva | volume=86 | issue=11 | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=16 October 2016 | format=PDF | url=http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/dp_e_05_4-user_fee_elimination_uganda.pdf | author=Ke Xu | author2=David B Evans | author3=Patrick Kadama | author4=Juliet Nabyonga | author5=Peter Ogwang Ogwal | author6=Ana Mylena Aguilar | title=The elimination of user fees in Uganda: Impact on utilization and catastrophic health expenditures | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | location=Geneva | date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Decentralization]] of health services began in the mid-1990s alongside wider [[devolution]] of all [[public administration]], and was sealed in 1998 with the definition of the health sub-district. Implementation of the health sub district concept extended into the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Apply"/&gt;

To improve medicines management and availability, the government of Uganda made medicines available to [[non-profit hospital|private-not-for-profit]] (PNFP) providers. With decentralization of health services, a "pull" system was instituted in which district and health facility managers were granted [[autonomy]] to procure medicines they needed in the required quantities from the national medical stores, within pre-set [[Earmark (politics)|financial earmarks]]. The result was better availability of medicines.&lt;ref name="More"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnadz297.pdf | accessdate=16 October 2016 | format=PDF | title=Uganda Health System Assessment System Assessment 2011 | publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] | author=Scott Stewart | location=Washington, D. C. | date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health system performance==

A comprehensive review of Uganda's Health System conducted in 2011 by USAID uncovered strengths and weaknesses of the health system, organized around the six technical [[health system|building blocks of health system]] that were defined by the WHO. In summary, the assessment found that whereas significant efforts are being implemented to qualitatively and quantitatively improve health in Uganda, more needs to be done to focus on the poor, improve engagement of the [[for-profit hospital|private-for-profit]] sector, enhance efficiency, strengthen stakeholder coordination, improve [[Health care quality|service quality]], and stimulate consumer-based [[advocacy]] for better health.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnadz297.pdf|title=UGANDA HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=USAID|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Health (MOH) also conducts annual health sector performance appraisals that assess health system performance and monitor progress in delivery of the UNMHCP.&lt;ref name="More"/&gt; The 2011 USAID report assessing Uganda's health care system pointed to the fact that the UNMHCP often sets health sector targets and activities without an adequate analysis of the costs involved or the implementation of measures to allocate required resources appropriately.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A number of factors affect the quality of services in Uganda, including the shortage of healthcare workers and lack of trust in them, a lack of needed treatments, high costs, and long distances to facilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiguli|first=Julie|year=2009|title=Increasing access to quality health care for the poor: Community perceptions on quality care in Uganda|url=|journal=Patient Preference and Adherence|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a survey conducted of Ugandan patients indicated a decline in the performance of the public sector health services. These were indicated through comments about poor sanitation, a lack of professionals and drugs and equipment, long wait times, inadequate preventative care, a poor referral system, rude health workers, and lack of services for vulnerable populations like the poor and elderly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The quality of services affects utilization in different ways, including preventing patients from seeking out delivery services or leading them to see traditional providers, self-medicate, and decide not to seek formal care or seeing private providers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Health workforce==

There is a significant shortage of health workers in Uganda.&amp;nbsp;A Human Resources for Health Policy is in place to guide recruitment, deployment, and [[Retention rate|retention]] of health staff. In spite of this, shortages of health workers persist. According to a 2009 published report, there is one doctor for every 7,272 Ugandans. The related statistic is 1:36,810 for nurse/midwifery professionals. The shortages are worse in rural areas where 80 percent of the population resides, as 70 percent of all doctors are practicing in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Human Resources for Health Country Profile, Uganda Members Document | author=Africa Health Workforce Observatory | date=2009 | url=http://www.who.int/workforcealliance/knowledge/resources/hrh_profile_uganda/en/ | accessdate=16 October 2016 | location=Geneva | publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 61 institutions that train health workers, with five medical colleges, twenty-seven allied health training schools, and twenty nine nursing schools.

[[Community health worker]]&amp;nbsp;training has increased since the 2000s. The&amp;nbsp;[[Ministry of Health (Uganda)|Ugandan Ministry of Health]]&amp;nbsp;implemented the Village Health Teams (VHT) Training Program to develop community health workers who connect rural communities to health facilities and aid in the spread of preventative knowledge about&amp;nbsp;[[malaria]],&amp;nbsp;[[pneumonia]], worm infestations,&amp;nbsp;[[diarrhea]], and&amp;nbsp;[[Neglected tropical diseases|neglected tropical disease]].[[Health in Uganda#cite note-:2-17|&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;VHTs have also aided in health campaigns and disease surveillance. Nongovernmental organizations, such as Health Child Uganda and Omni Med, have also been working with the Ministry of Health to train and maintain VHTs.[[Health in Uganda#cite note-18|&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

An assessment of VHT abilities led to the creation of a Community Health Extension Worker (CHEW) Program, which involves the training of health workers for a year in all districts of the nation.[[Health in Uganda#cite note-:2-17|&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;]]Unlike VHTs, CHEWs will possess elevated skills in addressing the health needs of their communities, will be based at the Health Center II level.[[Health in Uganda#cite note-:2-17|&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;The CHEW program is planned for implementation in 2017 and 2018.[[Health in Uganda#cite note-:2-17|&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Health financing==

Total public and private health expenditure [[per capita]] was US$59 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=The World Bank | title=Health expenditure per capita (current US$) | url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP | access-date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[government spending|Public financing]] for health was 4.3 percent of GDP in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=The World Bank | title=Health expenditure, public (% of GDP) | url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS | access-date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; well below the target of 15 percent set in the [[Abuja Declaration (2001)|2001 Abuja Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/publications/abuja_declaration/en|title=The Abuja Declaration: Ten Years On|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service delivery==

In 2006, there were 3,237 [[Health facility|health facilities]] in Uganda.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Seventy-one percent were public entities, 21 percent were not-for-profit organizations, and 9 percent were for-profit.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The doubling in public and not-for-profit facilities was primarily driven by the government’s initiative to improve access to services.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} However, 68 percent of these services are located in the capital [[Kampala]] and the surrounding central region, while rural areas face a gross shortage of such facilities.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

According to the Uganda National Household Survey 2012/2013, the majority of those who sought health care first visited a private hospital orclinic (37 percent) or a government health centre (35 percent). Twenty-two percent of the urban population used government health centers, while that proportion rose to 39 percent in the rural areas. Thirty-five percent of government health centers visited by persons who fell sick were within a radius of {{convert|5|km|0}} from the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | format=PDF | url=http://www.ubos.org/onlinefiles/uploads/ubos/UNHS_12_13/2012_13%20UNHS%20Final%20Report.pdf | title=Uganda National Household Survey 2012/2013 | publisher=[[Uganda Bureau of Statistics]] (UBOS) | accessdate=16 October 2016 | date=May 2014 | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fertility rate and family planning==

Uganda has the second-highest fertility rate in the East African Community, behind only Burundi. According to 2014 data, a Ugandan woman, on average, gives birth to 5.8 children during her lifetime compared to 7.1 in 1969 and 6.8 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=The World Bank | publisher=[[The World Bank]] | title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) | date=2015 |
url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=UG | accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age-specific fertility rates indicate that fertility peaks when women are aged between 20 and 24 years and then declines slowly until age 34. According to 2011 data, the fertility rate in urban areas (3.8 per woman) was significantly lower than in rural areas (6.7 per woman).&lt;ref name="Pregdata"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 October 2016 | url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/PR18/PR18.pdf | date=March 2012 | publisher=[[Uganda Bureau of Statistics]] (UBOS) and ICF International Inc. (ICFI) | title=Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2011 | author=UBOS &amp; ICFI | location=Kampala &amp; Calverton, Maryland, US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on 2012 data, 30 percent of married Ugandan women are using some method of contraception, with 26 percent using modern contraceptive methods (MCM), such as [[sterilization (medicine)|female and male sterilization]], [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]], [[intrauterine device]], [[combined injectable contraceptive|injectables]], [[Levonorgestrel implant|implants]], [[condom|male condom]], [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]], and the [[lactational amenorrhea]] method. MCM were used by only 8 percent of married Ugandan women in 1995.&lt;ref name="Pregdata"/&gt; There is a gap between the demand for contraception and the amount of contraception being made available. Several organisations are providing health education and contraceptive services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nalwadda | first1=Gorrette | last2=Mirembe | first2=Florence | last3=Byamugisha | first3=Josephat | last4=Faxelid | first4=Elisabeth | title=Persistent high fertility in Uganda: young people recount obstacles and enabling factors to use of contraceptives | journal=BMC Public Health | date=2010 | volume=10 | issue=30 | format=PDF | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-10-530.pdf | doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-530 | accessdate=17 October 2016 | pages=530 | pmid=20813069 | pmc=2940919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antenatal care, facility deliveries, and postnatal care==

{{main|Maternal health in Uganda}}
Antenatal care (ANC) coverage in Uganda in 2011 was almost universal with more than 95 percent of women attending at least one visit. Only 48 percent of women, however, attended the recommended four visits. Deliveries in health facilities accounted for about 57 percent of all deliveries, far below the number of women who attend at least one ANC visit. That percentage had risen from 41 percent between 2006 and 2011.&lt;ref name="Pregdata"/&gt;

Only one-third of women received postnatal care (PCN) in the first two days after delivery. In 2011, only two percent of mothers received a PNC check up in the first hour for all births in two years before the 2011 Uganda Demographic Household Survey.&lt;ref name="Pregdata"/&gt;

==Sexual health==

Sexual health in Uganda is affected by the prevalence of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), poor health-seeking behaviours regarding STIs, violence, and female genital mutilation that affect female sexuality in isolated communities in the north-eastern part of the country. As of 2015, Uganda's national HIV prevalence rate was 7.2 percent among adults aged 15–59 years, representing an increase from 6.7 percent in 2005. Prevention now includes voluntary male circumcision, although sexual behaviors among circumcised men need more understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kibira | first1=Simon Peter | last2=Nansubuga | first2=Elizabeth | last3=Tumwesigye | first3=Nazarius | last4=Atuyambe | first4=Lynn | last5=Makumbi | first5=Fredrick | title=Differences in risky sexual behaviors and HIV prevalence of circumcised and uncircumcised men in Uganda: evidence from a 2011 cross-sectional national survey | journal=Reproductive Health | date=2014 | volume=11 | issue=25 | doi=10.1186/1742-4755-11-25 | url=http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/pdf/1742-4755-11-25.pdf | access-date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2018, there was an estimated 1,350,000 people living with [[HIV/AIDS]] in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ug.usembassy.gov/u-s-government-renews-commitment-to-fight-hiv-aids-in-uganda-2/ |title=U.S. Government Renews Commitment To Fight HIV/AIDS In Uganda |date=27 April 2018 |publisher=U.S. Embassy in Uganda |author=U.S. Embassy in Uganda |access-date=24 August 2018 |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uganda is one of the three countries where randomized [[controlled trials]] were conducted to determine whether voluntary [[male circumcision]] reduces transmission of HIV from women to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV prevention | date=July 2012 | accessdate=16 October 2016 | last=WHO | url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/fact_sheet/en/ | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uganda is home to the [[Uganda Virus Research Institute]], a viral research facility.

==Men's health==

Issues affecting men including violence, sexually transmitted diseases, prostate cancers, infertility, HIV, and non-communicable diseases that affect sexual performance. The latest intervention that could improve men's sexual health is male circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=17 October 2016 | url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/ | location=Geneva | title=HIV/AIDS: Male circumcision for HIV prevention | author=WHO | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ICD-10]] is an international [[medical classification|statistical classification]] produced by the [[World Health Organization]]. It is used in [[health care]] and related industries in several countries around the world. Some have gone on to develop their own national enhancements, building off the international version of the classification.

The fifth chapter of ICD-10 contains the ''International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders.'' It is actually the official mental health system for the US as well, but even many professionals do not realize this due to the dominance of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geoffrey M. Reed|first=|year=2010|title=Toward ICD-11: Improving the clinical utility of WHO's International Classification of mental disorders|url=http://www.apa.org/international/outreach/icd-reed.pdf|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=41|issue=6|pages=457–464|doi=10.1037/a0021701|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO have made Chapter V available as two separate publications.&lt;ref&gt;The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: ''"Blue Book“'' ([http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines]) und "Green Book“ ([http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf Diagnostic criteria for research])&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines'' (or "Blue Book") is for clinical and general educational use. The ''Diagnostic criteria for research'' (or "Green Book") is intended for research purposes, and to be used in conjunction with the guidelines within it.

The '''Jaipur Foot''', also known as the '''Jaipur Leg''', is a rubber-based [[Artificial limb|prosthetic leg]] for people with below-knee [[amputation]]s. Although inferior in many ways to the composite carbon fibre variants, its variable applicability and cost efficiency make it an acceptable choice for prosthesis. Ram Chandra Sharma designed and developed it in 1968.&lt;ref name=name&gt;http://www.jaipurfoot.org/03_Technology_history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Designed in and named after [[Jaipur]], [[India]], the prosthetic leg was designed to be inexpensive, water-resistant, and quick to fit and manufacture. The Jaipur Foot is made of polyurethane, which at the time was the new material used in the production of the prostheses. The material increases the durability and the convenience of use. Now the government of India supports Bhagwan Mahavir Viklang Sahyata Samiti with financial aid to carry out the work done by the organization. The Jaipur Foot has helped many people to overcome their leg disability{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

The idea of the Jaipur Foot was conceived by Ram Chander Sharma under the guidance of Dr. P.K. Sethi, who was then the head of the Department of Orthopedics at [[Sawai ManSingh Medical College]] in [[Jaipur]], [[India]]. 

It is fitted free of cost by Bhagwan Mahavir Viklang Sahyata Samiti, founded by [[D. R. Mehta|Devendra Raj Mehta]]. It costs approximately $US 45 to make.

==Other Advantages==

The Jaipur Foot is superior to its SACH (Solid Ankle Cushion Heel) counterpart in certain ways, mainly in the range of movements it offers. The articulation at the 'ankle' allows not only inversion-eversion movements but also dorsiflexion (essential for squatting, standing up from prone position, etc.) and a shorter keel helps achieve this. Also, the materials used at the foot-end are waterproof and moderately mimic a real foot.

These features help a physically-challenged person assimilate more easily in a semi-urban or rural setup in the Indian subcontinent and other developing countries.

==In popular culture==
[[Sudha Chandran]], an Indian actress and dancer, lost her limb in an accident in 1982. She was fitted with the Jaipur Foot and started dancing once again; her journey is the theme of the Telugu 1984 film ''[[Mayuri (film)|Mayuri]]'' (Peahen), remade into a 1986 Hindi film, ''[[Naache Mayuri]]'' (Peahen Dancing). Both the films starred Sudha as the lead.&lt;ref name="Somaaya2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Somaaya|first=Bhawana|authorlink=Bhawana Somaaya|title=The Story So Far|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mK4aAQAAIAAJ|year=2003|page=153|publisher=Indian Express Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Awards==
[[P. K. Sethi]] {{Clarify|date=March 2013}} was awarded the [[Magsaysay Award]] for Community Leadership in 1981,&lt;ref name="Ramon_Magsaysay"&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationSethiPra.htm The 1981 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership: Citation for Pramod Karan Sethi] (accessed 28 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Padma Shri]] by the [[Government of India]] in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Directory (1954-2009) |publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] |url=http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/LST-PDAWD.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510095705/http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/LST-PDAWD.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. D R Mehta received the Rajasthan Ratna for his contribution in Jaipur Foot in 2013 by Rajasthan Government.

'''Keloid''', also known as '''keloid disorder''' and '''keloidal scar''',&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |page=1499 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the formation of a type of [[scar]] which, depending on its maturity, is composed mainly of either type III (early) or type I (late) [[collagen]]. It is a result of an overgrowth of [[granulation tissue]] (collagen type 3) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type 1.  Keloids are firm, rubbery lesions or shiny, fibrous [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], and can vary from pink to the color of the person's skin or red to dark brown in color. A keloid scar is [[benign]] and not contagious, but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness, pain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ogawa |first1=Rei |year=2010 |title=The Most Current Algorithms for the Treatment and Prevention of Hypertrophic Scars and Keloids |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=557–68 |pmid=20124841 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181c82dd5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in texture. In severe cases, it can affect movement of skin. Keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of sub-Saharan African descent than in people of European descent.

Keloids should not be confused with [[hypertrophic scar]]s, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Keloid.jpg|thumb|Postoperative keloid on the wrist]]
Keloids expand in claw-like growths over normal skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Babu |first1=M |last2=Meenakshi |first2=J |last3=Jayaraman |first3=V |last4=Ramakrishnan |first4=KM |year=2005 |title=Keloids and hypertrophic scars: A review |journal=Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=175–9 |doi=10.4103/0970-0358.19796}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have the capability to hurt with a needle-like pain or to itch, the degree of sensation varying from person to person.

If the keloid becomes infected, it may [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerate]]. Removing the scar is one treatment option; however, it may result in more severe consequences:  the probability that the resulting surgery scar will also become a keloid is high, usually greater than 50%. Laser treatment has also been used with varying degrees of success.

Keloids form within [[scar|scar tissue]]. [[Collagen]], used in [[wound repair]], tends to overgrow in this area, sometimes producing a lump many times larger than that of the original scar. They can also range in color from pink to red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Keloid Scar: Find Causes, Symptoms, and Removal|url = http://www.medicinenet.com/keloid/article.htm|website = MedicineNet|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they usually occur at the site of an injury, keloids can also arise spontaneously.  They can occur at the site of a [[piercing]] and even from something as simple as a pimple or scratch. They can occur as a result of severe [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or [[chickenpox]] scarring, infection at a wound site, repeated trauma to an area, excessive skin tension during wound closure or a foreign body in a wound. Keloids can sometimes be sensitive to chlorine. Keloid scars can grow, if they appear at a younger age, because the body is still growing.

===Location===
Keloids can develop in any place where skin trauma has occurred. They can be the result of pimples, insect bites, scratching, burns, or other skin injury. Keloid scars can develop after surgery.
They are more common in some sites, such as the central chest (from a sternotomy), the back and shoulders (usually resulting from acne), and the ear lobes (from ear piercings). They can also occur on body piercings.
The most common spots are earlobes, arms, pelvic region, and over the collar bone.

==Cause==
Most skin injury types can contribute to scarring. This includes [[burn]]s, [[acne]] scars, [[chickenpox]] scars, ear piercing, scratches, surgical incisions, and vaccination sites.

According to the (US) National Center for Biotechnology Information, keloid scarring is common in young people between the ages of 10 and 20. Studies have shown that those with darker complexions are at a higher risk of keloid scarring as a result of skin trauma. They occur in 15 – 20% of individuals with sub-Saharan African, Asian or Latino ancestry, significantly less in those of a Caucasian background and there are no reported cases in patients with albinism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.matbio.2016.01.013 |pmid=26844756 |pmc=4842154 |title=Keloids: The paradigm of skin fibrosis — Pathomechanisms and treatment |journal=Matrix Biology |volume=51 |pages=37–46 |year=2016 |last1=Andrews |first1=Jonathan P. |last2=Marttala |first2=Jaana |last3=MacArak |first3=Edward |last4=Rosenbloom |first4=Joel |last5=Uitto |first5=Jouni }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Keloids tend to have a genetic component, which means one is more likely to have keloids if one or both of their parents has them. However, no single gene has yet been identified which is a causing factor in keloid scarring but several susceptibility loci have been discovered, most notably in Chromosome 15.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001852/{{full citation needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Most people, especially sub-saharan Africans and African Americans, have a positive family history of keloid disorder.  Development of keloids among twins also lends credibility to existence of a genetic susceptibility to develop keloids. Marneros et al. (1) reported four sets of identical twins with keloids; Ramakrishnan et al.&lt;ref name=pmid4813760&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramakrishnan |first1=K. M. |last2=Thomas |first2=K. P. |year=1974 |last3=Sundararajan |first3=C. R.|title=Study of 1,000 patients with keloids in South India |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=276–80 |pmid=4813760 |doi=10.1097/00006534-197403000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; also described a pair of twins who developed keloids at the same time after vaccination. Case series have reported clinically severe forms of keloids in individuals with a positive family history and black African ethnic origin.

==Pathology==
[[File:Keloid -1.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of keloid. Thick, hyalinised collagen fibres are characteristic of this aberrant healing process. H&amp;E stain.]]

[[Histologically]], keloids are fibrotic tumors characterized by a collection of atypical [[fibroblast]]s with excessive deposition of [[extracellular matrix]] components, especially [[collagen]], [[fibronectin]], [[elastin]], and [[proteoglycan]]s. Generally, they contain relatively acellular centers and thick, abundant collagen bundles that form nodules in the deep dermal portion of the lesion. Keloids present a therapeutic challenge that must be addressed, as these lesions can cause significant [[pain]], {{lang|la|[[pruritus]]}} (itching), and physical disfigurement. They may not improve in appearance over time and can limit mobility if located over a joint.

Keloids affect both sexes equally, although the incidence in young female patients has been reported to be higher than in young males, probably reflecting the greater frequency of [[earlobe piercing]] among women.  
The frequency of occurrence is 15 times higher in highly pigmented people. African descendant people have increased risk of keloid occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1298013|Wound Healing, Keloids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==
The best treatment is prevention in patients with a known predisposition. This includes preventing unnecessary trauma or surgery (including ear piercing, elective mole removal), whenever possible. Any skin problems in predisposed individuals (e.g., acne, infections) should be treated as early as possible to minimize areas of inflammation.

Treatment of a keloid scar is age dependent. Radiotherapy, anti-metabolites and corticoids would not be recommended to be used in children, in order to avoid harmful side effects, like growth abnormalities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2014.02.011 |pmid=24767715 |pmc=4186912 |title=Up-to-date approach to manage keloids and hypertrophic scars: A useful guide |journal=Burns |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=1255–66 |year=2014 |last1=Arno |first1=Anna I. |last2=Gauglitz |first2=Gerd G. |last3=Barret |first3=Juan P. |last4=Jeschke |first4=Marc G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, corticosteriods combined with [[Fluorouracil|5-FU]] and [[Pulsed dye laser|PDL]] in a triple therapy, enhance results and diminish side effects.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Further prophylactic and therapeutic strategies include pressure therapy, silicone gel sheeting, intra-lesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), cryosurgery, radiation, laser therapy, [[Interferon|IFN]], 5-FU and surgical excision as well as a multitude of extracts and topical agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 |pmid=20927486 |pmc=3022978 |year=2011 |last1=Gauglitz |first1=Gerd |title=Hypertrophic scarring and keloids: Pathomechanisms and current and emerging treatment strategies |journal=Molecular Medicine |volume=17 |issue=1–2 |pages=113–25 |last2=Korting |first2=Hans }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical excision is currently still the most common treatment for a significant amount of keloid lesions. However, when used as the solitary form of treatment there is a large recurrence rate of between 70 and 100%. It has also been known to cause a larger lesion formation on recurrence. While not always successful alone, surgical excision when combined with other therapies dramatically decreases the recurrence rate. Examples of these therapies include but are not limited to radiation therapy, pressure therapy and laser ablation. Pressure therapy following surgical excision has shown promising results, especially in keloids of the ear and earlobe. The mechanism of how exactly pressure therapy works is unknown at present but many patients with keloid scars and lesions have benefited from it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Should keloids occur, the most effective treatment is combination of cryofreeze and intralesional cryofreeze which can achieve cure rates of up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.txid.org/?page_id=4043|title=Keloid Treatment|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Intralesional injection with a corticosteroid such as [[Triamcinolone acetonide|Kenalog]] does appear to aid in the reduction of fibroblast activity, inflammation and [[pruritus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=5919603 |url=http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Citation/1966/09000/The_Treatment_of_Keloids_with_Triamcinolone.4.aspx |year=1966 |author1=Griffith |first1=B. H. |title=The treatment of keloids with triamcinolone acetonide |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=202–8 |doi=10.1097/00006534-196609000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryotherapy]] or cryosurgery refers to application of extreme cold to treat keloids. This treatment method is easy to perform and has shown results with least chance of recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keloidresearchfoundation.org/treatment-options.php|title=Keloid Research Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea tree oil, salt or other topical oil has no any effect on keloid lesions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.txid.org/?page_id=4043|title=Keloid Treatment|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Epidemiology==
Persons of any age can develop a keloid. Children under 10 are less likely to develop keloids, even from ear piercing. Keloids may also develop from [[Pseudofolliculitis barbae]]; continued shaving when one has razor bumps will cause irritation to the bumps, infection, and over time keloids will form. Persons with razor bumps are advised to stop shaving in order for the skin to repair itself before undertaking any form of hair removal. The tendency to form keloids is speculated to be hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5999/aps.2012.39.3.184 |pmid=22783524 |pmc=3385329 |title=Keloid Scarring: Understanding the Genetic Basis, Advances, and Prospects |journal=Archives of Plastic Surgery |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=184–9 |year=2012 |last1=Halim |first1=Ahmad Sukari |last2=Emami |first2=Azadeh |last3=Salahshourifar |first3=Iman |last4=Kannan |first4=Thirumulu Ponnuraj }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keloids can tend to appear to grow over time without even piercing the skin, almost acting out a slow tumorous growth; the reason for this tendency is unknown.

Extensive burns, either thermal or [[Radiation burn|radiological]], can lead to unusually large keloids; these are especially common in firebombing casualties, and were a signature effect of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

True incidence and prevalence of keloid in United States is not known. Indeed, there has never been a population study to assess the epidemiology of this disorder.

Keloids were described by Egyptian surgeons around 1700 BCE, recorded in the Smith papyrus, regarding surgical techniques. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert|Baron Jean-Louis Alibert]] (1768–1837) identified the keloid as an entity in 1806.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He called them ''cancroïde'', later changing the name to ''chéloïde'' to avoid confusion with cancer. The word is derived from the Greek [[wikt:χηλή|χηλή]], ''chele'', meaning "[[hoof]]", here in the sense of "crab [[Pincer (biology)|pincers]]", and the suffix ''-oid'', meaning "like".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5078">'''[[Leprosy]]''' was said to be first recognized in the [[ancient civilization]]s of '''[[China]]''', [[Egypt]] and [[India]], according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/ WHO | Leprosy Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Leprosy, also known as '''Hansen's disease''', was officially eliminated at the national level in China by 1982, meaning prevalence is lower than 1 in 100,000. There are 3,510 active cases today. Though leprosy has been brought under control in general, the situation in some areas is worsening, according to China’s [[Ministry of Health (China)|Ministry of Health]]. In the past, leprosy sufferers were ostracized by their communities as the disease was incurable, disfiguring and wrongly thought to be highly infectious.

==Epidemiology==

===Numbers===
500,000 cases of leprosy were registered in China between 1950 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen XS, Li WZ, Jiang C, Ye GY |title=Leprosy in China: epidemiological trends between 1949 and 1998 |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=306–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11357209 |pmc=2566398 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862001000400007&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862001000400007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these sufferers have been cured but approximately 6,000 active cases remain today and about 2,000 new cases are detected and registered every year. Many more cases are not registered, partly through ignorance, but also because of the stigma associated with the disease.

There are estimates that show that there are 200,000 people in China today who have recovered from the disease but more than half (110,000) are disabled due to the disease, with conditions ranging from blindness to disfigurement. Although these former leprosy sufferers were cured in the last 50 years, many of them still suffer serious pain and difficulties because of these disabilities/deformities and the stigma. This social stigma has become the main problem in leprosy diagnosis and treatment, today.

===Areas affected===
Mostly, cases of infection remain in impoverished parts in the southwestern provinces of [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Sichuan]], and [[Tibet]] in the west and [[Hunan]] in the South. Other provinces/municipalities affected on a smaller scale, are [[Anhui]], [[Qinghai]], [[Chongqing]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Shaanxi]].

===Transmission and pathology===
Contrary to popular belief, leprosy ranks lowly in terms of infectiousness and is not congenital. It is passed via [[respiratory]] droplets among people in close and prolonged contact. The transmission rate is low and 95 percent of people are naturally [[immune]] to it. Caused by the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'', leprosy affects the skin, mucous membranes, peripheral nerves and eyes. As nerve damage is permanent, even those who have recovered can not feel pain. Minor cuts and abrasions on fingers and toes often turn into gaping, inflamed ulcers because of unsanitary living conditions. These open sores overrun the digits, which slowly shrink and many sufferers end up with stumps. Some have legs amputated.

==Treatment==
In China, [[dapsone]] was used from 1946 to treat leprosy, but treatment of the disease took a leap in 1982 with the introduction of a largely successful [[multidrug therapy]] (MDT) using dapsone, [[rifampicin]] and [[clofazimine]]. Today, therapy takes six months to a year. MDT treatment has been made available by the WHO free of charge to all [[patient]]s worldwide since 1995, and provides a simple yet highly effective cure for all types of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/lep/en/ WHO | Leprosy Today]&lt;/ref&gt; If diagnosed and treated early, the disease leaves no traces. But in some places in China, stigma still surrounds the disease and victims do not seek treatment until it is too late.

[[File:Mandibular 1st Molar.svg|thumbnail|right|Mandibular first molar.]]

The '''Lewis offset''' is a term for the portion of the central groove on a permanent [[mandibular first molar]] which lies between the two central pits. It was named for long time dental anatomy instructor Dr. Christopher S. Lewis, a Mercer Island, WA dentist. 

The offset lies at an angle to the mesio-distal axis of the tooth, and causes the [[mesial]] portion of the central groove to be located further [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|buccally]] than the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion. This [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|buccolingual]] shift correlates with a relative difference in size between the mesial and distal cusps on these teeth - the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|mesiolingual]] cusp is larger than the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|mesiobuccal]] cusp, but the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|distobuccal]] cusp is larger than the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|distolingual]] cusp. It also allows for the buccal groove to be located mesial to the lingual groove which is mandatory to accommodate the relative sizes of the three cusps on the buccal and two cusps on the lingual of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|occlusal]] surface of the tooth.

'''Lisandro Alvarado''' (September 19, 1858&amp;nbsp;– April 10, 1929) &lt;ref name=qwerty&gt;[http://www.lecturalia.com/autor/12983/lisandro-alvarado Biographical data of Lisandro Alvarado] on the website Lecturalia. Because most of the websites mention that he was a polygrapher (that is, he wrote about many very diverse topics), in this site he says "he is known for his work as an expert in the use of the polygraph". The detector of lies is called a polygraph.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Venezuelan doctor, naturalist, historian, ethnologist and linguist.

== Biography ==
He was born in the city of [[El Tocuyo]], in [[Morán Municipality]] ([[Lara (state)|Lara]]). His parents were Rafael Alvarado and Gracia Benigna Marchena. In the school La Concordia (of El Tocuyo), run by Egidio Montesinos, he received the influence of literary classics and knowledge of Latin, aspects that would be decisive in his intellectual life.&lt;ref name=qwerty /&gt;

In 1871 he traveled to [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]] to finish the baccalaureate. Soon, the lack of resources on the part of his family forced him to drop out of school and work as a pharmacist at [[Barquisimeto]]. However, in 1878 he moved to [[Caracas]] to begin medical studies. During this period he was in direct contact with the intense political life of the moment, characterized by the predominance of [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]]. Intellectually he was able to know the doctrinal framework of [[positivism]], represented in the teachings of [[Adolf Ernst]] and Rafael Villavicencio. In this sense, Alvarado was confronted with his religious and traditionalist vision of life with the new scientific ideas of the late nineteenth century. At first, positivism influenced his research in the field of ethnography, history, language, as well as his interest in various ancient and modern cultures. In this period Alvarado shared his scientific knowledge with César Zumeta, Luis López Méndez and José Rafael Revenga, giving information about his first works around 1882.&lt;ref name=qwerty /&gt;

Despite his first inclination towards the positivist doctrine, contact with [[Cecilio Acosta]], allowed Alvarado to connect to neoclassical tendencies other than positivism. In 1881, through Acosta he was able to meet [[José Martí]] in Caracas, who had an important influence on his vision of life and science. In this sense, once he obtained his doctorate in medicine, Alvarado settled in [[Ospino]] ([[Portuguesa (state)|Portuguesa]]).&lt;ref name=qwerty /&gt;

He traveled the country on donkey, in canoes and on foot, which allowed him to come into direct contact with Venezuelan reality: the landscapes, the vegetation, the wildlife, the customs and popular traditions, the different dialects, including the numerous indigenous people he met and whose language he could study first-hand.&lt;ref name name=qwerty /&gt;

He traveled to Europe as a consul and medical delegate. In 1891 he returned to the province and began the publication of a set of research papers. In this period he wrote several studies: Neurosis of famous men of Venezuela (''Neurosis de hombres célebres de Venezuela'') (1893) and On the civil wars of the country (''Sobre las guerras civiles del país'') (1894). He also published a series of works related to linguistics and lexicography, the first being ideas on the evolution of Spanish in Venezuela (''Ideas sobre la evolución del español en Venezuela'') (1903), followed by Glossary of indigenous voices in Venezuela (''Glosario de voces indígenas en Venezuela'') (1921), phonetic alterations of Spanish in Venezuela (''Alteraciones fonéticas del español en Venezuela'') (1922, reworked in 1929) and finally his Glossary of the Spanish bass in Venezuela (''Glosario del bajo español en Venezuela'') (1929). In 1920 he returned to Caracas to work in the Directorate of Trade Policy (of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). In recognition of his extensive work in research, he was incorporated as an individual number in the Academy of Medicine (Academia Nacional de Medicina de Venezuela) in 1905, the [[Academia Venezolana de la Lengua|Venezuelan Academy of Language]] in 1922 and the National Academy of History of Venezuela in 1923. His complete works in eight volumes began to be published in 1958; however, there is still an unpublished collection of his manuscripts in the custody of the National Academy of History.

He was a grade 30 [[Freemasonry|Mason]].

Since May 14, 1980 his remains rest in the [[National Pantheon of Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=qwerty /&gt;

'''Mary Elizabeth Pipher''' (born October 21, 1947), also known as '''Mary Bray Pipher''', is an American clinical psychologist and author, most recently of ''The Green Boat'', which was published by [[Riverhead Books]] in June 2013.  She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in anthropology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1969 and a PhD in clinical psychology from the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] in 1977.  She was a Rockefeller Scholar in Residence at Bellagio in 2001. She received two American Psychological Association Presidential Citations. She returned the one she received in 2006  as a protest against the APA's acknowledgment that some of its members participate in controversial interrogation techniques at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]] and at US "[[black site]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first =JoAnne|title=Pipher returns award in protest|publisher=''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]''|date=August 23, 2007|url=http://journalstar.com/articles/2007/08/23/news/local/doc46ccf4d458103603645050.txt|accessdate=2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipher participates actively in Nebraska state legislature and voices her opinion through letters to the editor of the Lincoln Journal Star. She has also written an essay to the New York Times about the difficulty of Nebraska's mixed political views and need for more progressive politicians. She strongly opposes the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL]] Pipeline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://0-infoweb.newsbank.com.library.unl.edu/resources/doc/nb/news/152DB996B8C92BA0?p=NewsBank|title = Log in|website = 0-infoweb.newsbank.com.library.unl.edu|access-date = 2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the Nebraska Legislative Bill 802, the purpose of which was to create a state task force to combat climate change, calling it "an opportunity to educate and work through problems relating to climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://0-infoweb.newsbank.com.library.unl.edu/resources/doc/nb/news/15AD4CA059197210?p=NewsBank|title = Log in|website = 0-infoweb.newsbank.com.library.unl.edu|access-date = 2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She currently resides in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].

==''Reviving Ophelia''==

Pipher is best known for a book she wrote in 1994, introducing the terms [[Ophelia complex]] or Ophelia syndrome, in ''[[Reviving Ophelia]]''.  There she argued for a view of Shakespeare's character of Ophelia in Hamlet as lacking inner direction, and externally defined by men (father/ brother);&lt;ref&gt;D. Lester, ''Katie's Diary'' (2004) p. 93-5&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that similar external pressures were currently faced by post-pubescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;K. Douglas, ''Life Narratives and Youth Culture'' (2007) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of the Ophelia syndrome was that of abandoning a rooted childhood self, for an apparently more sophisticated but over-externalised [[True self and false self|facade self]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Lester, ''Katie's Diary'' (2004) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|Plates vi &amp; vii of the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] (around the 17th century BC), among the earliest medical guidelines.]]
A '''medical guideline''' (also called a '''clinical guideline''' or '''clinical practice line''') is a document with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment in specific areas of [[healthcare]]. Such documents have been in use for thousands of years during the entire [[history of medicine]]. However, in contrast to previous approaches, which were often based on tradition or authority, modern medical guidelines are based on an examination of current evidence within the paradigm of [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burgers JS, Grol R, Klazinga NS, Mäkelä M, Zaat J | year = 2011 | title = Towards evidence-based clinical practice: an international survey of 18 clinical guideline programs | url = | journal = Int J Qual Health Care | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 31–45 | doi=10.1093/intqhc/15.1.31| pmid = 12630799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12571340 | volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Development and validation of an international appraisal instrument for assessing the quality of clinical practice guidelines: the AGREE project | pmc=1743672 | journal=Qual Saf Health Care | pages=18–23| year=2003 | author1=AGREE Collaboration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (edt.) [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13058 Clinical practice guidelines we can trust]. Washington DC, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They usually include summarized [[consensus (medical)|consensus statements]] on best practice in [[healthcare]]. A healthcare provider is obliged to know the medical guidelines of his or her profession, and has to decide whether to follow the recommendations of a guideline for an individual treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. [http://www.leitlinien.de/mdb/edocs/pdf/literatur/coe-rec-2001-13.pdf Developing a methodology for drawing up guidelines on best medical practice. Recommendation Rec(2001)13 and explanatory memorandum. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Modern clinical guidelines identify, summarize and evaluate the highest quality evidence and most current data about [[preventive medicine|prevention]], [[diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], therapy including dosage of medications, [[risk-benefit analysis|risk/benefit]] and [[cost-effectiveness]]. Then they define the most important questions related to clinical practice and identify all possible [[decision-making|decision options]] and their [[upside outcomes|outcomes]]. Some guidelines contain decision or computation [[algorithm (medical)|algorithms]] to be followed. Thus, they integrate the identified decision points and respective courses of action with the clinical judgment and experience of practitioners. Many guidelines place the treatment alternatives into classes to help providers in deciding which treatment to use.

Additional objectives of clinical guidelines are to [[standardization|standardize]] medical care, to raise quality of care, to reduce several kinds of risk (to the patient, to the healthcare provider, to [[medical insurance|medical insurers]] and health plans) and to achieve the best balance between cost and medical parameters such as [[effectiveness]], [[specificity (tests)|specificity]], [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]], resolutiveness, etc. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the use of guidelines by healthcare providers such as [[hospitals]] is an effective way of achieving the objectives listed above, although they are not the only ones.

Guidelines are usually produced at national or international levels by medical associations or governmental bodies, such as the United States [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]. Local healthcare providers may produce their own set of guidelines or adapt them from existing top-level guidelines.

Special [[computer software]] packages known as [[guideline execution engine]]s have been developed to facilitate the use of medical guidelines in concert with an [[electronic medical record]] system. 
The [[Guideline Interchange Format]] (GLIF) is a computer representation format for clinical guidelines that can be used with such engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openclinical.org/gmm_glif.html GLIF website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA and other countries maintain medical guideline [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouses]]. In the USA, the [[National Guideline Clearinghouse]] maintains a catalog of high-quality guidelines published by various health and medical associations. In the United Kingdom, clinical practice guidelines are published primarily by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE). In The Netherlands, two bodies—the [[:nl:Centraal BegeleidingsOrgaan|Institute for Healthcare Improvement]] (CBO) and [[:nl:Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap|College of General Practitioners]] (NHG)—have published specialist and primary care guidelines, respectively. In Germany, the [[German Agency for Quality in Medicine]] (ÄZQ) coordinates a national program for disease management guidelines. All these organisations are now members of the [[Guidelines International Network]] (G-I-N), an international network of organisations and individuals involved in clinical practice guidelines.

[[Checklists]] have been used  in medical practice to attempt to ensure that clinical practice guidelines are followed. An example is the Surgical Safety Checklist developed for the [[World Health Organization]] by Dr. [[Atul Gawande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Alex B.|last2=Weiser|first2=Thomas G.|last3=Berry|first3=William R.|last4=Lipsitz|first4=Stuart R.|last5=Breizat|first5=Abdel-Hadi S.|last6=Dellinger|first6=E.

==Problems==
Guidelines may lose their clinical relevance as they age and newer research emerges.&lt;ref name="pmid11572738"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shekelle PG|author2=Ortiz E|author3=Rhodes S|title=Validity of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality clinical practice guidelines: how quickly do guidelines become outdated? |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=12 |pages=1461–7 |date=2001 |pmid=11572738 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.12.1461|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even 20% of strong recommendations, especially when based on opinion rather than trials, from practice guidelines may be retracted.&lt;ref name="pmid24867012"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Neuman MD| author2=Goldstein JN| author3=Cirullo MA| author4=Schwartz JS| title=Durability of class I American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guideline recommendations | journal=JAMA | date= 2014 | volume= 311 | issue= 20 | pages= 2092–100 | doi=10.1001/jama.2014.4949 | pmid=24867012| pmc=4346183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2004 that some simple clinical practice guidelines are not routinely followed to the extent they might be.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gina Kolata]] "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/health/25medicine.html Program Coaxes Hospitals to See Treatments Under Their Noses]". ''[[The New York Times]]'' December 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that providing a [[nurse]] or other medical assistant with a [[checklist]] of recommended procedures can result in the attending physician being reminded in a timely manner regarding procedures that might have been overlooked.

Guidelines may have both methodological problems and conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="pmid23752105"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reames BN| author2=Krell RW| author3=Ponto SN| author4=Wong SL| title=Critical evaluation of oncology clinical practice guidelines | journal=J Clin Oncol | date= 2013 | volume= 31 | issue= 20 | pages= 2563–8 | pmid=23752105 | doi=10.1200/JCO.2012.46.8371 | pmc=5073383}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the quality of guidelines may vary substantially, especially for guidelines that are published on-line and have not had to follow methodological reporting standards often required by reputable clearinghouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norberg MM, Turner MW, Rooke SE, Langton JM, Gates PJ | year = 2012 | title = An Evaluation of Web-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Managing Problems Associated with Cannabis Use | journal = J Med Internet Res | volume = 14 | issue = 6| page = e169 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.2319 | pmid = 23249447 | pmc=3799569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines may make recommendations that are stronger than the supporting evidence.&lt;ref name="pmid23783104"&gt;{{cite journal| display-authors=4| author=Brito JP| author2=Domecq JP| author3=Murad MH| author4=Guyatt GH| author5=Montori VM| title=The Endocrine Society guidelines: when the confidence cart goes before the evidence horse | journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab | date= 2013 | volume= 98 | issue= 8 | pages= 3246–52 | doi=10.1210/jc.2013-1814 | pmid=23783104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to many of these problems with traditional guidelines, the BMJ created a new series of trustworthy guidelines focused on the most pressing medical issues called ''BMJ'' Rapid Recommendations.&lt;ref name="siemieniuk1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siemieniuk RA, Agoritsas T, Macdonald H, Guyatt GH, Brandt L, Vandvik PO | year = 2016 | title = TIntroduction to BMJ Rapid Recommendations | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i5191.long | journal = BMJ | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = i5191 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i5191 | pmid = 27680768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], the '''Mental Health Care Act 2017''' was passed on 7 April 2017 and came into force from July 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/ViewFileUploaded?path=AC_CEN_12_13_00024_201710_1517807327874/notificationindividualfile/&amp;file=MHA+2017+notification.pdf|title=MHA Notification|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was described in its opening paragraph as "An Act to provide for mental healthcare and services for persons with [[mental illness]] and to protect, promote and fulfill the rights of such persons during
delivery of mental healthcare and services and for matters connected therewith
or incidental thereto."&lt;ref name=Act/&gt; 
This Act superseded the previously existing [[Mental Health Act, 1987]] that was passed on 22 May 1987. 

It states that mental illness be determined "in accordance with nationally and internationally accepted medical standards (including the latest edition of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Disease]] of the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]]) as may be notified by the Central Government." Additionally, the Act asserts that no person or authority shall classify an individual as a person with mental illness unless in directly in relation with treatment of the illness .

# The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 aims at decriminalising the Attempt to Commit Suicide by seeking to ensure that the individuals who have attempted suicide are offered opportunities for rehabilitation from the government as opposed to being tried or punished for the attempt. 
# The Act seeks to fulfil India’s international obligation pursuant to the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.
# It looks to empower persons suffering from mental illness, thus marking a departure from the Mental Health Act 1987. The 2017 Act recognises the agency of people with mental illness, allowing them to make decisions regarding their health, given that they have the appropriate knowledge to do so. 
# The Act aims to safeguard the rights of the people with mental illness, along with access to healthcare and treatment without discrimination from the government. Additionally, insurers are now bound to make provisions for medical insurance for the treatment of mental illness on the same basis as is available for the treatment of physical ailments. 
# The Mental Health Care Act 2017 includes provisions for the registration of mental health related institutions and for the regulation of the sector. These measures include the necessity of setting up mental health establishments across the country to ensure that no person with mental illness will have to travel far for treatment, as well as the creation of a mental health review board which will act as a regulatory body.
# The Act has restricted the usage of [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) to be used only in cases of emergency, and along with [[Muscle relaxant|muscle relaxants]] and [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]]. Further, ECT has additionally been prohibited to be used as viable therapy for minors. 
# The responsibilities of other agencies such as the police with respect to people with mental illness has been outlined in the 2017 Act.
# The Mental Health Care Act 2017 has additionally vouched to tackle stigma of mental illness, and has outlined some measures on how to achieve the same.

He was also Minister of Health in the [[Nigerian First Republic]].

==Early life and education==
Moses was born in [[Abeokuta]] in August 1916. He studied at Abeokuta Grammar School, [[St. Gregory's College, Lagos]], before proceeding to the [[University of Dublin]] where he earned a degree in [[Anatomy]] and [[Physiology]] in 1936. He also earned a 1st Class degree in [[Bacteriology ]] and [[Clinical Medicine]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thenigerianvoice.com/news/89157/1/moses-adekoyejo-majekodunmi-1916-2012.html|website=The Nigerian Voice|title=Moses Adekoyejo Majekodunmi (1916-2012)|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=QWTd1ftuCbwC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=|title=Historical Dictionary of Nigeria (Volume 111)|author1=Toyin Falola|author2=Ann Genova|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-810-8631-63|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]], he worked as in-house physician at the National Children's Hospital and the Rotunda Hospital from 1941 to 1942. In 1943, he joined the Federal Government Medical Services as a medical doctor and established his medical practice.&lt;ref name=voice/&gt; He played key roles in the establishment of the [[Lagos University Teaching Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/moses-adekoyejo-majekodunmi-1916-2012-/115074/|title=Moses Adekoyejo Majekodunmi (1916-2012)|publisher=This Day Live|date=May 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153423/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/moses-adekoyejo-majekodunmi-1916-2012-/115074/|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also founded [[St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos|Saint Nicholas Hospital]] in Lagos, which opened in March 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Political career==
He was elected into the Nigerian Senate in 1960. He was appointed sole administrator of Western Region in June 1962 after a political crisis in the region, holding office in place of the Premier [[Samuel Akintola]] until December that year.&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;{{cite web

 |title='I was not there to fight the Action Group'
 |work=The Guardian
 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis was due to a struggle between Akintola and the former Western Region Premier and current leader of the opposition [[Obafemi Awolowo]], which had led to violent scenes in the House of Assembly.
On advice from the police, one of his first acts was to sign restriction orders to detain leaders of both factions.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;
After the situation had stabilized, Akintola resumed office on 1 January 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As an [[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Oloye]] of the [[Yoruba people]], he held the [[chieftaincy]] titles of the '''Mayegun''' of [[Lagos]] and the '''Otun Balogun''' of the [[Christian]]s of [[Egbaland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">The '''Navajo AIDS Network''' (NAN) is a [[Chinle, Arizona]]-based [[HIV]] prevention and [[AIDS]] service organization for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who reside within the [[Navajo Nation]], located in western [[New Mexico]] and eastern [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.health.gov/NHIC/NHICScripts/Entry.cfm?HRCode=HR3595 National Health Information Center/Department of Health and Human Services]&lt;/ref&gt; NAN was founded in 1990 as a volunteer organization and was incorporated as a 501(c)3 non-profit in 1993.

NAN, which operates independently of the Navajo tribal government, has offered anonymous HIV testing and references to medical services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100203071610/http://www.gallupindependent.com/2004/02feb04/020504HIV.html “HIV, syphilis create rez health emergency,” Gallup Independent, February 5, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also distributed [[condoms]] to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=SCLT000020050211e12f0016t “Health leaders target at-risk groups as syphilis problem persists, Science Letter, February 15, 2005 (subscription access required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

NAN has also worked to further the cause of raising tolerance for the [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] members of the Navajo Nation, who had traditionally not been able to openly discuss their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/10/26/gay_navajos_find_acceptance_yet_seek_support_community/ “Gay Navajos find acceptance, yet seek support community,” Boston Globe, October 26, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DD1E3AF934A3575AC0A96F958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 “AIDS Outbreak Feared for U.S. Tribes,” New York Times, September 7, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, NAN sponsored the first {{spell-nv|Hózhǫ́ Náhásdlį́į́ʼ}} Summer Gathering, which focused on health and social issues relating specifically to the Navajo LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativeout.com/content/blogsection/1/55/5/110/ “Navajo AIDS Network Sponsors Native GLBT Summer Gathering,” Native GLBT News, July 17, 2005]{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
[[Image:Nicotine pastille.jpg|thumb|right|Nicotine pastilles]]
Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products.&lt;ref name="Stead2012"/&gt; Studies have shown that nicotine replacement therapy is as effective as medications, such as [[bupropion]], in helping people quit smoking for at least 6 months.&lt;ref name=Cahill2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cahill|first1=K|last2=Stevens|first2=S|last3=Perera|first3=R|last4=Lancaster|first4=T|title=Pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD009329|pmid=23728690|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that all forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajek|first1=Peter|last2=West|first2=Robert|last3=Foulds|first3=Jonathan|last4=Nilsson|first4=Fredrik|last5=Burrows|first5=Sylvia|last6=Meadow|first6=Anna|title=Randomized Comparative Trial of Nicotine Polacrilex, a Transdermal Patch, Nasal Spray, and an Inhaler|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=159|issue=17|pages=2033|doi=10.1001/archinte.159.17.2033|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use.&lt;ref name="Cahill2013"/&gt; Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates.&lt;ref name=Rigotti&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rigotti|first1=NA|title=Clinical practice. Treatment of tobacco use and dependence.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=346|issue=7|pages=506–12|pmid=11844853|doi=10.1056/nejmcp012279|date=Feb 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicotine replacement products are most beneficial for heavy smokers who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day. There are not enough studies to show whether NRT helps those who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicotine replacement therapy|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007438.htm|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=28 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109145356/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007438.htm|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
Evaluation of NRT in real-world studies produces more modest outcomes than efficacy studies conducted by the industry-funded trials. The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service (NHS) in England]] has a smoking cessation service based on [[pharmacotherapy]] in combination with counseling support. An [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (UK) (ASH) report claims that the average cost per life year gained for every smoker successfully treated by these services is less than £1,000 (below the NICE guidelines of £20,000 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year).  However, the investment in NHS stop smoking services is relatively low. A comparison with treatment costs for illicit drug users shows that £585 million is committed for 350,000 problem drug users compared to £56 million for 9 million users of tobacco. This is £6.20 for each smoker, compared to £1,670 per illegal drug user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smokefreeaction.org.uk/consultation-response/responses/ASH_DH_Consultation_tobacco_control_final.pdf |title=Action on Smoking &amp; Health, 2008 |accessdate=27 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102928/http://www.smokefreeaction.org.uk/consultation-response/responses/ASH_DH_Consultation_tobacco_control_final.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims for high efficacy and cost-effectiveness of NRT have not been substantiated in real-world effectiveness studies.&lt;ref&gt;Doran et al. (2006), pp. 758–766&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferguson| year = 2006 | title =  | url = |journal = [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume = | issue = | pages = 59–69 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pierce02&gt;Pierce &amp; Gilpin (2002) ''JAMA'' 288 pp. 1260–1264&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce and Gilpin (2002) stated their conclusion as follows:  “Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation” (p.&amp;nbsp;1260).&lt;ref name=Pierce02/&gt; Efficacy studies, which are conducted using randomized controlled trials, do not transfer very well to real-world effectiveness. Bauld, Bell, McCullough, Richardson and Greaves (2009) reviewed 20 studies on the effectiveness of intensive NHS treatments for smoking cessation published between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bauld| year = 2010 | title = The effectiveness of NHS smoking cessation services: a systematic review. | url = | journal = J Public Health (Oxf) | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 71–82|doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdp074|display-authors=etal | pmid=19638397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quit rates showed a dramatic decrease between 4-weeks and one year. A quit rate of 53% at four weeks fell to only 15% at 1 year. Younger smokers, females, [[Smoking and pregnancy|pregnant smoker]]s and more deprived smokers had lower quit rates than other groups.

Serious risks include [[nicotine poisoning]] and continued [[addiction]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; 

Limited evidence exists regarding long-term NRT use, and concerns exist that long-term NRT use could raise cancer risk, due in part to the generation of carcinogens.&lt;ref name=Wilder2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilder|first1=Natalie|last2=Daley|first2=Claire|last3=Sugarman|first3=Jane|last4=Partridge|first4=James|title=Nicotine without smoke: Tobacco harm reduction|url=https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harm-reduction-0|page=58|location=UK|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|date=April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505193314/https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harm-reduction-0|archivedate=2016-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth===
In people under the age of 18, a physician is often consulted before starting NRT.&lt;ref name=FDA101 /&gt; The evidence suggests that exposure to nicotine between the ages of 10 and 25 years causes lasting harm to the brain and cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="e-cig_SG_2016_cognitive"&gt;{{cite journal |author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service Office of the Surgeon General Rockville, MD |title=E-Cigarette Use Among Youth  and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon General |date=2016 |url=https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/2016ecigarettes/index.html |accessdate=15 November 2018|quote=Evidence for this report was gathered from scientific research that included one or more of three age groups.

==Society and culture==
NRT products were first approved for use in the United States in 1984.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; Nicotine replacement products are on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].&lt;ref name=WHO19th&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213052708/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are available as [[generic medication]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; In the United States a month of patches or gum is between 100 and 200 USD while the other forms are more expensive.&lt;ref name=Ric2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
In the United States, a month of patches or gum is between 100 and 200 USD as of 2015 while the other forms are more expensive;&lt;ref name=Ric2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK lozenges are the cheapest. In the United States, a month of patches is about 170 USD.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

===Not approved as NRTs===
[[Snus]] and [[nasal snuff]] also allow for nicotine administration outside of tobacco smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=CV |last2=Heavner |first2=KK |title=Smokeless tobacco: The epidemiology and politics of harm |journal=Biomarkers |volume=14 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=79–84 |year=2009 |pmid=19604065 |doi=10.1080/13547500902965476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, NRT sales fell for the first time since 2008 while sales for [[electronic cigarette|e-cigarettes]] continued to increase at a substantial rate. This had led to speculation that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than NRT methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newswire.net/newsroom/pr/00089726-e-cigarettes-spark-nicotine-replacement-therapy-mutiny.html |title=E-cigarettes Spark Nicotine Replacement Therapy Mutiny |publisher=Newswire |date=2015-07-29 |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002083933/http://newswire.net/newsroom/pr/00089726-e-cigarettes-spark-nicotine-replacement-therapy-mutiny.html |archivedate=2015-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1464">The '''Permanent Indus Commission''' is a bilateral commission consisting of officials from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], created to implement and manage the goals and objectives and outlines of the [[Indus Waters Treaty]]. The commission maintains and exchanges data and co-operates between the two countries.

==Indus Waters Treaty==
After prolonged talks between the governments of India and Pakistan, the Indus Water Treaty was signed in September 1960. According to this treaty, waters of the three western rivers (the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Chenab River|Chenab]], and the [[Indus River|Indus]] itself) were allocated to Pakistan, and those of the three eastern rivers (the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], the [[Beas River|Beas]], and the [[Sutlej]]) were allocated to India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nih.ernet.in/rbis/Indus_treat.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indus Commission is the first step for conflict resolution. If an agreement cannot be reached at the Commission level, the dispute is to be referred to the two governments. If the governments too fail to reach an agreement, the Treaty provides an arbitration mechanism.

The '''Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations''' is the [[Holy See Representative|representative of the Holy See]] at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations]]. The [[diplomatic mission]] does not have the status of [[Permanent Representative to the United Nations|Permanent Representative]] and thus cannot vote — a decision it has freely taken. The Holy See has sat in the UN as a non-voting delegation with permanent [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Non-member states|observer state status]] since 1964, and is one of two states with this status, the other being the [[State of Palestine]].

The Permanent Observer, currently Archbishop [[Bernardito Auza]], as of 1 July 2014, holds the diplomatic rank of [[Apostolic Nuncio]] (Papal Ambassador) and the ecclesiastical title of a [[titular bishop|titular archbishop]]. He is assisted by the Reverend Father Roger Landry, a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River]] (in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], a large suburb of Providence, Rhode Island, south of Boston), former pastor of St. Bernadette's Parish there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/briefs/cns/20150303.htm#head12|title=Catholic News Service|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration''' is a process governed by various statutes enacted by the [[United States Congress]] and interpreted by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] ("FDA"). Pursuant to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] ("the Act")  and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as [[food]] in the [[United States]], and to monitor claims made in the [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] about both the composition and the [[health]] benefits of foods.

Substances which the FDA regulates as food are subdivided into various categories, including foods, [[food additive]]s, added substances (man-made substances which are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and [[dietary supplements]]. The specific standards which the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, the FDA has been granted a variety of means by which it can address violations of the standards for a given category of substances.

==History of legislation==

===Pure Food and Drug Act===
{{main|Pure Food and Drug Act}}

The [[s:1906 pure food and drug act|Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]] was the first of a series of significant [[consumer protection law]]s enacted by the Federal Government in the twentieth century and led to the creation of the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors. It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug’s packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by The United States Pharmacopeia or The National Formulary. ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]] was an inspirational piece that kept the public's attention on the important issue of unsanitary meat processing plants that later formed the Pure Food and Drug Act.

===Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act===
{{main|Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act}}

The [[United States]] '''Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act''' (abbreviated as '''FFDCA''', '''FDCA''', or '''FD&amp;C'''), is a set of laws passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1938 giving authority to the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to oversee the [[food safety|safety of food]], drugs, and cosmetics. A principal author of this law was [[Royal S. Copeland]], a three-term U.S. Senator from New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeowatch.org/history/reghx.html Homeopathic Drugs, Royal Copeland, and Federal Drug Regulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions were added to the FD&amp;C. Also in that year the FDA formed the [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation]] (DESI) to incorporate into FD&amp;C regulations the recommendations from a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] investigation of effectiveness of previously marketed drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/about/history/time1.htm CDER - Time Line&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The act has been amended many times, most recently to add requirements about [[bioterrorism]] preparations.

The introduction of this act was influenced by the death of more than 100 patients due to a [[sulfanilamide]] medication where [[diethylene glycol]] was used to dissolve the drug and make a liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/article_news.asp?CID=167&amp;DID=2024&amp;id=3659 ASHP Website : News Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225510/http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/article_news.asp?CID=167&amp;DID=2024&amp;id=3659 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]]. It replaced the earlier [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906.

===Food Additives Amendment of 1958===
{{main|Food Additives Amendment of 1958}}

The Food Additives Amendment of 1958 is a 1958 amendment to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938]]. It was a response to concerns about the safety of new food additives. The amendment established the designation of "[[generally recognized as safe]]", which refers to chemicals or substances which can be used as food additives without further evaluation or testing just because they have been long used and there is broad acceptance of their use. New food additives would be subject to testing including by the "Delaney clause". The Delaney clause was a provision in the amendment which said that if a substance were found to cause cancer in man or animal, then it could not be used as a food additive.

===Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994===
{{main|Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994}}

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 is a 1994 statute of [[List of United States federal legislation|United States Federal legislation]] which defines and regulates [[dietary supplements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:S.784: |title=Six versions of Bill Number S.784 for the 103rd Congress |publisher=THOMAS.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act, supplements are mainly unregulated, without proof of effectiveness or safety needed to market a supplement, as well as dietary supplements being classified as foods instead of as drugs.

==Food==

Food is defined in the Act&lt;ref name=321f&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(f).&lt;/ref&gt; to be:
# articles used for food or drink for man or other animals,
# [[chewing gum]], and
# articles used for components of any such article.

The first definition offered is [[self-reference|self-referential]], defining food in part as "articles used for food", leaving it to the FDA and the courts to determine what exactly constitutes food.&lt;ref name=text&gt;Peter Barton Hutt, Richard A. Merrill, Lewis A. Grossman, ''Food and Drug Law: Cases and Materials, Third Edition'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This determination is particularly important because the definition of a "drug" under the act includes a section defining drugs as "articles (''other than food'') intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals".&lt;ref name=321g1C&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(g)(1)(C).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the definition of food is important not only in determining what is covered by the regulatory regime for food, but in determining what is ''excluded'' from the regulatory regime for drugs. For example, in the 1983 case of ''Nutrilab, Inc. v. Schweiker'',&lt;ref name=Nutrilab&gt;''Nutrilab, Inc. v. Schweiker'', 713 F.2d 335 (7th Cir. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] found that [[starch]] blockers, though derived from [[kidney beans]], were drugs rather than food under the meaning of the Act. The starch blockers were sold as tablets, and "not consumed primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value".&lt;ref name=Nutrilab/&gt; Products that are normally considered to be foods may also be regulated as drugs if the parties responsible for their manufacture or sale make claims as to their ability to treat diseases,&lt;ref name=text/&gt; although the FDA now permits advertising addressing the disease-fighting qualities in foods where those qualities have been endorsed by the scientific community.

The standards for food sold in the United States are set forth in Chapter IV of the Act.&lt;ref name=USC401&gt;21 U.S.C. §401-417.&lt;/ref&gt; These standards set forth two main areas of food that violates the Act: adulterated food and misbranded food. These categories are independent of one another; food can be completely free of adulteration and otherwise healthy to consume, and still be in violation of the act if it is misbranded. Likewise, food that has completely accurate labels, including warnings about dangers that it may pose to health, may nevertheless be deemed adulterated.

===Adulterated food===
The Act sets forth several circumstances under which food will be deemed adulterated. The primary definition set forth is that food is adulterated if:
:...it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an [[Regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration#Added substances|added substance]] such food shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health.&lt;ref name=342a1&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Added substances are treated separately by the FDA, meaning that the sale of an article or substance as food will generally be permitted if that article or substance is not ordinarily injurious to health.

Food is also deemed adulterated "if it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit for food";&lt;ref name=342a3&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(3).&lt;/ref&gt; if it was "prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health";&lt;ref name=342a4&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(4).&lt;/ref&gt; if it was produced from "a diseased animal or of an animal which has died otherwise than by slaughter";&lt;ref name=342a5&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(5).&lt;/ref&gt; if it was packaged in a poisonous material;&lt;ref name=342a6&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(6).&lt;/ref&gt; or if it was intentionally irradiated outside of irradiation guidelines set forth by the Act.&lt;ref name=342a7&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(7).&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions are also independent, meaning that food that is "filthy" or has been "held under insanitary conditions" is still in violation of the Act and subject to condemnation even if the owner can demonstrate that it poses no actual threat to health. The phrase "otherwise unfit for food", although seeming to be a catch-all, has rarely been invoked. It would apply to a circumstance such as a seller offering wood chips as food, which might be safe to consume and prepared under sanitary conditions, but would be impossible to chew.

====Inspections for adulteration====
[[File:FDA inspection.jpg|thumb|right|An FDA Inspector gives an overview of the seafood inspection process to HHS Secretary [[Mike Leavitt]] and FDA Commissioner [[Andrew von Eschenbach]] at a [[Baltimore, Maryland]] processing facility owned by [[Phillips Foods, Inc. and Seafood Restaurants]].]]
The FDA has the authority to inspect any establishment in which food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.&lt;ref name=USC374&gt;21 U.S.C. §374.&lt;/ref&gt; In searching for contamination, the FDA typically uses organoleptic inspection methods - investigators trained to distinguish contamination and decomposition by sight and smell. Upon completion of such an inspection, the FDA will generate an "Establishment Inspection Report" (EIR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/ucm122530.htm#5.2.3.4 ''FDA'': "Investigations Operations Manual," 5.2.3.4 - Annotation of the FDA 483, last visited June 29, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; detailing any problems found. Where problems are found, the FDA will instruct the owner of the inspected facility how to proceed in resolving those problems. FDA inspectors may take photographs of an establishment unless they are expressly told not to do so, and the owner of the establishment must provide an employee to answer questions that arise during the inspection. If the owner of an establishment refuses to permit FDA inspectors to enter a covered establishment, or any part of one, then the FDA may obtain a [[search warrant]] to enter.

Courts have held that, so long as the owner has not objected to the inspection and prevented the inspectors from entering, the FDA does not require a warrant to seize materials that are in violations of the Act. Furthermore, such materials may be used at trial against the owner without raising [[unreasonable search and seizure]] issues under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] because the industry at issue has been found to be heavily regulated, meaning that the owner of such an establishment has no [[expectation of privacy]] with respect to premises of the type covered by the Act.

====Action levels====
The presence of some degree of contamination is inevitable in almost all food. Technically, the FDA could inspect all food under a microscope and prohibit the sale of every article containing any discernible trace of mold, insect fragments, rodent hairs, and the like - effectively barring the sale of all food. In order to avoid this outcome, the FDA sets "action levels", which specify minimum amounts of particular contaminants that must be found in a food sample before the FDA will take action with respect to that sample. The FDA maintains a listing of all current action levels on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/dalbook.html ''FDA'': The Food Defect Action Levels, last visited April 22, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA also establishes action levels for man-made chemicals such as [[aflatoxin]], [[lead]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and maintains these on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fdaact.html ''FDA'': Action Levels for Poisonous or Deleterious Substances in Human Food and Animal Feed, last visited April 22, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misbranded food===

The primary basis under which food may be deemed misbranded under the Act is if "its labeling is false or misleading in any particular".&lt;ref name=343a1&gt;21 U.S.C. §343(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Labeling is defined elsewhere in the Act,&lt;ref name=321m&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(m).&lt;/ref&gt; and includes:

...all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter 
# upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers
# accompanying such article

Under the second part of this definition, it has been held that a food substance sold in conjunction with a book or pamphlet which makes false claims about the benefits of that substance is misbranded.&lt;ref name=Century&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''United States v. Articles of Drug ... Century Food Co.'', 32 F.R.D. 32 (S.D. Ill. 1963).''&lt;/ref&gt; If books making false claims about a food are sold in conjunction with that food, the books themselves may also be seized and destroyed - even if the author had no intention of selling the book in conjunction with the food.&lt;ref name=Century/&gt; However, if a store happens to be selling both a food and a book which makes false claims about that food, and is selling the items separately, then no misbranding occurs. This is so even if the book and the food are both produced by the same company, and even if the maker of the food encourages the seller to carry the book.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. 24 Bottles "Sterling Vinigar &amp; Honey"'', 338 F.2d 157 (2d Cir. 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of determining whether food is misbranded, the FDA only monitors labeling, and not [[advertising]], which instead falls under the authority of the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. However, the FDA will review the advertising of a product to determine whether it is to be regulated as a food or as a drug, based on the claims that the manufacturer or seller makes about its properties.

====Standards of identity====
The FDA is authorized to issue a [[standard of identity]] for any food. This is a description of what, exactly, must be in that food in order for it to be identified under a certain name. For example, a court has upheld an FDA  ruling that for a product to be sold as [[cream cheese]], it must contain a specified minimum percentage of [[milk fat]], and a maximum level of moisture.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''Columbia Cheese Co. v. McNutt'', 137 F.2d 576 (2nd Cir. 1943).&lt;/ref&gt; Incorrectly identifying a food by a name for which a standard of identity has been established is considered a form of misbranding. The FDA has set forth nearly 300 such standards.&lt;ref name=text/&gt; However, in recent decades, companies marketing new types of food items have diminished the importance of these standards by simply coining new names for foodstuffs that do not conform to an existing standard, with examples including [[Cool Whip]] and [[Cheetos]].

====Health claims====
There are two kinds of health claims that can be made about foods other than dietary supplements: structure/function claims and disease claims. Structure/function claims are claims that do not suggest that the food can diagnose, treat, or prevent any particular disease, but that it can, for example, maintain, regulate, or promote normal healthy bodily functions. Where such claims are made, foods are generally required to carry a [[disclaimer]] on their label indicating that the claim has not been evaluated by the FDA.

Disease claims suggest that the food can help prevent specific diseases. Such claims are only permitted where the FDA finds that there is "significant scientific agreement", or where the claim has been approved by another federal health agency or the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=343r&gt;21 U.S.C. §343(r).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food additives==
Food additives are defined in the Act&lt;ref name=321s&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(s).&lt;/ref&gt; to be:
:...any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food...

The definition goes on to capture several broad categories of things not traditionally thought of as "food", including "any substance intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food".&lt;ref name=321s /&gt; The definition only applies if the substance in question is not "generally recognized as safe" by qualified experts, and also exempts substances that were in common use as food prior to January 1, 1958.&lt;ref name=321s /&gt;

The Act sets forth certain exemptions for substances which are treated under different regulatory schemes, including pesticide chemicals and their residue,&lt;ref name=321s1&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(s)(1)-(2).&lt;/ref&gt; [[artificial color|color additive]]s,&lt;ref name=321s3&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(s)(3)&lt;/ref&gt; substances previously approved under other statutes,&lt;ref name=321s4&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(s)(4).&lt;/ref&gt; new animal drugs,&lt;ref name=321s5&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(s)(5).&lt;/ref&gt; and dietary supplements.&lt;ref name=321s6&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(s)(6).&lt;/ref&gt; The statute directs that food additives are generally to be presumed to be unsafe (and therefore prohibited) until they have been proven to be safe.&lt;ref name=348a&gt;21 U.S.C. §348(a).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statute then sets out a regulatory scheme under which a person intending to use a heretofore unapproved food additive may petition for "the issuance of a regulation prescribing the conditions under which such additive may be safely used".&lt;ref name=348b&gt;21 U.S.C. §348(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delaney clause===
The [[Delaney clause]], initially enacted in 1958, prohibits the FDA from approving food additives shown to cause [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=348c&gt;21 U.S.C. §348(c)(3)(A).&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the passage of the amendment, little was known about the [[carcinogen]]ic propensities of a wide variety of additives.&lt;ref name=text/&gt; Following the enactment of this amendment, more and more substances were shown to be potentially carcinogenic, albeit in experiments wherein test animals were subjected to doses far in excess to the proportions which humans were likely to consume. In 1982, the FDA responded to this trend by adopting a rule that a food additive would not be denied approval under the Delaney clause unless the additive itself, and not just the constituent chemicals used to make it, was shown to cause cancer.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, Policy for Regulating Carcinogenic Chemicals in Food and Color Additives, 47 Fed. Reg. 14464 (April 2, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was later challenged in court following FDA approval of a food coloring manufactured with a compound known to be carcinogenic, after separate testing indicated that the food coloring itself did not cause cancer in test animals. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] upheld the FDA's approval of the food coloring.&lt;ref&gt;''Scott v. Food and Drug Administration'', 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Added substances==

Added substances are not separately defined in the act, but are understood to be different from food itself based on the definition of adulterated food,&lt;ref name=342a2A&gt;21 U.S.C. §342(a)(2)(A).&lt;/ref&gt; and a later section authorizing the FDA to set forth tolerance limits for "[a]ny poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food...".&lt;ref name=USC346&gt;21 U.S.C. §346.&lt;/ref&gt; Such substances are prohibited, "except where such substance is required in the production thereof or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice".&lt;ref name=USC346 /&gt; Because added substances often can not be avoided in food, such as the presence of man-made pollutants in fish, the FDA is required to "promulgate regulations limiting the quantity therein or thereon to such extent as [is] necessary for the protection of public health".&lt;ref name=USC346 /&gt; The action levels discussed above with respect to poisonous or deleterious substances address these added substances. Added substances differ from food additives, discussed above, in that the latter applies to things which are ''intentionally'' added to food, and therefore require FDA approval prior to being added to food.

==Dietary supplements==
{{main|Dietary supplement}}
The [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act]] of 1994 mandated that the FDA regulate [[dietary supplement]]s as foods, rather than as drugs. Consequently, dietary supplements are defined as a kind of food under the statute,&lt;ref name=321ff3b2&gt;21 U.S.C. §321(ff)(3)(b)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; with the caveat that this does not exempt them from being treated as drugs in the way that other foods are exempted, if circumstances permit it.&lt;ref name=321ff3b2 /&gt;

Like other food substances, dietary supplements are not subject to the safety and efficacy testing requirements imposed on drugs, and unlike drugs they do not require prior approval by the FDA; however, they are subject to the FDA regulations regarding adulteration and misbranding. The FDA can take action against dietary supplements only after they are proven to be unsafe. Dietary supplements may be deemed to be misbranded if they are marketed in a way that characterizes them as a drug, without having undergone the clinical trials to which new drugs are subjected. Manufacturers of dietary supplements are permitted to make specific claims of health benefits, referred to as "structure or function claims" on the labels of these products.&lt;ref name=text/&gt; They may not claim to treat, diagnose, cure, or prevent disease and must include a disclaimer on the label.&lt;ref name="dshea text"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/dshea.html Text of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]. Accessed 5 Feb 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Where a manufacturer makes a structure or function claim in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement, the manufacturer must notify the FDA within 30 days after it has introduced that product to the market.

Claims that either a food or dietary supplement acts to ''prevent'' a disease are permitted, so long as there is "significant scientific agreement" for the claim, or it has been approved in an "authoritative statement" by "a scientific body with official responsibility for the public health protection or research directly relating to human nutrition" such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=343r3C&gt;21 U.S.C. §343(r)(3)(C).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibitions and treatment of violations==

The Act expressly prohibits the "introduction, or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of food... that is adulterated or misbranded",&lt;ref name=331a&gt;21 U.S.C. §331(a).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the actual adulteration or misbranding of food.&lt;ref name=331b&gt;21 U.S.C. §331(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The Act further sets forth a broad range of powers that the FDA may exercise in order to prevent distribution of adulterated or misbranded food. In addition to the express powers set forth in the statute, the FDA exercises certain implied powers, such as the issuance of [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]]s and recall orders.

The steps which the FDA may take in response to a violation include the following:
# Sending an "untitled letter" to the violator indicating the concern and requesting a response detailing how the concern will be addressed by the violator.&lt;ref&gt;FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual, Chapter 4 ("Advisory Actions") (March 2006), 4-1-10, "Warning Letter Format".&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sending a Warning Letter to the violator specifically identifying the violation and requiring a response detailing how the violation will be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual, Chapter 4 ("Advisory Actions") (March 2006), 4-2, "Untitled Letters".&lt;/ref&gt;
# Issuing a [[press release]], holding a [[press conference]], having notices posted, or taking similar action to alert the public to the violation. Use of [[publicity]] is expressly authorized by the Act,&lt;ref name=USC375&gt;21 U.S.C. §375.&lt;/ref&gt; and courts have held that the FDA need not give the alleged violator any notice or opportunity to be heard prior to the use of this measure.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''Hoxsey Cancer Clinic v. Folsom'', 155 F. Supp. 376 (D.D.C. 1957).&lt;/ref&gt; A party who feels that the FDA has wrongfully maligned its goods may file a [[lawsuit]] for [[defamation]], but no such suit has ever succeeded.&lt;ref name=text/&gt;
# Ordering the violator to recall the adulterated or misbranded products. The FDA has no formal authority to order a recall, but companies that receive such an order almost always comply with it to avoid invoking the FDA's more severe enforcement powers.&lt;ref name=text/&gt;
# Ordering the violator to disgorge its products from sales of products to third parties, and provide [[restitution]] to those parties. The FDA also lacks statutory authority for this practice, but is able to coerce violators to disgorge profits through consent decrees.&lt;ref name=text/&gt; Courts have also found that they have the equitable power to order disgorgement and restitution as requested.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Lane Labs-USA Inc.'', 427 F.3d 219 (3d Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Petitioning a [[United States district court]]s to issue an [[injunction]] against the violation, as permitted by the Act,&lt;ref name=USC332&gt;21 U.S.C. §332.&lt;/ref&gt; and to order the seizure of foods which violate the Act.&lt;ref name=USC334&gt;21 U.S.C. §334.&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA has an easier burden to obtain both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that does a private litigant, because the FDA is always acting in the public interest, and the injury sought to be prevented - violation of the laws designed to protect the public from harmful or misleading products - is presumed to be irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Odessa Union Warehouse Co-Op'', 833 F.2d 172 (9th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Seizing the offending food ''without'' first obtaining a court order, if the FDA has probable cause to believe that a misbranded food is dangerous to health or is fraudulent in a way that would cause commercial injury to the consumer.&lt;ref name=334a1B&gt;21 U.S.C. §334(a)(1)(B).&lt;/ref&gt; Where this occurs, the owner of the food may later seek to recover the seized food by initiating a proceeding in the local United States district court.&lt;ref name=334a1B /&gt;
# Seeking criminal penalties which may be imposed on violators, including imprisonment for up to a year and a fine of up to $1,000 for a first offense.&lt;ref name=333a1&gt;21 U.S.C. §333(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the president of a company that violates the Act may be found criminally liable for those violations even if he had no personal knowledge of the violations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Dotterweich]]'', 320 U.S. 277 (1943); ''[[United States v. Park]]'', 421 U.S. 658 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Act provides for civil penalties for certain violations relating to applications for approval of new drugs, it does not provide for civil penalties for violations involving food.&lt;ref name=335b&gt;21 U.S.C. §335b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where food is found to be adulterated, the FDA also has the option to offer the owner the opportunity to "recondition" the food - that is, to remove all traces and contamination, and submit that food for a reinspection by the FDA, at which time it may be approved for sale. Similarly, where food is found to be misbranded, the FDA has the option of offering the owner the opportunity to correct the labeling, and put the food back on the market with new labels that are not misleading.

'''Major Sherman Cottle''' is a [[fictional character]] in the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series. The [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|battlestar ''Galactica'']]'s [[Physician|Chief Medical Officer]], Cottle is played by [[Donnelly Rhodes]].

==Character biography==

Cottle is gruff, sarcastic, and portrayed as a heavy smoker. He isn't impressed or easily swayed by those in authority: He makes less-than-deferential remarks to both Cdr. [[William Adama]] and Col. [[Saul Tigh]],&lt;ref name="Resistance"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Resistance (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resistance| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even President [[Laura Roslin]].&lt;ref name="Act of Contrition"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Act of Contrition (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Act of Contrition| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the rank of [[Major]] in the [[Colonial Forces (Battlestar Galactica)|Colonial Fleet]],&lt;ref name="Bastille Day"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Bastille Day (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Bastille Day| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not a [[line officer]]: he does not form a part of ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[chain of command]].&lt;ref name="Fragged"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Fragged (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Fragged| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is invariably addressed by his medical title, and unlike [[Gaius Baltar]], Cottle does not object to the abbreviation "Doc".

Cottle appears to have a strict sense of medical ethics (possibly having sworn the Colonial equivalent of Earth's [[Hippocratic oath]]), and does not discriminate between human and [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] patients. He describes the sexual assault of [[Sharon Agathon|Sharon "Athena" Agathon]] as "unforgivable,"&lt;ref name="Resurrection Ship"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resurrection Ship| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, provides medical care to critically injured Cylons, telling Number Three that all patients are the same to him.&lt;ref name="Exodus"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Exodus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Roslin is a long term patient: she informs him of her [[breast cancer]] diagnosis two weeks after [[The Destruction of the Twelve Colonies|the destruction of the Twelve Colonies]],&lt;ref name="Act of Contrition"/&gt; and continues to see him at various points until her near death and successful treatment by Doctor [[Gaius Baltar|Baltar]]. Cottle opposes but does not obstruct Baltar's treatment method, which uses the blood of Sharon Agathon's unborn child, calling it "unnatural".&lt;ref name="Epiphanies"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Epiphanies (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Epiphanies| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottle appears to be among those who muster out of the Colonial Fleet after the establishment of the settlement on [[New Caprica]]. He continues to provide medical services as a civilian doctor, frustrated by the lack of [[antibiotic]]s and other medical supplies.&lt;ref name="Lay Down Your Burdens"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Cylon invasion, Cottle acts as a neutral party, providing medical care to all those in need.

Following the rescue of the New Caprica colonists,&lt;ref name="Exodus"/&gt; Cottle resumes his duties as ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; chief medical officer.&lt;ref name="A Measure of Salvation"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=A Measure of Salvation (Battlestar Galactica)| title=A Measure of Salvation| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He volunteers for the apparent suicide mission in the series finale, [[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak]]", but is reminded by [[William Adama]] that the fleet can not afford to lose a doctor. The civilian fleet reunites with ''Galactica'' after the battle, at the new habitable planet Starbuck jumped it to. Cottle then settles down on the new planet, named "Earth" after the original one, with the rest of the surviving crew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">Chronic '''systemic inflammation''' (SI) is the result of release of [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s from immune-related cells and the chronic activation of the innate immune system.

It can contribute to the development or progression of certain conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid14676136"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sattar N, McCarey DW, Capell H, McInnes IB |title=Explaining how "high-grade" systemic inflammation accelerates vascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Circulation |volume=108 |issue=24 |pages=2957–63 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14676136 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000099844.31524.05 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14676136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms ==
Release of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s and activation of the innate immune system may be the result of either external (biological or chemical agents) or internal (genetic mutations/variations) factors.

==Research==
While SI may be induced by multiple external factors, research suggests that a lack of control by tolerogenic [[dendritic cell]]s and [[T-regulatory cell]]s (Treg) is possibly the primary risk factor for the development of SI.  In functioning immune responses, T-helper and T-cytotoxic cells are activated by presentation of antigens by [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs).  Chief among these are [[dendritic cell]]s (DCs).  When a DC presents an antigen to a Treg cell, a signal is then sent to the nucleus of the DC, resulting in the production of [[Indoleamine 2,3- Dioxygenase]] (IDO). IDO inhibits T cell responses by depleting [[tryptophan]] and producing [[kynurenine]], which is toxic to the cell.

Individuals susceptible to developing chronic systemic inflammation appear to lack proper functioning of Treg cells and TDCs.  In these individuals, a lack of control of inflammatory processes results in multiple chemical and food intolerances, autoimmune diseases and many other symptoms and diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25208">'''Toxicodynamics''', termed [[pharmacodynamics]] in [[pharmacology]], describes the dynamic interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and its biological effects.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli&gt;Boelsterli, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A [[biological target]], also known as the site of action, can be binding proteins, [[ion channel]]s, [[DNA]], or a variety of other receptors. When a [[toxicant]] enters an organism, it can interact with these receptors and produce structural or functional alterations. The [[mechanism of action]] of the toxicant, as determined by a toxicant’s chemical properties, will determine what receptors are targeted and the overall toxic effect at the cellular level and organismal level.

Toxicants have been grouped together according to their chemical properties by way of [[quantitative structure-activity relationship]]s (QSARs), which allows prediction of toxic action based on these properties.  [[Endocrine disruptors|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs) and [[carcinogen]]s are examples of classes of toxicants that can act as QSARs. EDCs mimic or block transcriptional activation normally caused by natural [[steroid hormone]]s.  These types of chemicals can act on [[androgen receptor]]s, [[estrogen receptor]]s and [[thyroid hormone receptor]]s.  This mechanism can include such toxicants as [[dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]] (DDE) and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs). Another class of chemicals, carcinogens, are substances that cause [[cancer]] and can be classified as [[genotoxic]] or nongenotoxic carcinogens.  These categories include toxicants such as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAHs) and [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

The process of toxicodynamics can be useful for application in environmental [[risk assessment]] by implementing toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models.  TKTD models include phenomenas such as time-varying exposure, carry-over [[toxicity]], organism recovery time, effects of mixtures, and extrapolation to untested [[chemical compound|chemicals]] and [[species]].  Due to their advantages, these types of models may be more applicable for risk assessment than traditional modeling approaches.

== Overview ==

[[File:Diagram showing the conceptual pathway of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.png|thumb|alt=A box model explaining the processes of toxokinetics and toxicodynamics.|A box model explaining the processes of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.]]

While [[toxicokinetics]] describes the changes in the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, [[biotransformation]], distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a [[biological target]] and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity [[binding site]]s increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which will translate into effects at higher levels of organization.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt;

== Endocrine disruptors ==

EDCs are generally considered to be toxicants that either mimic or block the transcriptional activation normally caused by natural steroid hormones.&lt;ref name=Tabb&gt;Tabb and Blumberg, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals include those acting on androgen receptors, estrogen receptors and thryoid hormone receptors.&lt;ref name=Tabb /&gt;

=== Effects of endocrine disruptors ===

Endocrine disrupting chemicals can interfere with the [[endocrine system]] in a number of ways including hormone synthesis, storage/release, transport and clearance, receptor recognition and binding, and postreceptor activation.&lt;ref name=Choi&gt;Choi et al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In wildlife, exposure to EDCs can result in altered fertility, reduced viability of offspring, impaired hormone secretion or activity and modified reproductive anatomy.&lt;ref name=Guillette&gt;Guillette et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive anatomy of offspring can particularly be affected if maternal exposure occurs.&lt;ref name=Colborn&gt;Colborn et al., 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In females, this includes [[mammary gland]]s, [[fallopian tube]]s, [[uterus]], [[cervix]], and [[vagina]]. In males, this includes the [[prostate]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[epididymitis]] and [[testes]].&lt;ref name=Colborn /&gt; Exposure of fish to EDCs has also been associated with abnormal thyroid function, decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, de-feminization and masculinization of female fish and alteration of [[immune system|immune function]].&lt;ref name=Colborn /&gt;

Endocrine disruption as a [[mode of action]] for [[xenobiotic]]s was brought into awareness by [[Our Stolen Future]] by Theo Colborn.&lt;ref name=Tabb /&gt; Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to accumulate in body tissue and are highly persistent in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Clotfelter et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Many toxicants are known EDCs including [[pesticide]]s, [[phthalate]]s, [[phytoestrogens]], some industrial/commercial products, and [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref name=Choi /&gt; These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via a few different mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid hormone receptor is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.

=== Androgen-receptor mediated ===
Certain toxicants act as endocrine disruptors by interacting with the androgen receptor. DDE is one example of a chemical that acts via this mechanism. DDE is a [[metabolite]] of [[DDT]] that is widespread in the environment.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; Although production of DDT has been banned in the Western world, this chemical is extremely persistent and is still commonly found in the environment along with its metabolite DDE.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; DDE is an [[antiandrogen]], which means it alters the expression of specific androgen-regulated genes, and is an androgen receptor (AR)-mediated mechanism.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; DDE is a [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] compound which diffuses into the cell and binds to the AR.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; Through binding, the receptor is inactivated and cannot bind to the androgen response element on DNA.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; This inhibits the transcription of androgen-responsive genes&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; which can have serious consequences for exposed wildlife. In 1980, there was a spill in [[Lake Apopka]], Florida which released the pesticide dicofol and DDT along with its metabolites.&lt;ref name=Guillette /&gt; The neonatal and juvenile alligators present in this lake have been extensively studied and observed to have altered [[Blood plasma|plasma]] hormone concentrations, decreased clutch viability, increased juvenile mortality, and morphological abnormalities in the testis and ovary.&lt;ref name=Guillette /&gt;

=== Estrogen-receptor mediated ===
Toxicants may also cause endocrine disruption through interacting with the estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals have been used as coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties.&lt;ref name=ATSDR&gt;ATSDR&lt;/ref&gt; A purely [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment.&lt;ref name=ATSDR /&gt; PCBs are a [[xenoestrogen]], which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in organisms.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as [[heat shock protein]]s 59, 70, and 90.&lt;ref name=Pait&gt;Pait, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a [[protein dimer|homodimer]] complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the [[chromatin]] and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation.&lt;ref name=Perrin&gt;Perrin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the [[harbor seal]] (Phoca vitulina).&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; Similar effects have been found in the [[grey seal]] (Halichoerus grypus), the [[ringed seal]] (Pusa hispida) and the [[California sea lion]] (Zalophys californinus).&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and [[stenosis]] were found which led to [[sterility (physiology)|sterility]].&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce [[vitellogenin]].&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; This is often used as a [[biomarker]] for EDCs.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt;

== Carcinogens ==
Carcinogens are defined as any substance that causes cancer. The toxicodynamics of carcinogens can be complex due to the varying mechanisms of action for different carcinogenic toxicants. Because of their complex nature, carcinogens are classified as either genotoxic or nongenotoxic carcinogens.

=== Effects of carcinogens ===
The effects of carcinogens are most often related to human exposures but mammals are not the only species that can be affected by cancer-causing toxicants.&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;Rand, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have shown that cancer can develop in fish species as well.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; [[Neoplasm]]s occurring in [[Epithelium|epithelial tissue]] such as the [[liver]], gastrointestinal tract, and the [[pancreas]] have been linked to various environmental toxicants.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; Carcinogens preferentially target the liver in fish and develop hepatocellular and biliary lesions.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt;

=== Genotoxic carcinogens ===
Genotoxic carcinogens interact directly with DNA and genetic material or indirectly by their reactive metabolites.&lt;ref name=VanDelft&gt;VanDelft et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicants such as PAHs can be genotoxic carcinogens to aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  PAHs are widely spread throughout the environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as [[benzo(a)pyrene]], [[benz(a)anthracene]], and Benzofluoranthene, are [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] and responsible for liver [[disease]]s like cancer in wild fish populations.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of [[DNA adduct]]s. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and available for biotransformation.

The biotransformation process can activate the PAH compound and transform it into a diol epoxide,&lt;ref name=Munoz&gt;Munoz and Albores, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which is a very [[reactive intermediate]]. These diol-epoxides [[Covalent bond|covalently bind]] with DNA [[base pair]]s, most often with [[guanine]] and [[adenine]] to form stable adducts within the DNA structure.&lt;ref name=Munoz /&gt; The binding of diol epoxides and DNA base pairs blocks polymerase replication activity. This blockage ultimately contributes to an increase in DNA damage by reducing repair activity.&lt;ref name=Munoz /&gt;

Due to these processes, PAH compounds are thought to play a role in the initiation and early promotion stage of [[carcinogenesis]]. Fish exposed to PAHs develop a range of liver [[lesion]]s, some of which are characteristic of [[hepatocarcinogen]]icity.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;

=== Nongenotoxic carcinogens ===
Nongenotoxic, or [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] carcinogens are different and slightly more ambiguous than genotoxic carcinogens since they are not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of carcinogenesis does not change the sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes.&lt;ref name=VanDelft /&gt; Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, little is known about the mechanistic pathway.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by [[oxidative stress]], peroxisome proliferation, suppression of [[apoptosis]], alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of metabolizing enzymes.&lt;ref name=VanDelft /&gt;

Carbon tetrachloride  is an example of a probable nongenotoxic carcinogen to aquatic vertebrates. Historically, carbon tetrachloride has been used in pharmaceutical production, petroleum refining, and as an industrial solvent.&lt;ref name=NTP&gt;National Toxicology Program, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its widespread industrial use and release into the environment, carbon tetrachloride has been found in drinking water and therefore, has become a concern for aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Rabergh&gt;Rabergh and Lipsky, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its high [[Hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] properties, carbon tetrachloride could potentially be linked to liver cancer. Experimental cancer studies have shown that carbon tetrachloride may cause [[Benign tumor|benign]] and [[Malignancy|malignant]] liver [[tumor]]s to [[rainbow trout]].&lt;ref name=NTP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabergh /&gt; carbon tetrachloride works as a nongenotoxic carcinogen by formulating [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] which induce oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; It has been proposed that once carbon tetrachloride enters the organism, it is metabolized to trichloromethyl and trichloromethyl peroxy radicals by the [[CYP2E1]] [[enzyme]].&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manibusan&gt;Manibusan and Eastmond, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The more reactive radical, trichloromethyl peroxy, can attack [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in the [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]] to form [[fatty acid]] free radicals and initiate [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; The attack on the cellular membrane increases its permeability, causing a leakage of enzymes and disrupts cellular calcium [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; This loss of calcium homeostasis activates calcium dependent [[degradative enzyme]]s and [[cytotoxicity]], causing hepatic damage.&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; The regenerative and proliferative changes that occur in the liver during this time could increase the frequency of genetic damage, resulting in a possible increase of cancer.&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt;

== Applications ==

Toxicodynamics can be used in combination with toxicokinetics in environmental risk assessment to determine the potential effects of releasing a toxicant into the environment.  The most widely used method of incorporating this are TKTD models.

=== Setup of TKTD models ===
Both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics have now been described, and using these definitions models were formed, where the internal concentration (TK) and damage (TD) are [[simulation|simulated]] in response to exposure.  TK and TD are separated in the model to allow for the identification of properties of toxicants that determine TK and those that determine TD.  To use this type of model, [[parameter]] values for TK processes need to be obtained first.  Second, the TD parameters need to be estimated.  Both of these steps require a large database of toxicity information for [[parameterization]].  After establishing all the parameter values for the TKTD model, and using basic scientific precautions, the model can be used to predict toxic effects, calculate recovery times for organisms, or establish extrapolations from the model to toxicity of untested toxicants and species.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher"&gt;Ashauer and Escher 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashauer et al., 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of TKTD models ===
It has been argued that the current challenges facing risk assessments can be addressed with TKTD modeling.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;  TKTD models were derived in response to a couple of factors.  One is the lack of time being considered as a factor in toxicity and risk assessment.  Some of the earliest developed TKTD models, such as the [[Critical Body Residue]] (CBR) model and Critical Target Occupation (CTO) model, have considered time as a factor but a criticism has been that they are for very specific circumstances such as reversibly acting toxicants or irreversibly acting toxicants.  Further extrapolation of the CTO and CBR models are [[DEBtox]], which can model sublethal endpoints, and hazard versions of the CTO, which takes into account [[stochastic]] death as opposed to individual [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]].&lt;ref name="Jager et al."&gt;Jager et al. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another significant step to developing TKTD models was the incorporation of a [[state variable]] for damage.  By using damage as a toxicodynamic state-variable, modeling intermediate recovery rates can be accomplished for toxicants that act reversibly with their targets, without the assumptions of instant recovery (CBR model) or irreversible interactions (CTO model). TKTD models that incorporate damage are the Damage Assessment Model (DAM) and the Threshold Damage Model (TDM).&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt; For what may seem like straightforward [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], a variety of different TKTD approaches exist.  A review of the assumptions and [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of each was previously published in the creation of a general unified threshold model of survival (GUTS).&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt;

=== Advantages for risk assessment ===

As referenced above, TKTD models have several advantages to traditional models for risk assessments.  The principal advantages to using TKTD models are:&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;

* The consequences of time-varying or repeated [[Chemical exposure|exposures]] can be explained and simulated by the TKTD model.
* Carry-over toxicity as well as delayed effects can be simulated, whether the carry-over toxicity is due to TK or TD or both.&lt;ref&gt;Ashauer et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, TKTD models can quantify risks from pulsed or fluctuating exposures.
* Organism recovery time depends on the time course of TK and TD, which makes the TKTD models suitable for calculating organism recovery time.
* TKTD models have the potential to predict effects of mixtures and also be used as mechanism-based extrapolation to untested toxicants or untested species.
* Linking TKTD models with [[agent-based model|Individual Based Models]] (IBM) may improve risk assessment of toxicants by simulating [[Time|temporal]] aspects as well as [[ecology|ecological]] aspects.

Due to its advantages, TKTD models may be more powerful than the traditional [[dose-response relationship|dose-response]] models because of their incorporation of chemical [[concentration]]s as well as temporal dimensions.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;  Toxicodynamic modeling (such as TKTD models) has been shown to be a useful tool for toxicological research, with increasing opportunities to use these results in risk assessment to permit a more scientifically based risk assessment that is less reliable on [[animal testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaauboer 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, these types of models can formalize knowledge about the toxicity of toxicants and organism [[Resistance (ecology)|sensitivity]], create new hypotheses, and simulate temporal aspects of toxicity, making them useful tools for risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4976">{{About|the body concerned with chemical reaction hazards|the UK professional engineering association and charity|Hazards Forum}}
The '''UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum''' is a group of [[process safety]] scientists, from different companies, who meet at regular intervals to share knowledge and experiences of recent [[chemical incident]]s, within their own companies, with the aim of preventing a repeat of the incident at a different location.  They further try extend this aim to assist smaller companies, many of whom will not have access to the sophisticated equipment of the forum members, by publishing these incidents and near-misses on a web site.

==History==
Prior to 1995, the main source of data pertaining to [[chemical reaction]] incidents was the [[Regulatory agency|regulatory bodies]] (e.g. [[Health and Safety Executive]] in UK), following the investigation (and maybe) [[prosecution]] post incident.  There was very little data that could be obtained regarding incidents and [[Near miss (safety)|near-misses]] that fell outside this area.

By this time the majority of the larger chemical companies all had some sort of [[Process safety]] section, either as a stand-alone unit or as part of a [[Process development]] area – increasing amounts of safety studies are needed as the scale is increased.  Workers in this field were becoming acquainted with those in other companies, due to a rapid rise in the number of specialist safety testing equipment (most notably the [[Calorimeter#Adiabatic calorimeters|Accelerating Rate Calorimeter]] and the [[Calorimeter#Reaction calorimeters|Metter-Toledo RC1 Reaction Calorimeter]])

In 1994 two of these safety scientists got together with the idea of creating a forum for free and unbiased information exchange.  They contacted many of the companies with known process safety sections, and an [[inaugural]] meeting in May 1995 was achieved, with people representing 15 different companies plus the addition of an academic expert in chemical reaction incidents from the [[South Bank University]].

==Forum size==
The forum size has been kept to around 15 members. The forum is [[non-profit organization]], and has no need to raise funds as all meetings are carried out at the members sites on a rota basis. Due to the many mergers and divestments over the years since its start, there has had to be quite a few changes, and the newer companies have been invited to join to keep the numbers viable.

==Members==
The members are typically senior safety scientists, often at a managerial level, from the major UK chemical companies, including:-
* [[Alfa Aesar]]
* [[AstraZeneca]]
* [[Avecia]]
* [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals]]
* [[Evonik Industries]]
* [[Whyte Chemicals|Grosvenor Chemicals]]
* [[GlaxoSmithKline]]
* [[London South Bank University]]
* [[Merck Sharp and Dohme]]
* [[Nicholas Piramal]]
* [[Pfizer]]
* Shasun
* [[Sigma Aldrich]]
* [[Syngenta]]
* [[UCB (company)|UCB-Celltech]]

==Website==
The incident data on the web site has been obtained from all over the world, not just in the UK.  Many of the members have global sites, which report back to them.  In addition there is some data which has been freely supplied from other individuals and companies, via the e-mail links on the web site.

In all cases the data is made anonymous, so that there can be no link back to the originator – otherwise it would be unlikely that the majority of the data would ever have been released.

Many adedemic chemistry departments have installed links to the site on their own web pages, to facilitate their students education in reaation hazards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19534">In [[science fiction]], '''uplift''' is a developmental process to transform a certain species of animals into more intelligent beings by other, already-intelligent beings. This is usually accomplished by cultural, technological, or evolutional interventions like [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|genetic engineering]] but any fictional or real process can be used. The earliest appearance of the concept is in [[H. G. Wells]]' 1896 novel ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=Keith M.|title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction in Literature|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently appears in [[David Brin]]'s ''[[Uplift Universe|Uplift series]]'' and other science fiction works.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JXnz9x9sO4C&amp;pg=PA850 |title=The Greenwood encyclopedia of science fiction and fantasy |volume=2 |author=David Langford |chapter=Uplift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The concept can be traced to [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://web.syr.edu/~blbousfi/UPLIFTEX22.html FROM THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU TO LIVES OF THE MONSTER DOGS: UPLIFTED ANIMALS, WISH FULFILLMENT, AND ORIGINAL SIN &lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at web.syr.edu  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111202414/http://web.syr.edu/~blbousfi/UPLIFTEX22.html|date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the titular scientist transforms animals into horrifying parodies of humans through surgery and psychological torment. The resulting animal-people obsessively recite the Law, a series of prohibitions against reversion to animal behaviors, with the haunting refrain of "Are we not men?" Wells' novel reflects Victorian concerns about [[vivisection]] and of the power of unrestrained scientific experimentation to do terrible harm.

Other early literary examples can be found in the following works:
* [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s "Johnny Black" stories (beginning with "[[The Command (short story)|The Command]]") about a black bear raised to human-level intelligence, published in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' from 1938-1940. 
* [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Sirius (novel)|Sirius]]'' (1944) explores a dog with human intelligence. 
* In [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s ''[[Instrumentality of Mankind]]'' series "underpeople" are created from animals through unexplained technological means explicitly to be servants of humanity, and were often treated as less than slaves by the society that used them, until the laws were reformed in the story ''[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]'' (1962). However, Smith's characterizations of individual underpeople are frequently quite sympathetic, and one of his most memorable characters is C'Mell, the cat-woman who appears in ''[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]'' and in ''[[Norstrilia]]'' (1975).

David Brin has stated that his [[Uplift Universe]] was written at least in part in response to the common assumption in earlier science fiction such as Smith's work and ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' that uplifted animals would, or even should, be treated as possessions rather than people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090325125822/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue25/interview.html David Brin&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.scifi.com&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a significant part of the conflict in the series revolves around the differing policies of Galactics and humans toward their client races. Galactic races traditionally hold their uplifted "clients" in a hundred-millennium-long [[indenture]], during which the "patrons" have extensive rights and claims over clients' lives and labor power. In contrast, humans have given their uplifted [[dolphin]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s near-equal [[civil rights]], with a few legal and economic disabilities related to their unfinished state.  A key scene in ''[[Startide Rising]]'' is a discussion between a self-aware computer (the Niss) and a leading human (Gillian) about how the events during their venture (and hence the novel's plot) relate to the morality of the Galactics' system of uplift.

'''Vaccination Week In The Americas''' (VWA) is an annual public health campaign by the [[member state]]s of the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) to promote equity and access to [[immunization]].&lt;ref name="Vaccination Week in the Americas: An Opportunity to Integrate Other Health Services With Immunization"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/205/suppl_1/S120.full.pdf?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=XCWwDrPkQYJ6zCZ |title=Vaccination Week In The Americas: An Opportunity to Integrate Other Health Services With Immunization |publisher=Journal of Infectious Diseases |year=2012 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marked each year during the last week of April.&lt;ref name=PAHO-VW-hist /&gt;

Since 2012, the campaign has been celebrated globally across all regions of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) under [[World Immunization Week]]. The WHO reports there are 25 [[vaccine-preventable diseases|diseases]] for which vaccines exist for their prevention and control.&lt;ref name=WHOglobal&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/immunization/global_vaccine_action_plan/GVAP_doc_2011_2020/en/ Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020.] Geneva, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Typhoid inoculation2.jpg|right|thumb|A doctor performing a [[typhoid]] vaccination in [[Texas]], 1943]]
VWA was initially proposed in April 23, 2002, under the presidency of Dr. Patricio Jamriska, Secretary of Health of the Republic of Ecuador and by the Ministers of Health in the Andean Region following a [[measles]] outbreak in Venezuela and Colombia.&lt;ref name="PAHO-VW-hist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=940&amp;Itemid=834 |title=History of Vaccination Week in the Americas |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally endorsed through the adoption of Resolution CD44.R by the Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the overarching objectives of VWA are to
promote equity and access to immunization and strengthen immunization programs in the Region of the Americas by “reaching the unreached”, populations with otherwise limited access to regular health services and at heightened risk of contracting [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. In the Americas, such populations can be found in areas such as urban fringes, low coverage municipalities, indigenous communities and rural and/or border zones.&lt;ref name="PAHO-VW-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=750&amp;Itemid=1 |title=Vaccination Week In The Americas (2009 portal) |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

VWA has been used to conduct large-scale vaccination campaigns, introduce new vaccines, carry out communication and social mobilization campaigns, and to integrate other [[health promotion]] measures.&lt;ref name="Vaccination Week in the Americas: An Opportunity to Integrate Other Health Services With Immunization"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAHO-VW-2008-final"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/vw2008_final.pdf |title=VWA 2008 Final Report |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch in 2003, over 365 million individuals have been vaccinated through campaigns conducted under the framework of the initiative.&lt;ref name="PAHO-VW-2011-final"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=15609&amp;Itemid=3594 |title=VWA 2011 Final Report |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |format=PDF |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, PAHO joined the other five WHO regions to celebrate [[World Immunization Week]]. This followed the launch of [[European Immunization Week]] (EIW) in the WHO European region in 2005, and Vaccination Week campaigns launched in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region in 2010, and in the WHO African and Western Pacific regions in 2011. The member states of the WHO South-East Asian region committed to the annual campaign in 2012.

==Themes==
The goals and activities for each VWA are chosen in accordance with a specific theme, and adapted in alignment with national health objectives.&lt;ref name="Vaccination Week in the Americas Goes Global"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhealthmagazine.com/cover_stories/vaccination_week_goes_global |title=Vaccination Week in the Americas Goes Global |publisher=Global Health Magazine |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===2014===
The twelfth VWA takes place from 26 April to 3 May 2014, with the regional slogan: “''Vaccination: Your best shot''.” This slogan was chosen to encourage people to protect themselves and their communities against the importation of [[polio]], [[measles]] and other vaccine-preventable diseases, in the context of the upcoming [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;PAHO, [http://www.paho.org/vwa/ Vaccination Week in the Americas.] Accessed 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Vendor Neutral Archive''' ('''VNA''') is a [[medical imaging]] technology in which images and documents (and potentially any file of clinical relevance) are stored (archived) in a standard format with a standard interface, such that they can be accessed in a vendor-neutral manner by other systems.

This terminology is used as distinct from a traditional [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems]] (PACS), although there is debate about where the boundary between a VNA and a PACS lies along the continuum of their common features.

==Definition==
The simplest definition is "a medical device that stores medical images in a standard format with a standard interface, such that they can be accessed in a vendor-neutral manner by other systems".

So-called "vendor neutrality" is implied by the standard format and interface, and the neutrality is with respect to vendor-specific devices that produce or consume those images (e.g., for display, distribution or analysis, with or without specific workflows, such as for radiology reporting, i.e., a [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]]).

The exact definition and feature set is contentious though, and evolves as different vendors of VNAs attempt to distinguish themselves from their competitors and avoid being excluded, and customers express desires ranging from pragmatic to fantastic.

There is general agreement on the following key features:

* Storage of [[DICOM]] images and related composite objects (presentation states, key objects, structured reports)
* DICOM network standard interface for storage, query and retrieval
* Administrative updates and corrections (patient ID changes and study merges)
* [[Scalability]]

Each of the following features remain contentious, in the sense that some customers and vendors claim that some or all are fundamental to the concept, but others disagree:

* Storage of objects not directly related to images (such as human-generated requests and reports)
* Storage of non-DICOM content (such as [[HL7]] [[Clinical Document Architecture|CDA]] documents)
* Non-DICOM access protocols (such as IHE Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing ([[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing|XDS]] and XDS-I)
* Cross-domain identity and code resolution (patient ID, accession #, procedure codes)
* Dynamic DICOM tag morphing
* [[Information lifecycle management]]
* Exclusion of workflow management database content
* Independence from choice of database engine
* Audit trail of access

==History==

===Evolution===
Traditionally, the need to store medical images has been most common in the radiology and nuclear medicine departments, and has been implemented in the form of sub-specialty and departmental (PACS), which have combined the functions of image management and image archiving into a single solution. Whilst such systems all have standard interfaces ([[DICOM]] and [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]]) for ingestion and distribution of images over the network and on physical media (like CD), typically the workflow and optimal performance for display are achieved using proprietary software and protocols. Further, the persistent storage "inside" a proprietary PACS may not be in a standard form, the PACS may not update the stored files with the latest study and demographic updates and annotations stored in the database, and it may extend, abuse or depend on specific standard and non-standard (private) DICOM attributes in the stored files.

Over time, in many implementations, the underlying storage infrastructure has been "factored" out of the traditional (PACS) at the hardware and file system ([[Direct-attached storage|DAS]], [[Network-attached storage|NAS]], [[Storage area network|SAN]]) level, and are supplied instead by non-domain-specific [[computer data storage]] vendors.

As more medical specialties incorporate images in their practice, the need to extend image storage and distribution capability to other departments, enterprise wide. Increasingly there is a desire to inter-operate at a higher application level, separating departmental-specific workflows, display and analysis solutions from image storage infrastructure, using standard protocols that are image and metadata aware, without sacrificing display performance.

A complicating factor is that the (PACS) offerings are in a constant state of flux with respect to features and quality of service, and traditionally users will abandon one vendor and replace their product with another's every 3–5 years. This triggers the need to "migrate" the images and associated information to the new architecture without data loss, a non-trivial task despite the use of standard formats for image encoding. The concept of a VNA theoretically allows for greater stability (re-usability and less frequent migration) at the archive level, despite rapid evolution and change at the higher application-level (display and workflow). Of course, migrating from one vendor's VNA to another isn't trivial either, just hopefully less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnie|first=Aunt|title=Vendor Neutral Archive (Migration)|url=http://www.auntminnie.com/forum/tm.aspx?high=&amp;m=333472|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative term for a VNA is a "PACS Neutral Archive", which perhaps better conveys the original intent, but this term is rarely used, and for better or for worse, VNA has become the [[buzzword]] of choice amongst customers and salesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Is it a PACS-Neutral Archive or Vendor-Neutral Archive?|url=http://www.graycons.com/news/is-it-a-pacs-neutral-archive-or-vendor-neutral-archive/|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
As noted above, the archive of images was naturally mostly static—that is, most of the content of an archive is unchanged, with only a (relatively) small number of examinations added each day. On the other hand, the PACS workstation benefits from the rapid advance of technology. Therefore, it was suggested as early as 1998 that it would be desirable to separate these such that the archive was independent of the workstation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Bradley|date=1998|title=The Evolution of Electronic Imaging in the Medical Environment|url=|journal=J Digit Imaging|volume=11|issue=Suppl 1|pages=71–74|doi=10.1007/BF03168264|pmc=3453350|access-date=|pmid=9735437}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that article it was noted that one or more 'Independent DICOM Archives' could achieve this benefit and even provide inter-enterprise image sharing. The article also noted the practical challenges at the time—namely the relative inefficiency of doing DICOM queries against such multiple archives and separating out those responses relevant for pre-fetching, as well as challenges of patient identifiers. Never-the-less, the ability to have images in a separate system from the workstation was felt to be an important capability, and ultimately, Erickson and colleagues developed this into a startup company, TeraMedica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teramedica.com|title=Teramedica, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000, which was purchased by Fuji Medical Systems in 2015.

A long running Aunt Minnie PACS Forum thread digressed to discuss the issue of neutral archives amongst a broader audience after a response from Michael Gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnie|first=Aunt|title=RE: The Dalai's Laws of PACS|url=http://www.auntminnie.com/forum/tm.aspx?high=&amp;m=101689&amp;mpage=1#102308|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Gray offers his essential ingredients of a VNA in his 2009 blog entry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Essential Ingredients of a PACS-Neutral Archive|url=http://www.graycons.com/pacs-neutral-archive/essential-ingredients-of-a-pacs-neutral-archive/|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; making reference to Acuo's checklist of attributes, the most recent form of which can be found in Shannon Werb's white paper on attributes of a "true" VNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Werb|first=Shannon|title=12 Attributes of a True Vendor Neutral Archive|url=http://www.acuotech.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=tag&amp;tag=white%20paper&amp;app_id=1&amp;Itemid=632|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Oosterwijk provides a more recent description on behalf of another vendor, Teramedica, in his white paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterwijk|first=Herman|title=What is a VNA anyway?|url=http://www.himss.org/files/HIMSSorg/content/files/TeraMedicaWhatisaVNA.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-22|date=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he offers a more detailed definition: "A Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA) is a medical device that provides scalable image and information and life cycle management so that images and related information can be queried, stored, and retrieved in a manner that is defined by open standards at multiple department, enterprise, and regional level while maintaining patient privacy and security. Characteristic for a VNA is that it provides a patient-centric approach that transcends upgrades and changes of the different viewing, acquisition, and workflow management components as they should be interchangeable without having to migrate, convert, or change the data formats or interface of the VNA."

The relationship of VNA to storage of medical images in the [[cloud storage|cloud]] is also nebulous, though offers high potential for [[buzzword compliant|buzzword compliance]], and Michael Gray provides some clarity in his paper commissioned by EMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Cloud Infrastructure in Vendor Neutral Archive Configurations|url=http://www.graycons.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Cloud-Infrastructure-and-VNA.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term "VNA" has been so abused as a marketing term, it has already achieved mythical status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Dave|title=Top 5 Myths About Vendor Neutral Archives|url=http://blogs.hds.com/hdsblog/2011/02/top-5-myths-about-vendor-neutral-archives.html|accessdate=2014-07-10|date=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Administrative updates and corrections===
A passive archive will simply store what it receives, and potentially overwrite the same thing when it is received again with changes but the same (unique) identifiers. This is insufficient in a production operation, where mistakes are made, and it is necessary to correct patient demographics, or correct mistakes (wrong patient or request or side was selected during an exam and incorrect information present in the image headers).

Standards exist that cover some use cases, such as IHE Patient Information Reconciliation (PIR) and Imaging Object Change Management (IOCM).

===Cross-domain identity and code resolution===
For an archive to span departments, institutions, regions or even national boundaries, the question of identification of entities and concepts must be addressed.

In general, within a domain such as an individual institution, patient identifiers and identifiers of request, studies and reports (e.g., by accession numbers) are assigned uniquely within that domain, but not outside. Most internal systems (and most [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]]) do not manage the existence of multiple identity domains, and if identifiers are used across domains then collisions and ambiguity occur. Thus each identifier needs to either be qualified by its "assigning authority" when used (the approach taken by the [[DICOM]]-based [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] Multiple Image Manager Archive (MIMA) profile) or coerced into a single "canonical" identifier that spans the scope of the larger domain that includes all integrated cross-enterprise systems (the approach taken by IHE [[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing]]. When importing outside images into the local archive, this matter also has to be addressed, usually by mapping the outside identifier into an internal identifier and re-encoding the information (coercion) in the DICOM "header" or other meta-data (such as by the manner specified in Import Reconciliation Workflow).

Whether support for this is an essential feature for a VNA depends on what environment it is intended to be deployed in (within one enterprise or across enterprises), but robust support provides insurance against future deployment configuration changes (such as enterprise mergers).

Likewise, local code sets used for such things as procedure codes (for "orderables", as opposed to billing codes), are not well standardized, and where these are useful in images to drive workflow and display (such as hanging protocols), an ability to map these too is a useful feature.

===Dynamic tag morphing===
One purpose of a VNA is to store information and serve it to multiple systems that may have different requirements for its use and expectations for very specific characteristics of the DICOM attributes and values stored in them, both standard and private.

The concept of "dynamic tag morphing" is touted as a solution to the problem of two different systems expecting different values in the same attribute. "Tag morphing" refers to changing the values in one or more attributes (usually DICOM data elements in this context). This may be done "statically", in which case only one mapping is performed, or "dynamically", in which case multiple mappings, each specific to a particular recipient, is performed.

In its degenerate form, the ability to map any tag and value to any other is inherently dangerous and undermines the value of attempting to standardize attributes in the first place, and the efforts by modality and PACS vendors to use them "properly". That said, there is variation in the installed base and even new products in how some fields are used, particularly for highly specific and advanced forms of imaging, and corresponding variation in what advanced display and analysis applications expect in their input. Accordingly this is a popular feature, despite its dangers. Some will argue strongly that it is an essential feature to be classed as a VNA.

This feature is reminiscent of what is common in the [[HL7]] version 2 world, a so-called Interface Engine, which is designed to map pretty much anything to anything else, depending on the source and target.

A typical use case is to change the values in Series Description supplied by acquisition modalities, in order to allow two different PACS sharing the same data to use different hanging protocol rules based in Series Description. Arguably, this could be achieved in a more standard way if modalities populated other attributes in more detail, acquisition protocols and codes for them were better standardized and hanging protocol engines were more flexible, but given the limitations of the state of the art, this technique remains useful.

Dynamic tag morphing is distinct from the specific attribute changes related to Cross-domain Identity and Code Resolution (what DICOM in PS 3.4 refers to as "coercion"), for which there are standards defined for what to change, when and how, and which often involve additional actors such as a Master Patient Index, though some proponents lump these together and some products implement them using the same mechanism.

Michael Gray was an early proponent of tag morphing and regards it an essential VNA feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=DICOM Tag Morphing – Essential Ingredient in Enterprise PACS Archive|url=http://www.graycons.com/pacs-technologies/dicom-tag-morphing-essential-ingredient-in-enterprise-pacs-archive/|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2007-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A description of tag morphing use-cases can be found in Wayne Dejarnette's 2010 white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dejarnette|first=Wayne|title=Context Management and Tag Morphing in the Real World|url=http://www.vendorneutralarchive.com/Literature/Context%20Management%20and%20Tag%20Morphing%20in%20the%20Real%20World.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information lifecycle management===
Disk is cheap, though power and air-conditioning are not, but regardless, storage has a finite cost, particularly when one is paying as one goes rather than using a locally hosted capitalized infra-structure.

Accordingly, when medico-legal retention periods expire, or the clinical utility expires (such as on a patient's death), many users would like to be able to purge their storage. The rules for this are complex, and vary between jurisdictions as well as according to local policy. Given the conflicting demands of financiers, risk managers, litigators, researchers and educators, coming to agreement on such a policy may be difficult.

Regardless, a potentially useful VNA feature is support for locally customizable rule-based purging (culling) criteria, whether it be by implementing the rules directly, or responding to IHE Imaging Object Change Management (IOCM) requests from a separate rules engine.

===Non-DICOM content===
VNAs should have no difficulty storing DICOM content such images and associated information such as presentation states and so-called "evidence documents", such as DICOM Structured Reports containing such things as measurements recorded by the modality, or post-processing results such as from [[Computer-aided diagnosis|CAD]].

In a clinical setting, however, other document and bulk object types may be available that it would be desirable to store. Most PACS take the approach of converting these to DICOM, in some cases using objects intended to "encapsulate" another type of object. The classic example is a scanned document stored as a PDF file and encapsulated in a DICOM PDF object along with sufficient metadata to identify it and manage it, as if it were an image. VNAs should support these type of encapsulated DICOM objects and the DICOM "header" provides a means to obtain the metadata for indexing to support query and retrieval. Michael Gray elaborates in detail on this topic in his white paper on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Best Practices Strategy for Dealing with non-DICOM Data objects in a PACS-Neutral Archive|url=http://www.merge.com/MergeHealthcare/media/documents/whitepapers/Best_Practices_Strategy_for_non-DICOM_data_in_Neutral_Archive.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other object types, or when there is no DICOM encapsulation object available, or when there is no need to interface with DICOM systems, as long as there is a standard means of providing the necessary metadata for indexing, such as by using HL7 version 2 messages or XDS registry services, then in theory a VNA could store anything.

Specific types of non-DICOM content, such as an HL7 CDA document instance containing, for example, a radiology report, could be stored either as a XDS, or first encapsulated in a DICOM Encapsulated CDA object and stored using DICOM services, or its content and header could be transcoded into a DICOM Structured Report instance. A fully featured VNA might have the ability to transcode any single instance into another form depending on what the requesting system needed ("object morphing", if you will).

A description of Wayne Dejarnette's approach to non-DICOM object storage in his product is described in his 2009 white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dejarnette|first=Wayne|title=Archiving of non-DICOM data with xDL|url=http://www.vendorneutralarchive.com/Literature/Archiving%20of%20non-DICOM%20data%20with%20xDL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface standardization==

===Image file format on long term storage media===
There is general agreement that the use of the DICOM file format is required for images, and that where images are compressed for archival or transport, standard, not proprietary, compression schemes (transfer syntaxes) need to be used. Indeed, a distinguishing feature of most VNAs as opposed to many traditional PACS is the avoidance of proprietary internal formats ostensibly used in the past for "performance" reasons, whilst still obtaining good performance across the interfaces.

Implementations may vary in the range of supported compression schemes, whether or not reversible (lossless) compression is mandatory for medico-legal archival purposes. Implementations also vary in the range of modality-specific image types that they support; though many archives will support all DICOM image information objects in principle, some extreme cases, like whole slide pathology images and long videos may not be supported. A general feature of VNAs is to attempt to preserve all attributes as originally supplied, including private (proprietary) attributes whether from the acquisition modality or added by other intervening applications (such as QC workstations or PACS).

DICOM describes many different "Information Object Definitions" and "SOP Classes" for storage of images with specific metadata related to particular modalities and applications, and the list of these grows as technology evolves. Since the DICOM format is inherently extensible, and all new objects build upon a common encoding and pattern, a VNAs should be able to store any DICOM image object, regardless of whether the SOP Class is recognized or new. This may be achieved through the use of field-modifiable configuration to add new SOP Classes, or by analysis of the contents of the objects "header", or by the simple of approach of accepting, storing and regurgitating anything transferred via a DICOM C-STORE operation.

===Image transfer protocols===

====Conventional DICOM====
Support of the basic DICOM C-STORE, C-FIND, C-MOVE and preferably C-GET are fundamental and not debated. The basic uncompressed transfer syntaxes including implicit and explicit VR little-endian, and the less common big-endian transfer syntax are typically supported. The range of compressed transfer syntaxes usually includes [[lossless JPEG]] and reversible and irreversible [[JPEG 2000]], occasionally [[JPEG-LS]], and usually lossy JPEG for images that were supplied that way (especially true color photographs. Support for motion compression (other than multi-frame JPEG) is less common, but perhaps more common in VNAs than in [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]]s, especially for storage and regurgitation without viewing.

====WADO====
Most would agree that an important VNA interface is the original version of [[Web Access to DICOM Persistent Objects]] (WADO), which allows single images to be retrieved with an [[HTTP]] URL in either DICOM file format or pre-rendered into a consumer format like [[JPEG]].

====XDS-I.b====
The [[SOAP]] [[Web Service]] based transactions of the IHE Cross Enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging are also generally considered a prerequisite for a claim to be a VNA.

===Image-related objects===

====Presentation states====
The grayscale or color rendering transformation applied to images for display should be stored as a DICOM Presentation State object. These objects support grayscale and true color images, as well as the application of a pseudo-color [[lookup table]] to grayscale images. Presentation states can also record any zooming and panning (displayed area selection) applied. [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] uses these in the Consistent Presentation of Images (CPI) profile

Since many modern [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]] can also store image annotations using DICOM Presentation State objects, a VNA needs to support these, including not just storage and regurgitation, but also selection and display in any viewer supplied as a VNA component.

====Annotations, regions of interest and measurements====
The preferred format for storage of [[annotation]]s, [[Region of Interest|regions of interest]], and [[measurement]]s is the DICOM Structured Report (SR) object, which allows structure, coded and semantic information to be persisted, rather than just presentation. IHE refers to these as Evidence Documents (ED). DICOM SR objects may also be produced in the context of the IHE specifies these in the Simple Image and Numeric Report (SINR) profile.

Since many Acquisition Modalities, mammography CAD systems and quantitative image analysis workstations produce SR objects, a VNA should be capable of storing and regurgitating these. Ideally, any viewer component should be capable of a generic (if not ideal) rendering of the content of any SR, including display of coordinates on referenced images.

For specific domains, such as [[Radiotherapy]], an older format, the DICOM RT Structure Set, which can encode 3D patient relative coordinate [[isocontour]]s (only) is used, and some non-RT workstations produce these as well instead of SRs. A VNA needs to support these too.

====Key images and object selection====
A common concept in a PACS is for the user (such as a modality operator or interpreting radiologist) to flag some images (or other objects) as being "key", i.e., of particular interest for some reason. Though obsolete PACS may only record this as a flag in an internal database, modern PACS use the [[DICOM]] Key Object Selection object (a specialized form of SR) to export this information. This usage is described in the IHE Key Image Note (KIN) profile. A VNA needs to support storage and regurgitation of KOS objects, as well as selection and display of these in any viewer.

====Radiation dose reports====
Since many medical imaging techniques deliver non-trivial amounts of ionizing radiation to the patient, the dose exposure needs to be tracked, and in some jurisdictions this must be recorded by law. DICOM defines a specialized form of Structured Report, the Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) to encode this. IHE uses these in the Radiation Exposure Management (REM) profile. A VNA must support storage and regurgitation these, and ideally, would be able to extract critical information for display in any viewer.

====Procedure reports====
In radiology and nuclear medicine applications, the practice of dictating and transcribing (or using [[speech recognition]]) is well entrenched and the output of these is typically unstructured or minimally structured prose, encoded as plain text and distributed by fax or HL7 version 2 messages or some equally primitive mechanism. The persistent form of these "documents" is not well-standardized, but many customers expect a VNA to be able to accept them in whatever local format is preferred. The same principles apply as for the storage of any non-DICOM content, including the use of HL7 version 2 messages or XDS to provide metadata in lieu of a structured "header", such as in the case of reports rendered as PDF, when they have not been encapsulated in DICOM or CDA objects. Now that HL7 has promised to relax its previously closed IP policy, including offering CDA free for use, it is possible that CDA will become the preferred form of encoding, but VNAs will still need to accept (and possibly transcode) reports in a plethora of form from the installed base. DICOM defines templates for the encoding of human-generated reports as DICOM Structured Report (SR) objects, and IHE specifies these in the Simple Image and Numeric Report (SINR) profile.

====Radiotherapy objects====
In addition to DICOM RT Structure Sets, for a VNA to be usable in an enterprise that performs Radiotherapy, the entire family of DICOM RT objects for beam, ion and [[brachytherapy]] need to be stored and regurgitated.

====Raw data objects====
DICOM defines a Raw Data object that is essentially a conventional DICOM composite instance header with patient, study, series and instance information, but no payload. It was intended for the storage of the [[raw data]] that is not easily represented as an image or image-like object, such as the raw views obtained from the detectors of a CT scanner, or the [[k-space (MRI)|k-space]] data from an MRI scanner, but can be used to encode anything. A VNA should be able to store and regurgitate these, even though it may be unaware of their contents and only the originating device may be able to interpret them.

====Audio, waveform and spectroscopy objects====
Though there are many consumer formats for encoding audio in widespread use, these lack the header or metadata necessary to identify the patient and encounter. A VNA that wants to support these needs to have a means of providing such information, such as submission using XDS. [[DICOM]] does define a Basic Audio object, and though it does not support the plethora of audio codecs available in the consumer world, some PACS do produce them, so a VNA should support these.

Time-based waveforms (such as ECGs) may be stored as DICOM or in a multitude of other formats, and the same principles apply as for audio; i.e., if the format is a medically oriented one, use the header meta-data for indexing during ingestion, if not, use XDS to register it.

A DICOM [[MR Spectroscopy]] object is defined, and since some modalities produce it, a VNA should be able to store and regurgitate instances of it.

====Private objects====
DICOM allows for the concept of Private SOP Classes, which use the DICOM encoding and transfer mechanisms but whose content is opaque. Vendors use these to good effect when necessary to encode information that has not been standardized, and also abuse them for convenience in lieu of using a standard encoding. Regardless, since their content may be important to the clinical workflow, a VNA should be configurable to accept, store and regurgitate these.

==Use cases==
* On site serving of images to multiple PACS
* Off site serving of images to multiple PACS
* Direct viewing of images (locally or externally)
* [[High Availability]]
* [[Business Continuity]] and [[Disaster Recovery]]

==Spectrum of vendor offerings==
Given the convoluted history, it should come as no surprise that two products claiming to be VNAs may have completely different feature sets and performance. However, there are essentially four categories of product:

* Third-party systems that have developed independently of PACS
* Offsite archival systems originally intended for BC/DR
* Central repository products that support cross-enterprise &amp; external access
* Traditional PACS that have improved standard access to their internal archive

The heritage of any individual product line may be a significant factor when considering suitability for a different application than originally intended, despite the purported feature set as re-envisaged by a creative marketing department.

==Market==
The size of the global VNA market is small relative to the PACS market, but is purported to be growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Imaging Technology News|title=VNA, PACS Market Worth $3.48 Billion by 2018|url=http://www.itnonline.com/article/vna-pacs-market-worth-348-billion-2018|accessdate=2015-12-21|date=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1309">The [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) requires that any time [[fecal contamination]] is detected during meat and poultry processing, it must be removed from the carcass. '''Wash versus trim''' is shorthand used to characterize the debate over how this rule has been applied and enforced by USDA in meat and poultry plants.

For a number of years, poultry processors have been permitted to either rinse (wash) off or cut (trim) away such contamination, but beef processors have only been permitted to (trim) it with a knife. This, they argue, costs them money in lost product weight and imposes a requirement that poultry producers do not have to meet. The policy jargon for this debate is "wash versus trim". USDA, early in 1997, clarified its zero tolerance rule for poultry; a year earlier it gave beef plants permission to use a new high-temperature vacuuming method to remove fecal contamination in lieu of cutting it off.
