{{3D computer graphics}}

'''3D computer graphics''' or three-dimensional computer graphics (in contrast to [[2D computer graphics]]), are graphics that use a [[three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data (often [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|Cartesian]]) that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering [[Digital image|2D images]]. Such images may be stored for viewing later or displayed in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]].

3D computer graphics rely on many of the same [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer [[vector graphics]] in the [[wire-frame model]] and 2D computer [[raster graphics]] in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as [[lighting]], and 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.

3D computer graphics are often referred to as [[3D modeling|3D models]]. Apart from the rendered graphic, the model is contained within the graphical data file. However, there are differences: a 3D model is the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] representation of any [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] object. A model is not technically a graphic until it is displayed. A model can be displayed visually as a two-dimensional image through a process called [[3D rendering]] or used in non-graphical [[computer simulation]]s and calculations. With [[3D printing]], 3D models are similarly rendered into a 3D physical representation of the model, with limitations to how accurate the rendering can match the virtual model.

== History ==
{{main|History of computer animation}}
[[William Fetter]] was credited with coining the term ''computer graphics'' in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/timeline.html#1960|title=An Historical Timeline of Computer Graphics and Animation|access-date=2009-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310082944/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/timeline.html#1960|archive-date=2008-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Computer Graphics |url=http://www.comphist.org/computing_history/new_page_6.htm |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his work at [[Boeing]]. One of the first displays of computer animation was ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), which included an [[animation]] of a human face and a hand that had originally appeared in the 1972 experimental short ''[[A Computer Animated Hand]]'', created by [[University of Utah]] students [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]].&lt;ref name="sltrib"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/mobile/53193670-90/film-catmull-computer-animation.html.csp |title=Pixar founder's Utah-made ''Hand'' added to National Film Registry |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=December 28, 2011 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[3D computer graphics software]] began appearing for [[home computer]]s in the late 1970s. The earliest known example is ''[[3D Art Graphics]]'', a set of 3D computer graphics effects, written by Kazumasa Mitazawa and released in June 1978 for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/projects/cassettes/japan/|title=Brutal Deluxe Software|website=www.brutaldeluxe.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neoncluster.com/projects-apple2/apple2-jcassettes.html |title=PROJECTS AND ARTICLES Retrieving Japanese Apple II programs |publisher= |access-date=2017-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005101914/http://www.neoncluster.com/projects-apple2/apple2-jcassettes.html |archive-date=2016-10-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
3D computer graphics creation falls into three basic phases: 
# [[3D modeling]] – the process of forming a computer model of an object's shape
# Layout and [[computer animation|animation]] – the placement and movement of objects within a scene
# [[3D rendering]] – the computer calculations that, based on light placement, surface types, and other qualities, generate the image

===Modeling===
{{main|3D modeling}}
The model describes the process of forming the shape of an object. The two most common sources of 3D models are those that an artist or engineer originates on the computer with some kind of 3D modeling tool, and models [[3D scanning|scanned]] into a computer from real-world objects. Models can also be produced [[procedural modeling|procedurally]] or via [[physical simulation]]. Basically, a 3D model is formed from points called vertices (or vertexes) that define the shape and form [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]. A polygon is an area formed from at least three vertexes (a triangle). A polygon of n points is an n-gon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mathwords.com/n/n_gon.htm/ |title= n-gon  |last = Simmons |first = Bruce |website=MathWords | access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall integrity of the model and its suitability to use in animation depend on the structure of the polygons.

=== Materials and textures ===
Which includes giving the model the properties that the render engine uses to render the model, in an unbiased render engine like blender cycles one can give the model materials to tell the engine how to treat light when it hits the surface. Textures are also used to give the material color like a color or albedo map, or give the surface features like bump or normal maps. It can be also used to deform the model itself like a displacement map.

===Layout and animation===
{{main|Computer animation}}
Before rendering into an image, objects must be laid out in a [[Scene (drama)|scene]]. This defines spatial relationships between objects, including [[Location (geography)|location]] and [[Dimension|size]]. Animation refers to the temporal description of an object (i.e., how it moves and deforms over time. Popular methods include [[keyframing]], [[inverse kinematics]], and [[motion capture]]). These techniques are often used in combination. As with animation, [[physical simulation]] also specifies motion.

===Rendering===
{{main|3D rendering}}
Rendering converts a model into an image either by simulating [[light transport theory|light transport]] to get photo-realistic images, or by applying an art style as in [[non-photorealistic rendering]]. The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light gets from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light). This step is usually performed using [[3D computer graphics software]] or a [[List of 3D graphics APIs|3D graphics API]]. Altering the scene into a suitable form for rendering also involves [[3D projection]], which displays a three-dimensional image in two dimensions. Although 3D modeling and CAD software may perform [[3D rendering]] as well (e.g. [[Autodesk 3ds Max]] or [[Blender (software)|Blender]]), exclusive 3D rendering software also exists.

}}

==Software==
3D computer graphics software produces [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) through [[3D modeling]] and [[3D rendering]] or produces 3D models for analytic, scientific and industrial purposes.

===Modeling===
{{Main|3D modeling software}}
3D modeling software is a class of 3D computer graphics software used to produce 3D models. Individual programs of this class are called modeling applications or modelers.

3D modelers allow users to create and alter models via their 3D mesh. Users can add, subtract, stretch and otherwise change the mesh to their desire. Models can be viewed from a variety of angles, usually simultaneously. Models can be rotated and the view can be zoomed in and out.

3D modelers can export their models to [[computer file|files]], which can then be imported into other applications as long as the [[metadata]] are compatible. Many modelers allow [[importer (computing)|importers]] and [[exporter (computing)|exporters]] to be [[Plug-in (computing)|plugged-in]], so they can read and write data in the native formats of other applications.

Most 3D modelers contain a number of related features, such as [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracers]] and other rendering alternatives and [[texture mapping]] facilities. Some also contain features that support or allow animation of models. Some may be able to generate [[full-motion video]] of a series of rendered scenes (i.e. [[animation]]).

===Computer-aided design===
{{Main|Computer-aided design}}
Computer aided design software may employ the same fundamental 3D modeling techniques that 3D modeling software use but their goal differs. They are used in [[computer-aided engineering]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]], [[Finite element analysis]], [[product lifecycle management]], [[3D printing]] and [[computer-aided architectural design]].

===Complementary tools===
After producing video, studios then [[Film editing|edit]] or [[Compositing|composite]] the video using programs such as [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] or [[Final Cut Pro]] at the mid-level, or [[Autodesk Combustion]], [[Digital Fusion]], [[Shake (software)|Shake]] at the high-end. [[Match moving]] software is commonly used to match live video with computer-generated video, keeping the two in sync as the camera moves.

Use of real-time computer graphics engines to create a cinematic production is called [[machinima]].

==Communities==
There are a multitude of websites designed to help, educate and support 3D graphic artists. Some are managed by [[software developers]] and [[content providers]], but there are standalone sites as well. These communities allow for members to seek advice, post tutorials, provide product reviews or post examples of their own work.

==Differences with other types of computer graphics==

===Distinction from photorealistic 2D graphics===
{{see also|Still life#21st century}}
Not all computer graphics that appear 3D are based on a [[wireframe model]]. 2D computer graphics with 3D [[photorealistic]] effects are often achieved without wireframe modeling and are sometimes indistinguishable in the final form. Some [[graphic art software]] includes filters that can be applied to 2D vector graphics or 2D raster graphics on transparent layers. [[Visual art]]ists may also copy or visualize 3D effects and [[artistic rendering|manually render]] photorealistic effects without the use of filters.

===Pseudo-3D and ''true 3D''===
{{main|2.5D}}
Some [[video game]]s use restricted projections of three-dimensional environments, such as [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric graphics]] or [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|virtual cameras with fixed angles]], either as a way to improve performance of the [[game engine]], or for stylistic and gameplay concerns. Such games are said to use [[pseudo-3D]] graphics. By contrast, games using 3D computer graphics without such restrictions are said to use ''true 3D''.

== Life and work ==
Carter earned a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] at the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]], a [[Master's degree|MA]] at the [[University of Sussex]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] at [[St Cross College, Oxford|St Cross College]] at the [[University of Oxford]].
Carter's first academic position was Lecturer in Political Theory at [[University College Dublin]]. He then became Head of the Philosophy Department at [[Heythrop College]], [[University of London]]. Subsequently, he was Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  He has been a Visiting Professor at the [[University of British Columbia]] and at the [[University of Bucharest]]. For a number of years Carter was joint editor of the ''[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]''.

He works principally in [[political philosophy]], [[moral philosophy]], and [[environmental philosophy]]. Carter has published on a wide range of topics: within political philosophy he has written on political obligation, equality, and [[property right]]s; within environmental philosophy he has written on the moral status of both nonhuman animals and ecosystems; within [[applied ethics]] he has written on problems regarding future persons and world hunger; within [[political theory]] he has written on theories of the state and [[Third World]] underdevelopment; and within [[anarchism and Marxism]] Carter has written on their respective theories of history. He is currently developing an environmentalist moral theory that is, [[normative ethics|normatively]],  [[value pluralism|value pluralist]] and, [[metaethics|metaethically]], [[projectivism|projectivist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/philosophy/ourstaff/ |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016085729/http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/philosophy/ourstaff/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-16 |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;University of Glasgow :: Philosophy :: Our staff&lt;/nowiki&gt; |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; topics he has previously written about in moral theory.

Some of Carter's work in environmental philosophy is discussed critically by [[Robin Attfield]].&lt;ref name="Attfield"&gt;See for example Attfield, R., ''Environmental Ethics: An Overview for the Twenty-First Century''. Polity-Blackwell (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's state-primacy theory has been discussed by [[Robyn Eckersley]]&lt;ref name="Eckersley"&gt;Eckersley, R. ''The Green State: Rethinking Democracy and Sovereignty''. MIT Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized by [[John Barry (politician)|John Barry]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, J. ''Rethinking Green Politics: Nature, Virtue and Progress''. Sage (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and, most fully, by Simon Hailwood.&lt;ref name="Hailwood"&gt;Hailwood, S. ''How to be a Green Liberal: Nature, Value and Liberal Philosophy''. Acumen (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Carter has responded by arguing that his critics fail to take sufficiently into account the problems the military causes in modern societies: "it is telling how little attention green liberal critics of the state-primacy theory have paid to the role of the military and to its highly distorting effects. Failing to examine in any detail military requirements within ostensibly 'liberal democracies', whether existing or imagined, is more like simply ignoring an argument rather than answering it."&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter, A. "Beyond primacy: Marxism, anarchism and radical green political theory," ''Environmental Politics'' 19, 6 (2010): 951-972, here at 971n.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was one of the founder members of the London-based Anarchist Research Group.&lt;ref name="Goodway"&gt;Goodway, D. (ed.), ''[[For Anarchism: History, Theory, and Practice]]''. Routledge (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Ward]] has described Carter, with [[Murray Bookchin]], as one of the leading [[eco-anarchism|eco-anarchist]] thinkers.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, C. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of academia, Carter is a former Chair of the [[World Development Movement|World Development Movement Scotland]] and a former Board Member of [[Friends of the Earth Scotland]]. He is also a former Board Member and a former Trustee of [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth]].

==Publications==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">'''Araldite''' is a registered [[trademark]] of [[Huntsman Advanced Materials]] (previously part of [[Novartis#Ciba-Geigy|Ciba-Geigy]]) referring to their range of engineering and structural [[epoxy]], acrylic, and [[polyurethane]] [[adhesive]]s. The name was first used in 1946 for a two-part epoxy adhesive.

Araldite adhesive sets by the interaction of a resin with a hardener. Heat is not necessary although warming will reduce the curing time and improve the strength of the bond. After curing, the joint is claimed to be impervious to boiling water and all common organic solvents. It is available in many different types of packs, the most common containing two different tubes, one each for the resin and the hardener. Other variations include double syringe-type packages which automatically measure equal parts. This type of packaging, however, is not exact and also poses the problem of unintentional mixing of resin and hardener.

== History ==
In the UK [[Aero Research Limited]] (hence the name; ''ARaLdite'') developed this new synthetic resin adhesive for bonding metals, glass, porcelain, china and other materials.

The first production of epoxy resins was carried out by De Trey Frères SA of Switzerland. They licensed the process to Ciba AG in the early 1940s and Ciba first demonstrated a product under the tradename Araldite at the Swiss Industries Fair in 1945. Ciba went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off and later sold in the late 1990s and is now the advanced materials business unit of Huntsman Corporation of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; At Coventry cathedral, Araldite adhesive was used to bond its columns and fins, while at Sydney Opera House, Araldite adhesive was used to bond the rib sections of the shells, since a traditional concrete joint would have slowed construction, as it would need 24 hours to cure before stressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Advertising ==
In 1983, British advertising agency FCO Univas set up a visual stunt presentation of the strength of Araldite adhesive by gluing a yellow [[Ford Cortina]] to a billboard on Cromwell Road, London, with the tagline "It also sticks handles to teapots".&lt;ref&gt;[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2d/70/2b/2d702b19900e18b502bd93482dec819e.jpg Images of original adverts]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, to demonstrate more of its strength, a red Cortina was placed on top of the yellow Cortina, with the tagline "The tension mounts". Finally, the car was removed from the billboard, leaving a hole on the billboard and a tagline "How did we pull it off?".

'''Astroinformatics''' is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of [[astronomy]], [[data science]], [[informatics]], and [[Information technology|information]]/[[Communications technologies|communications]] technologies.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~nkirov/zip/SEEDI_astro_presentation.pdf Astroinformatics and digitization of astronomical heritage], Nikolay Kirov. The fifth SEEDI International Conference Digitization of cultural and scientific heritage, May 19–20, 2010, Sarajevo. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of [[computational science]], [[data science]], and [[statistics]] for research and education in data-oriented astronomy.&lt;ref name="astroinfo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk D. |title=Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education |journal=Earth Science Informatics |date=12 May 2010 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts in this direction included [[data exploration|data discovery]], [[metadata standards]] development, [[data modeling]], astronomical [[data dictionary]] development, [[data access]], [[information retrieval]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining|eprint=astro-ph/0008307|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data integration]], and [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kargupta |editor-first1=Hillol |display-editors=etal |title=Next generation of data mining |date=2008 |location=London |isbn=9781420085860 |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk|chapter=Scientific Data Mining in Astronomy |publisher=CRC Press |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the astronomical [[Virtual Observatory]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.487536|chapter=Distributed data mining in the National Virtual Observatory|title=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|volume=5098|pages=211|series=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|year=2003|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VOdm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurino |first1=O. |last2=D’Abrusco |first2=R. |last3=Longo |first3=G. |last4=Riccio |first4=G. |title=Astroinformatics of galaxies and quasars: a new general method for photometric redshifts estimation |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=21 December 2011 |volume=418 |issue=4 |pages=2165–2195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19416.x|arxiv=1107.3160 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.418.2165L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the [[National Research Council (United States)]] in 2009 in the Astroinformatics "State of the Profession" Position Paper for the 2010 [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: A 21st Century Approach to Astronomy|eprint = 0909.3892 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper ''Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education''.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;

Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Geoinformatics]], and through the [[eScience]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Online Science'|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/JimGrayTalks.htm|website=Talks by Jim Gray|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)]] at [[Microsoft Research]], whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gray eScience Award|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary focus of Astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to [[Digital data|digitize]] historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large [[database]] for efficient retrieval through [[World wide web|web]]-based interfaces.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casca.ca/lrp2010/Docs/LRPReports/astroinformatics_lrp.pdf Astroinformatics in Canada], Nicholas M. Ball, David Schade. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Astroinformatics' helps Astronomers explore the sky|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-10-astroinformatics-astronomers-exploring-sky.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Heidelberg University|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics is described as the "Fourth Paradigm" of astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fourth-paradigm-data-intensive-scientific-discovery/|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science.&lt;ref name="VOdm"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5618-2_9|chapter=Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics|title=Planets, Stars and Stellar Systems|pages=403|year=2013|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|isbn=978-94-007-5617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data mining]] and [[machine learning]] play significant roles in Astroinformatics as a [[Scientific method|scientific research]] discipline due to their focus on "knowledge discovery from data" ([[data mining|KDD]]) and "learning from data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=N.M. |last2=Brunner |first2=R.J. |title=Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1049 |doi=10.1142/S0218271810017160 |year=2010|arxiv=0906.2173 |bibcode=2010IJMPD..19.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1063/1.3059074 |chapter=The LSST Data Mining Research Agenda |title=AIP Conference Proceedings |pages=347 |year=2008 |last1=Borne |first1=K |last2=Becla |first2=J |last3=Davidson |first3=I |last4=Szalay |first4=A |last5=Tyson |first5=J.

The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] and into the exabytes with the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.3059076|chapter=Parametrization and Classification of 20 Billion LSST Objects: Lessons from SDSS|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|pages=359|year=2008|last1=Ivezić|first1=Ž|last2=Axelrod|first2=T|last3=Becker|first3=A.

A|last21=Bailer-Jones|first21=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0810.5155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.

[[Informatics]] has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]], and/or collaborative [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Collaborative Annotation for Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse|url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_RDAP_Borne.html|website=Bulletin of the ASIS&amp;T|publisher=American Society for Information Science and Technology|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plus [[Astrostatistics]] will also be heavily involved. [[Citizen science]] projects (such as [[Galaxy Zoo]]) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.

In 2012, two position papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigelson|first1=Eric|title=Astrostatistics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astrostatistics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were presented to the Council of the [[American Astronomical Society]] that led to the establishment of formal working groups in Astroinformatics and [[Astrostatistics]] for the profession of [[astronomy]] within the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Feigelson|first1=E.|last2=Ivezić|first2=Ž.|last3=Hilbe|first3=J.|last4=Borne|first4=K.|title=New Organizations to Support Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics|eprint=1301.3069|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=The Revolution in Astronomy Education: Data Science for the Masses|eprint = 0909.3895 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow [[data literacy]] through the easy re-use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Data in the Classroom|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/index.html|website=Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College|publisher=National Science Digital Library|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy|location=George Mason University, USA|url=http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/PosterPapers/Poster-paper18.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lyon hypothesis]] states that in cells with multiple [[X chromosome]]s, all but one are inactivated during mammalian [[embryogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, M. F. (1961), Gene Action in the ''X''-chromosome of the Mouse (''Mus musculus'' L.) ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. '''190''' (4773): 372-3. {{DOI|10.1038/190372a0}} {{PMID|13764598}} ([http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v190/n4773/abs/190372a0.html Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;  This happens early in [[embryo]]nic development at random in [[mammal]]s,&lt;ref name="Full Text PDF"&gt;Brown,C.J., Robinson,W.P., (1997), XIST Expression and X-Chromosome Inactivation in Human Preimplantation Embryos. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 61, 5-8 ([http://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(07)64268-2.pdf Full Text PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; except in [[marsupial]]s and in some extra-embryonic tissues of some placental mammals, in which the father's X chromosome is always deactivated.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. T., (2003), X-chromosome inactivation: a multi-disciplinary approach. j.semcdb 14, 311-312. ({{doi|10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.09.025}} Abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans with more than one X chromosome, the number of Barr bodies visible at [[interphase]] is always one fewer than the total number of X chromosomes. For example, men with [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (47,XXY [[karyotype]]) have a single Barr body, whereas women with a 47,XXX karyotype have two Barr bodies. Barr bodies can be seen on the nucleus of [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]].

==Mechanism==
A genotypical [[human]] female has only one Barr body per [[somatic cell]], while a genotypical human male has none.

Mammalian [[X-chromosome inactivation]] is initiated from the X inactivation centre or ''Xic'', usually found near the [[centromere]].&lt;ref name="Rougeulle"&gt;Rougeulle, C., Avner, P. (2003), Controlling X-inactivation in mammals: what does the centre hold?. j.semcdb 14, 331-340. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.09.014 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; The center contains twelve [[gene]]s, seven of which code for [[protein]]s, five for untranslated [[RNA]]s, of which only two are known to play an active role in the X inactivation process, ''[[Xist]]'' and ''Tsix''.&lt;ref name="Rougeulle" /&gt; The centre also appears to be important in chromosome counting: ensuring that random inactivation only takes place when two or more X-chromosomes are present. The provision of an extra artificial ''Xic'' in early [[embryogenesis]] can induce inactivation of the single X found in male cells.&lt;ref name="Rougeulle" /&gt;

The roles of ''Xist'' and ''Tsix'' appear to be antagonistic. The loss of ''Tsix'' expression on the future inactive X chromosome results in an increase in levels of ''Xist'' around the ''Xic''. Meanwhile, on the future active X ''Tsix'' levels are maintained; thus the levels of ''Xist'' remain low.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. T., Davidow, L. S., Warshawsky, D., (1999), Tisx, a gene antisense to Xist at the X-inactivation centre. Nat. Genet. 21, 400-404. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/7734 Full Text]&lt;/ref&gt; This shift allows ''Xist'' to begin coating the future inactive chromosome, spreading out from the ''Xic''.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, M. F., (2003), The Lyon and the LINE hypothesis. j.semcdb 14, 313-318. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.09.015 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In non-random inactivation this choice appears to be fixed and current evidence suggests that the maternally inherited [[gene]] may be [[Genomic Imprinting|imprinted]].&lt;ref name="Full Text PDF"/&gt;

It is thought that this constitutes the mechanism of choice, and allows downstream processes to establish the compact state of the Barr body. These changes include [[histone]] modifications, such as histone H3 [[methylation]] (i.e. H3K27me3 by [[Polycomb recruitment in X chromosome inactivation|PRC2 which is recruited by Xist]])&lt;ref&gt;Heard, E., Rougeulle, C., Arnaud, D., Avner, P., Allis, C. D. (2001), Methylation of Histone H3 at Lys-9 Is an Early Mark on the X Chromosome during X Inactivation. Cell 107, 727-738. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00598-0 Full Text])&lt;/ref&gt; and histone H2A [[ubiquitination]],&lt;ref&gt;de Napoles,M., Mermoud,J.E., Wakao,R., Tang,Y.A., Endoh,M., Appanah,R., Nesterova,T.B., Silva,J., Otte,A.P., Vidal,M., Koseki,H., Brockdorff,N., (2004), Polycomb Group Proteins Ring1A/B Link Ubiquitylation of Histone H2A to Heritable Gene Silencing and X Inactivation. Dev. Cell 7, 663-676 ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2004.10.005 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; as well as direct modification of the [[DNA]] itself, via the methylation of [[CpG site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick,B.P., Willard,H.F., (2003), Barring gene expression after XIST: maintaining faculative heterochromatin on the inactive X. j.semcdb 14, 359-367 ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.09.016 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; These changes help inactivate [[gene]] expression on the inactive X-chromosome and to bring about its compaction to form the Barr body.

Reactivation of a Barr body is also possible, and has been seen in breast cancer patients.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natekar|first=Prashant E.|last2=DeSouza|first2=Fatima M.|date=2008|title=Reactivation of inactive X chromosome in buccal smear of carcinoma of breast|journal=Indian Journal of Human Genetics|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–8|doi=10.4103/0971-6866.42320|issn=0971-6866|pmc=2840782|pmid=20300284}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that the frequency of Barr bodies in breast carcinoma were significantly lower than in healthy controls, indicating reactivation of these once inactivated X chromosomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Biological soil crusts''' are communities of living organisms on the [[soil]] surface in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on [[topography]], soil characteristics, [[climate]], [[plant community]], [[microhabitats]], and [[disturbance regimes]]. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as ''cryptogamic'', ''microbiotic'', ''microphytic'', or ''cryptobiotic'' soils.

==Natural History==
===Biology and composition===
Biological soil crusts are most often&lt;ref name="belnap crypto 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/biology/crypto/ |title=Cryptobiotic Soils: Holding the Place in Place |first=Jayne |last=Belnap |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=May 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hPb2odvA?url=http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/biology/crypto/ |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of [[fungi]], [[lichens]], [[cyanobacteria]], [[bryophytes]], and [[algae]] in varying proportions. These organisms live in intimate association in the uppermost few millimeters of the soil surface, and are the biological basis for the formation of soil crusts.

'''Cyanobacteria'''
{{main|Cyanobacteria}}
Cyanobacteria are the main photosynthetic component of biological soil crusts,&lt;ref name="moore sonoran 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mineralarts.com/artwork/cryptos.html |title=Cryptobiotic Crust in the Sonoran Desert |date=March 23, 2010 |first=Lorena B. |last=Moore |publisher=Southern Arizona Desert Botany |accessdate=May 10, 2016 |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hPbc2N4S?url=http://www.mineralarts.com/artwork/cryptos.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to other photosynthetic taxa such as mosses, lichens, and green algae. The most common cyanobacteria found in soil crusts belong to large filamentous species such as those in the genus ''[[Microcoleus]]''.&lt;ref name="belnap crypto 2013"/&gt; These species form bundled filaments that are surrounded by a gelatinous sheath of [[polysaccharides]]. These filaments bind soil particles throughout the uppermost soil layers, forming a 3-D net-like structure that holds the soil together in a crust. Other common cyanobacteria species are as those in the genus ''[[Nostoc]]'', which can also form sheaths and sheets of filaments that stabilize the soil. Some ''Nostoc'' species are also able to fix atmospheric nitrogen gas into bio-available forms such as [[ammonia]].

'''Bryophytes'''
{{main|Bryophyte}}
Bryophytes in soil crusts include [[mosses]] and [[liverworts]]. Mosses are usually classified as short annual mosses or tall perennial mosses. Liverworts can be flat and ribbon-like or leafy. They can reproduce by spore formation or by asexual fragmentation, and photosynthesize to fix carbon from the atmosphere.

'''Lichens'''
{{main|Lichen}}
Lichens are often distinguished by growth form and by their photosymbiont. Crust lichens include crustose and [[aerolate]] lichens that are appressed to the soil substrate, [[squamulose]] lichens with scale- or plate-like bodies that are raised above the soils, and foliose lichens with more “leafy” structures that can be attached to the soil at only one portion. Lichens with algal symbionts can fix atmospheric carbon, while lichens with cyanobacterial symbionts [[Lichens and nitrogen cycling|can fix nitrogen]] as well. Lichens produce many pigments that help protect them from radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=UV-induction of sun-screening pigments in lichens |date=April 2003 |first=Knut Asbjørn |last=Solhaug |first2=Yngvar |last2=Gauslaa |first3=Line |last3=Nybakken |first4=Wolfgang |last4=Bilger |journal=New Phytologist |pages=91–100 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00708.x |deadurl=yes |df= |volume=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fungi'''

[[Microfungi]] in biological soil crusts can occur as free-living species, or in [[symbiosis]] with algae in lichens. Free-living microfungi often function as decomposers, and contribute to soil microbial biomass. Many microfungi in biological soil crusts have adapted to the intense light conditions by evolving the ability to produce [[melanin]], and are called black fungi or [[black yeast]]s. Fungal [[hyphae]] can bind soil particles together.

'''Free-living green algae'''
{{main|Green algae}}
[[Green algae]] in soil crusts are present just below the soil surface where they are partially protected from UV radiation. They become inactive when dry and reactivate when moistened. They can photosynthesize to fix carbon from the atmosphere.

===Formation and succession===
Biological soil crusts are formed in open spaces between [[vascular plants]]. Frequently, single-celled organisms such as cyanobacteria or spores of free-living fungi colonize bare ground first. Once filaments have stabilized the soil, lichens and mosses can colonize. Appressed lichens are generally earlier colonizers or persist in more stressful conditions, while more three-dimensional lichens require long disturbance-free growth periods and more moderate conditions.
Recovery following disturbance varies. Cyanobacteria cover can recover by propagules blowing in from adjacent undisturbed areas rapidly after disturbance. Total recovery of cover and composition occurs more rapidly in fine soil textured, moister environments (~2 years) and more slowly (&gt;3800 years)&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt; in coarse soil textured, dry environments. Recovery times also depend on disturbance regime, site, and availability of propagules.

==Distribution==
===Geographical range===
[[File:Cryptobiotic soil crust in Natural Bridges National Monument near Sipapu 20100906 - number 5.png|thumb|right|Biological soil crust in [[Natural Bridges National Monument]] near [[Sipapu Bridge]].]]
Biological soil crusts are found on almost all soil types, but are more commonly found in arid regions of the world where plant cover is low and plants are more widely spaced. This is because crust organisms have a limited ability to grow upwards and cannot compete for light with vascular plants. Across the globe, biological soil crusts can be found on all continents including Antarctica.&lt;ref name=FGBSC&gt;Rosentreter, R., M. Bowker, and J. Belnap. 2007. A Field Guide to Biological Soil Crusts of Western U.S. Drylands. U.S. Government Printing Office, Denver, Colorado.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation throughout range===
The species composition and physical appearance of biological soil crusts vary depending on the climate, soil, and disturbance conditions. For example, biological soil crusts are more dominated by green algae on more acidic and less salty soils, whereas cyanobacteria are more favored on alkaline and haline soils. Within a [[climate zone]], the abundance of lichens and mosses in biological soil crusts generally increases with increasing clay and silt content and decreasing sand. Also, habitats that are more moist generally support more lichens and mosses.

The morphology of biological soil crust surfaces can range from smooth and a few millimeters in thickness to pinnacles up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm high. Smooth biological soil crusts occur in hot deserts where the soil does not freeze, and consist mostly of cyanobacteria, algae, and fungi. Thicker and rougher crusts occur in areas where higher precipitation results in increased cover of lichen and mosses, and [[frost heaving]] of these surfaces cause microtopography such as rolling hills and steep pinnacles. Due to the intense [[UV]] radiation present in areas where biological soil crusts occur, biological soil crusts appear darker than the crustless soil in the same area due to the UV-protective pigmentation of cyanobacteria and other crust organisms.&lt;ref name=FGBSC/&gt;

==Ecology==
===Ecosystem function and services===
====Biogeochemical cycling====

'''Carbon cycling'''
Biological soil crusts contribute to the [[carbon cycle]] through [[Soil gas|respiration]] and [[photosynthesis]] of crust microorganisms which are active only when wet. Respiration can begin in as little as 3 minutes after wetting whereas photosynthesis reaches full activity after 30 minutes. Some groups have different responses to high water content, with some lichens showing decreased photosynthesis when water content was greater than 60% whereas green algae showed little response to high water content.&lt;ref name=BSCEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilcrust.org/crust.pdf|format=PDF|title=Biological Soil Crusts:  Ecology and Management|last1=Belnap |first1=Jayne |display-authors=etal |date=2001|publisher=[[U.S. Department of the Interior]]: [[Bureau of Land Management]] and [[U.S. Geological Survey]]|id=Technical Reference 1730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosynthesis rates are also dependent on temperature, with rates increasing up to approximately {{convert|28|°C|°F}}.

Estimates for annual carbon inputs range from 0.4 to 37 g/cm*year depending on successional state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Housman | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Powers | first2 = H.H. | last3 = Collins | first3 = A.D. | last4 = Belnap | first4 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Carbon and nitrogen fixation differ between successional stages of biological soil crusts in the Colorado Plateau and Chihuahuan Desert | journal = Journal of Arid Environments | volume = 66 | issue = 4| pages = 620–634 | doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2005.11.014| type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of total net carbon uptake by crusts globally are ~3.9 pg/year (2.1-7.4 pg/year).&lt;ref name="Elbert, W. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elbert | first1 = W. | last2 = Weber | first2 = B. | last3 = Burrows | first3 = S. | last4 = Steinkamp | first4 = J. | last5 = Budel | first5 = B. | last6 = Andreae | first6 = M. O. | last7 = Poschl | first7 = U. | year = 2012 | title = Contribution of cryptogamic covers to the global cycles of carbon and nitrogen | url = | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 5 | issue = 7| pages = 459–462 | doi=10.1038/ngeo1486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nitrogen cycling'''
Biological soil crust contributions to the [[nitrogen cycle]] varies by crust composition because only cyanobacteria and cyanolichens fix nitrogen. [[Nitrogen fixation]] requires energy from photosynthesis products, and thus increase with temperature given sufficient moisture. Nitrogen fixed by crusts has been shown to leak into surrounding substrate and can be taken up by plants, bacteria, and fungi. 
Nitrogen fixation has been recorded at rates of 0.7–100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha*year, from hot deserts in Australia to cold deserts.&lt;ref&gt;Evans R. D. and Johansen J. R. 1999. Microbiotic Crusts and Ecosystem Processes. Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences 18(2): 183-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of total biological nitrogen fixation are ~ 49 Tg/year (27-99 Tg/year).&lt;ref name="Elbert, W. 2012"/&gt;

====Geophysical and geomorphological properties====
'''Soil stability'''

Soils in arid regions are slow-forming{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and easily eroded. Crust organisms contribute to increased soil stability where they occur. Cyanobacteria have filamentous growth forms that bind soil particles together, and hyphae of fungi and [[rhizine]]s/[[rhizoid]]s of lichens and mosses also have similar effects. The increased surface roughness of crusted areas compared to bare soil further improves resistance to wind and water [[erosion]]. Aggregates of soil formed by crust organisms also increase soil aeration and provide surfaces where nutrient transformation can occur.&lt;ref name=WAYF&gt;Belnap, J. (2003). The world at your feet: desert biological soil crusts. Front. Ecol. Environ., 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181–89}}

'''Soil water relations'''

The effect of biological soil crusts on [[water infiltration]] and [[soil moisture]] depends on the dominant crust organisms, soil characteristics, and climate. In areas where biological soil crusts produce rough surface microtopography, water is detained longer on the soil surface and this increases water infiltration. However, in warm deserts where biological soil crusts are smooth and flat, infiltration rates can be decreased by [[bioclogging]].&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt;

'''Albedo'''

The darkened surfaces of biological soil crusts decreases soil [[albedo]] (a measure of the amount of light reflected off of the surface) compared to nearby soils, which increases the energy absorbed by the soil surface. Soils with well-developed biological soil crusts can be over 12&amp;nbsp;°C (22&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than adjacent surfaces. Increased soil temperatures are associated with increased metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, as well as higher soil water evaporation rates and delayed seedling germination and establishment.&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt; The activity levels of many arthropods and small mammals are also controlled by soil surface temperature.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

'''Dust-trapping'''

The increased surface roughness associated with biological soil crusts increase the capture of [[dust]]. These [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] deposits of dust are often enriched in [[plant-essential nutrients]], and thus increase both the fertility and the [[water holding capacity]] of soils.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

===Role in the biological community===
====Effects on vascular plants====
'''Germination and establishment'''

The presence of biological soil crust cover can differentially inhibit or facilitate plant seed catchment and [[germination]]. The increased micro-topography generally increases the probability that plant seeds will be caught on the soil surface and not blown away. Differences in water infiltration and soil moisture also contribute to differential germination depending on the plant species. It has been shown that while some native desert plant species have seeds with self-burial mechanisms can establish readily in crusted areas, many exotic invasive plants do not. Therefore, the presence of biological soil crusts may slow the establishment of [[invasive plant species]] such as cheatgrass (''[[Bromus tectorum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. Deines, R. Rosentreter, D.J. Eldridge, M.D. Serpe. Germination and seedling establishment of two annual grasses on lichen-dominated biological soil crusts. Plant Soil, 295 (2007), pp. 23–35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrient levels'''

Biological soil crusts do not compete with vascular plants for nutrients, but rather have been shown to increase nutrient levels in plant tissues, which results in higher [[biomass]] for plants that grow near biological soil crusts. This can occur through N fixation by cyanobacteria in the crusts, increased trapment of nutrient-rich dust, as well as increased concentrations of [[micronutrients]] that are able to [[chelate]] to the negatively charged clay particles bound by cynaobacterial filaments.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

====Effects on animals====
The increased nutrient status of plant tissue in areas where biological soil crusts occur can directly benefit [[herbivore]] species in the community. [[Microarthropod]] populations also increase with more developed crusts due to increased microhabitats produced by the crust microtopography.&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt;

==Human impacts and management==
===Human disturbance===
Biological soil crusts are extremely susceptible to disturbance from human activities. Compressional and shear forces can disrupt biological soil crusts especially when they are dry, leaving them to be blown or washed away. Thus, animal hoof impact, human footsteps, [[off-road vehicles]], and tank treads can remove crusts and these disturbances have occurred over large areas globally. Once biological soil crusts are disrupted, wind and water can move sediments onto adjacent intact crusts, burying them and preventing photosynthesis of non-motile organisms such as mosses, lichens, green algae, and small cyanobacteria, and of motile cyanobacteria when the soil remains dry. This kills remaining intact crust and causes large areas of loss.

Invasive species introduced by humans can also affect biological soil crusts. Invasive annual grasses can occupy areas once occupied by crusts and allow fire to travel between large plants, whereas previously it would have just jumped from plant to plant and not directly affected the crusts.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

[[Climate change]] affects biological soil crusts by altering the timing and magnitude of [[precipitation]] events and [[temperature]]. Because crusts are only active when wet, some of these new conditions may reduce the amount of time when conditions are favorable for activity.&lt;ref name="Ferrenberg et al 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281754117_Climate_change_and_physical_disturbance_cause_similar_community_shifts_in_biological_soil_crusts |title=Climate change and physical disturbance cause similar community shifts in biological soil crusts|first1=Scott |last1=Ferrenberg |first2=Sasha C. |last2=Reed |first3=Jayne |last3=Belnap |date= September 2015 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1509150112 |accessdate=7 November 2018 |volume=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological soil crusts require stored carbon when reactivating after being dry. If they do not have enough moisture to photosynthesize to make up for the carbon used, they can gradually deplete carbon stocks and die.&lt;ref name="belnap et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belnap | first1 = J | last2 = Phillips | first2 = SL | last3 = Miller | first3 = ME | year = 2004 | title = Response of desert biological soil crusts to alteration in precipitation frequency | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume =  141| issue = 2| pages =  306–316| doi = 10.1007/s00442-003-1438-6 | pmid = 14689292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced carbon fixation also leads to decreased nitrogen fixation rates because crust organisms do not have sufficient energy for this energy-intensive process. Without carbon and nitrogen available, they are not able to grow nor repair damaged cells from excess radiation.

===Conservation and management===
Removal of stressors such as [[grazing]] or protection from disturbance are the easiest ways to maintain and improve biological soil crusts. Protection of relic sites that have not been disturbed can serve as reference conditions for restoration.
There are several successful methods for stabilizing soil to allow recolonization of crusts including coarse litter application (such as straw) and planting vascular plants, but these are costly and labor-intensive techniques. Spraying [[polyacrylamide]] gel has been tried but this has adversely affected photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation of ''[[Collema]]'' species and thus is less useful. Other methods such as fertilization and inoculation with material from adjacent sites may enhance crust recovery, but more research is needed to determine the local costs of disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, M.

The '''CSIR Fourth Paradigm Institute''' (CSIR-4PI) formerly CMMACS is a unit of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]. The centre is involved in developing modelling approaches for illuminating the structure and evolution of complex systems.

==History==
In the late 1980s the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research realised the increasing importance of mathematical modelling and computer based simulations that were critical for understanding complex systems, which were used in a wide array of scientific research. Various fields that were previously thought to be purely observational and qualitative now needed the use of such technologies.

It was established in 1988 in the Belur Campus of the [[National Aerospace Laboratories]] (NAL), Bengaluru. The current Scientist-in-Charge of the centre is Dr.Vidyadhar Y Mudkavi

==Academics==
The institute offers opportunities of summer projects for B.E. / M.Sc. / M.Tech students twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmmacs.ernet.in/cmmacs/acaprog.html Academic programmes in C-MMACS]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative foot morphology''' involves comparing the form of [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] [[structures]] of a variety of [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrates]].  Understanding the role that the foot plays for each type of organism must take account of the differences in body type, foot shape, arrangement of structures, loading conditions and other variables.  However, similarities also exist among the feet of many different terrestrial vertebrates.  The [[paw]] of the dog, the [[hoof]] of the horse, the ''manus'' (foot) and ''pes'' (foot) of the [[elephant]], and the foot of the human all share some common features of structure, organization and function.  Their foot structures function as the load-transmission platform which is essential to balance, standing and types of locomotion (such as walking, trotting, galloping and running).

The discipline of [[biomimetics]] applies the information gained by comparing the foot [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of a variety of terrestrial vertebrates to human-engineering problems.  For instance, it may provide insights that make it possible to alter the foot's load transmission in people who wear an external [[orthosis]] because of paralysis from spinal-cord injury, or who use a [[prosthesis]] following the diabetes-related amputation of a leg.  Such knowledge can be incorporated in technology that improves a person's balance when standing; enables them to walk more efficiently, and to exercise; or otherwise enhances their quality of life by improving their mobility.

===Variability in scaling and limb coordination===
[[File:Elephant skeleton.jpg|thumb|Elephant skeleton]]
There is considerable variation in the scale and proportions of body and limb, as well as the nature of loading, during standing and locomotion both among and between [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupeds]] and [[Bipedalism|bipeds]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal

However, little is understood concerning the functional contribution of the foot and its structures during the weight-bearing phase.  The comparative morphology of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] limb and foot structure of some representative terrestrial vertebrates reveals some interesting similarities.

===Columnar organization of limb structures===
[[File:Panthera leo limbs.png|thumb|Limb skeleton of a lion, an example of an angulated bony column]]
Even many terrestrial vertebrates exhibit differences in the scaling of limb dimension, limb coordination and magnitude of forelimb-hind limb loading, in the dog, horse and elephant the structure of the distal forelimb is similar to that of the distal hind limb.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="extension.missouri.edu"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the human, the structures of the hand are generally similar in shape and arrangement to those of the foot. Terrestrial vertebrate quadrupeds and bipeds generally possess distal limb and foot [[endoskeleton]] structures that are aligned in series, stacked in a relatively vertical orientation and arranged in a quasi-columnar fashion in the extended limb.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the human and the elephant, the column orientation of the foot complex is replaced in humans by a [[plantigrade]] orientation, and in elephants by a semi-plantigrade alignment of the hind limb foot structure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  This difference in orientation in the foot bones and joints of humans and elephants helps them to adapt to variations in the terrain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Distal cushion===
{{Double image|right|Mm Fuß.jpg|160|Indischer Elefant Detail Füße.JPG|150|Distal cushions on the foot of a raccoon and an elephant}}
Many representative terrestrial vertebrates possess a distal cushion on the under-surface of the foot.  The dog's paw contains a number of [[Viscosity|visco]]-elastic pads oriented along the middle and distal foot.  The horse possesses a centralized digital pad known as the [[Horse hoof#The frog|frog]], which is located at the distal aspect of the foot and surrounded by the hoof.&lt;ref name="extension.missouri.edu"/&gt; Humans possess a tough [[Fiber|fibro]] and elastic pad of fat that is anchored to the skin and bone of the rear portion of the foot.&lt;ref name="Gefen A 1665"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot of the elephant possesses what is perhaps one of the most unusual distal cushions found in vertebrates.  The forefoot (''manus'') and hindfoot (''pes'') contain huge pads of fat that are scaled to cope with the massive loadings imposed by the largest terrestrial vertebrate.  In addition, a [[cartilage]]-like projection ([[prepollex]] in the forelimb and [[prehallux]] in the hind limb) appears to anchor the distal cushion to the bones of the elephant's foot.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distal cushions of all these organisms (dog, horse, human and elephant) are dynamic structures during locomotion, alternating between phases of compression and expansion; it has been suggested that these structures thereby reduce the loads experienced by the skeletal system.&lt;ref name="Gefen A 1665"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-Young JE 1531"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weissengruber" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konig"&gt;{{cite journal

==Organization==
Arrangement of foot structures:

Because of the wide variety in body types, scaling and morphology of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] limbs of terrestrial vertebrates, there exists a degree of controversy concerning the nature and organization of foot structures.  One organizational approach to understanding foot structures makes distinctions regarding their regional anatomy.  The foot structures are divided into segments from proximal to distal and are grouped according to similarity in shape, dimension and function.  In this approach, the foot may be described in three segments: as the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot.

The '''hindfoot''' is the most proximal and posterior portion of the foot.&lt;ref&gt;McPoil TG, Brocato RS. The foot and ankle: biomechanical evaluation and treatment. In: Gould JA, Davies GJ, ed. Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy. St. Louis: CV Mosby; 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Functionally, the structures contained in this region are typically robust, possessing a larger size and girth than the other structures of the foot.  The structures of the hindfoot are usually adapted for transmitting large loads between the proximal and distal aspects of the limb when the foot contacts the ground.  This is apparent in the human and elephant foot, where the hindfoot undergoes greater loading during initial contact in many forms of locomotion.&lt;ref name="Perry J 1992"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hindfoot structures of the dog and horse are located relatively proximally compared to the elephant and human foot.

The '''midfoot''' is the intermediate portion of the foot between the hindfoot and forefoot. The structures in this region are intermediate in size, and typically transmit loads from the hindfoot to the forefoot.  The human transverse tarsal joint of the midfoot transmits forces from the subtalar joint in the hindfoot to the forefoot joints (metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal) and associated bones (metatarsals and phalanges).&lt;ref name="Soderberg GL 1997"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The midfoot of the dog, horse and elephant contains similar intermediate structures having similar functions to those of the human midfoot.

The '''forefoot''' represents the most distal portion of the foot. In the human and elephant, the bone structures contained in this region are generally longer and narrower.  The structures of the forefoot play a role in providing leverage for terminal stance propulsion and load transfer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry J 1992"/&gt;

==Function==
Load transmission of the foot in representative terrestrial vertebrates:

===Dog paw===
[[File:DogDewClawTika1 wb.jpg|thumb|Dog paw]]
The paw of the dog has a [[digitigrade]] orientation.  The vertical columnar orientation of the proximal bones of the limbs, which articulate with distal foot structures that are arranged in quasi-vertical columnar orientation, is well-aligned to transmit loadings during weight-bearing contact of the skeleton with the ground.  The angled orientation of the elongated [[metatarsal]] and the digits extends the area available for storing and releasing mechanical energy in the muscle [[tendon]] units originating proximally to the ankle joint and terminating at the distal aspect of the foot bones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  When muscle tendon units lengthen, the load strain facilitates mechanical activity.  These muscle tendon unit structures appear well designed to aid in the ground-reaction transmission of forces that is essential for locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the pads of the distal paw appear to allow load attenuation, by enhancing shock absorption during the paw's contact with the ground.

===Horse foot===
[[File:Hufschnitt.jpg|thumb|left|Section of a horse foot]]
The horse's foot is in an [[Ungulate|unguligrade]] orientation.  The columnar orientation of bones and connective tissue is similarly well-aligned to transmit loads during the weight-bearing phase of locomotion.  The thick [[keratin]]ized and semicircular hoof changes shape during loading and unloading.  Similarly, the cushioned frog situated centrally at the rear ends of the hoof undergoes compression during loading, and expansion when unloaded.  Together, the hoof and cushioned frog structures may work in concert with hoof capsule to provide shock absorption.&lt;ref name="Konig" /&gt;  The horse hoof also acts dynamically during loading, which may cushion the endoskeleton from high loads that would otherwise produce critical deformation.

===Elephant foot===
[[File:PSM V04 D550 Elephant rear leg bones.jpg|thumb|Leg skeleton of the modern elephant]]
The hind limb and foot of the elephant are oriented semi-plantigrade, and closely resemble the structure and function of the human foot.  The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]]s and [[metapodial]]s are arranged so as to form an arch, similarly to the human foot.  The six toes of each foot of the elephant are enclosed in a flexible sheath of skin.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Recently, scientists at the [[Royal Veterinary College]] in the United Kingdom have discovered that the elephant possesses a sixth false toe, a [[sesamoid]], located similarly to the [[giant panda]]'s extra "thumb". They found that this sixth toe acts to support and distribute the weight of the elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2011-12-23|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/12/elephants-have-a-sixth-toe.html?ref=hp|title=Elephants Have a Sixth 'Toe'|publisher=ScienceMag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human foot===
[[File:Primatenskelett-drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of the human and gorilla (gorilla shown in non-natural posture)]]

The unique [[plantigrade]] alignment of the [[human foot]] results in a distal-limb structure that can adapt to a variety of conditions.  The less mobile and more robust [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] bones are shaped and aligned to accept and transmit large loads during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running).  The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsals]] of the midfoot, which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to transmit loads between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase.  Conversely, the midfoot bones and joints also allow for the transmission of loads and inter-joint movement that unlocks the foot to create a loosely packed structure which renders the foot highly compliant over a variety of surfaces.  In this configuration, the foot is able to absorb and damp the large loads encountered during heel strike and early weight acceptance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  The forefoot, with its long [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] and relatively long [[Phalanx bone|phalanges]], transmits loads during the end-of-stance phase that facilitate the push-off and transfer of forward momentum.  The forefoot also serves as a [[lever]] to allow balance during standing and jumping. In addition, the [[arches of the foot]] that span the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot play a critical role in the nature of transformation of the foot from a rigid lever to a flexible weight-accepting structure.&lt;ref name="Perry J 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soderberg GL 1997"/&gt;

With a running gait, the foot-loading order is usually the reverse of walking. The foot strikes the ground with the [[Ball (anatomy)|ball]] of the foot, and then the [[heel]] drops.&lt;ref name="Lieberman et al 2010" &gt;{{Cite web

==Clinical implications==
Veterinarian or human healthcare professionals often respond when the foot of a dog, horse, elephant or human develops an abnormality.  They typically investigate to understand the nature of the [[pathology]] in order to generate and implement a clinical treatment plan. For instance, the paws of the dog and the hindfoot work together to absorb the shock of jumping and running, and to provide flexibility of movement.  If the dog's skeletal structures in areas other than the foot are compromised, the foot may be burdened with compensatory loading.  Structural faults such as straight or loose shoulders, straight [[stifle]]s, loose hips, and lack of balance between the forefoot and hindfoot, can all cause gait abnormalities that in turn damage the hindfoot and paws by overloading their foot structures as they compensate for the structural faults.

In the horse, dryness of the hoof may cause stiffening of the external foot structure.  The stiffer hoof reduces the foot's load attenuation capacity, rendering the horse unable to bear much weight on the distal limb.  Similar characteristic features emerge in the human foot in the form of the ''pes cavus'' alignment deformity, which is produced by tight connective tissue structures and joint congruency that create a rigid foot complex. Individuals with ''pes cavus'' display characteristic reduced load-attenuation features, and other structures proximal to the foot may compensate with increased load transfer (i.e., excessive loading to the knees, hips, lumbo-pelvic joints or lumbar vertebrae).&lt;ref name="Soderberg GL 1997"/&gt; Foot disorders are common in captive elephants. However, the cause is poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Contamination''' is the presence of an unwanted constituent, contaminant or [[impurity]] in a material, [[physical body]], [[natural environment]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], etc.
Contaminants are biological, chemical, physical or radiological substance.

==Sciences==
"Contamination" has also more specific meanings in science:
*In [[chemistry]], the term usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of [[impurity]]. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional [[chemical reaction]]s. The additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial, in which case the label ‘contaminant’ is replaced with [[reactant]] or [[catalyst]]. If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as [[toxin]], [[poison]] or [[pollutant]], depending on the type of [[molecule]] involved. A major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying, isolating, and studying contaminants.
*In [[environmental chemistry]] the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to [[pollution]], where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans.
*In [[radiation protection]] the [[radioactive contamination]] is radioactive substances on surfaces, or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, or the process giving rise to their presence in such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

: Also used less formally to refer to a quantity, namely the amount of [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|radioactivity]] in a location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter. 
:Contamination may include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of a site where there was a [[nuclear reactor]], such as a [[power plant]], [[experimental reactor]], [[isotope reactor]] or a [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear powered ship]] or [[nuclear submarine|submarine]].
:The term [[radioactive contamination]] may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of [[radioactivity]], and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved.
*In [[organic agriculture]] contamination with [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) has been a cause for decertification of a farm.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/26549/7/26549.pdf  Organic versus GMO farming: Contamination, what contamination?]. Journal of Organic Systems, 9 (1), pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western Australia]] a Parliamentary Inquiry was set up in December 2017 to examine mechanisms for compensating farmers where there has been contamination by [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37501069/Compensation_for_GMO_contamination  Compensation for GMO contamination]. International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS) Newsletter, Issue 3: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[food chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]], the term "contamination" is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of [[toxin]]s or [[pathogen]]s in [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, see [[food contaminant]].
*In [[forensic science]], a contaminant can be [[fingerprint]]s, [[hair]], [[human skin|skin]] or [[DNA]] from [[first responder]]s or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects. 
*In the [[biology|biological sciences]], accidental introduction of "foreign" material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living [[microorganism]], it can often multiply and take over the experiment, especially cultures, and render them useless.
*In [[geology]] and especially [[geochemistry]], it can have similar effects where even a few grains of "modern" dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments.
*the term "contamination" is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another.
*it has even been used in the "directed [[panspermia]]" hypothesis about the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with [[microbe]]s from their own world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Cool Climate [[Oenology]] and [[Viticulture]] Institute''' (CCOVI) is a [[research institute]] at [[Brock University]] in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It was established in 1996 and is a partnership with the Wine Council of Ontario (WCO) and the Ontario Grape Growers Marketing Board, now the Grape Growers of Ontario (GGO).  In addition to its research programs, it offers  academic programs  through the Department of Biological Sciences. CCOVI has had several graduates complete the undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs, and announced their first PhD graduate in 2007.

Graduates from CCOVI have established careers in winegrowing regions around the globe including France, New Zealand, Australia, and California. Many graduates have chosen to help further establish and improve the Canadian wine industry in the [[Niagara Peninsula]], [[British Columbia]], [[Lake Erie]] North Shore region, [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. CCOVI graduates have had great success in many fields including winemaking, viticulture, research and development, and academia.

'''Ecosystem decay''' is a term coined by [[Thomas Lovejoy]] to define the process of which [[species]] become extinct locally based on [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warf|title=Encyclopedia of Geography|pages=856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is what led to the extinction of several species, including the Irish Elk. Ecosystem decay can be mainly attributed to population isolation, leading to [[inbreeding]], leading to a decrease in the population of local species. Another factor is the absence of competition, preventing the mechanisms of natural selection to benefit the population. This leads to a lack of a skill set for the animal to adjust and adapt to a new environment. 

Although similar to [[forest fragmentation]] and [[Island Biogeography Theory|island biogeography]], ecosystem decay is what results in the event of forest fragmentation. 

==Overview==
Ecosystem decay is a natural phenomenon that has several resulting features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mokross|first=Karl|last2=Ryder|first2=Thomas B.|last3=Côrtes|first3=Marina Corrêa|last4=Wolfe|first4=Jared D.|last5=Stouffer|first5=Philip C.|date=2014-02-07|title=Decay of interspecific avian flock networks along a disturbance gradient in Amazonia|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1776/20132599|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=281|issue=1776|pages=20132599|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2599|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3871315|pmid=24335983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decline of native populations of animals
* Decrease in genetic diversity
* Decrease of the interior:[[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of an area of viable habitat
* Reduction in viable habitats and often extreme separation

==Process==
The process through which ecosystem decay occurs can be long and complicated or short and hasty. Overall, it still follows some basic guidelines. First, a piece of habitat is surrounded and thus isolated by farmland or cities.
Secondly, pollination of the plants immediately ceases and the number of species thins out. Thirdly, through generations of inbreeding and thus higher birth mortality than birth survival rate and infertile dirt, the forest fragment will slowly decline to nothing.

== Causes ==
Ecosystem decay is commonly caused by the harvesting of rain forest in appliance to certain laws or illegally for profit by humans. Certain countries such as [[Brazil]] prohibit the harvesting of [[Brazil nut|Brazil nut trees]] and groves of this species causing forest fragmentation and thus causing ecosystem decay to occur. Cities, roads, farms and any other substantial barrier impeding and animals habitat can be a direct or an indirect cause. Naturally, fires and rising sea levels on low land can also cause habitat fragmentation and thus ecosystem decay. Although this process is much more lengthy, many species such as the [[Irish Elk]] and several species of ancient [[Australian megafauna|Australian Marsupials]] have been indirectly killed this way with contributions by [[Climate Change]], [[Glaciation]] and [[Forest Fires]].

== Studies ==
Eleonore Setz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quammen|title=The Song Of The Dodo|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-684-80083-7|pages=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; was studying a patch of equatorial rainforest named reserve #1202 containing ''[[white-faced saki|Pithecia pithecia]] (''white-faced sakis), to study the effects of ecosystem decay. The 9.2 hectare (less than 25 acre) area had been isolated for five years when [[David Quammen]] noted results on the fragmentation of their habitat which resulted in them being stranded. The population of ''P. Pithecia'' was slowly declining at the time of the study and the population had declined to six.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10022">'''Electric grid security''' refers to the activities that utilities, regulators, and other stakeholders play in securing the national electricity grid. The American electrical grid is going through one of the largest changes in its history, which is the move to smart grid technology. The smart grid allows energy customers and energy providers to more efficiently manage and generate electricity. Similar to other new technologies, the smart grid also introduces new concerns about security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDaniel |first1=Patrick |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Stephen |title=Security and Privacy Challenges in the Smart Grid |journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine |date=May 2009 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=75–77 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2009.76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utility owners and operators (whether investor-owned, municipal, or cooperative) typically are responsible for implementing system improvements with regards to cybersecurity. Executives in the utilities industry are beginning to recognize the business impact of cybersecurity.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Electric%20Grid%20Security%20and%20Resilience--Establishing%20a%20Baseline%20for%20Adversarial%20Threats.pdf Electric Grid Security and Resilience: Establishing a Baseline for Adversarial Threats]''. June 2016. ICF International. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric grids can be targets of military or terrorist activity. When American military leaders created their first air war plan against the Axis in 1941, Germany's electric grid was at the top of the target list.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/constancedouris/2018/01/16/as-cyber-threats-to-the-electric-grid-rise-utilities-regulators-seek-solutions/#59aa786a343e|title=As Cyber Threats To The Electric Grid Rise, Utilities And Regulators Seek Solutions|last=Douris|first=Constance|date=2018-01-16|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issue overview ==
The North American electrical power grid is a highly connected system. The ongoing modernization of the grid is generally referred to as the "[[smart grid]]." Reliability and efficiency are two key drivers of the development of the smart grid. Another example is the ability for the electrical system to incorporate renewable energy sources such as wind power and geothermal power. One of the key issues for electric grid security is that these ongoing improvements and modernizations have created more risk to the system. As an example, one risk specifically comes from the integration of digital communications and computer infrastructure with the existing physical infrastructure of the power grid.&lt;ref name="IEEE Security"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khurana |first1=H. |last2=Hadley |first2=M. |last3=Ning Lu |last4=Frincke |first4=D.A. |title=Smart-grid security issues |journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine |date=January 2010 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=81–85 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2010.49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the academic journal ''IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine'', "The smart grid . . . uses intelligent transmission and distribution networks to deliver electricity. This approach aims to improve the electric system's reliability, security, and efficiency through two-way communication of consumption data and dynamic optimization of electric-system operations, maintenance, and planning."&lt;ref name="IEEE Security" /&gt;

== Government oversight ==
In the U.S., the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) is in charge of the cybersecurity standards for the bulk power system. The system includes systems necessary for operating the interconnected grid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Investor-owned utility|Investor-owned utilities]] operate under a different authority, state public utility commissions. This falls outside of FERC's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cybersecurity ==
As of 2018, two evolutions are taking place in the power economic sector. These evolutions could make it harder for utilities to defend from a cyber threat. First, hackers have become more sophisticated in their attempts to disrupt electric grids. "Attacks are more targeted, including spear phishing efforts aimed at individuals, and are shifting from corporate networks to include industrial control systems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/cybersecurity-and-the-distributed-grid-a-double-edged-sword/523285/|title=Cybersecurity and the distributed grid: A double-edged sword|last=Walton|first=Robert|date=2018-05-21|work=Utility Dive|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the grid is becoming more and more distributed and connected. The growing "[[Internet of things|Internet of Things]]" world could make it so that every device could be a potential vulnerability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Terrorist attack risk ==
As of 2006, over 200,000 miles of transmission lines that are 230 kV or higher existed in the United States. The main problem is that it is impossible to secure the whole system from terrorist attacks. The scenario of such a terrorist attack, however, would be minimal because it would only disrupt a small portion of the overall grid. For example, an attack that destroys a regional transmission tower would only have a temporary impact. The modern-day electric grid system is capable of restoring equipment that is damaged by natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms, and earthquakes in a generally short period of time. This is due to the resiliency of the national grid to such events. "It would be difficult for even a well-organized large group of terrorists to cause the physical damage of a small- to moderate-scale tornado."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schainker |first1=R. |last2=Douglas |first2=J. |last3=Kropp |first3=T. |title=Electric utility responses to grid security issues |journal=IEEE Power and Energy Magazine |date=March 2006 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=30–37 |doi=10.1109/MPAE.2006.1597993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential solutions ==
Today the utility industry is advancing cybersecurity with a series of initiatives. They are partnering with federal agencies. The goal is to improve sector-wide resilience to both physical and cyber threats. The industry is also working with [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], and federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/cybersecurity/Pages/default.aspx|title=Cyber &amp; Physical Security|last=|first=|date=|website=Edison Electric Institute|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Brien Sheahan, chairman and CEO of the [[Illinois Commerce Commission]] and a member of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee, and [[Robert Powelson]], a former [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) commissioner, wrote in a published piece in ''Utility Dive'' that cyberthreats to the national power system require stronger national standards and more collaboration between levels of government. Recent to their article, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] confirmed that Russian [[hacker]]s targeted the control room's of American [[Public utility|public utilities]]. The electric distribution system has become more and more networked together and interconnected. Critical public services depend on the system: water delivery, financial institutions, hospitals, and public safety. To prevent disruption to the network, Sheahan and Powelson recommended national standards and collaboration between federal and state energy regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/cyber-threat-requires-strengthened-standards-for-distribution-utilities-co/531474/|title=Cyberthreats require strengthened standards, increased government collaboration|last=Sheahan|first=Brien J.|date=2018-09-04|work=Utility Dive|access-date=2018-09-13|last2=Powelson|first2=Robert F.|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some utility companies have cybersecurity-specific practices or teams. [[Baltimore Gas and Electric]] conducts regular drills with its employees. It also shares cyber-threat related information with industry and government partners. [[Duke Energy]] put together a corporate incident response team that is devoted to cybersecurity 24 hours a day. The unit works closely with government emergency management and law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some states have cybersecurity procedures and practices:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* New Jersey: Utilities are required to put together comprehensive cybersecurity plans.
* Pennsylvania: Utilities must keep physical and cybersecurity, emergency response and business continuity plans. They also have to report severe cyberattacks.
* Texas: The state's public utility commission conducts annual security audits.

The '''Elgin Center''' is a non-profit  research center which specializes in [[zoosemiotics]], or animal communication. The Elgin Center carries out research in the wild (in Nicaragua at The [[Maderas rainforest conservancy]][http://www.maderasrfc.org], in a lab (where the center performs anatomical studies on animal brains with regard to language areas, and in a semi-free ranging environment (primarily at [[Lion Country Safari]] in Loxahatchee, Florida in the [[United States]]). 

A primary focus of the center has been research on the vocalizations of Lion Country Safari's  [[chimpanzees]].

== Group-specific vocalizations and vocal evolution in chimpanzees ==
One of the first findings at the center concerned chimpanzee vocalizations. Chimpanzees have been found to have group-specific vocalizations (the structure of chimpanzee calls vary from group to group). This gives evidence that chimpanzee calls are learned rather than genetically inherited. At Lion Country Safari, the largest chimpanzee group was separated in 2004, with seven of the group going to the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] in [[Chicago]]. Two years later, the vocalizations were analyzed and it was determined that the way they were vocalizing was slightly different from their original group - giving evidence that chimpanzee vocalization evolve in much the same way human [[dialects]] do. This provides a direct link between chimpanzee vocal communication and human language.[http://www.physanth.org/annmeet/aapa2007/aapa2007abstracts.pdf]

== Chimpanzee cognition ==
The center has also performed cognitive studies with the Lion Country Safari chimpanzees. These studies have included the ability of chimpanzees to understand certain mathematical properties (number conservation, fractions, quantity comparisons from memory, etc.), the ability of chimpanzees to discern binary oppositions, and the ability of chimpanzees to understand 2-dimensional photographs as representations of real life. These studies are done in an effort to determine if there is a cognitive structure inherent in the chimpanzee mind which would be conducive to a grammatical ability.

== Alarm calls in wild capuchin monkeys ==
The center also studies the alarm calls of wild Capuchin monkeys in Ometepe, Nicaragua. Capuchin monkeys produce alarm call relative to the predator &lt;ref&gt;Digweed, S. M., Fedigan, L. M., &amp; Rendall, D. (2005). Variable specificity in the anti-predator vocalizations and behaviour of the white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus. Behaviour, 142: 997– 1021&lt;/ref&gt; Previous surveys show two distinct families of alarm calls - those dealing with terrestrial predators and those dealing with aerial predators. Alarm calls focused on human threats fall into the aerial category.&lt;ref&gt;Gros-Louis, J.J., Perry, S.E., Fichtel, C., Wikberg, E., Gilkenson, H.,  Wofsy, S,. Fuentes, A. (2008). Vocal Repertoire of Cebus capucinus: Acoustic Structure, Context, and Usage. Int J Primatology,  29: 3: 641-670&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of over 1500 alarm call vocalizations from a group of previously unstudied wild Capuchin monkeys were recorded on Ometepe island in Nicaragua during the summer of 2008. The calls were analyzed for spectral peak frequencies and onset 
durations and compared with previously published data of Capuchin alarm calls. The results reveal no significant difference between the terrestrial alarm calls analyzed in the published accounts and the human predator calls recorded in Nicaragua. The results also show a significant difference between the human predator alarm calls in Nicaragua and the aerial alarm calls in the published data. This suggests a geographic variation in the genetic based alarm calls of Capuchin monkeys.

'''Engineering Critical Assessment''' (ECA) is a procedure by which the safety of a welded structure with defects or flaws can be determined.  ECAs utilize the material properties and expected stress history to determine a flaw acceptance criteria which will ensure that welds will not fail during the construction or service life of the welded structure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The assessment can be used before the structure is in use, or during in-service inspection, to determine whether a given weld is in need of repair.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fracture and Fatigue of Welded Joints and Structures|last=MacDonald|first=K.|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=60–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ECAs are used throughout the energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure industries.  ECAs are based heavily upon [[fracture mechanics]] principles, and reflect an improvement over traditional methods of weld quality assurance, which can be arbitrary or overly conservative.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Background ==
During welding, [[Welding defect|defects]] or flaws can develop.  In some cases, these flaws could potentially affect the integrity of the weld,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twi-global.com/capabilities/integrity-management/engineering-critical-assessment/|title=Engineering Critical Assessment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in failure by [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[Fracture|brittle fracture]], or [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Therefore, codes to determine weld quality must be developed.  Traditionally, welding codes have been based off workmanship criteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;API Standard 1104: "Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities" (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;CSA Z662-11: "Oil and gas pipeline systems" (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;BS 7910: "Guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures" (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;API Standard 579: "Fitness-for-Service" (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  These criteria are determined empirically, typically by estimating the level of weld quality expected from a skilled welder.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/gasimp/docs/FinalReport_TransborderStandards.pdf|title=Comparison of US and Canadian Transmission Pipeline Consensus Standards|last=Michael Baker Jr., Inc|date=May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these criteria have been reliable historically, improvements made in welding technology and materials science are not taken into account.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kenneth Y.|date=September 2008|title=Reducing Pipeline Construction Costs With Girth Weld ECA|url=http://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-us/industries/Documents/ReducingPipelineConstructionCostswithECA-LincolnElectricPGJ.pdf|journal=Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, over time, workmanship criteria have become increasingly conservative.  This conservatism results in unnecessary repairs, which can increase construction costs and can yield undesirable residual stresses at the location of the repair weld.

Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, engineering critical assessments began to emerge as an alternative to traditional workmanship criteria.  These ECAs relied heavily on recent developments in the field of [[fracture mechanics]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Where workmanship criteria were developed with a limited understanding of material characteristics, and considered only the length of a given weld flaw, these ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria considered additional factors such as:
* The stress history of the weld, including all cyclic and static stresses expected throughout the life cycle of the welded structure 
* The strength of the base metal and weld material&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/faq-engineering-critical-assessment-eca/|title=Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fracture toughness (measured via [[Crack tip opening displacement]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rules.dnvgl.com/docs/pdf/DNV/codes/docs/2006-01/RP-F108.pdf|title=DNV-RFP-F108: Fracture Control for Pipeline Installation Methods Introducing Cyclic Plastic Strain|last=|first=|date=January 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; testing or [[Charpy impact test]]ing)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; of the base metal and the weld material
* The flaw orientation (e.g., measurement of flaw length ''and'' flaw height, as opposed to flaw length only)
Together, these additional factors allow for more generous flaw acceptance criteria, resulting in fewer unnecessarily repaired welds.

To comply with the flaw acceptance criteria developed during ECA, [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive examination]] must be utilized.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  [[Ultrasonic testing]] is typically used due to its high accuracy, ability to identify flaw size and orientation, and its ability to provide feedback instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/sragtech/ndt4.pdf|title=Information for the Procurement and Conduct of NDT|last=|first=|date=April 2008|website=Health and Safety Executive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ECA for oil and gas pipelines ==
ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, particularly with regard to qualification of girth welds on cross-country oil and gas transmission pipelines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This is because girth welds are typically uniform from weld to weld, allowing construction contractors to utilize mechanized welding.  Mechanized welding increases productivity over manual welding techniques by allowing for better, more uniform control over weld characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are able to take advantage of the high strength and toughness of the welds produced to develop more generous flaw acceptance criteria.  In addition, the flaws created during mechanized welding are typically oriented differently than flaws developed from manual welding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria more effectively assess these flaws, by considering flaw orientation, rather than just flaw length.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Standards ===
Several standards specific to ECAs for oil and gas pipelines have been developed.  The most commonly used of these are API 1104 Appendix A,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; API 579,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; CSA Z662&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Annex K, and BS 7910.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The standard used depends primarily on the location of the pipeline being installed.  The standards differ in methodology and in extreme cases, can result in significantly different flaw acceptance criteria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, for typical operating conditions, the criteria are easy enough to follow that practical differences between the standards are small.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:GCN.PNG|300px|thumb|Diagram of the Gamma ray burst Coordinates Network. (NASA/GSFC)]]
The '''gamma-ray burst coordinates network''' ('''GCN''') is a system that distributes information about the location of a [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB), called ''notices'', when a burst is detected by various spacecraft. The GCN also automatically receives and distributes messages, called ''circulars'', about follow-up observations to interested individuals and institutions. Follow-up observations may be made by ground-based and space-based optical, radio, and X-ray observatories.

GCN has its origins in the BATSE coordinates distribution network (BACODINE). The Burst And Transient Source Experiment ([[BATSE]]) was a scientific instrument on the ''[[Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]]'' (CGRO), and BACODINE monitored the BATSE real-time telemetry from CGRO. The first function of BACODINE was calculating the [[right ascension]] (RA) and [[declination]] (dec) locations for GRBs that it detected, and distributing those locations to sites around the world in real-time. Since the de-orbiting of the CGRO, this function of BACODINE is no longer operational. The second function of BACODINE was collecting right ascension and declination locations of GRBs detected by spacecraft other than CGRO, and then distributing that information. With this functionality, the original BACODINE name was changed to the more general name GCN.

==GCN data flow==
The GCN data flow starts when gamma-rays from a GRB hit a detector on a spacecraft. The spacecraft sends the GRB location information down to a ground station, which in turn relays it to the GCN at the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. At GSFC the location information is processed by GCN with custom hardware and software, and then Notices are sent to users via [[Inter-process communication|socket connection]], [[e-mail]], and [[pager]]s. Those users may then schedule follow-up observations of the GRB, and send refined information about the GRB back to the GCN.

In the case of ''[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]]'', the GRB location information follows the same path, except it is transmitted from ''Swift'' up to a [[TDRS]] satellite, and then down to the [[TDRSS#Ground segment|White Sands Complex]] (WSC). From WSC, the location information is sent to GSFC via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT).

==GCN notices==
The following spacecraft, and instruments where noted, are sources of real-time GCN information:

*''[[High Energy Transient Explorer]]'' (WMM and SXC)
*''INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory'' ([[INTEGRAL]])
*[[InterPlanetary Network]] (IPN) Position Notices from ''[[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]]'' (Konus) and ''[[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]]''.
*''[[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]]'' (PCA and ASM)
*''[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]]'' provides data products not previously available from prior missions, including [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Spectra of objects|spectra]], images, and [[lightcurve]]s.

Past spacecraft and instruments that participated in GCN include ''[[Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors]]'' (''ALEXIS''), ''[[BeppoSAX]]'', the Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) on CGRO, and the X-Ray/Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (XGRS) on ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]''.

==GCN circulars==
The GCN system has the capability to receive and distribute timely information on GRBs called GCN Circulars. Users e-mail their reports to a central location and then those reports will be automatically sent to an e-mail distribution list. This list of Circular recipients is completely separate from the list of Notice recipients. The GCN Observation Report Circulars allow the GRB follow-up community to make optimum use of limited resources, such as labor and telescope time, by communicating what has already been done or will soon be done.

==Future plans for GCN==
To maximize the utility of the GCN system, GCN will make whatever modifications are necessary to incorporate and distribute GRB location information from new spacecraft and instruments as they become active. GCN will also expand its operations to include information about any astrophysical transients, including non-GRBs such as the [[UV astronomy|extreme-ultraviolet]] transients detected by the ''ALEXIS'' spacecraft. Future spacecraft that will be distributing GRB locations via GCN include ''[[AGILE (spacecraft)|AGILE]]'' and ''[[Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope]]''.

[[File:DIW-Berlin-Eingang.jpg|thumbnail|DIW Berlin building in Mohrenstraße 58, Berlin Mitte, Berlin]]

The '''German Institute for Economic Research''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung}}) or more commonly '''DIW{{nbsp}}Berlin''' is one of the leading economic research institutes in Germany. It is an independent, non-profit academic institution which is involved in basic research and policy advice. DIW Berlin was founded in 1925 as the Institute for Business Cycle Research and was later renamed.

DIW Berlin presents its research results in science journals, within the scope of national and international scientific events as well as at workshops, symposia and colloquia. The research results provide a basis for the exchange of ideas among experts and other relevant groups. Current economic and structural data, forecasts and advice as well as services in the area of quantitative economics are provided to decision makers in economics and policy and the broad public. DIW Berlin endues a target group specific range of publications, events and data sources. Furthermore, the research results often meet with a major response in the news media.

== Leadership and bodies ==
The legal status of DIW Berlin is that of a registered association. The association's bodies are the Members, the Board of Trustees, the Executive Board and the Scientific Advisory Board. To date, there are 185 employees, 102 of them being researchers.

=== Executive board ===

'''Service departments'''
* Communication
* Information Technology
* Library
* Management Services
* Office Management
* Legal Department and Human Resources

=== Research departments ===
The institute is divided into ten research departments, which are:
 
* The '''Department of Macroeconomics''' focuses on the empirical and theoretical analysis of aggregate economic developments as well  as national and international economic policy.
* The '''Department Forecasting and Economic Policy''' uses modern macroeconomic methods to analyze economic policy issues. Economic forecasting is a key component of the department’s work.
* The Department of '''International Economics''' focuses on monetary and financial issues affecting the global economy. It concentrates on two key activities: examining international financial markets in terms of their economic functionality and analyzing the contribution of financial development to the goal of shared growth in developing and emerging countries.
* The '''Department of Energy, Transportation and Environment''' researches different strategies of sustainable development in energy, transportation and the environment in order to formulate sound policy recommendations.
* The '''Department Climate Policy''' uses empirical and theoretical methods to explore Germany and Europe’s transition to sustainable energy—for example, by analyzing policies related to energy efficiency in buildings as well as the shift to sustainable, climate-friendly power production.
* The '''Department of Competition and Consumers''' aims to produce robust evidence of how society and markets function. Its research combines approaches from industrial economics with behavioral and experimental economics, thus enabling a comprehensive analysis of strategic interactions, market allocations, and human behavior.
* The '''Department of Firms and Markets''' analyzes firms’ strategic behavior and its impact on efficiency, productivity, and growth as well as the institutional and political environment in which firms operate.
* The '''Department of Public Economics''' analyzes how financial, fiscal, and social policies influence economic decisions made by individuals, households, and companies.
* The '''Department of Education and Family''' explores education and family-related issues primarily from a microeconomic perspective. One key question is the extent to which it is possible to fully develop the human potential of a country’s economy.
* The '''Socio-Economic Panel Study''' (SOEP) is a research-based infrastructure facility at DIW Berlin funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and state governments. The SOEP is one of the world's largest and longest-running surveys of individuals and private households. Numerous studies based on SOEP data examine mechanisms behind the distribution of social resources.

== Graduate Center ==
Since 2006 the Graduate Center (GC) of DIW Berlin offers about 15 scholarships per year for PhD positions in economics in cooperation with Berlin's largest universities: [[Free University of Berlin]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], and [[Technical University of Berlin]]. The Graduate Center is located within the DIW building in the center of Berlin. The academic research of students focuses on applied topics. The four-year program is divided into two parts: while students receive academic training in economics and related social sciences during the first year, in years two to four on-the-job training in DIW research projects leads them to complete their doctoral theses. The application period is between January and March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.100305.en/about_us/graduate_center/graduate_center.html Homepage of DIW Graduate Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-operations ==
A broad range of predominantly external Research Directors, Research Professors and Research Affiliates research along with the employees of DIW Berlin. They co-operate for a specific time, perform cross sectional tasks, care about scientific surveys (such as diploma thesis, dissertations) and release important pulses for the institute.

== Financing ==
More than half of the Institute's budget is derived from public grants, which DIW Berlin receives as research funding from the State of Berlin and the Federal Government in equal parts. This sum is supplemented by income from projects, research contracts with third parties, trustee memberships and donations.
Because of its financial structure DIW Berlin is member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Association]] (WGL).

== Publications ==
Dissemination of information is fundamental to DIW Berlin. As a leading economic research institute, it seeks to supply the wider public with up-to-date economic and structural data, forecasts, research reports, and services in the field of quantitative economics. Research results are presented in the Institute's own publications and in publications edited in co-operation with the Institute.

=== Economic situation forecasts ===
Forecasts about current and future trends in Germany, EU and world economy are published on a regular basis by DIW Berlin.

=== Publications ===
'''Wochenbericht'''

Readily available, condensed information on current economic policy issues. Published weekly in German (Wochenbericht des DIW Berlin).

'''DIW Economic Bulletin'''

The DIW Economic Bulletin is a DIW Berlin online publication. At irregular intervals selected articles of the Wochenbericht are being published online in English..

'''Quarterly Journal of Economic Research'''

Each issue concentrates on a topic relevant to the current economic policy debate. It includes detailed information on research findings and their methodological basis.

'''Discussion papers'''

The papers are presenting pre-publications of research results.

'''DIW Berlin: Policy Advice Compact'''
DIW Berlin furnishes opinions for the Federal Government of Germany, the Commission of the European Union, the Ministries of Federal and State Governments, political parties, interest groups and associations, and the social partners. In the series “DIW Berlin: Policy Advice Compact” these research reports will be published.

'''Applied Economics Quarterly''' (Konjunkturpolitik)

Applied Economics Quarterly is an international journal publishing empirical research on issues with relevance for all areas of economic policy. AEQ is published four times a year in English.

=== Events ===
'''Industrial Conference'''

The Industrial Conference is the traditional institutionalised forum for exchange between the DIW Berlin and the business sector. Since October 1960, the forum has met twice a year - May and November.
Approximately one hundred representatives of enterprises, business associations and economic sciences participate regularly. Since the Federal Government moved to Berlin, the conference has been attracting increasing numbers of participants from politics. The conference understands itself to be a platform for dialogs on different viewpoints and opinions.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Lunchtime Meetings'''

The Berlin Lunchtime Meetings are a joint series of monthly expert talks hosted by the [[Center of Economic Policy Research]] (CEPR), the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) and the Institute for the Study of Labour (IZA). The seminars serve as a platform for leading European and international researchers to address important policy issues, and as a forum for debate and discussion among researchers, policy makers and the private sector.

== History ==
'''1925''' In July 1925 Ernst Wagemann founds DIW Berlin, which is originally called Institute for Business Cycle Research, and becomes the first President.

'''1928''' In the context of the Quarterly Journal of Economic Research, Arthur Hanau publishes his dissertation „The phenomenon of cyclical development” and becomes head of the agricultural market research in Germany. Using his concept of the „[[Pork cycle|Pork Cycle]]“ is still a popular way of explaining students of economics the relationship between demand and supply.

'''1933–1945''' During the Nazi Regime, Ernst Wagemann is removed from his office. He is questioned several times by the Gestapo and even arrested for a while in 1942. By the end of 1943, the Institute for Business Cycle Research, now renamed in German Institute for Economic Research, is partially relocated to Feldberg, Mecklenburg.

'''1945''' Prof. Dr. Ferdinand Friedensburg takes on being the President of the German Institute for Economic Research until 1968. Now, after the war, the main focus of economic research lies upon economic issues within the city of Berlin.

'''1950''' The first Wochenbericht after the war is published, covering a detailed report about „Germany´ s economic situation at the end of 1945”.

'''1956''' The German Institute for Economic Research moves into its new building in Koenigin-Luise-Straße.

'''1960''' For the first time, the so-called “Grundlinien der Wirtschaftsentwicklung”, forecasts about current and future trends in Germany, EU and world economy, are published. They are referring to the year of 1961.

'''1968''' Dr. Klaus Dieter Arndt becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research.

'''1972''' Newly established departments are the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Finance and the Department of Money and Capital Markets.

'''1975''' Dr. Karl Koenig takes on being new the President of the German Institute for Economic Research.

'''1979''' The German Institute for Economic Research publishes the Wochenbericht „Eine mittelfristige Strategie zur Wiedergewinnung der Vollbeschaeftigung“, proposing strategies for re-establishing full employment in Germany. Taking this report into account, the federal government derives a programme for future investment in year 1977-1980, one of the very few programmes which consequence is a noticeable drop in German unemployment rates. Prof. Dr. [[Hans-Jürgen Krupp]] becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research.

'''1989''' The [[Socio-Economic Panel|Socio-Economic Panel Study]] (SOEP) is now part of the German Institute for Economic Research. The main focus of the service institution SOEP is on basic research and scientific services. The Socio-Economic Panel regularly surveys 10,000 private households in a representative longitudinal study. The data acquired is analysed within and outside the German Institute for Economic Research, the results are then used for the analysis of income and labour force developments.

'''1990''' The German Institute for Economic Research clearly disapproves a monetary union with the former GDR. In the case of a monetary union, the only way for the GDR to compensate their difference in productivity would be a significant decrease of the wage level. A unification of wage levels would lead to mass dismissals and enormous business shutdowns. The GDR people would become welfare recipients of the Federal Republic of Germany.

'''1994''' On behalf of [[Greenpeace]], the German Institute for Economic Research analyses the economic consequences of an ecological fiscal reform. The model of [[ecotax]], short for ecological taxation, has been enacted in Germany by means of three laws in the following years.

'''2000''' Prof. Dr. Klaus F. Zimmermann becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). From now on, there are seven Research Departments. Thus, DIW Berlin is able to react flexible to new respective current economic and social political topics. Main focus of economic research is now lying upon information society and competition, public economics and innovation. The Institute also aims at increasing its number of international cooperations and its participation in research networks worldwide.

'''2003''' DIW Berlin publishes its first Konjunkturprognose (Economic Barometer), an up-to-date indicator of Germany’s economic trends.

'''2006''' With the founding of the DIW Graduate Center, the Institute dedicates itself to furthering the careers of young scientists.

'''2007''' DIW Berlin relocates from Berlin-Dahlem to Mohrenstraße in Berlin-Mitte, marking a return to the city’s government district.

'''2013''' Prof. Marcel Fratzscher becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diw.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=diw_01.c.415093.de|title=DIW Berlin: Marcel Fratzscher neuer Präsident des DIW Berlin|last=Berlin|first=DIW|date=2007-03-01|website=www.diw.de|language=de|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hay Swamp''' (Hay Swamp Management Area) is a provincially significant [[wetland]] complex, 1839 hectares (4544 acres) in size, located in parts of the central land areas of the municipalities of [[Bluewater, Ontario|Bluewater]] and [[South Huron, Ontario|South Huron]], in [[southwestern Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Approximately {{convert|13|km|mi|sp=us}} in length and {{convert|2|km|mi|sp=us}} in width, at its widest point; it consists of 15 extensively forested individual wetlands, situated on either side, of sections of both the upper drainage of the [[Ausable River (Lake Huron)|Ausable River]] and its tributary, Black Creek.

Hay Swamp is situated at the northern limit of the [[Carolinian forest|Carolinian Biotic Province]] and is categorized as consisting of 98% [[swamp]] and 2% [[marsh]]land. Apart from the Ausable and the Black, its primary source of water is considered to be the local [[Wyoming Moraine]] [[aquifer]]. Hay Swamp is an important regional habitat for wildlife populations including [[white-tailed deer]], [[great blue heron]], ducks, geese, as well as a significant  [[beaver]] presence. The swamp is also home to several plant [[Species at Risk Act|species at risk]], including green dragon and Riddell's goldenrod. Endangered fish and mussel species present in Hay Swamp include, eastern [[Ammocrypta|sand darter]], greenside darter, [[northern riffleshell]], snuffbox, wavy-rayed lampmussel, rainbow mussel and kidneyshell.

Historic logging operations, as well as continuing intensive drainage practices to obtain access to the rich underlying organic [[soil]]s of the swamp, have affected its overall size and health as a [[Habitat (ecology)|natural habitat]]. Since the Ausable River only partially drains the swamp on an ongoing basis, Hay Swamp acts as a natural water 'storage basin', guarding against large-scale [[flood]]ing in other areas downstream and helping to maintain and moderate [[baseflow]] conditions during the summer months. By doing so it improves both the overall [[water quality]] in the Ausable system and aids local fish, bird and wildlife populations during the times of the year when water sources that are available for local wildlife are at a premium. The swamp contains several sites of abandoned 19th and early 20th century farms, including the location of the former community of [[Sodom, Ontario|Sodom]]. Hay Swamp (Hay Swamp Management Area) is administered by the [[Conservation Authority (Canada)|Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority]].

[[File:M73 13.jpg|thumb|''The Fall of Babylon'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]] from the ''Apocalypse'' series, circa 1555, plate size: 11 ⅞ x 8 ⅜ in.]]

In [[visual art]], '''horror vacui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|r|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɑː|k|juː|aɪ}}; from [[Latin]] "fear of empty space"), also '''kenophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "fear of the empty"),&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M. [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], Oxford 1993, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an [[Work of art|artwork]] with [[Complexity|detail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror%20vacui]] horror vacui as defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar [[Mario Praz]], who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the [[Victorian age]].&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=1592535879|pages=128–9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on [[Migration period art]] objects like the [[carpet page]]s of [[Insular art|Insular]] illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]]. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the [[Geometric Art|Geometric Age]] (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver [[Jean Duvet]] consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Some examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the [[mentally ill|mentally unstable]] and inmates of [[psychiatric hospitals]], such as [[Richard Dadd]] in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of [[Outsider Art]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on [[graphic design]] by artists like [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] or [[Vaughan Oliver]], and in the [[underground comix]] movement in the work of [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and on later comic artists such as [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]]. The paintings of Williams, [[Faris Badwan]], Emerson Barrett, [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]] and [[Todd Schorr]] are further examples of horror vacui in the modern [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[entheogen]]-inspired [[visionary art]] of certain [[indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] yarn paintings and the [[ayahuasca]]-inspired art of [[Pablo Amaringo]], often exhibits this style, as does the [[psychedelic art]] movement of the [[1960s counterculture]]. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric [[Mola (art form)|molas]] of [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] people and the traditional clothing on [[Shipibo-Conibo]] people.

The artwork in the [[Where's Wally?]] series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique ([[Malangatana Ngwenya]]) also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[hieroglyphs]] suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or [[phonetic complement]]s added to prevent gaps.

Horror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the [[Age of Discovery|Discoveries]], for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the ''[[Terra incognita]]'' or the poorly known oceans with [[Sea monster|monsters]] or simply with the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of the map, rather than to leave them blank.

==Current usage and meaning==
{{double image|right|Only Two Colours.jpg|150|Mango store in Barcelona.jpg|150|''Horror vacui'' and value perception}}
There is an inverse relationship between ''horror vacui'' and value perception, and commercial designers favour [[minimalism]] in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden" /&gt;


==Analogy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The term is also used as an analogy to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Horror vacui (physics)|idea]] that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected.  This was widely believed up to the time of [[Rene Descartes]].

'''Human rights literature''' is a literary [[genre]] that deals with [[human rights]] issues, and thus - directly or indirectly - promotes values of [[human rights]]. The goal of human rights literature is to combine the literary driving force with the motivation for action, which is a fundamental and integral element of the struggle for protection of human rights. This literary genre is based on the concept of "Engaged Literature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/343936/litterature-engagee |title=Littérature engagée &amp;#124; French literature &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was articulated by the French writer and philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Human rights literature is committed to society and believes that each one of us has moral duty and power to make a social change. It is based on the belief of the enormous power of literature to make a change, and in the responsibility of the author toward readers both on the social aspect and the artistic one.

==Background==
The concept of human rights literature was first articulated in the foreword to ''Freedom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Greenland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/10/freedom-amnesty-international-short-stories |title=Freedom: Short Stories &amp;#124; Book review &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anthology of short stories by renowned authors from around the world published in Britain in 2010 by Mainstream Publishing in cooperation with the human rights organization [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIUK : Book search and order online : Freedom|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/books_details.asp?BookID=103 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222342/https://www.amnesty.org.uk/books_details.asp?BookID=103 |archivedate=June 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were written in the spirit of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

The foreword - "The Tremendous Power of Literature", by Vered Cohen Barzilay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://novelrights.com/2011/07/13/the-tremendous-power-of-literatureforeword-from-freedom/ |title=The Tremendous Power of Literature/Foreword from "Freedom" |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the relationship between the Italian novella  "Prima di Lasciarsi" by [[Gabriella Ambrosio]] (English: "[[Before We Say Goodbye]]") and human rights.

The foreword along with the book was translated into various languages and published around the world in many countries including UK, US, Canada, Poland, Spain, Latin America, and Italy. At the 2010 Edinburgh Book festival the preliminary concept was first introduced in public discussion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye |title=Before We Say Goodbye - Edinburgh Festival guide &amp;#124; Fest |publisher=Festmag.co.uk |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228111532/https://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye |archivedate=2014-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2012 it was formally introduced by Cohen-Barzilay at [[Oxford University]], UK, at a panel discussion held under the title "The Power of Literature and Human Rights" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talks.ox.ac.uk/talk/index/8103 |title=Oxford Talks : The Power of Literature and Human Rights |publisher=Talks.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early 2013 at the Literary Festival at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/events/2013/literature.aspx |title=The Power of Literature and Human Rights - 2013 - Events - Centre for the Study of Human Rights - Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Cohen-Barzilay founded Novel Rights e-publishing, an e- publishing house specializing in creating and promoting Human Rights Literature.

==Engaged literature and the connection to human rights literature==
"Human rights literature" is based on the idea of "engaged literature" that was first formulated by the French writer and [[philosopher]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his book ''What is literature?''.  Sartre argued that intellectuals and the ordinary citizens must take a stand, especially in regard to major political conflicts. Sartre hoped that literature would serve as a means to enable oppressed minority groups gain recognition and that members of the elites would be moved to action as a result of the influence of literature. He argued that should a novel end with a call for action, it has to consciously address groups that have the power to act.

Sartre offers a double function for literature, acting  as both a mirror for the oppressor and as also as a source of inspiration and guidance for the oppressed, though he does not explicitly explain what the action to be taken is or how to take it within the framework of committed literature. Various actions should be chosen according to their contribution to the realization of a socialist democracy, but the author must not decide according to dogma, in the manner of a conscientious objector.

As a moral concept, human rights literature deals directly or indirectly with human rights and leads its readers to understand and act to protect human rights. The literary products are accompanied by general information concerning human rights and organizations, as well as suggestions for direct action that go hand in hand with subjects that arise from the literature.

==The power of literature vs. the power of art==
Sartre argued that "the reader of the novel submits to the book before him, abandoning his worldly existence to assume a vicarious one while he reads. He lives the problem which he himself helps to create, placing himself in the most sympathetic position white relation to what the writer wishes to say". [[Marina Nemat]], author of "Prisoner of Teheran"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinanemat.com/books.html |title=Marina Nemat |publisher=www.marinanemat.com |date=2007-12-15 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the winner of the first European Parliament 'Human Dignity' award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/88795/toronto-author-marina-nemat-awarded-first-human-dignity-prize-by-european-parliament-presentation-in-milan-italy-on-december-15-2007 |title=SLOPEN LITERARY AGENCY &amp;#124; Toronto author Marina Nemat awarded first "Human Dignity" prize by European Parliament; presentation in Milan, Italy, on December 15, 2007 |publisher=Newswire.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains: "Literature allows the victim to become a survivor and stand up to the past to ensure a better future. It is literature that carries the human experience, reaches our hearts, and makes us feel the pain of those who have been treated unjustly. Without literature and narrative, we would lose our identity as human beings and will dissolve in the darkness of time and our repeated mistakes that lead us from one preventable devastation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/2012/09/06/marina-nemat-authors-note-leila/ |title=Marina Nemat, Author’s Note /"Leila" |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, human rights literature emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately isolated from the world and geopolitical events, and regional or global social crises. Human rights literature does not believe in writing for purely artistic aesthetic purposes. It calls on writers to exercise their moral-social duty wherein the power of the literary creation on the public is enormous and rarely come to fruition. According to the American philosopher professor [[Martha Nussbaum]] in her book: [[Poetic justice|"Poetic Justice"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Justice-Literary-Imagination-Public/dp/0807041092 |title=Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life: Martha C. Nussbaum: 9780807041093: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that social sympathy is a necessary condition for equitable treatment in courts of law. Judges, Nussbaum has observed, are short of imaginative data about the persons they must judge, and novels are one place they can look for guidance. The author [[Richard Rorty]] wrote in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/3RORTY.pdf |format=PDF |title=Human Rights, Rationality and Sentimentality |publisher=Nyu.edu |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty wrote about the "human rights culture" a term he declair to borrow from the Argentinian jurist and philosopher Eduardo Rabossi. In an article called "Human Rights Naturalized", Rabossi argues that philosophers should think of this culture as a new, welcome fact of the post-Holocaust world, They should stop trying to get behind or beneath this fact.

In her essay "The Tremendous Power of Literature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307588838&amp;view=toc |title=Random House Academic |publisher=Randomhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vered Cohen Barzilay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=Novel Rights |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes:  "Literature can be as powerful as life itself. It can be like our [[prophecy]]. It can inspire us to change our world and give us the comfort, hope, passion and strength that we need in order to fight to create a better future for us, as well as all humanity. We just need to keep on reading and to allow the tremendous power of literature to enter our hearts and lead us to our own path." Indeed, Human Rights Literature does not impose on the authors actual call for action, rather, the writer’s task ends as soon as he completes the writing process. Only the readers’ response can answer whether the creation inspires social change or motivates for action.

Human rights literature provides the readers with an opportunity for a direct action, however it is not a compulsory requirement. In fact, the commitment is an unwritten accord between the readers and the literary creation developed through the reading process, which holds simultaneously the freedom to refrain from action.

==Criticism and response==
Critics of engaged literature argue that such literature is propaganda and that it is created and used  for political purposes. But if the literature becomes propaganda the reader would see through that, and the magic, the intimate process of communion between the reader and the author’s inner voice will not unfold.

It is argued that for the purpose of reaching the masses such literature will be reduced to the lowest common denominator while compromising quality standards to a limited criteria of stimulation for action. Sartre stresses that both writers and social leaders must constantly aim for developing and improving their readers’ intellectual level,  offering readers something beyond the familiar and providing an opportunity to expand horizons.

Another criticism of engaged literature suggests irrelevance of the commitment for action during times of large-scale events or conflicts once these circumstances change, and while a great novel is eternal and can exist in timeless literary space. Sartre argued that those who attack engaged literature are manifesting again the old desire to retreat into a private shell and ignore events which may someday reach their lives. Authors, he claimed, are trying in vain to isolate themselves from reality, and during a demanding writing process they are cut off from social problems, and thus, create literature for sheer escapism. All novels, whatever else they may do, inevitably instruct us on life. Engaged novel tells us that we may or may not, relate this knowledge to whatever sphere of reality we choose, whenever and however we wish. We cannot meet reality in our own terms. The novel, which has always presented the reader with knowledge of real life, is changing the form of its presentation in order to accord with a more accurate conception of the relation between the individual and reality.

As [[Gabriella Ambrosio]], author of ''[[Before We Say Goodbye]]'', writes in the foreword of her short story "Sticko": "At times, writers are afraid to know what is inevitable: that “pure” art does not exist. None of us is pure or innocent: any word carrying imaginative power produces culture, and culture produces behaviour." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/sources/ |title=Inspiration Sources &amp;#124; Novel Rights &amp;#124; Human Rights Literature ePublishing |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dilemma which was raised by intellectuals and in literary circles is the issue of the author’s competence to the task if indeed a novel is an adequate tool for generating social action. Can authors understand the substantive social issues? Or handle the risk and complexity as not to support a false cause? Or be discussed only by experts? What has been suggested was that the engaged novel requires greater talent and wider knowledge by novelists than has been necessary before, and in fact create a new generation of engaged authors.

As for irrelevance of human rights issues outside a specific context in time, the answer is embodied in the relevance and validity of human rights’ values which were articulated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. These principles transcend the era in which they were articulated and bring a set of burning social issues to the surface.
An example of a novel set in a temporal and geographical context which transcended these limits is [[Harper Lee]]’s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. While the book’s focus on racism in the United States covered events in the author’s environment at a specific time, it highlighted the larger issue of racism and discrimination in a universal manner, transcending the local context of the story. With its social commitment for change, the book had an enormous impact, not only on local issue of racism, but rather as an influencing generations of readers around the world.

==Literature and the human rights movement==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2018}}Unlike the abstract commitment to social action of Sartre’s engaged literature, human rights literature places human rights at the core of its moral and social duty.  It emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately cut off from the world, geopolitical changes or social crises. Human rights literature does not believe writing is solely an artistic aesthetic exercise, and calls on writers to realize the social commitment under the power of their literary creation that it effects on the public is enormous and does not come to fruition often. And thus, human rights literature manifests that unique and close links exist between literature and human rights campaigns.

Lynn Hunt identified these links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2002/april17/hunt-417.html |title=Empathy with literary characters helped spur concept of human rights, scholar says: 04/02 |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=2002-04-17 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Inventing Human Rights: A History'', she examines the emergence of the prose narrative in the 18th century and the role it played in the conception of the human rights idea. Hunt demonstrates how ideas of human relationships portrayed in novels and art generated a powerful fictional empathy which helped spreading this new idea.  ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by [[Nelle Harper Lee]] is one example of a novel that had major contribution and impact on American public opinion on the issue of race and rights. Another example is [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]’s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was the best-selling novel of the 19th century. The book had a deep impact on public opinion in the US on the issue of slavery and is seen as one of the triggers to the Abolitionist movement in the 1850s.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}
Many other books and novels had great impact on human rights issues and struggles,{{According to whom|date=January 2018}} for example: [[Toni Morrison]]’s ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', [[Giannina Braschi]]’s ''[[United States of Banana]]'', [[Franz Kafka]]’s ''[[The Trial]]'' and ''Night'' by [[Elie Wiesel]].

==Freedom of expression and persecution of authors==
While the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and subsequent international covenants defined Freedom of Thought and Expression as fundamental human rights, constant and frequent attacks on these freedoms takes place under dictatorships and repressive regimes in attempt to silence any protest or dissent. Censorship is exercised on each and every publication while are often writers and journalists are persecuted, imprisoned and executed. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] is a Chinese literary critic, writer, professor, and human rights activist. He published a manifesto calling for freedom of expression and free elections, and in 2009 was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power”. Like Xiaobo, many authors suffer persecution as authorities recognize their unique power and ability to impact on the masses. [[Salman Rushdie]], an awarded British-Muslim novelist and essayist of Indian origin became a target following the publication his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988). The book was the center of a major controversy in the Islamic world because of what was perceived as an irreverent depiction of [[Muhammad]].  Death threats were made against him, including a [[fatwā]] issued by [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], the Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989 and a bounty was offered for Rushdie's death. Rushdi was forced to hide and live under police protection for many years.  Years later Rushdi became the president of [[PEN International]], the worldwide association of writers who fights for freedom of expression, and acts as a powerful voice on behalf of writers harassed, imprisoned and sometimes killed for their views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">{{hatnote|This article deals with the general meaning of the '''integument'''. Consult articles listed below for other articles dealing with similar or related concepts}}

In biology, '''integument''' is the natural covering of an organism or an organ, such as its [[skin]], [[husk]], [[Exoskeleton|shell]], or [[Peel (fruit)|rind]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"/&gt;

It derives from ''integumentum'', which means "a covering" in [[Latin]]. In a transferred or figurative sense, it could mean a [[cloak]] or a [[disguise]].&lt;ref name="Latin Cassel"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marchant, J.R.V. |author2=Charles Joseph F. | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell | location = London | year = 1952 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English "integument" is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century. It can mean a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of "clad" or "coated", as with a skin or husk.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical usage ==
In [[botany]] the senses are similar to those in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the [[Ovule#Integuments, chivai and chalaza|ovule]]. The integument may consist of one layer (or unitegmic) or two layers (or bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or [[seed]] coat.

==Zoological usage==
The integument of an organ in [[zoology]] typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the [[integumentary system]], where "integumentary" is a simile for "[[Skin|cutaneous]]".

In arthropods, the integument, or external "skin", consists of a single layer of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[ectoderm]] from which arises the [[cuticle]],&lt;ref name="Kristensen&amp;Georges2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kristensen|first1=Niels P.|last2=Georges|first2=Chauvin|title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology, and Development : Teilband|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-016210-3|page=484|chapter=Integument}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outer covering of [[chitin]] the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

==Derivative terms and sundry usages==
Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, "peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion"&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;) and integumented (as opposed to bare).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R. Chambers | location = Edinburgh | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-550-13202-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other illustrative examples of usage occur in the following articles:
*[[Connective tissue in skeletal muscle]]
*[[Dorsal artery of the penis]] (example of integument enclosing an internal organ)
*[[Flensing]]
*[[Flesh]] (generic use of plural "integuments")
*[[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] (figurative usage)
*[[Integumentary system]] (senses related to vertebrate skin and medical aspects)
*[[Cat anatomy#Muscles|Integumental muscles]]
*[[Mosasaur#Soft tissue|Mosasaur]]
*[[Seed]]

The '''''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants''''' ('''ICN''') is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal [[botanical name]]s  that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those "traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants".&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2018 |editor-last=Turland |editor-first=N.J. |displayeditors=etal|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Shenzhen Code) adopted by the Nineteenth International Botanical Congress Shenzhen, China, July 2017 |edition=electronic |publication-place=Glashütten |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php |accessdate=2018-06-27 |lastauthoramp=yes |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preamble, para. 8}} It was formerly called the '''''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature''''' ('''ICBN'''); the name was changed at the [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Melbourne]] in July 2011 as part of the ''Melbourne Code''&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |displayeditors=etal|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code), Adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |edition=electronic |publication-place=Bratislava |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php |accessdate=2012-12-20 |lastauthoramp=yes |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the ''Vienna Code'' of 2005.

The current version of the code is the ''Shenzhen Code'' adopted by the [[International Botanical Congress]] held in [[Shenzhen]], China, in July 2017. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on 29 July 2017), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not published until 26 June 2018.

The name of the ''Code'' is partly capitalized and partly not. The lower-case for "algae, fungi, and plants" indicates that these terms are not formal names of [[clade]]s, but indicate groups of organisms that were historically known by these names and traditionally studied by [[phycology|phycologists]], [[mycology|mycologists]], and [[botany|botanists]]. This includes blue-green algae ([[Cyanobacteria]]); [[fungi]], including [[chytrid]]s, [[oomycete]]s, and [[slime mould]]s; [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protists]] and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomically]] related non-photosynthetic groups. There are special provisions in the ''ICN'' for some of these groups, as there are for [[fossil]]s.

The ''ICN'' can only be changed by an International Botanical Congress (IBC), with the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] providing the supporting infrastructure. Each new edition supersedes the earlier editions and is retroactive back to 1753, except where different starting dates are specified.&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Principle VI}}

For the naming of cultivated plants there is a separate code, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'', which gives rules and recommendations that supplement the ''ICN''.

== Principles ==
* Botanical nomenclature is independent of zoological, bacteriological, and viral nomenclature (see [[Nomenclature codes]]).
* A botanical name is fixed to a taxon by a [[type (botany)|type]].&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Article 7}} This is almost invariably dried plant material and is usually deposited and preserved in a [[herbarium]], although it may also be an image or a preserved culture. Some type collections can be viewed online at the websites of the herbaria in question.
* A guiding principle in [[botanical nomenclature]] is priority, the first publication of a name for a taxon.&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Principle III}} The formal starting date for purposes of priority is 1 May 1753, the publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. However, to avoid undesirable (destabilizing) effects of strict enforcement of priority, [[conservation (botany)|conservation]] of family, genus, and species names is possible.
* The intent of the Code is that each taxonomic group ("[[taxon]]", plural "taxa") of plants has only one [[correct name (botany)|correct name]] that is accepted worldwide, provided that it has the same [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], position and [[Taxonomic rank|rank]].&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Principle IV}} The value of a scientific name is that it is an [[identifier]]; it is not necessarily of descriptive value.
* Names of taxa are treated as Latin.
* The rules of nomenclature are retroactive unless there is an explicit statement that this does not apply.

== History ==
{{Main article|International Botanical Congress}}
The rules governing botanical nomenclature have a long and tumultuous history, dating back to dissatisfaction with rules that were established in 1843 to govern zoological nomenclature.&lt;ref name=Nicholson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicolson, D.H. |year=1991 |title= A History of Botanical Nomenclature |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|volume=78|issue=1|pages=33–56|jstor=2399589|doi=10.2307/2399589}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of international rules was the ''Lois de la nomenclature botanique'' ("Laws of botanical nomenclature") that was adopted as the "best guide to follow for botanical nomenclature"&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; at an "International Botanical Congress" convened in [[Paris]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S-QkAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=[[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle]]|year=1867 |title= Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée au congrès|publisher=J.-B.

Reeve and Co|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924001723604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike modern codes, it was not enforced. It was organized as six sections with 68 articles in total.

Multiple attempts to bring more "expedient" or more equitable practice to botanical nomenclature resulted in several competing codes, which finally reached a compromise with the 1930 congress.&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; In the meantime, the second edition of the international rules followed the [[Vienna]] congress in 1905. These rules were published as the ''Règles internationales de la Nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique de Vienne 1905'' (or in English, ''International rules of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Conference of Vienna 1905''). Informally they are referred to as the ''Vienna Rules'' (not to be confused with the ''Vienna Code'' of 2006).

Some but not all subsequent meetings of the International Botanical Congress have produced revised versions of these ''Rules'', later called the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'', and then ''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants''.

The Nomenclature Section of the 18th International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia (2011) made major changes:&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller JS, Funk VA, Wagner WL, Barrie F, Hoch PC, Herendeen P | year = 2011 | title = Outcomes of the 2011 Botanical Nomenclature Section at the XVIII International Botanical Congress | journal = PhytoKeys | volume = 5 | pages = 1–3 | doi = 10.3897/phytokeys.5.1850 | pmid = 22171188 | issue = 5 | pmc = 3174450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McNeill, 2011.

* The ''Code'' now permits electronic-only publication of names of new taxa; no longer will it be a requirement to deposit some paper copies in libraries.
* The requirement for a Latin validating diagnosis or description was changed to allow either English or Latin for these essential components of the publication of a new name (Article 39).
* "[[One fungus, one name]]" and "one fossil, one name" are important changes; the concepts of ''[[anamorph]]'' and ''[[teleomorph]]'' (for fungi) and ''[[morphotaxa]]'' (for fossils) have been eliminated.
* As an experiment with "registration of names", new fungal descriptions require the use of an identifier from "a recognized repository"; there are two recognized repositories so far, [[Index Fungorum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Index Fungorum Registration|url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/IndexFungorumRegistration.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MycoBank]].

'''Leiden Observatory''' ('''Sterrewacht Leiden''' in Dutch) is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] in the city of [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]]. It was established by [[Leiden University]] in 1633, to house the quadrant of [[Rudolph Snellius]], making it the oldest operating university observatory in the world, with the only older still existing observatory being the [[Vatican Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deborah Todd, Joseph A. Angelo|title=A to Z of Scientists in Space and Astronomy|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=1438109237|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3l4Rngj4B0C&amp;pg=PA262 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

The observatory was initially located on the university building in the centre of Leiden before a new observatory building and dome were constructed in the university's botanical garden in 1860. It remained there until 1974 when the department moved to the science campus north-west of the city.

Some notable astronomers have worked or directed the observatory including [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]], and [[Jan Oort]].

==History==

===1633–1860===
[[File:Leiden Observatory in 1670.png|thumb|left|Drawing of Leiden Observatory in 1670, seen on top of the university building.]]

[[Leiden University]] established the observatory in 1633; astronomy had been on the curriculum for a long time, and due to possession of a large [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] built by [[Rudolph Snellius]], [[Jacobus Golius]] requested an observatory in which to use it. The observatory was one of the first purpose-built observatories in [[Europe]]. Though Golius used the observatory regularly, no publications came from its use by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prögler|first1=Daniela|title=English Students at Leiden University, 1575-1650|date=2014|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=1409484041|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPmAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT168 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Golius had any instrumentation other than Snellius' quadrant at the observatory.&lt;ref name=deSitter&gt;{{cite book |title= Short History of the Observatory of the University at Leiden 1633-1933 |author= W. de Sitter |date= 1933 |publisher= Joh. Enschede en Zonen, Haarlem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1682 [[Burchardus de Volder]] became professor of mathematics at the university and thus took over responsibility for the observatory. During his tenure, the observatory was enlarged, including a second turret to house a brass [[sextant]] which he purchased, and the rebuilding of the old turret. Both turrets had rotating roofs. Upon retiring in 1705, de Volder handed over a catalogue of instruments which showed that the observatory owned two other quadrants, a 12-inch telescope, two [[Objective (optics)|objectives]], and several smaller telescopes. For the next two years, Lotharius Zumbach de Coesfeld ran the observatory until his appointment as professor of mathematics in [[Kassel]] in 1708. Between then and 1717 the observatory went without a director until [[Willem 's Gravesande]] was appointed director. During his time at the observatory, 's Gravesande purchase a number of new instruments including new telescopes and tools, before his death in 1742.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

's Gravesande's successor was Johan Lulofs who used the observatory to observe [[Halley's comet]] in 1759 and [[solar transit]]s of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1743 and 1753 and [[Venus]] in 1761. In November 1768 when Lulofs died, Dionysius van de Wijnpersse took over responsibility for the observatory until [[Pieter Nieuwland]] became its director in 1793 for a year until he died in 1794. For a number of years the curators attempted to find a suitable astronomer to look after the observatory, eventually employing [[Jan Frederik van Beeck Calkoen]] in 1799, who left in 1805.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

In 1817 the observatory towers were pulled down and rebuilt. [[Frederik Kaiser]] was appointed lecturer of astronomy and director of the observatory in 1837, and again renovated the observatory, providing the towers with rotatable roofs with full shutters, and reinforcing the north-western tower. Kaiser also acquired a number of new instruments and telescopes with which he made observations including that of comets, planets, and [[binary star]]s.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

As a result of the increased interest in astronomy brought about due to Kaiser's popular writings and teachings, a commission was founded in 1853 to fund a new observatory.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt; From 1859 to 1909 the [[Netherlands]] [[civil time]] was set according to the local civil time at the observatory; communicated using the [[telegraphic]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astro.rug.nl/~vdkruit/JCKapteyn/HHKbiog.pdf |title= J.C.

===1860–present===
[[Image:Leiden old observatory2.jpg|thumb|left|The second building to house the Leiden Observatory (built in 1860). This building now houses part of the law faculty. Two of the optical [[telescope]] domes can be seen on the roof.]]

By 1860 the new observatory building was completed. The new building was constructed in a quiet side of the city inside the university’s botanical gardens. It consisted of a number of offices, living quarters for astronomers, and a number of observing domes containing telescopes. In 1873 two new rooms were added to the building in order to house the tools required to verify nautical instruments; tools used to test compasses, sextants and other instruments. Two of the domes were rebuilt, one in 1875 and the other in 1889.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

More new buildings were constructed before the end of the 19th century including the Western tower in 1878, one to the East in 1898, and another small building to house a gas engine in the same year (used for electricity until the observatory was connected to the city grid). In 1896 the observatory purchased their first photographic telescope, with a dome being built to house it between then and 1898.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

In 1923 the observatory formed a research agreement with [[Union Observatory]] to allow researchers use of both facilities. The first visitor from Leiden was [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]]. In 1954 the telescopes were moved to [[Hartbeespoort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assa.saao.ac.za/sections/history/observatories/leiden_obs/|title=Leiden Observatory|website=www.assa.saao.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration lasted until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Piet C. van der Kruit, [[Klaas van Berkel]] |title=The Legacy of J.C.

The astronomy department moved to the science campus north-west of the city centre in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Gent|first1=Robert|title=Historical Telescopes in the Netherlands|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/telescope/telescopenl.htm#Leiden|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although professional astronomical observations are no longer carried out from Leiden itself, the department still calls itself Leiden Observatory.

Single-molecule biomechanics studies of proteins and DNA, and mechanochemical coupling in [[molecular motors]] have demonstrated the critical importance of molecular mechanics as a new frontier in [[bioengineering]] and life sciences. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered [[flexible linker]] domains, induce long-range [[Allosteric regulation|allostery]] via [[Protein dynamics#Global flexibility: multiple domains|protein domain dynamics]].
The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains. They can however be inferred by comparing different structures of a protein (as in [[Database of Molecular Motions]]).  They can also be suggested by sampling in extensive molecular dynamics trajectories&lt;ref name="potestioBJ2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potestio R, Pontiggia F, Micheletti C | title = Coarse-grained description of protein internal dynamics: an optimal strategy for decomposing proteins in rigid subunits | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 4993–5002  | date = Jun 2009 | pmid = 19527659 | pmc = 2712024 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.051 | url = http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495%2809%2900781-4 | bibcode = 2009BpJ....96.4993P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and principal component analysis,&lt;ref name="pmid22802671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron R, Vellore NA | title = LSD1/CoREST is an allosteric nanoscale clamp regulated by H3-histone-tail molecular recognition | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 31 | pages = 12509–14  | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22802671 | pmc = 3411975 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1207892109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10912509B }}&lt;/ref&gt; or they can be directly observed using spectra&lt;ref name="pmid21081097"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farago B, Li J, Cornilescu G, Callaway DJ, Bu Z | title = Activation of nanoscale allosteric protein domain motion revealed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 99 | issue = 10 | pages = 3473–3482 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 21081097 | pmc = 2980739 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.09.058 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3495(10)01208-7 | bibcode = 2010BpJ....99.3473F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bu Z, Biehl R, Monkenbusch M, Richter D, Callaway DJ | title = Coupled protein domain motion in Taq polymerase revealed by neutron spin-echo spectroscopy | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 49 | pages = 17646–17651  | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16306270 | pmc = 1345721 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503388102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10217646B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ear ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
One such mechanism is the opening of [[ion channels]] in the [[hair cell]]s of the [[cochlea]] in the inner ear.

Air pressure changes in the ear canal cause the vibrations of the [[tympanic membrane]] and middle ear ossicles. At the end of the ossicular chain, movement of the stapes footplate within the [[oval window]] of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the [[basilar membrane]]. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the [[organ of Corti]]: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the [[scala vestibuli]] and [[scala tympani]]. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the [[tectorial membrane (cochlea)|tectorial membrane]] and the [[reticular lamina]] of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position.  When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.

Basilar Membrane motion causes a shearing motion between the reticular lamina and the tectorial membrane, thereby activating the mechano-sensory apparatus of the hair bundle, which in turn generates a [[receptor potential]] in the hair cells.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Thus the sound pressure wave is transduced to an electrical signal which can be processed as sound in higher parts of the [[auditory system]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

== Skeletal Muscle ==

[[File:Mechanically Gated Channel.png|thumb|Mechanically gated channel]]
One of the main mechanical functions of articular [[cartilage]] is to act as a low-friction, load-bearing surface.  Due to its unique location at joint surfaces, articular cartilage experiences a range of static and dynamic forces that include shear, compression and tension. These mechanical loads are absorbed by the cartilage [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM), where they are subsequently dissipated and transmitted to [[chondrocytes]] (cartilage cells).

[[Image:Cartilage forces.jpg|thumb|right|Cartilage experience tension, compression and shear forces in vivo]]

Chondrocytes sense and convert the mechanical signals they receive into biochemical signals, which subsequently direct and mediate both [[anabolic]] (matrix building) and [[catabolic]] (matrix degrading) processes.  These processes include the synthesis of matrix proteins ([[type II collagen]] and [[proteoglycans]]), [[proteases]], protease inhibitors, [[transcription factors]], [[cytokines]] and [[growth factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M400437200 |title=Mechanical Compression of Cartilage Explants Induces Multiple Time-dependent Gene Expression Patterns and Involves Intracellular Calcium and Cyclic AMP |year=2004 |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=J.

The balance that is struck between [[anabolic]] and [[catabolic]] processes is strongly influenced by the type of loading that cartilage experiences.  High strain rates (such as which occurs during impact loading) cause tissue damage, degradation, decreased matrix production and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00033-X |title=Biosynthetic response and mechanical properties of articular cartilage after injurious compression |year=2001 |last1=Kurz |first1=Bodo |last2=Jin |first2=Moonsoo |last3=Patwari |first3=Parth |last4=Cheng |first4=Debbie M. |last5=Lark |first5=Michael W. |last6=Grodzinsky |first6=Alan J. |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1140–6 |pmid=11781016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/abbi.2000.1988 |title=Injurious Mechanical Compression of Bovine Articular Cartilage Induces Chondrocyte Apoptosis |year=2000 |last1=Loening |first1=A |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=381 |issue=2 |pages=205–12 |pmid=11032407 |last2=James |first2=IE |last3=Levenston |first3=ME |last4=Badger |first4=AM |last5=Frank |first5=EH |last6=Kurz |first6=B |last7=Nuttall |first7=ME |last8=Hung |first8=HH |last9=Blake |first9=SM }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased mechanical loading over long periods, such as during extended bed-rest, causes a loss of matrix production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jor.1100070305 |title=Biochemical changes in articular cartilage after joint immobilization by casting or external fixation |year=1989 |last1=Behrens |first1=Fred |last2=Kraft |first2=Ellen L. |last3=Oegema |first3=Theodore R. |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–43 |pmid=2703926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Static loads have been shown to be detrimental to biosynthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10237-006-0030-5 |title=Effect of Compressive Strain on Cell Viability in Statically Loaded Articular Cartilage |year=2006 |last1=Torzilli |first1=P.

Although studies have shown that, like most biological tissues, cartilage is capable of mechanotransduction, the precise mechanisms by which this is done remain unknown.  However, there exist a few hypotheses which begin with the identification of [[mechanoreceptors]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In order for mechanical signals to be sensed, there need to be mechanoreceptors on the surface of chondrocytes.  Candidates for chondrocyte mechanoreceptors include [[stretch-activated ion channel]]s (SAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10237-006-0034-1 |title=Ion-channel Regulation of Chondrocyte Matrix Synthesis in 3D Culture Under Static and Dynamic Compression |year=2006 |last1=Mouw |first1=J.

Using the integrin-linked mechanotransduction pathway as an example (being one of the better studied pathways), it has been shown to mediate chondrocyte adhesion to cartilage surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00051-1 |title=Mechanisms of chondrocyte adhesion to cartilage: Role of Î²1-integrins, CD44, and annexin V |year=2001 |last1=Kurtis |first1=Melissa S. |last2=Tu |first2=Buu P. |last3=Gaya |first3=Omar A. |last4=Mollenhauer |first4=Jürgen |last5=Knudson |first5=Warren |last6=Loeser |first6=Richard F. |last7=Knudson |first7=Cheryl B. |last8=Sah |first8=Robert L. |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1122–30 |pmid=11781014}}&lt;/ref&gt; mediate survival signaling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/art.10334 |title=The ?5?1 integrin provides matrix survival signals for normal and osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes in vitro |year=2002 |last1=Pulai |first1=Judit I. |last2=Del Carlo |first2=Marcello |last3=Loeser |first3=Richard F. |journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regulate matrix production and degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1529-0131(200009)43:9&lt;2091::AID-ANR21&gt;3.0.CO;2-C |title=Mechanotransduction via integrins and interleukin–4 results in altered aggrecan and matrix metalloproteinase 3 gene expression in normal, but not osteoarthritic, human articular chondrocytes |year=2000 |last1=Millward–Sadler |first1=S.

Integrin receptors have an extracellular domain that binds to the ECM proteins (collagen, [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], [[vitronectin]] and [[osteopontin]]), and a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with intracellular signaling molecules.  When an integrin receptor binds to its ECM ligand and is activated, additional integrins cluster around the activated site.  In addition, [[kinases]] (e.g., [[focal adhesion kinase]], FAK) and [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adapter proteins]] (e.g., [[paxillin]], Pax, [[talin protein|talin]], Tal and [[Src homology 2 domain-containing|Shc]]) are recruited to this cluster, which is called the [[focal adhesion]] complex (FAC).  The activation of these FAC molecules in turn, triggers downstream events that up-regulate and /or down-regulate intracellular processes such as transcription factor activation and gene regulation resulting in apoptosis or differentiation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In addition to binding to ECM ligands, integrins are also receptive to [[autocrine]] and [[paracrine]] signals such as growth factors in the [[TGF-beta]] family.  Chondrocytes have been shown to secrete TGF-b, and upregulate TGF-b receptors in response to mechanical stimulation; this secretion may be a mechanism for autocrine signal amplification within the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:ABME.0000017538.72511.48 |title=Integrin-Dependent Signal Cascades in Chondrocyte Mechanotransduction |year=2004 |last1=Millward-Sadler |first1=S. J. |last2=Salter |first2=D. M. |journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=435–46 |pmid=15095818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrin signaling is just one example of multiple pathways that are activated when cartilage is loaded.  Some intracellular processes that have been observed to occur within these pathways include phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/ERK kinase-1 (SEK-1) of the JNK pathway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M305107200 |title=Mechanical Regulation of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Signaling in Articular Cartilage |year=2003 |last1=Fanning |first1=P. J. |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=278 |issue=51 |pages=50940–8 |pmid=12952976 |last2=Emkey |first2=G |last3=Smith |first3=RJ |last4=Grodzinsky |first4=AJ |last5=Szasz |first5=N |last6=Trippel |first6=SB}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as changes in cAMP levels, actin re-organization and changes in the expression of genes which regulate cartilage ECM content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/33.10.901 |title=The Chondrocyte: A Cell Under Pressure |year=1994 |last1=Urban |first1=J. P. G. |journal=Rheumatology |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have hypothesized that chondrocyte primary [[cilium]] act as a mechanoreceptor for the cell, transducing forces from the extracellular matrix into the cell.  Each chondrocyte has one cilium and it is hypothesized to transmit mechanical signals by way of bending in response to ECM loading.  Integrins have been identified on the upper shaft of the cilium, acting as anchors to the collagen matrix around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1369/jhc.5A6866.2006 |title=Localization of Extracellular Matrix Receptors on the Chondrocyte Primary Cilium |year=2006 |last1=McGlashan |first1=S. R. |journal=Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=1005–14 |pmid=16651393 |last2=Jensen |first2=CG |last3=Poole |first3=CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies published by Wann ''et al.'' in FASEB Journal have demonstrated for the first time that primary cilia are required for chondrocyte mechanotransduction. Chondrocytes derived from IFT88 mutant mice did not express primary cilia and did not show the characteristic mechanosensitive up regulation of proteoglycan synthesis seen in wild type cells&lt;ref&gt;Wann AK, Zho N, Haycraft CJ, Jensen CG, Poole CA, McGlashen SR, Knight MM (2012) FASEB J. {{PMID|22223751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to examine the mechanotransduction pathways in chondrocytes since mechanical loading conditions which represent an excessive or injuruous response upregulates synthetic activity and increases catabolic signalling cascades involving mediators such as NO and MMPs.  In addition, studies by Chowdhury TT and Agarwal S have shown that mechanical loading which represents physiological loading conditions will block the production of catabolic mediators (iNOS, COX-2, NO, PGE2) induced by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1) and restore anabolic activities. Thus an improved understanding of the interplay of biomechanics and cell signalling will help to develop therapeutic methods for blocking catabolic components of the mechanotransduction pathway.  A better understanding of the optimal levels of in vivo mechanical forces are therefore necessary for maintaining the health and viability of cartilage, preventative techniques may be devised for the prevention of cartilage degradation and disease.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26713">The concept of '''motor cognition''' grasps the notion that [[cognition]] is embodied in action, and that the [[motor system]] participates in what is usually considered as mental processing, including those involved in [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Sommerville 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Sommerville | first1 = JA. | last2 = Decety | first2 = J. | title = Weaving the fabric of social interaction: articulating developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience in the domain of motor cognition. | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–200 |date=Apr 2006 | doi = 10.3758/BF03193831 | pmid = 16892982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental unit of the motor cognition paradigm is action, defined as the movements produced to satisfy an intention towards a specific [[motor goal]], or in reaction to a meaningful event in the physical and social environments. Motor cognition takes into account the preparation and production of actions, as well as the processes involved in recognizing, predicting, mimicking and understanding the behavior of other people. This paradigm has received a great deal of attention and empirical support in recent years from a variety of research domains including [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[social psychology]].

==Perception-action coupling==
The idea of a continuity between the different aspects of motor cognition is not new. In fact, this idea can be traced to the work of the American psychologist [[William James]] and more recently, American neurophysiologist and Nobel prize winner [[Roger Sperry]]. Sperry argued that the perception–action cycle is the fundamental logic of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = R.W. | year = 1952 | title = Neurology and the mind-brain problem | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 291–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perception and action processes are functionally intertwined: [[perception]] is a means to action and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is a means to perception. Indeed, the vertebrate brain has evolved for governing motor activity with the basic function to transform sensory patterns into patterns of motor coordination.

More recently, there is growing empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, [[Cognitive model#Behavioral dynamics|cognitive science]], as well as social psychology which demonstrates that perception and action share common computational codes and underlying neural architectures. This evidence has been marshaled in the "[[common coding theory]]" put forward by [[Wolfgang Prinz]] and his colleagues at the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W. | year = 1997 | title = Perception and action planning | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1080/713752551}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate.&lt;ref name="Hommel 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hommel | first1 = B. | last2 = Müsseler | first2 = J. | last3 = Aschersleben | first3 = G. | last4 = Prinz | first4 = W. | title = The Theory of Event Coding (TEC): a framework for perception and action planning. | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 849–78; discussion 878–937 |date=Oct 2001 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.77.9446  | pmid = 12239891 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x01000103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing a [[Motion (physics)|movement]] leaves behind a bidirectional association between the motor pattern it has generated by and the sensory effects that it produces. Such an association can then be used backwards to retrieve a movement by anticipating its effects. These perception/action codes are also accessible during action observation. Other authors suggest a new notion of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic origin of action understanding that utilizes the motor system; motor cognition hypothesis. This states that motor cognition provides both human and nonhuman primates with a direct, prereflexive understanding of biological actions that match their own action catalog.&lt;ref name="Gallese 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gallese | first1 = V. | last2 = Rochat | first2 = M. | last3 = Cossu | first3 = G. | last4 = Sinigaglia | first4 = C. | title = Motor cognition and its role in the phylogeny and ontogeny of action understanding. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–13 |date=Jan 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0014436 | pmid = 19209994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.379.8550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[mirror neurons]] in the ventral premotor and parietal cortices of the macaque monkey that fire both when it carries out a goal-directed action and when it observes the same action performed by another individual provides [[neurophysiological]] evidence for a direct matching between action perception and action production.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Craighero | first2 = L. | title = The mirror-neuron system. | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 169–92 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid = 15217330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such coupling is the ease with which people can engage in [[speech repetition]] when asked to [[speech shadowing|shadow]] words heard in earphones.&lt;ref name="Marslen-Wilson 1973"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Marslen-Wilson | first1 = W. | title = Linguistic structure and speech shadowing at very short latencies. | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5417 | pages = 522–3 |date=Aug 1973 | doi =  10.1038/244522a0| pmid = 4621131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, common neural activation during action observation and execution has been well documented. A variety of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and [[magnetoencephalography]] have demonstrated that a motor resonance mechanism in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices occurs when participants observe or produce goal directed actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grèzes | first1 = J. | last2 = Armony | first2 = J.

==Shared representations between other and self==
The common coding theory also states that perception of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knoblich | first1 = G. | last2 = Flach | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = Predicting the effects of actions: interactions of perception and action | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 467–472 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00387| pmid = 11760133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these representations may be shared between individuals. Indeed, the meaning of a given object, action, or social situation may be common to several people and activate corresponding distributed patterns of neural activity in their respective brains.&lt;ref name="Decety 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Sommerville | first2 = JA. | title = Shared representations between self and other: a social cognitive neuroscience view. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 527–33 |date=Dec 2003 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.004 | pmid = 14643368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an impressive number of behavioral and neurophysiological studies demonstrating that perception and action have a common neuronal coding and that this leads to shared representations between self and others, which can lead to host of phenomena such as [[emotional contagion]], [[empathy]], social facilitation, and understanding others minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blakemore | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Frith | first2 = C.D. | year = 2005 | title = The role of motor contagion in the prediction of action | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.012 | pmid=15707910| citeseerx = 10.1.1.130.2472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor priming==
One consequence of the functional equivalence between perception and action is that watching an action performed by another person facilitates the later reproduction of that action in the observer. For instance, in one study, participants executed arm movements while observing either a robot or another human producing the same or qualitatively different arm movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kilner | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Paulignan | first2 = Y. | last3 = Blakemore | first3 = S.J. | year = 2003 | title = An interference effect of observed biological movement on action | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 522–525 | doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that observing another human make incongruent movements interferes with movement execution but observing a robotic arm making incongruent movements does not.

==Social facilitation==
The fact that the observation of action can prime a similar response in the observer, and that the degree to which the observed action facilitates a similar response in the observer cast some light into the phenomenon called [[social facilitation]], first described by [[Robert Zajonc]], which accounts for the demonstration that the presence of other people can affect individual performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chartrand | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Bargh | first2 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = The chameleon effect: The perception-behavior link and social interaction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 893–910 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.893 | pmid=10402679}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated that watching facial expression of emotions prompts the observer to resonate with the state of another individual, with the observer activating the motor representations and associated autonomic and somatic responses that stem from the observed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatfield | first1 = E. | last2 = Cacioppo | first2 = J.T. | last3 = Rapson | first3 = R.L. | year = 1993 | title = Emotional contagion | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 96–99 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental state understanding==
Humans have a tendency to interpret the actions of others with respect to underlying mental states. One important question is whether the perception-action matching mechanism and its product, shared motor representations, can account (or to what extent it does) for the attribution of mental states to others (often dubbed [[theory of mind]] mechanism). Some authors have suggested that the shared representations network that stems from the perception-action matching mechanism may support mental state attribution via covert (i.e., non conscious) mental simulation.&lt;ref name="Gallese 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gallese | first1 = V. | last2 = Goldman | first2 = A. | title = Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 493–501 |date=Dec 1998 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5 | pmid = 21227300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some other scholars have argued that the mirror system and the theory of mind system are two distinct processes and it’s likely that the former cannot account for mental state understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saxe | first1 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Against simulation: the argument from error | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 174–179 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.01.012 | pmid=15808499| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.3655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decety 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ. | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y. | title = Who caused the pain?

==Cognition and action==
To understand the relationship between cognition and action, Cherie L. Gerstadt, Yoon Joo Hong and Adele Diamond of University of Pennsylvania carried out a ''Stroop like day-night test'' &lt;ref name = "Stroop"&gt;{{Cite journal | editor=C. Brainerd | title = A review of the day–night task: The Stroop paradigm and interference control in young children| volume = 30 | issue = 3| year = 2010 | pages = 257–330 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229710000298 | doi=10.1016/j.dr.2010.07.001 | journal=Developmental Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; on children between the age of 3&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; - 7 years. They tested one hundred and sixty children on a task that requires inhibitory control of action plus learning and remembering two rules. They found that the response latency decreased from 3&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; to 4&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; years. They concluded that the requirement to learn and remember two rules is not in itself sufficient to account for the poor performance of the younger children.&lt;ref name = "Cognition and Action"&gt;{{Cite journal | editor=Gerry T. M Altmann | title = The relationship between cognition and action: performance of children 312–7 years old on a stroop- like day-night test| volume = 53 | issue = 2| year = 1994 | pages = 91–180 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779490068X | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90068-X | journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vygotsky’s Theory of Cognitive Development tells us that children are more likely to be cognitively advanced if they are more physically active. This is because playing and physical activity allows children to branch out into new situations and helps them learn strategies for learning new information&lt;ref name="Simply Psychology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Lev Vygotsky|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|website=Simply Psychology|publisher=Simply Psychology|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyun | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Luck | first2 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.3758/bf03194043}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;"Moreau, D. (2012). The role of motor processes in three-dimensional mental rotation: Shaping cognitive processing via sensorimotor experience. ''Learning and Individual Differences'', 22(3), 354-359"&lt;/ref&gt; A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | year = 2013a | title = Constraining movement alters the recruitment of motor processes in mental rotation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 224 | issue = 3| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3324-0| pmid = 23138523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | last2 = Clerc | first2 = J. | last3 = Mansy-Dannay | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerrien | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Enhancing spatial ability through sport practice: Evidence for an effect of motor training on mental rotation performance | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Differences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 83–88 | doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | year = 2013b | title = Motor expertise modulates movement processing in working memory | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 356–361 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.01.011| pmid = 23422289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mirror neurons==
Recent discoveries in the field of [[social neuroscience]] have heavily implicated [[mirror neuron]]s and their related systems as a possible neurological basis for [[social cognition]] specifically factors which involve motor cognition. In chimpanzees (the closest living relative to humans) mirror neuron systems have been shown to be highly active when the ape is observing another individual (ape or human) perform a physical action such as grasping, holding, or hitting.&lt;ref name="Marco"&gt;{{Cite journal

A study by Spunt and Liberman (2013) used an fMRI study to observe mirror neurons in the brain. Participants observed a video of an action being performed under a high or low cognitive load. While watching, they were instructed to observe for why the action was being performed, what action was being performed, or how the action was being performed. The end result provided direct evidence for activation and more importantly automaticity of the mirror neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex and anterior Intraparietal sulcus.&lt;ref name="Spunt 80–86"/&gt;

Although there are large amounts of supporting evidence which indicate mirror neurons activate in situations where one is analyzing oneself to the actions of others,&lt;ref name="Sinigaglia 3–29"/&gt; there is still debate as to whether these activations should be interpreted as intentional understanding. Shannon Spaulding (2013) argues that the neuroscientists who offer up mirror neurons as a physiological answer to social cognition are misinterpreting their results and not using the correct philosophical definitions of goal and intention. Rather than being interchangeable or one leading to the other, she argues they need to be thought of two separate actions.&lt;ref name="Spaulding 233–257"/&gt;

The discovery of the link between mirror neurons and social cognition provides further links to a neurological basis found in other social phenomena such as [[social learning theory]], [[empathy]], and [[observational learning]].&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">The '''NESTOR Project''' (Neutrino Extended Submarine Telescope with Oceanographic Research Project) is an international scientific collaboration whose target is the deployment of a neutrino telescope on the sea floor off [[Pylos, Greece]]. 

==Neutrino==
{{Main|Neutrino}}
[[Neutrinos]] are elementary particles first detected in the 1950s, long after their theoretical prediction by theorist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Neutrinos (or anti-neutrinos) are created during certain [[nuclear reactions]], where [[proton]]s are transformed into [[neutron]]s and vice versa. Neutrinos do not interact with matter via either the [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]], the strong nuclear, or [[gravity|gravitational]] forces, since they are electrically neutral leptons and their [[rest mass]] is very small. They interact with the [[nucleon]]s (neutrons and protons) only via [[weak nuclear interactions]]. Since they do not interact with matter via the electromagnetic or gravitational forces, it is extremely difficult to detect them. Since their mass is very small (less than 14 [[Electronvolt|eV]]) they travel with speeds that are very close to the speed of light in [[vacuum]].

==NESTOR Telescope==
{{Main|Neutrino detector}}

Because neutrinos are very weakly interacting, neutrino detectors must be very large in order to detect a significant number of neutrinos. After completion, NESTOR will consist of a large number of glass balls (the "eyes") containing  [[photomultiplier]] tubes.
The "eyes" are connected with star shaped [[titanium]] frames. Many frames compose a NESTOR tower. The whole construction is placed at the bottom of the  sea to reduce noise from  [[cosmic radiation]] (depth 4000m).
The detectors are connected with the terminal station through a 31&amp;nbsp;km long deep sea, [[optic fiber]] cable for data collection. &lt;!--Thus far one frame has been deployed, and the program is active.--&gt;

[[Pylos, Greece|Pylos]] was selected for the installation of the telescope for several reasons. It combines deep water with close proximity to the shore, a convenient combination for the installation of the NESTOR towers and the communication
and power supply cables. It is also located in an anti-diametric  point  with respect to the
[[Project DUMAND|DUMAND]] neutrino telescope in the [[Pacific]] ocean and therefore, it is possible to compare 
observations and study correlations between the observed neutrino.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''net reproduction rate''' ('''NRR''') is the average number of daughters that would be born to a female (or a group of females) if she passed through her lifetime conforming to the age-specific fertility and mortality rates of a given year. This rate is similar to the [[gross reproduction rate]] but takes into account that some females will die before completing their childbearing years. An NRR of '''one''' means that each generation of mothers is having exactly enough daughters to replace themselves in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetwire.org/details/62] Retrieved on August 28, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224163842/http://www.planetwire.org/details/62 |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dharmalingham|first=A.|title=The Methods and Materials of Demography|editor=David Swanson |editor2=Jacob S.

Shryock|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|date=2004|edition=2|page=819|chapter=Reproductivity|isbn=0-12-641955-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the NRR is less than one, the reproductive performance of the population is below replacement level.

The NRR is particularly relevant where sex ratios at birth are significantly affected by the use of reproductive technologies, or where life expectancy is low.

'''Ninon Hesse''' (née Ausländer, born 18 September 1895 in [[Czernowitz]], died 22 September 1966 in [[Montagnola]]) was an [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Hermann Hesse]]'s third wife.

Ninon Ausländer was born to a Jewish lawyer in Czernowitz and studied [[archaeology]], art history and [[medicine]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. In 1918, she married [[Caricature|caricaturist]] B. F. Dolbin, whom she left in 1920; the official [[divorce]] only took place in 1931.

Although she had written a letter to Hesse after reading his [[novel]] ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'' in 1910, she only met him in 1922. The two lived together from 1927 and got married in 1931.

Ninon Hesse played an important role in Hermann Hesse's life not only as the love of his life, but also as she helped him to continue with his work when his eyes got weak by reading to him and writing for him and by collecting and editing his writings and letters after his death in 1962.

The '''Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands''' ([[PLOCAN]]) is a [http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.26172fcf4eb029fa6ec7da6901432ea0/?vgnextoid=05cf097c526b4410VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD&amp;lang_choosen=en singular scientific and technological infrastructure] built in order to create a new network of production in the marine and maritime sector that is in harmony with the strategy for blue growth{{clarify|date=October 2017}} that has been established within the European Union. It has been partially co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the ERDF Operational Programme for the Canary Islands 2007-2013 within Axis 1 “Development of the Knowledge Economy”, priority theme 02, with a co-financing rate of 85%. [[PLOCAN]] is financed and managed by a consortium comprising 50% contributions from the Government of the [[Canary Islands]] and from the Spanish National Government (Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities).

==History==

The project was approved in 2007 as a node part of the [http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.26172fcf4eb029fa6ec7da6901432ea0/?vgnextoid=05cf097c526b4410VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD&amp;lang_choosen=en Singular Scientific and Technological Infrastructures (ICTS)] within the framework of the [[Ingenio 2010 Program]].&lt;ref name=ingenio2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingenio2010.es/ |title=Programa Ingenio 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2011 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation was officially published in the [[Spanish Official Journal]] on 5 April 2008.&lt;ref name="boe20080405"/&gt;

==Infrastructures==

[[PLOCAN]] offers land-based and sea-based novel infrastructures to promote long-term observation and sustainability of the ocean, providing a cost-effective combination of services, such as observatories, a test site, a base for marine vehicles, training and an innovation hub. PLOCAN is able to provide access and multidisciplinary logistic support through its onshore facility and two marine test sites (Taliarte harbor and offshore). The facility and test sites are located in the NE coast of Gran Canaria Island, and the platform is integrated in the offshore test site.

===The platform===

The main aim of the [[PLOCAN]] consortium is the construction and operation of a fixed offshore platform that will underpin national research and technological development capacities at the cutting-edge of knowledge and within the framework of international competitiveness. The platform will be located both close to the coast and near the edge of the continental shelf, in shallow waters (30 meters depth). It has a net surface of around 2,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of research capacity, space for laboratories, instrumented containers and capacity to accommodate researchers distributed in a multi-story building with a main dock of 1,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Onshore facility===

The onshore testing facility has dedicated 400 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equipped workshops for electronics and mechanical integration, repairs, storage and logistics, including a wet-lab with a testing pool with target seawater. A dedicated control room for piloting and related issues is also available.

===Marine test sites (harbor and offshore)===

The harbor testing facility is located very close to the onshore facility (just a few meters with a direct view between both) and has clear and calm waters with maximum depths of 8 m. It is an optimal place for the early sea trials.

The [[PLOCAN]] offshore test site area is 23&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, located  3 nautical miles from the harbour testing area and also quite near to the major harbor of Gran Canaria Island (Las Palmas/ Port). The area offers progressive depths from shore up to 600 m (deeper upon request) dedicated to study the behaviour and efficiency of different types of maritime devices and technologies and contributing to speed up the process of their introduction into the market. The marine area of [[PLOCAN]] test site was comprehensively studied with a view of offering an optimal space in terms of logistics, supported infrastructures and grid connection. In addition, the area has excellent environmental conditions facilitating 9 to 12 months of operational window and optimal wind and wave energy resources for testing/demonstration operations, which range from 300-400 W/m2 for wind power density and from 4 to 8 Kw/m of wave power.

===Electrical and Communications Grid Infrastructure (IECOM)===

The evacuation of the electricity produced during experimental assays in PLOCAN Marine Test Site is done through its Electrical and Communication grid Infrastructure (IECOM). The IECOM will be operational in 2017 and it will be composed of 2 main modules, each with 5 MW of electricity evacuation capacity. Module 1 will be dedicated to [[Wave power|wave energy]] converter demonstrators, with 5 positions of 1 MW each. Module 2 will be dedicated to [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind]] technologies with one position of 5 MW. Regular sea-operations are covered by PLOCAN’s own boats as part of the main equipment available.

===Fleet of unmanned marine vehicles===

A fleet of unmanned marine vehicles for survey and work applications up to 1,000 m and moored buoys suited with meteorological and oceanographic sensors are available in order to cover real-time monitoring needs in the area.

== Projects ==
[[PLOCAN]] is involved in European and national R&amp;D&amp;I projects with the objective of enabling research and scientific and technological development of maritime and marine sciences. Finished and ongoing projects can be consulted in a [http://plocan.eu/index.php/en/projects specific section of the PLOCAN webpage].

{{Islamic culture}}

An '''oriental rug''' is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in “[[Orient|Oriental countries]]” for home use, local sale, and export.

Oriental carpets can be [[knotted-pile carpet|pile]] woven or [[Kilim|flat woven]] without pile, using various materials such as silk, wool, and cotton. Examples range in size from pillow to large, room-sized carpets, and include carrier bags, floor coverings, decorations for animals, Islamic [[prayer rug]]s (''sajjadah''), Jewish Torah ark covers (''[[parochet]]''), and Christian altar covers. Since the [[High Middle Ages]], oriental rugs have been an integral part of their cultures of origin, as well as of the European and, later on, the North American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|pages=9–10|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, oriental rugs are made in an area referred to as the “Rug Belt”, which stretches from Morocco across North Africa, the Middle East, and into Central Asia and northern India. It includes countries such as northern [[China]], [[Tibet]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], the [[Maghreb]] in the west, the [[Caucasus]] in the north, and [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in the south. People from different cultures, countries, racial groups and religious faiths are involved in the production of oriental rugs. Since many of these countries lie in an area which today is referred to as the [[Islamic world]], oriental rugs are often also called “'''Islamic Carpets'''”,&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term “oriental rug” is used mainly for convenience. The carpets from Iran are known as “'''[[Persian Carpets]]'''”.&lt;ref name="Savory, R."&gt;Savory, R., ''Carpets'',([[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]); accessed January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origin of the knotted pile rug ==
[[File:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|Border of the [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]], circa 400 BC.]]
The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory about the origin of the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of [[felt]], or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emery|first1=Irene|title=The primary structures of fabrics : an illustrated classification|date=2009|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0500288023|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces [[Soumak rug|soumak]], and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cootner|first1=Cathryn|editor1-last=Cootner|editor1-first=Cathryn|editor1-link=Flat woven textiles|title=Flat-weaves and knotted-pile: An historical and structural overview|date=1981|publisher=Textile Museum|location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A.|isbn=9780874050189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, hand-woven [[pile rug]]s are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wertime|first1=J|title=A new approach to the structural analysis of pile rugs.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=3|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical evidence from ancient sources ===
Probably the oldest existing texts referring to carpets are preserved in [[cuneiform]] writing on [[clay tablet]]s from the royal archives of the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], from the 2nd millennium BC. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for rug is ''mardatu'', and specialist rug weavers referred to as ''kāşiru'' are distinguished from other specialized professions like sack-makers (''sabsu'' or ''sabsinnu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Soden|first1=Wolfram|last2=Schley (transl.)|first2=Donald G.|title=The ancient Orient: an introduction to the study of the ancient Near East|date=1993|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=978-0802801425|page=107|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"To my Lord speak! Your servant Ašqudum (says), I've requested a rug from my lord, and they did not give me (one). [...]" (letter 16 8)
&lt;br&gt;
"To my Lord speak! Your servant Ašqudum (says), About the woman who is staying by herself in the palace of Hişamta—The matter does not meet the eye. It would be good if 5 women who weave carpets&lt;ref&gt;lit.: "''mahrĩşa i-pe-şa''", "to do wool work", the interpretation proposed by [[Benno Landsberger]]&lt;/ref&gt; were staying with her."

&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Palace inventories from the archives of [[Nuzi]], from the 15th/14th century BC, record 20 large and 20 small ''mardatu'' to cover the chairs of [[Idrimi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer-Opificius|first1=Ruth|title=Rekonstruktion des Thrones des Fürsten Idrimi von Alalah = Reconstruction of the throne of Prince Idrimi of Alalah|journal=Ugarit Forschungen|date=1983|volume=15|pages=119–126|url=http://biblio.ebaf.edu/cgi-bin/koha/opac-ISBDdetail.pl?biblionumber=146759|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]] writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a “splendid carpet”. In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X “carpets” are mentioned.

Around 400 BC, the Greek author [[Xenophon]] mentions “carpets” in his book “[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]”:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς" [Xen. anab. VII.3.18]
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''
"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν." [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: ''Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.''|Xenophon, Anabasis, 400 BC&lt;ref&gt;https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%9A%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%82/%CE%96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote in ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets (“polymita”) were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the texts. Already the earliest known written sources refer to carpets as gifts given to, or required from, high-ranking persons.

=== Pazyryk: The first surviving pile rug ===

The oldest known hand knotted rug which is nearly completely preserved, and can, therefore, be fully evaluated in every technical and design aspect is the [[Pazyryk carpet]], dated to the 5th century BC. It was discovered in the late 1940s by the Russian archeologist Sergei Rudenko and his team.&lt;ref name="Frozen Tombs of Siberia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W. (transl.)|title=Frozen Tombs of Siberia|date=1970|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|isbn=978-0460077156|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpet was part of the grave gifts preserved frozen in ice in the [[Scythian]] burial mounds of the [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk area]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] of [[Siberia]]&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum: The Pazyryk Carpet"&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/25.+Archaeological+Artifacts/879870/?lng=de The State Hermitage Museum: The Pazyryk Carpet]. Hermitagemuseum.org. Retrieved on 2012-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The provenience of the Pazyryk carpet is under debate, as many carpet weaving countries claim to be its country of origin.&lt;ref name="The debate on the origin of carpets and rugs"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA357 The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art: The debate on the origin of rugs and carpets]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2015-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The carpet had been dyed with plant and insect dyes from the Mongolian steppes.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.212rugcleaners.com/blog/the-history-of-rugs/]&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever it was produced, its fine weaving in symmetric knots and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.

=== Fragments from Turkestan, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan ===
[[File:Textile fragment from Loulan Xinjiang China.jpg|thumb|Carpet fragment, [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], Xinjiang province, China, dated to 3rd-4th century AD. [[British Museum]], London]]
The explorer [[Mark Aurel Stein]] found flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD in [[Turpan]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref name="Spuhler Carpets Islamic Museum Berlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Die Orientteppiche im Museum für Islamische Kunst Berlin|date=1987|publisher=Klinkhardt and Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0270-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet fragments dated to the third or fourth century BC were excavated from burial mounds at Bashadar in the [[Ongudai|Ongudai District]], [[Altai Republic]], [[Russia]] by S. Rudenko, the discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet. They show a fine weave of about 4650 asymmetrical [[knot density|knots per]] square decimeter&lt;ref name="Rudenko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W.  (transl.)|title=Frozen Tombs of Siberia|date=1970|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|isbn=978-0460077156|pages=302–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dura-Europos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfister|first1=R.|last2=Bellinger|first2=L.|title=The Excavations at Dura-Europos; IV Vol. 2 The Textiles|date=1945|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the At-Tar caves in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="At-Tar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujii|first1=Hideo|last2=Sakamoto|first2=Kazuko|editor1-last=Eiland|editor1-first=M.L.|title=The marked characteristics of carpets unearthed from the At-Tar caves, Iraq|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=35–40|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated to the first centuries AD.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] period. Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets.

=== 13th–14th century: The Konya and Fostat fragments; findings from Tibetan monasteries ===

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the account of his [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travels]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming from Persia, Polo travelled from Sivas to Kayseri. [[Abu'l-Fida]], citing [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] refers to carpet export from Anatolian cities in the lte 13th century: “That's where Turkoman carpets are made, which are exported to all other countries”. He and the Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] mention Aksaray as a major rug weaving center in the early-to-mid-14th century.

Pile woven Turkish carpets were found in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt, and were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] Period (1243–1302). Eight fragments were found in 1905 by F.R. Martin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R. State and Court Print|location=Vienna|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in Konya, four in the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]] in Konya province by R.M. Riefstahl in 1925.&lt;ref name="Beyshehir fragments"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riefstahl|first1=Rudolf Meyer|title=Primitive Rugs of the "Konya" type in the Mosque of Beyshehir|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=December 1931|volume=13|issue=4|pages=177–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; More fragments were found in [[Fustat|Fostat]], today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By their original size (Riefstahl reports a carpet up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=off}} long), the Konya carpets must have been produced in town manufactories, as looms of this size cannot be set up in a nomadic or village home. Where exactly these carpets were woven is unknown. The field patterns of the Konya carpets are mostly geometric, and small in relation to the carpet size. Similar patterns are arranged in diagonal rows: Hexagons with plain, or hooked outlines; squares filled with stars, with interposed kufic-like ornaments; hexagons in diamonds composed of rhomboids, rhomboids filed with stylized flowers and leaves. Their main borders often contain kufic ornaments. The corners are not “resolved”, which means that the border design is cut off, and does not continue around the corners. The colours (blue, red, green, to a lesser extent also white, brown, yellow) are subdued, frequently two shades of the same colour are opposed to each other. Nearly all carpet fragments show different patterns and ornaments.

The Beyşehir carpets are closely related to the Konya carpets in design and colour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the "animal carpets" of the following period, depictings of animals are rarely seen in the Seljuq carpet fragments. Rows of horned quadrupeds placed opposite to each other, or birds beside a tree can be recognized on some fragments. A near-complete carpet of this kind is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]]. It has survived in a Tibetan monastery and was removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]].

The style of the Seljuq carpets finds parallels amongst the architectural decoration of contemporaneous mosques such as those at [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği]], [[Sivas]], and [[Erzurum]], and may be related to Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich = The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are today at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in Konya, and at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]] in Istanbul.

=== Current understanding of the origin of pile-woven carpets ===
Knotted pile woven carpets were likely produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques. The different knot types in carpets from locations as distant from each other like the Pazyryk carpet (symmetric), the East Turkestan and Lop Nur (alternate single-weft knots), the At-Tar (symmetric, asymmetric, asymmetric loop kots), and the Fustat fragments (looped-pile, single, asymmetric knots) suggest that the technique as such may have evolved at different places and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debated whether pile-knotted carpets were initially woven by nomads who tried to imitate animal pelts as tent-floor coverings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they were a product of settled peoples. A number of knives was found in the graves of women of a settled community in southwest [[Turkestan]]. The knives are remarkably similar to those used by Turkmen weavers for trimming the pile of a carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=Jungbronzezeitliche Gräberfelder im Sumbar-Tal, Südwest-Turkmenistan = Early Bronze age cemeteries in the Sumbar valley, East Turkestan|date=1986|publisher=Beck|location=München|isbn=978-3406315398|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/29303067?q&amp;versionId=35641318|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=The manufacture of pile carpets in Bronze Age Central Asia.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient motifs on Turkmen carpets closely resemble the ornaments seen on early pottery from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|title=Decorative designs on prehistoric Turkmenian ceramics.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings suggest that Turkestan may be among the first places we know of where pile-woven carpets were produced, but this does not mean it was the only place.

In the light of ancient sources and archaeological discoveries, it seems highly likely that the pile-woven carpet developed from one of the extra-weft wrapping weaving techniques, and was first woven by settled people. The technique has probably evolved separately at different places and times. During the migrations of nomadic groups from Central Asia, the technique and designs may have spread throughout the area which was to become the “rug belt” in later times. With the emergence of Islam, the westward migration of nomadic groups began to change Near Eastern history. After this period, knotted-pile carpets became an important form of art under the influence of Islam, and where the nomadic tribes spread, and began to be known as “Oriental” or “Islamic” carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U.

== Manufacture ==

An oriental rug is woven by hand on a loom, with warps, wefts, and pile made mainly of natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In representative carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the weaving has finished, the rug is further processed by fastening its borders, clipping the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.

=== Materials ===

Materials used in carpet weaving and the way they are combined vary in different rug weaving areas. Mainly, animal [[wool]] from sheep and goats is used, occasionally also from camels. Yak and horse hair have been used in Far Eastern, but rarely in Middle Eastern rugs. [[Cotton]] is used for the foundation of the rug, but also in the pile. [[Silk]] from [[Bombyx mori|silk worms]] is used for representational rugs.

==== Wool ====

In most oriental rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=32|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, rug wools come mainly from the [[Fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed]] and fat-rumped sheep races, which are distinguished, as their names suggest, by the accumulation of fat in the respective parts of their bodies. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is “skin” wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvages, of [[Baluch rug|Baluchi]] and [[Turkmen rug]]s, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Middle Eastern rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|page=25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cotton ====

[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Silk ====

[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets of the Mamluk, Ottoman, and Safavid courts. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design in [[Turkmen rug]]s, but more expensive carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan in Persia, and Istanbul and Hereke in Turkey, have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillow tapestry. Silk is more often used in rugs of Eastern Turkestan and Northwestern China, but these rugs tend to be more coarsely woven.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}

[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. With the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all the rugs produced in the countries of the rug belt use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===

[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5 |Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Vegetal dyes ====

[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used for oriental rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented in oriental rugs since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s, and later on, in Iran.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyzes, natural dyes used in Turkish carpets include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. In some instances, the analysis of the dye has provided information about the provenience of a rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enez|first1=N.|editor1-last=Eiland jr.|editor1-first=M.L.|title=Dye research on the prayer rugs of the Topkapi Collection|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=191–204|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur (perhaps identical with the ''isparek'' plant), or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=54|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insect reds ====

[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=33–34|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====

With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====

The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a pre-planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tools ===
{{see also|Weaving}}
A variety of tools are needed for the construction of a handmade rug. A [[loom]], a horizontal or upright framework, is needed to mount the vertical [[Warp (weaving)|warps]] into which the pile nodes are knotted. One or more shoots of horizontal [[Warp and woof|wefts]] are woven (“shot”) in after each row of knots in order to further stabilize the fabric.

==== Horizontal looms ====

Nomads usually use a horizontal loom. In its simplest form, two loom beams are fastened, and kept apart by stakes which are driven into the ground. The tension of the warps is maintained by driving wedges between the loom beams and the stakes. If the nomad journey goes on, the stakes are pulled out, and the unfinished rug is rolled up on the beams. The size of the loom beams is limited by the need to be easily transportable, thus, genuine nomad rugs are often small in size. In Persia, loom beams were mostly made of poplar, because poplar is the only tree which is easily available and straight.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=22–28|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closer the warps are spanned, the more dense the rug can be woven. The width of a rug is always determined by the length of the loom beams. Weaving starts at the lower end of the loom, and proceeds towards the upper end.

Traditionally, horizontal looms were used by the
* [[Kurds]], [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Lurs]], [[Beluch]], [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] in Persia,
* [[Beluch]] and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] in Afghanistan and Turkmenistan
* Kurds and nomads ([[Yörük]]) in Anatolia.

==== Vertical looms ====

The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams. While the dimensions of a horizontal loom define the maximum size of the rug which can be woven on it, on a vertical loom longer carpets can be woven, as the completed sections of the rugs can be moved to the back of the loom, or rolled up on a beam, as the weaving proceeds.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released, the finished section of the carpet is pulled around the lower beam and upwards on the back of the loom. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, it is wound up on the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.
The vertical loom enables weaving of larger rug formats. The most simple vertical loom, usually used in villages, has fixed beams. The length of the loom determines the length of the rug. As the weaving proceeds, the weavers' benches must be moved upwards, and fixed again at the new working height. Another type of loom is used in manufactures. The wefts are fixed and spanned on the beams, or, in more advanced types of looms, the wefts are spanned on a roller beam, which allows for any length of carpet to be woven, as the finished part of the carpet is rolled up on the roller beam. Thus, the weavers' benches always remain at the same height.

==== Other tools ====

Few essential tools are needed in carpet weaving: Knives are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, and a pair of scissors for trimming off the ends of the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects from the end of the blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts. When the rug is completed, the pile is often shorn with special knives to obtain an even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=24–25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Warp, weft, pile ===

[[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] and [[Warp and woof|wefts]] form the foundation of the carpet, the pile accounts for the design. Warps, wefts and pile may consist of any of these materials:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! warp

|-
|wool ||wool ||wool ||nomad and village rugs
|-
|cotton ||cotton ||wool ||manufacture rugs

|silk ||silk ||silk ||manufacture rugs

|}

Rugs can be woven with their warp strings held back on different levels, termed sheds. This is done by pulling the wefts of one shed tight, separating the warps on two different levels, which leaves one warp on a lower level. The technical term is “one warp is depressed”. Warps can be depressed slightly, ore more tightly, which will cause a more or less pronounced rippling or “ridging” on the back of the rug. A rug woven with depressed warps is described as “double warped”. Central Iranian city rugs such as Kashan, Isfahan, Qom, and Nain have deeply depressed warps, which make the pile more dense, the rug is heavier than a more loosely woven specimen, and the rug lies more firmly on the floor. Kurdish [[Bidjar rug|Bidjar carpets]] make most pronounced use of warp depression. Often their pile is further compacted by the use of a metal rod which is driven between the warps and hammered down on, which produces a dense and rigid fabric.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L.

=== Knots ===

The pile knots are usually knotted by hand. Most rugs from Anatolia utilize the symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish double knot]]. With this form of knotting, each end of the pile thread is twisted around two warp threads at regular intervals, so that both ends of the knot come up between two warp strings on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The thread is then pulled downwards and cut with a knife.

Most rugs from other provenances use the asymmetric, or [[Persian knot]]. This knot is tied by winding a piece of thread around one warp, and halfway around the next warp, so that both ends of the thread come up at the same side of two adjacent strings of warp on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The pile, i.e., the loose end of the thread, can appear on the left or right side of the warps, thus defining the terms “open to the left” or “open to the right”. Variances in the type of knots are significant, as the type of knot used in a carpet may vary on a regional, or tribal, basis. Whether the knots are open to the left or to the right can be determined by passing one's hands over the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1-85669-132-2|pages=35–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant knot is the so-called jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps. Jufti can be knotted symmetrically or asymmetrically, open to the left or right.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"/&gt;  A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn than traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=366–7|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant of knot is known from early Spanish rugs. The Spanish knot or single-warp knot, is tied around one single warp. Some of the rug fragments excavated by A. Stein in Turfan seem to be woven with a single knot. Single knot weavings are also known from [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts|Coptic]] pile rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0821225486|pages=37–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular knots sometimes occur, and include missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, both symmetric and asymmetric. They are frequently found in Turkmen rugs, and contribute to the dense and regular structure of these rugs.

Diagonal, or offset knotting has knots in successive rows occupy alternate pairs of warps. This feature allows for changes from one half knot to the next, and creates diagonal pattern lines at different angles. It is sometimes found in Kurdish or Turkmen rugs, particularly in Yomuds. It is mostly tied symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The upright pile of oriental rugs usually inclines in one direction, as knots are always pulled downwards before the string of pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling row after row of knots on top of each other. When passing one's hand over a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. [[Prayer rug]]s are often woven “upside down”, as becomes apparent when the direction of the pile is assessed. This has both technical reasons (the weaver can focus on the more complicated niche design first), and practical consequences (the pile bends in the direction of the worshipper's prostration).

==== Knot count ====
{{Main|Knot count}}
[[File:Knoopdichtheid ghom.jpg|thumb|Back side of a [[Qom rug]] with very high knot density]]
The knot count is expressed in knots per square inch (''kpsi'') or per square decimeter. Knot count per square decimeter can be converted to square inch by division by 15.5. Knot counts are best performed on the back of the rug. If the warps are not too deeply depressed, the two loops of one knot will remain visible, and will have to be counted as one knot. If one warp is deeply depressed, only one loop of the knot may be visible, which has to be considered when the knots are counted.

Compared to the kpsi counts, additional structural information is obtained when the horizontal and vertical knots are counted separately. In Turkmen carpets, the ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Considerable technical skill is required to achieve this knot ratio. Rugs which are woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Knot counts bear evidence of the fineness of the weaving, and of the amount of labour needed to complete the rug. However, the artistic and utilitarian value of a rug hardly depends on knot counts, but rather on the execution of the design and the colours. For example, Persian Heriz or some Anatolian carpets may have low knot counts as compared to the extremely fine-woven Qom or Nain rugs, but provide artistic designs, and are resistant to wear.

=== Finishing ===
Once the weaving is finished, the rug is cut from the loom. Additional work has to be done before the rug is ready for use.

==== Edges and ends ====

The edges of a rug need additional protection, as they are exposed to particular mechanical stress. The last warps on each side of the rug are often thicker than the inner warps, or doubled. The edge may consist of only one warp, or of a bundle of warps, and is attached to the rugs by weft shoots looping over it, which is termed an “overcast”. The edges are often further reinforced by encircling it in wool, goat's hair, cotton, or silk in various colours and designs. Edges thus reinforced are called selvedges, or ''shirazeh'' from the Persian word.

The remaining ends of the warp threads form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in some other manner.  Especially Anatolian village and nomadic rugs have flat-woven [[kilim]] ends, made by shooting in wefts without pile at the beginning and end of the weaving process. They provide further protection against wear, and sometimes include pile-woven tribal signs or village crests.

==== Pile ====

The pile of the carpet is shorn with special knives (or carefully burned down) in order to remove excess pile and obtain an equal surface. In parts of Central Asia, a small sickle-shaped knife with the outside edge sharpened is used for pile shearing. Knives of this shape have been excavated from [[Bronze Age]] sites in Turkmenistan (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=31|isbn=978-0821225486|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In some carpets, a relief effect is obtained by clipping the pile unevenly following the contours of the design. This feature is often seen in [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs.

==== Washing ====

Most carpets are washed before they are used or go to the market. The washing may be done with water and soap only, but more often chemicals are added to modify the colours. Various chemical washings were invented in New York, London, and other European centers. The washing often included chlorine bleach or sodium hydrosulfite. Chemical washings not only damage the wool fibers, but change the colours to an extent that some rugs had to be re-painted with different colours after the washing, as is exemplified by the so-called "American Sarouk" carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

== Design ==

Oriental rugs are known for their richly varied designs, but common traditional characteristics identify the design of a carpet as “oriental”.  With the exception of pile relief obtained by clipping the pile unevenly, rug design originates from a two-dimensional arrangement of knots in various colours. Each knot tied into a rug can be regarded as one "[[pixel]]" of a picture, which is composed by the arrangement of knot after knot. The more skilled the weaver or, as in manufactured rugs, the designer, the more elaborate the design.

=== Rectilinear and curvilinear design ===

{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = ''Left image'': Silk Tabriz Persian rug with a predominantly curvilinear design&lt;br&gt; ''Right image'': Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| footer_align = left | image1 =|Silk Tabriz Persian Rug 7991 with a predominantly curvilinear design| width1 = 185 | caption1  = | image2 =Antique Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, 9ft 11in x 12ft 10in, circa 1875,.jpg|Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| width2 = 200 | caption2 = }}

A rug design is described either as '''rectilinear''' (or “geometric”), or '''curvilinear''' (or “floral”). Curvilinear rugs show floral figures in a realistic manner. The drawing is more fluid, and the weaving is often more complicated. Rectilinear patterns tend to be bolder and more angular. Floral patterns can be woven in rectilinear design, but they tend to be more abstract, or more highly stylized. Rectilinear design is associated with nomadic or village weaving, whereas the intricate curvilinear designs require pre-planning, as is done in factories. Workshop rugs are usually woven according to a plan designed by an artist and handed over to the weaver to execute it on the loom.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|page=170|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===

This feature is typical for [[Turkish carpet|rugs made in Anatolia]].]]

Rug design can also be described by how the surface of the rug is arranged and organized. One single, basic design may cover the entire field (“all-over design”). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Islamic rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments in a manner called "infinite repeat".&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common “Lechek Torūnj” (medallion and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In Persian rugs, the medallion represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinated, creating an impression of the medallion “floating” on the field. Anatolian rugs often use the infinite repeat as the primary pattern, and integrate the medallion as secondary. Its size is often adapted to fit into the infinite repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Oriental rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines or reciprocal trefoils. The latter are frequently found in Caucasian and some Turkish rugs, and are related to the Chinese “cloud collar” (yun chien) motif.&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. Seen in Kerman rugs and Turkish rugs from the late eighteenth century "mecidi" period, this feature was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs. Additional end borders called ''elem'', or skirts, are seen in Turkmen and some Turkish rugs. Their design often differs from the rest of the borders. Elem are used to protect the lower borders of tent door rugs ("ensi"). [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs sometimes do not have any borders.

Designing the carpet borders becomes particularly challenging when it comes to the corner articulations. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be “resolved”. In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver has discontinued the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolutions helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===

The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the ''[[Paisley (design)|boteh]]'' is used throughout the “carpet belt”. Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=36–51|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=51–168|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called “fish”.  Herati patterns are used throughout the “carpet belt”; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Sefavi period, and the “claws” of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.
* The '''[[Gül|Gul]]''' design is frequently found in [[Turkmen rug]]s. Small round or octagonal medallions are repeated in rows all over the field. Although the Gül medallion itself can be very elaborate and colourful, their arrangement within the monochrome field often generates a stern and somber impression. Güls are often ascribed a heraldic function, as it is possible to identify the tribal provenience of a Turkmen rug by its güls.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Turkmen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ian|title=Turkmen.

=== Special designs ===
A different type of field design in a specific Islamic design tradition is used in [[prayer rug]]s. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]], an architectural element in [[mosque]]s intended to direct the worshippers towards the [[Qibla]].  Prayer rugs also show highly symbolic smaller design elements like one or more [[mosque lamp]]s, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]], or water jugs, potentially as a reminder towards ritual cleanliness. Sometimes stylized hands or feet appear in the field to indicate where the worshipper should stand, or to represent the praying person's prostration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=127–143|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other special types include garden, compartment, vase, animal, or pictorial designs

=== The 15th century "design revolution" ===

During the 15th century, a fundamental change appeared in carpet design. Because no carpets survived from this period, research has focused on [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. Earlier Timurid paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with “kufic” border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially the “[[Holbein carpet]]s” that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier “kufic” border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. The resulting change in carpet design was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''“carpet design revolution”'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr.

== Intra- and intercultural contexts ==
[[File:TownVillageNomads.jpg|thumb|Cultural interactions in traditional carpet production]]

Four "social layers" of carpet production can be distinguished: Rugs were woven simultaneously by and for nomads, rural villages, towns, and the royal court. Rural village, and nomad carpet designs represent independent artistic traditions.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Elaborate rug designs from court and town were integrated into village and nomadic design traditions by means of a process termed stylization.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; When rugs are woven for the market, the weavers adapt their production in order to meet the customers' demands, and to maximize their profit. As is the case with Oriental rugs, adaptation to the export market has brought forth both devastating effects on the culture of rug weaving, but has also led to a revival of old traditions in more recent years.

=== Representative ("court") carpets ===
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature by Mir Sayyid Ali, circa 1540. [[British Museum]], London]]

Representative "court" rugs were woven by special workshops, often founded and supervised by the sovereign, with the intention to represent power and status:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=273–275|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman (Byzantine)]] and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] Empires have coexisted for more than 400 years. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabularies, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Masterpieces Islamic Art, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekthiar|first1=MD|last2=Soucek|first2=PP|last3=Canby|first3=SR|last4=Haidar|first4=NN|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-434-7|pages=20–24|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Anatolian carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|“Paele Madonna”]] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs were produced in the court manufactures as special commissions or gifts (some carpets included inwoven European coats of arms). Their elaborate design required a division of work between an artist who created a design plan (termed “cartoon”) on paper, and a weaver who was given the plan for execution on the loom. Thus, artist and weaver were separated.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"/&gt; Their appearance in Persian book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniatures]] as well as in European paintings provides material for their dating by using the [[Terminus post quem|''“terminus ante quem”'']] approach.

=== Town, village, nomadic rugs ===

High-status examples like Safavid or Ottoman court carpets are not the only foundation of the historical and social framework. The reality of carpet production does not reflect this selection: Carpets were simultaneously produced by and for the three different social levels. Patterns and ornaments from court manufactory rugs have been reproduced by smaller (town or village) workshops. This process is well documented for Ottoman prayer rugs.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; As prototypical court designs were passed on to smaller workshops, and from one generation to the next, the design underwent a process termed stylization, comprising series of small, incremental changes either in the overall design, or in details of smaller patterns and ornaments, over time. As a result, the prototype may be modified to an extent as to barely being recognizable. A mihrab column may change into a detached row of ornaments, a Chinese dragon may undergo stylization until it becomes unrecognizable in a Caucasian dragon carpet.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

Pile rugs and flat weaves were essential items in all rural households and nomadic tents. They were part of a tradition that was at times influenced, but essentially distinct from the invented designs of the workshop production. Frequently, mosques had acquired rural carpets as [[Waqf|charitable gifts]], which provided material for studies.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, Vakiflar Museum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpinar|first1=Belkis|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U.

With the end of the traditional [[Transhumance|nomadic lifestyle]] in large parts of the rug belt area, and the consequent loss of specific traditions, it has become difficult to identify a genuine “nomadic rug”. Tribes known for their nomadic lifestyle like the [[Yürük]] in Anatolia, or the [[Kurds]] and [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] in contemporary Turkey and Southwestern Iran have voluntarily or by force acquired sedentary lifestyles. Migration of peoples and tribes, in peace or warfare, has frequently happened throughout the history of [[Turkic peoples]], as well as Persian and Caucasian tribes. Some designs may have been preserved, which can be identified as specifically nomadic or tribal.&lt;ref name="Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Housego|first1=Jenny|title=Tribal Rugs|date=1998|publisher=Olive Branch Press|location=London|isbn=9781566562188|edition=1998 reissue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Black Oriental Carpets"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=David|last2=Loveless|first2=Clive|title=Woven Gardens: Nomad and Village Rugs of the Fars Province of Southern Persia|date=1979|publisher=David Black Oriental Carpets|location=London|isbn=9780950501833|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mackie|editor1-first=Louise|editor2-last=Thompson|editor2-first=Jon|title=Turkmen: Tribal Carpets and Traditions|date=1980|publisher=The Textile Museum|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=9780295965956|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Nomadic” rugs can be identified by their material, construction, and colours.

Criteria for nomadic production include:&lt;ref name="Brueggemann/Boehmer, 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann, W., and Boehmer, H.|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unusual materials like warps made of goat's hair, or camel wool in the pile;
* high quality wool with long pile (Anatolian and Turkmen nomads);
* small format fitting for a horizontal loom;
* irregular format due to frequent re-assembly of the loom, resulting in irregular tension of the warps;
* pronounced abrash (irregularities within the same colour due to dyeing of yarn in small batches);
* inclusion of flat weaves at the ends.

Within the genre of carpet weaving, the most authentic village and nomadic products were those woven to serve the needs of the community, which were not intended for export or trade other than local. This includes specialized bags and bolster covers (''yastik'') in Anatolia, which show designs adapted from the earliest weaving traditions.&lt;ref name="Steiner, Heybe ve Torba"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Pinkwart|first2=Doris|last3=Ammermann|first3=Eberhart|title=Bergama Heybe ve Torba: Traditional bags of the Yürüks in Northwest Anatolia, Observations from 1970 to 2007 / Traditionelle Taschen der Yürüken Nordwest-Anatoliens.

Smaller (''torba'') and midsize (''mafrash'') and a variety of special bags to keep bread or salt were woven. They are usually made of two sides, one or both of them pile or flat-woven, and then sewn together. Long tent bands woven in mixed pile and flat weave adorned the tents, and carpets known as ''ensi'' covered the entrance of the tent, while the door was decorated with a pile-woven door surround. Turkmen, and also tribes like the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] nomads of western Iran, or the [[Qashqai people]] wove animal trappings like saddle covers, or special decorations for weddings like ''asmalyk'', pentagonally shaped camel coverings used for wedding decorations. Tribal signs like the Turkmen [[Gül]] can support the assessment of provenience.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

=== Symbolism and the origin of patterns ===

{{Quotation|The symbolism of Oriental rug designs has recently been made the subject of a number of articles. Many of the ideas put forward are of great interest, but to attempt to discuss such a subject without a profound knowledge of the philosophies of the East would be unwise, and could easily provide unreliable food for unbridled imaginations. One may believe implicitly in certain things, but especially if they have an ancient religious basis, it may not always be possible to prove them. Such ideas merit attention.|May H. Beattie, ''Carpets of central Persia'', 1976, p. 19}}

Oriental rugs from various proveniences often share common motifs. Various attempts have been made to determine the potential origin of these ornaments. Woven motifs of folk art undergo changes through processes depending on human creativity, trial and error, and unpredictable mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vavilov's theory of origins|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1994|volume=14|issue=6|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also through the more active process of stylization. The latter process is well documented, as the integration into the work of rural village and nomad weavers of patterns designed in town manufactures can be followed on carpets which still exist. In the more archaic motifs, the process of pattern migration and evolution cannot be documented, because the material evidence does not exist any more. This has led to various speculations about the origins and “meanings” of patterns, often resulting in unsubstantiated claims.

==== Prehistoric symbolism ====

In 1967, the British archaeologist James Mellaart claimed to have found the oldest records of flat woven [[kilim]]s on wall paintings he discovered in the [[Çatalhöyük]] excavations, dated to circa 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=R. H.|title=Catal Huyuk. A Neolithic Town in Anatolia. James Mellaart. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967. 232 pp., illus. $9.95|journal=Science|date=22 September 1967|volume=157|issue=3795|pages=1419–1420|doi=10.1126/science.157.3795.1419}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The drawings Mellaart claimed to have made before the wall paintings disappeared after their exposure showed clear similarities to nineteenth century designs of Turkish flatweaves. He interpreted the forms, which evoked a female figure, as evidence of a Mother Goddess cult in Çatalhöyük. A well-known pattern in Anatolian kilims, sometimes referred to as ''[[Elibelinde]]'' (lit.: “hands on hips”), was therefore determined to depict the Mother Goddess herself. This theory had to be abandoned after Mellaarts claims were denounced as fraudulent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlamallett.com/ch.htm Oriental Rug Review, August/September 1990 (Vol. 10, No. 6)]&lt;/ref&gt; and his claims refuted by other archaeologists. The elibelinde motif lost its divine meaning and prehistoric origin. It is today understood as a design of stylized carnation flowers, and its development can be traced back in a detailed and unbroken line to Ottoman court carpets of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Apotropaic symbols ====

[[File:Amulet Kilim Motif.jpg|thumb|[[Amulet]] (Muska) [[kilim motifs|kilim motif]], for protection (3 examples)]]

Symbols of protection against evil are frequently found on Ottoman and later Anatolian carpets. The Turkish name for these symbols is ''nazarlık'' (lit.: "[protection from] the evil eye"). [[Apotropaic magic|Apotropaic]] symbols include the [[Cintamani]] motif, often depicted on white ground [[Ushak carpet|Selendi]] carpets, which consists of three balls and a pair of wavy stripes. It serves the same purpose as protective inscriptions like "May God protect", which are seen woven into rugs. Another protective [[Kilim motifs|symbol often woven into carpets]] is the triangular talisman pendant, or "''muska''". This symbol is found in Anatolian, Persian, Caucasian and Central Asian carpets.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Tribal symbols ====
Some carpets include symbols which serve as a tribal crest and sometimes allow for the identification of the weaver's tribe. This is especially true for Turkmen pile woven textiles, which depict a variety of different medallion-like polygonal patterns called [[Gul (design)|Gul]], arranged in rows all over the field. While the origin of the pattern can be traced back to Buddhist depictions of the lotus blossom,&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"/&gt; it remains questionable if the weaver of such a tribal symbol was aware of its origins.

==== "Kufic" borders ====

Early Anatolian carpets often show a geometric border design with two arrowhead-like extensions in a sequence of tall-short-tall. By its similarity to the [[kufic]] letters of alif and lām, borders with this ornament are called "kufic" borders. The letters are thought to represent the word “[[Allah]]”. Another theory relates the tall-short-tall ornament to split-palmette motifs. The "alif-lām" motif is already seen on early Anatolian carpets from the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]].&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

==== Symbolism of the prayer rug ====
[[File:Shirvan 01.jpg|thumb|Shirvan Prayer rug with a rectangular niche, depicting inwoven hands and an ornament representing the mosque lamp]]

The symbolism of the Islamic [[Prayer rug]] is more easily understandable. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]] in every mosque, a directional point to direct the [[worship]]per towards [[Mecca]]. Often one or more [[mosque lamp]]s hang from the point of the arch, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]]. Sometimes a comb and pitcher are depicted, which is a reminder for Muslims to wash their hands and for men to comb their hair before performing prayer. Stylized hands are woven in the rug pile, indicating where the hands should be placed when performing prayer, often also interpreted as the [[Hamsa]], or “Hand of Fatima”, a protective amulet against the [[evil eye]].

=== Cultural effects of commercialization ===

Since the beginning of the Oriental rug trade in the High Middle Ages, Western market demand has influenced the rug manufacturers producing for export, who had to adapt their production in order to accommodate Western market demands. The commercial success of oriental rugs, and the [[Mercantilism|mercantilistic]] thinking which arose during the sixteenth century, led European sovereigns to initiate and promote carpet manufactories in their European home countries. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Western companies set up weaving facilities in the rug-producing countries, and commissioned designs specifically invented according to Western taste.

Rugs exist which are known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the technique and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In [[Swedish carpets and rugs|Sweden]], flat and pile woven rugs (called “''[[Rya (rug)|rya]]''”, or “''rollakan''”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, [[Axminster Carpets|Axminster carpets]] were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the [[Savonnerie manufactory]] began weaving pile carpets by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “''mecidi''”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company [[Ziegler &amp; Co.]] maintained workshops in [[Tabriz]] and [[Arak, Iran|Sultanabad]] (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as [[Liberty &amp; Company]] and [[Harvey Nichols]]. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansel|first1=Antony Wynn ; with a foreword by Philip|title=Three camels to Smyrna: times of war and peace in Turkey, Persia, India, Afghanistan &amp; Nepal, 1907-1986 : the story of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Company|date=2008|publisher=Hali|location=London|isbn=9781898113676}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, the Western invention of synthetic [[dye]]s had a devastating effect on the traditional way of carpet production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bode|first1=Wilhelm von|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche aus alter Zeit|date=1902|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|page=158 ff|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neugebauer, R |author2=Orendi, J|title=Handbuch der Orientalischen Teppichkunde|date=1920|publisher=Karl W. Hiersemann|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3-86444-955-0|pages=81–82|edition=Reprint 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early twentieth century, carpets were woven in the cities of [[Saruq, Markazi|Saruk]] and [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], Iran and the surrounding villages mainly for export to the U.S. While the sturdy construction of their pile appealed to U.S. American customers, their designs and colours did not fit in with the demands. The traditional design of the Saruk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=141–142|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its home countries, the ancient art and craft of carpet weaving has been revived. Since the early 1980s, initiatives were ongoing like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative|DOBAG project]] in Turkey, in Iran,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and by various social projects in Afghanistan and amongst Tibetan refugees in Northern India. Naturally dyed, traditionally woven rugs are available on the Western market again.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique carpets sold at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

=== Forgery ===
Oriental rugs have always attracted collectors' interest, and sold at high prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/persian-rug-carpet-sells-world-record-price-475630 |title=Persian Rug Sells For World Record $33.7m |publisher=International Business Times |first=Hannah |last=Osborne |work=ibtimes.co.uk |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been an incentive for fraudulent behaviour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Techniques used traditionally in rug restoration, like replacing knots, or re-weaving parts of a rug, can also be used to modify a rug so as to appear older or more valuable than it actually is. Old flatweaves can be unravelled to obtain longer threads of yarn which can then be re-knitted into rugs. These forgeries are able to overcome [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] dye analysis and [[radiocarbon dating]], since they make use of period material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hebborn|first1=Eric|title=The Art Forger's Handbook|date=1997|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0304349143|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Romanian artisan Teodor Tuduc has become famous for his fake oriental rugs, and the stories which he delivered in order to gain credibility. The quality of his forgeries was such that some of his rugs found their way into museum collections, and “Tuduc rugs” have themselves become collectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Handbook of Fakes by Tuduc (world's most famous rug forger), published on the occasion of the Volkmann-Treffen Symposium, Berlin, October, 2012|date=2012|publisher=Stefano Ionescu|location=Rome|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugs by regions ==
Oriental rugs can be classified by their region of origin, each of which represents different strands of tradition: [[Persian rug]]s, [[Pakistani rug]]s, [[Arabian carpet|Arabian rug]]s, [[Turkish carpet|Anatolian rug]]s, [[Kurdish rug]]s, [[Caucasian carpets and rugs|Caucasian rugs]], Central Asian rugs, [[Turkish rug|Turkestanian (Turkmen, Turkoman) rugs]], [[Chinese rug]]s, [[Tibetan rug]]s and Indian rugs.

=== Persian (Iranian) rugs ===

{{main article|Persian carpet}}
The Persian carpet or Persian rug is an essential and distinguished part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Persian art|art]], and dates back to [[Persian Empire|ancient Persia]].
Persian carpets are classified by the social setting in which they were woven (nomads, villages, town and court manufactories), by ethnic groups (e.g. [[Kurds]], nomadic tribes such as the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] or [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]]; [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmens]]) and others, or by the town or province where carpets are woven, such as [[Heriz]], [[Hamadan]], [[Senneh]], [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] (Sultanabad), [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Kashan]], [[Qom]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]], and others. A technical classification for Persian carpets is based on material used for warps, wefts, and pile, spinning and plying of the yarn, dyeing, weaving technique, and aspects of finishing including the ways how the sides (selvedges) and ends are reinforced against wear.

=== Anatolian (Turkish) rugs ===
{{main article|Turkish carpet}}
Turkish carpets are produced mainly in [[Anatolia]], including neighbouring areas. Carpet weaving is a traditional art in Anatolia, dating back to pre-Islamic times, and integrates different cultural traditions reflecting the history of [[Turkic peoples]]. Turkish carpets form an essential part of the Turkish culture.

Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is distinguished by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]], or symmetrical knot. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets date from the thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, as well as in villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. Pile woven as well as flat woven carpets ([[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.
Following a decline which began in the second half of the nineteenth century, initiatives like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative]] in 1982, or the [[Turkish Cultural Foundation]] in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.&lt;ref name="TCF Natural Dyes Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Cultural Foundation|url=http://www.tcfdatu.org/en/home/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish carpet is distinct from carpets of other provenience in that it makes more pronounced use of primary colours. Western Anatolian carpets prefer red and blue colours, whereas Central Anatolian use more red and yellow, with sharp contrasts set in white. With the exceptions of representative court and town manufacture designs, Turkish carpets make more pronounced use of bold geometric, and highly stylized floral patterns, generally in rectilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMullan|first1=Joseph V.|title=Islamic Carpets|date=1965|publisher=Near Eastern Art Research Center|location=New York|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian Mamluk rugs ===
[[File:The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet.jpg|thumb|The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet]]

Under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], a distinctive carpet was produced in Egypt. Called "Damascene" carpets by previous centuries, there is no doubt now that the center of production was [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

European and Islamic Sources from the 15.-18. Century|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to nearly all other oriental rugs, Mamluk carpets used “S” (clockwise) spun and “Z” (anti-clockwise)-plied wool. Their palette of colours and shades is limited to bright red, pale blue, and light green, blue and yellow are rarely found. The field design is characterized by polygonal medallions and stars and stylized floral patterns, arranged in a linear way along their central axis, or centralized. The borders contain rosettes, often alternating with cartouches. As [[Edmund de Unger]] pointed out, the design is similar to other products of Mamluk manufacture, like wood- and metal work, and book bindings, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] and floor mosaics.&lt;ref name="de Unger, Mamluk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Unger|first1=Edmund|title=The Origin of the Mamluk Carpet Design|journal=Hali|date=1980|volume=2|issue=4|pages=321–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamluk carpets were made for the court, and for export, Venice being the most important market place for Mamluk rugs in Europe.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

After the 1517 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. The Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt, and probably also in Anatolia, into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caucasian rugs ===
{{main article|Caucasian carpets and rugs}}

[[File:Azeri carpet-maker.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani woman makes a carpet. Early 20th century]]
The Caucasian provinces of [[Karabagh]], Moghan, [[Shirvan]], [[Daghestan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] formed the northern territories of the [[Safavid Empire]]. In the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)]] and the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], 1813, the provinces were finally ceded to Russia. Russian rule was further extended to [[Baku]], [[Genje]], the [[Derbent]] khanate, and the region of [[Talish]]. In the 19th century the main weaving zone of the Caucasus was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, in a region which today comprises [[Azerbaijan]]. In 1990, Richard E. Wright claimed that ethnicities other than the [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri population]] "also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Carpets xv.

With regard to antique carpets and rugs, the weavers' identity or ethnicity remains unknown. Eiland &amp; Eiland stated in 1998 that "it should not be taken for granted that the majority population in a particular area was also responsible for the weaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eiland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eiland|first2=Murray|title=Oriental rugs : a complete guide|date=2008|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|isbn=9781856691321|page=263|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a variety of theories about the ethnic origin of carpet patterns, and a variety of classifications have been put forward, sometimes attributing one and the same carpet to different ethnic groups. The debate is still ongoing, and remains unresolved.

In 1728 the Polish Jesuit Thaddaeus Krusinski wrote that at the beginning of the seventeenth century Shah [[Abbas I of Persia]] had established carpet manufactories in Shirvan and Karabagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tadeusz Jan Krusiński |first1=T.

Characteristic motifs include stylized Chinese dragons in the so-called '''“Dragon carpets”''', combat scenes of tigers and stags, or floral motifs. The style is highly abstract to an extent that the animal forms become unrecognizable, unless compared to earlier Safavid animals and 16th century "vase style" carpets depicting the same motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Bode |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Kühnel |first2=Ernst |title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra.

A precise classification of Caucasian rugs is particularly difficult, even compared to other types of oriental rugs. Virtually no information is available from before the end of the nineteenth century, when Caucasian rugs began to be exported in larger numbers. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] socialistic economy, carpet production was organized in industrial lines in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Daghestan and Georgia, which used standardized designs based on traditional motifs, provided on scalepaper cartoons by specialized artists.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In 1927, the Azerbaijani Carpet Association was founded as a division of the Azerbaijani Art Association. At their factories, wool and cotton were processed and handed out to the weavers, who had to join the association.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zollinger|first1=Werner|last2=Kerimov|first2=Latif|last3=Azadi|first3=Siawosh U.|title=Azerbaijani-Caucasian rugs|date=2001|publisher=Ulmke Collection|location=Switzerland|isbn=978-3925813108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azerbaijani scholar [[Latif Karimov]] wrote&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; that between 1961 and 1963, a technical college devoted to teaching carpet weaving was built, in 1961, the National Azerbaijan M.A. Aliev Institute of Art opened a department headed by Karimov, which specialized on the training of carpet designers.

Detailed ethnographic information is available from the works of ethnologists like [[Vsevolod Miller]] and Soviet Russian surveys conducted by the [[Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography]] (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Field|first1=H.|title=Contributions to the Anthropology of the Caucasus.|journal=Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology|date=1953|volume=1|issue=48|publisher=Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, during the long period of industrial production, the connection between specific designs and their ethnic and geographic origins may have been lost. Research was published mainly in Russian language, and still is not fully available to non-Russian speaking scientists.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; From a Western perspective, when scientific interest started to develop in Oriental rugs by the end of the nineteenth century, the Caucasian regions, being part of the Soviet Union, closed up to the West. Thus, Western information about carpet weaving in the Caucasian countries was not as detailed as from other regions of the "carpet belt".&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"/&gt;

Different classifications have been proposed, however, many trade names and labels have been kept merely as terms of convenience, and future research may allow for more precise classification.&lt;ref name="Schurmann, Caucasian 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schurmann|first1=Ulrich|title=Caucasian Rugs.|date=1974|publisher=Crosby|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0903580151|edition=3rd impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright, Caucasus 1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Rugs and flatweaves of the Transcaucasus : a commentary|date=1980|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Pittsburgh, Pa.|isbn=978-0960421008|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, archival research from earlier Russian and Soviet sources has been included,&lt;ref name="Wright and Wertime, Caucasian 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wertime|first2=John T.|title=Caucasian carpets &amp; covers : the weaving culture|date=1995|publisher=Hali Publ. in ass. with King|location=London|isbn=978-1856690775}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperations were initiated between Western and Azerbaijani experts.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; They propose the study of flatweaves as the major indigenous folk art of the Caucasus, and worked on more specific and detailed classifications.

==== Classification by Zollinger, Karimov, and Azadi ====

Zollinger, Kerimov and Azadi propose a classification for Caucasian rugs woven from the late 19th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; Essentially, they focus on six provenances:

* '''Kuba''' relates to a district and its town, located between Baku and Derbent, the Samur river constituting its northern, the southern crest of the Caucasus its southern border.Kuba borders the Baku district in the southeast, and the Caspian Sea n the east. Kuba rugs are classified as town rugs, with dense ornamentation, high knot density, and short pile. Warps are made of wool, not dyed and dark ivory. Wefts are of wool, wool and cotton, or cotton. One of two wefts is often deeply depressed. Knots are symmetrical. Plain-woven Soumakh ends of dark wool or light blue cotton are frequent, white cotton soumakhs are rare. The fringes are braided, pleated, or artistically knotted. The selvedges are mainly round (in that case, in dark blue wool) or 0.3–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide and made of light blue wool, reinforced over two ribs by figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The colours are dark and the rugs look hardly polychrome despite the fact that they use 10–12 different colours, because their ornaments are small and arranged densely on the rug. The majority of Kuba rugs have a dark blue background. Red or dark red rarely occur, sometimes ivory, rarely yellow and hardly any green.
* '''Shirvan''' is the name of the town and province, located on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, east of the Kura river, between the southern part of the river and the city of Derbent in the north. Kerimov distinguished six districts, which weave different types of rugs. Some Shirvan rugs come with a high knot density and short pile. More coarsely woven carpets have a higher pile. Symmetrical knots are used, woven with alternate warps depressed. The weft is generally of wool, in dark ivory to brown. The ends are flat-woven, light cotton or wool sumakh. The fringes are sometimes artistically knotted. The selvedges are either round, or 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide, in white cotton, with 2–3 ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. White cotton selvedges are the most common in Shirvan rugs. Shirvan rugs may have town, or village designs, but less densely ornamented as compared to Kuba rugs, and the drawing is more sparse. Compared to Kuba rugs, Shirvan rugs are lighter, and more colourful, with a dark blue background. The borders often have a light background which is more sparsely ornamented compared to the central field. Light ivory, red or yellow rarely occur. Ivory is mainly used for prayer rugs.
* '''Gyanya''' (Genje) is a large city, located ca. {{convert|360|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku.In contrast to the more urban design of Kuba and Shirvan, rugs from other provenances have longer piles. On average, the pile of Gyanya rugs is 6–15&amp;nbsp;mm high. The warp is generally darker, mainly wool, not dyed dark or light brown. Camel hair is said to be used for warps as well. Wefts are commonly dyed light to dark brownish red. Three wefts are often shot in after each row of knots, but warps are not depressed. The upper end is often {{convert|2|-|6|cm|abbr=on}} long brownish-red tapestry weave, turned over and sewn on. The lower end is frequently red woolen tapestry weave, with the warp loops uncut. Selvedges are rarely round, but flat and wide, mainly dark brownish red, and consist of three ribs with figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The second most common shape is similar, but includes only two ribs. Gyanya rugs are more generously and sparsely ornamented, as compared to Kuba and Shirvan weavings. Large square, rectangular, hexagonal and octagonal patterns are set within more open space. Medallions (gul) are often hooked. The colour palette is more restricted than in Kuba and Shirvan rugs, but distributed over larger areas, so that the overall impression is more colourful.
* '''Kazak''' according to Latimov refers to a district and its center town located between the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic towards the northwest into the Republic of Georgia and towards the southwest into the Republic of Armenia. The city of Kasak lies {{convert|460|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku. The warp of Kazak rugs is of sheep wool, not dyed, rather dark ivory, sometimes camel hair is said to be used. The weft is of wool, or a blend of wool and camel hair. Sometimes wool and cotton threads are only slightly plied together to form the warp thread. Wefts are dyed mostly in light red, wefts in dark blue distinguish the Kazak from Karabakh rugs. 2–6 wefts are shot in after each row of knots. The pile is wool, sometimes undyed camel hair, the knots being symmetrical, the warps not depressed. Kazak rugs are woven more coarsely, their pile being 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm high. The upper end is fastened with a 1–4&amp;nbsp;cm wide woolen tapestry weave in red colours. The lower end is often finished like the upper end, but uncut warp loops are often seen protruding from the flat-woven end. Selvedges are nearly always flat nd between 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm wide, consisting of two ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads, these often in different colours. In most cases, two double warps are wrapped three times. Kazak rugs have a limited colour palette of 5–7 colours. In general, the field has a red background, less frequently also ivory, green, blue, or yellow, the colour of the main border often in contrasting colours. The colour of the main borders is often difficult to identify due to the dense ornamentation. Kazak rugs woven before ca. 1910 have more intense and bright colours than rugs woven after this year.
* '''Karabagh''' extends between the rivers Kura and Araz up to the mountains of the small Caucasus. The rugs woven in the different regions of the Karabagh area differ substantially from each other. Rugs from the easternmost parts of the Karabagh area have cotton wefts and light blue cotton or wool selvedges. In some regions (Mokan, Talysh, Lenkoran) the rugs have runner formats, approximately three times as long as wide. Apart from manufacture rugs, Karabagh rugs have a high pile, up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. According to Karimov, some types of rugs like the "Eagle Kazak", Cloud band Kazak, or Kasymushak Kazaks, have actually been woven in Karabagh. Their upper and lower ends are often fllat-woven, folded towards the back, and sewn on.
* '''Nakhichevan''' is located between Armenia and Iran. No information was available on this region to the authors of this classification.

=== Turkmen rugs ===
{{main article|Turkmen rug}}
{{see also|Yomut carpet}}

[[File:Gorskii 20005u.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two Turkmen men standing on a ''Halı'' main carpet with Tekke göl, in front of a [[yurt]]. (1905-1915)]]

[[Turkmen people|Turkmen tribes]] inhabited the area between the [[Amu Darya]] river, the [[Caspian Sea]], [[Aral Sea]] and towards the borders of modern-time Iran and Afghanistan. They produced rugs and smaller pile woven textiles in various sizes, including main carpets (''halı''), tent door hangings (''ensi''), and other household items like tent door decorations (''khalyk'' or ''kapunuk''), tent bags (''torba''), large bags (''chuval''), smaller bags (''mafrash''), saddle bags (''Khordjin''), animal covers (''[[asmalyk]]''), and tent bands.

Many archaic components of Turkmen representative arts have survived into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsareva|first1=Elena|title=Turkmen Carpets: Masterpieces of Steppe Art, from 16th to 19th Centuries: The Hoffmeister Collection|date=2011|publisher=Arnoldsche Art Publishers|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783897903425|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Turkmen were an ancient, Iranian-speaking ethnicity in the western Central Asian steppes and oases. Their military administrative organization in tribes was traced back to the influence of the [[Huns]].(&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atayev|first1=K.|title=Nekotorye dannye po etnografii turkmen shikov|journal=Studies of the Institute of Ethnography and Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the TSSR|volume=VII|trans-title=Some ethnographic data on the Turkmen shikhs|location=Ashkabad|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited in&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Akbar S.|title=Islam in tribal societies : from the Atlas to the Indus|date=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Paul|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-0710093202|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Turkish influence came with the [[Hephthalite Empire]] in the sixth century AD, and, to a larger extent, by the immigration of the [[Oghuz Turks]] in the ninth and tenth century AD. The Oghuz assimilated the local population, who converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"/&gt; The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the thirteenth century AD led to the destruction of the cities and agricultural irrigation systems, and reduced the Turkmen people to a nomadic lifestyle which they have kept throughout their later history, living at the borders of more powerful states like the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], and the [[Khanate of Bukhara]]. Less amenable to assimilation than their neighbours, they were able to preserve much of their traditional culture. During the nineteenth century, the Turkmen came under the influence of the [[Russian Empire]]. With the end of the [[Soviet Union]], the former Turkmen socialist republic turned into the independent state of [[Turkmenistan]].

The [[History of Turkmenistan|history of the Turkmen]] tribes is characterized by migrations, alliances, intertribal warfare, even by the violent extinction of regional populations. Knowledge of both the history of a Turkmen tribe and its migrations, and the characteristics of their structure and design, often allows for the attribution of a rug or pile-woven household item to a certain tribe, and to a certain period in its history. The diversity of the colours and ornaments, as well as their potential symbolic meaning, constitutes the subject of a large, sometimes controversial, body of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jourdan|first1=Uwe|title=Oriental rugs Vol. V: Turkoman|date=1989|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1851491360|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Eilland, Jr.|first2=Murray J.|title=Between the Black Desert and the Red : Turkmen carpets from the Wiedersperg collection ; [published on the occasion of an Exhibition Between the Black Desert and the Red - Turkmen Carpets from the Wiedersperg Collection, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.

Typical for nomadic weaving, the wool of Turkmen rugs is of high quality, with a fairly long pile. Sheep wool, goat's hair and cotton are used for the foundation. The pile is made from wool, and often also contains silk. The predominant colour in nearly all Turkmen rugs is [[Rubia tinctorum|madder red]], which was obtained locally, and allows for dyeing in various shades. The different tribes used distinct shades of red. The predominance of the red colour in Turkmen rugs creates a monotonous impression on first sight, but the minor ornaments are woven in a great variety of colours. The most prominent ornament in Turkmen rugs is the [[Gul (design)|gul]], a medallion-like polygonal pattern which is arranged in rows all over the field. Specific gul were used as tribal emblems in a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] manner.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moshkova|first1=Valentina G.|editor1-last=O' Bannon|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Amanova Olsen|editor2-first=Ovadan K.|title=Carpets of the people of Central Asia of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries|date=1996|publisher=O'Bannon|location=Tucson|isbn=9780965342100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, main (termed “göl”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;), and secondary, less elaborate gul (termed “gül”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;) can be distinguished, “gul” being the more generic name for this type of ornament. Gul were also used depending on the type of rug or household item. Main carpets usually display the main göl of the tribe, whereas tent door covers and bags show special gul.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Primary göl in Turkmen rugs include:&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George W.|title=The Turkoman carpet|date=1974|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715607404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gülli or gushli göl: Lobed göl which includes a square ornament, from which tre-foiled ornaments on a stem protrude. Used by the Tekke, Salor and Ersari, and by some weavers of the Saryk. “Gülli” means "flower" in Turkmen, “gushli” (from “kush” or “gush”) means “bird”. 
* Tauk-Nuska göl: Divided into four quarters in diagonally opposed colours, each quarter shows two stylized animals. Common in many tribes, it is mainly used by Arabachi, Chodor, some groups of the Yomud and Ersari including the Kizil Ayak.
* Tekke göl: Design variation of the gülli göl. Round shape set on the coordinates of a dark blue lattice, which divides each gül into four sections with diagonally opposed colours.
* Saryk göl: Similar to the Tekke göl, but not arranged on a lattice framework. Often seen on Saryk main carpets, also called Chuval göl because of its use on large bags (''chuval'').
* Dyrnak göl - literally: “Comb göl”. Rhomboid göl adorned with rows of hooks, resembling combs, opposite rows of hooks are in the same colour. Used by the Yomud tribe
* Kepse göl: Used mainly by the Yomud tribe, rhomboid göl surrounded by two-coloured crenellations.
* Eagle göl: At least two, if not three groups of rugs are distinguished by this design feature, which has not yet been attributed to any specific tribe.
* "C" göls: Octagon within an octagon filled with patterns resembling the letter “C”.

Turkmen carpets can be woven with both symmetric, and asymmetric knots, open to the left and to the right. Irregular knots are also frequent, including missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, are seen, both symmetric and asymmetric. Often warps are deeply depressed. Pile, warp and weft yarns are excellently balanced. The ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Rugs woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

The '''Salor''' confederation (consisting mainly of the Salor proper and Saryk) is believed to have lived originally in the Amu Darya valley, and the oases of southern Turkmenistan, including [[Merv]]. They used bright shades of madder red. The typical Salor göl has a lobed rosette shade, upright-cross division and motif-filling. Its four central quarters are dyed in diagonally opposed colours. The style of colouring is labelled “Central Asian”. The göl are arranged on the main field of a carpet in a way that makes them appear to “float” on the field, creating the impression of a diagonal movement.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt; A group of Turkmen carpets with common structural features were termed “'''S-group'''” and identified as Salor rugs by Mackie and Thompson.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; The carpets of the “S-group” are asymmetrically knotted, open to the left. Warps are ivory, with alternate warps deeply depressed, wefts of two-ply brown wool, occasionally dyed red. Their pile is less supple than other Turkmen rugs, fairly long. Sometimes silk is used, but rarely cotton. Red colour is mostly from madder, but lac and cochineal reds have been found.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; Older Saryk weavings often have symmetric knots.

'''Tekke''' rugs are distinguished by the use of the Tekke göl. They are asymmetrically knotted, almost always open to the right. Alternate warps are rarely deeply depressed. The red colours are dyed in madder, but also cochineal red can be found. In the nineteenth century, synthetic dyes have been used. Warps are often of ivory yarn with a large component of ivory goat's hair. The selvage is overcast in dark blue.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rautenstengel|first1=Anette|last2=Rautenstengel|first2=Volker|last3=Pakbin|first3=Ali|title=Studien zur Teppich-Kultur der Turkmen = Studies on Turkmen Carpet Culture|date=1990|publisher=A. Rautenstengel|location=Hilden|isbn=978-3980259606|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Yomud''' rugs are of a similar structure, with less depressed warps. The red field colour of Yomud rugs is more subdued with a brown hue. Knots are asymmetric, open to the left. Typical göl are ''dyrnak'' and ''kepse'' göl.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"/&gt;
The most common field colour of '''Chaudor''' rugs is a purplish chestnut brown. White appears more prominently, also dark and light blue, green and yellow. The warps are made of dark wool, whereas the wefts include white cotton. Knotting is asymmetrical and open to the right, which helps distinguishing Chaudor from Yomud rugs. Tauk nuska göls are common in Chaudor rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munkacsi|first1=Kurt|title=Dividing the Chaudor|journal=Hali|date=1994|issue=26|pages=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carpet weaving tribes include the Arabatchi, Ersari and Beshiri.

==== Commercialization and revival ====

With the beginning of commercialization in the nineteenth century, carpets were produced for export in Russia and Afghanistan. Known under the trade name of “Bokhara rugs”, they show designs inspired by Turkmen carpets, but the colours and the quality of design did not match the original. With the end of the Soviet Union, national states were established in the area. Within general activities to revive the ancient tradition of hand-spinning, natural dyeing, and hand weaving, projects to support refugees from Afghanistan have taken a part in the “carpet renaissance”.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"/&gt;

The two states, India and Pakistan, separated in 1947 at the [[Partition of India]]. The tradition of carpet weaving, however, was common to the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, they are described together in this section. Unless otherwise indicated, "India" in this section refers to the Indian subcontinent.

Rug weaving was known in India at least since the sixteenth century. The original models were probably Persian, since their designs appear closely related. Other influences came from central Asia, but India soon developed a style of her own. The most elaborate carpets were woven under the [[Mughal Empire]] during the late sixteenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Further southwards, the rugs woven in the Deccan area are distinguished by their colours and design.

Pile rugs made of wool are not essential household items in the hot and humid climate of India. They might have been introduced by succeeding waves of migrants from central and western Asia. The first people to invade India from the Eurasian steppe were the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryans]] at around 1800 BC. The Aryans were nomadic people subsiding on animal breeding. It has been suggested that they might have introduced sheep breeding, and the production of woolen textiles to Northwestern India.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In the sixth century BC, India was invaded by the [[Hephthalite Empire]], another steppe nomad culture. In the fourth and fifth century BC, some areas were ruled by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. To what extent these peoples were already weaving pile carpets remains unknown, since no carpets exist from this period to support the hypothesis. The earliest references to Indian carpets come from Chinese writers during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Stephen J.|editor1-last=Pinner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Denny|editor2-first=Walter|title=Indian and Kashmiri carpets before Akbar: Their perceived history|journal=Oriental carpet and textile studies|date=1987|volume=III|issue=1|pages=119–126|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Arab invasion of [[Sindh]] in 712, India came in touch with Islam. The Afghan [[Ghaznavids]] and their successors, the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghaurids]], further spread Islam in India. The Arabian geographer [[Al-Muqaddasi]] mentions carpets from Sindh in 985 AD.&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"/&gt; Carpet weaving can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Empire in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to India and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Baburs successor, [[Humayun]], took refuge in the Persian Safavid court of Shah [[Tahmasp I]]. Supported by the [[Safavid Empire]], Humayun returned to India. His son, [[Akbar]] the Great extended is power to northern India and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs.

Miniature paintings from the court of Akbar show that carpets were in use at the Mughal court. During the seventeenth century, commercial records prove the extensive trade in carpets with western Europe. Mughal carpets were depicted in period Netherlandish paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ydema|first1=Onno|title=Carpets and their datings in Netherlandish paintings : 1540-1700|date=1991|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=978-1851491513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large number of Indian carpets still exist in European collections.

The majority of Mughal period carpets shows floral motifs, large leaf-and-blossom patterns, on a red field. Depending on their similarities with, e.g., Persian carpet designs, they are sometimes leballed “Indo-Persian”, or “Indo-Isfahan” in the literature. A large collection of Indian carpets existed at [[Jaipur]], where they were studied by T. H. Hendley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendley|first1=T.H.|title=Asian Carpets: XVI and XVII century designs from the Jaipur palaces|date=1905|publisher=W. Griggs|location=London|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these rugs were labeled, indicating the date of purchase, size, and cost. Most carpets in Jaipur had a cotton foundation, silk was sometimes used for the wefts. White cotton was used for accents in the pile. The finest carpets are often labelled as Persian, but there are carpets with an animal design which are labelled as Indian. The field is frequently dyed with lac, an insect dye resembling cochineal dye. A series of palmettes is often seen along the central vertical axis. On larger carpets, they are flanked by horizontal palmettes pointing alternately to the central axis and to the outer edges. Subsidiary figures are arranged along thin lines of scrolling vinework, usually adorned with lancet-shaped leaves. Several shades of blue are often seen, green, yellow, two different shades of red. Frequently two shades of the same colour are placed closely together with no outlining between the two colours. This feature is regarded as characteristic for Mughal Indian carpets.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The floral design of Indian carpets is often more naturalistic than in their Persian and other counterparts. This feature is considered typical for carpets woven under [[Jahangir]]. Another typical design is the "millefleurs" design, woven mainly between the seventeenth and nineteenth century. These rugs are very intricately woven, with soft wool and often with silk warps which change their colours across the width of the rug, forming vertical “rainbow” bands across the carpet. The field is covered by a multitude of fine flowerheads connected by fine vinework. Carpets with prayer rug design show elaborate vase-and-flowers arrangements flanked by cypress trees, another feature of Mughal art, also seen in architectural ornaments of Mughal period buildings like the [[Taj Mahal]]. Exact dating of Mughal period carpets is difficult, since few examples have inwoven dates. Rugs were woven in [[Agra]], [[Lahore]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

With the decline of the Mughal Empire, by the late nineteenth century, carpet weaving in India had also declined to an extent that the [[British Raj|British]] colonial administration decided to set up factories, sometimes in jails, to produce carpets for export. Carpet weaving continues in India and Pakistan after their separation and independence. Today, the carpet production in India and Pakistan frequently use foreign designs or design copies, and produce commercial rugs of mainly utilitarian value.

== The Oriental rug and the Western world ==
Oriental rugs were probably known to Europe since the [[High Middle Ages]]. Travellers' stories, court annals, home inventories and testaments and, most importantly, paintings bear evidence of rugs and carpets as goods of luxury. As such, they were absorbed into European material culture, providing a context of prestige and dignity which is still understood today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Persian Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, art historic and scientific interest in oriental rugs awoke, and they began to be regarded as genuine objects of art. Rugs were collected in museums and by private collectors, and provided the material for scientific research. Nearly every aspect of the manufacture, design, colours, and cultural significance has been, and still is, analyzed and appreciated.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the [[The Travels of Marco Polo|account of his travels]] about Anatolian rugs. Other thirteenth-century European [[Travel Literature|travellers]] who journeyed to the court of the [[Mongol Empire]] were [[André de Longjumeau]], [[William of Rubruck]] and [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] with [[Benedykt Polak]]. None of them visited China except Marco Polo. The Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] travelled with the [[Golden Horde]] and through China in the early-to-mid-14th century. The 14th-century English author [[John de Mandeville]] wrote an account of his journeys in the East. The travellers sometimes cursorily mention carpets, but only the luxurious carpets which they saw at royal courts seem to have attracted greater interest.

By the late twelfth century, the [[Republic of Venice]], strategically positioned at the head of the Adriatic, became a flourishing trade center. In 1204, [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice]], led the Venetian contingent in the [[Fourth Crusade]] which ended in the [[Sack of Constantinople]], and established Venetian predominance in the trade between western Europe and the [[Islamic world]]. Occasional reports appear about carpets and rugs being bought in Venice. In a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Renaissance]] painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] mentions "two nice and large" carpets which he bought for a friend amongst other luxury goods. Objects of courtly representation and prestige initially, oriental rugs became affordable to wider groups of European citizens with the growing wealth and influence of merchant families and private persons. Inventories and testaments of Venetian citizens found in the archives document extensive collection of carpets.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|editor1-last=Carboni|editor1-first=Stefano|title=Venice and the Islamic world, 828-1797|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300124309|pages=175–191|edition=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental rugs are depicted in a large number of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, attempts were made to determine the date when specific rugs were woven, and carpets were identified with designs similar to these reproduced in the paintings. As a rug could not have been woven later than it had appeared in a painting, the age of a carpet can be assessed by this ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra. C. G. Ellis, 1970|date=1985|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=München|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|pages=48–51|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scientists who established the method soon realized that their approach was biased, as it focused on representative carpets. Only these were deemed worthy of being reproduced by artists.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Village or nomadic rugs were not depicted in paintings aiming to represent dignity and prestige, and not until the mid twentieth century was their artistic and art historic value appreciated in the Western World.

=== Collectors and scientists: late nineteenth century until today ===

In the late nineteenth century, western art historians developed scientifically productive approaches to the Oriental rug.  In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets, because Oriental carpets were not yet collected when he wrote his book, and he thought that not many ancient carpets had survived. However, Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting of oriental rugs as an art form began in the 1880s.  It was confirmed by two groundbreaking exhibitions. The first took place in Vienna in 1891, focusing on the rugs of the imperial collection of the [[House of Habsburg]], but including specimen from private collections as well.&lt;ref name="1891 Vienna exhibition catalogue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=K. K. Österreichisches Handelsmuseum Wien (Ed.)|title=Katalog der Ausstellung Orientalischer Teppiche im K. K. Österreichischen Handelsmuseum|date=1891|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second was held in London in 1892. For the first time, the [[Ardabil Carpet]] was presented to the public.&lt;ref name="Ardabil carpet, first publication"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbing|first1=Edward Percy|title=The holy carpet of the mosque at Ardebil|date=1892|publisher=Robson &amp; Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), advised by [[William Morris]], purchased the Ardabil carpet, recognised today as one of the finest carpets in the world. The high price that was to be paid for the Ardabil carpet required public collection of money, and Oriental rugs came to be understood as objects of great value by a larger audience.

In 1882, Robinson published a book on eastern carpets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Vincent J.|title=Eastern Carpets: Twelve Early Examples with descriptive notices|date=1882|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he deployed the analytical terms that were emerging in decorative arts scholarship for the elements of carpet design, recognising medallions, floral tracery, cloud bands or the “so-called cloud pattern”, and scrollwork on the outer border.

In 1891, [[Alois Riegl]] published his book about “Ancient Oriental Carpets”.&lt;ref name="Riegl, Ancient oriental carpets, 1892"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riegl|first1=Alois|title=Altorientalische Teppiche|date=1892|publisher=A. Th. Engelhardt|isbn=3-88219-090-6|edition=Reprint 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Oriental carpets were analyzed in their geographic, cultural, and sociological context, which marks the first time when Oriental rugs were recognized as an art in itself. Following a first essay in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Ein altpersischer Teppich im Besitz der Königlichen Museen zu Berlin|journal=Jahrbuch der königlich preussischen Kunstsammlungen, Berlin|date=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; art historian [[Wilhelm von Bode]] published his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr. C. G. Ellis, 1970|date=1985|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=München|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|pages=48–51|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still is considered as a standard textbook. Wilhelm von Bode's donation of his carpet collection to the Berlin Museum in 1904-5 was the foundation of the Islamic Museum, Berlin, today the [[Pergamon Museum]]. With Wilhelm von Bode as its first director, his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] created and established the “Berlin School” of history of Islamic Art. They developed the ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method for dating based on Renaissance paintings, recognized the “four social layers” of carpet production (nomadic, village, town and court manufacture) with their different approaches to design and stylization, and established the method of structural analysis to determine the historical framework of the rug weaving traditions within the Islamic world, from a Western perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K. Erdmann|date=1977|publisher=Oguz Pr.|location=London|isbn=9780905820026|edition=1977 English ed. of the original, 1957 German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London 1892 exhibition, especially the display of the Ardabil carpet, led to a growing interest in collecting oriental rugs by private collectors, who, mainly in the United States, also started publicly exhibiting their collections. Later on, private collectors donated their collections to museums. U.S. American collectors and philanthropists ([[Charles Yerkes|Charles T. Yerkes]], [[J. P. Morgan]], Joseph L. Williams, [[James F. Ballard]], [[Benjamin Altman]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[George Hewitt Myers|George H. Myers]] and Joseph V. McMullan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Joseph McMullan Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2011/islamic-art/joseph-mcmullan|website=Met Museum of Art|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) donated to, or bequeathed their collections to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. [[James F. Ballard]] donated both to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and to the St. Louis Art Museum. [[George Hewitt Myers]] donated his private collection to found the Textile Museum, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farnham|first1=Thomas J.|title=In pursuit of high standards|journal=Hali|date=2015|volume=Summer 2015|issue=184|pages=52–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major exhibition of oriental rugs in the United States was held in Chicago in 1893. Further exhibitions include the Detroit Institute of Arts, 1922;&lt;ref name="Detroit Exhibition, 1921"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cliff|first1=Vincent D.|title=Loan exhibition of antique oriental rugs; arranged and catalogued for the Detroit institute of arts of the city of Detroit, by Mr. Vincent D.

Many of the dealers who set up booths at these exhibitions then started galleries in America’s major cities. In New York, most of these stores were run by Armenian immigrants and concentrated in lower and mid-town Manhattan. At the turn of the century, the best known stores belonged to [[Dikran Kelekian]], [[Hagop Kevorkian]], S. Kent Costikyan and H. Michaelyan. In 1932, a group of collectors and rug enthusiasts, amongst them Arthur Dilley, Joseph McMullan, and Maurice Dimand, then curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, founded the ''Hajji Baba Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hajji Baba Club, New York|url=http://www.hajjibaba.org|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their exhibitions and publications, they have contributed ever since to the knowledge and appreciation of oriental rugs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2647">[[File:Mushrooms growed with PF Tek.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushrooms grown using the PF Tek]]

'''PF Tek''' is a method of [[Fungiculture|mushroom cultivation]] pioneered by Robert McPherson, aka [http://www.fanaticus.com Psylocybe Fanaticus]. This technique (Tek) originally utilized [[Rye|organic rye berries]], but later included  [[brown rice]] flour and [[vermiculite]]. The substrate is [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] in half pint wide mouthed [[Mason jar|canning jars]] by boiling or [[pressure cooking]], with a layer of dry vermiculite as a filter agent to keep out competing [[bacteria]] and [[fungus]]. The sterilized "PF jar" is then injected with a solution containing [[spore]]s and water from a [[syringe]], creating a one step procedure for reliably growing mushrooms indoors.

Psylocybe Fanaticus was the business name of Robert McPherson, the creator of the PF Tek. The PF Tek can be used to grow a wide variety of mushrooms including the edible species [[Coprinus comatus|shaggy mane]], [[Hericium erinaceus|lion's mane]], the [[bioluminescent]] species ''[[Panellus stipticus]]'', and various species of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s.

== Strengths and weaknesses ==

===Strengths===

PF Tek is a popular method for home cultivation because it is easy, simple, inexpensive and reliable. The materials needed are cheap and widely available. Jars can be sterilized by boiling or with a [[pressure cooking|pressure cooker]]. Although [[Asepsis|sterile technique]] is required when [[Inoculation|inoculating]], risk of [[contamination]] from airborne [[spore]]s or [[bacteria]] is small because air exposure is minimal and the layer of vermiculite which acts as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]].

===Weaknesses===

More experienced growers may not use PF Tek due to its low [[crop yield|yield]], and high labor input required when compared to other methods, like Monotubs. The use of a spore syringe also has its drawbacks. Because spores are a mix of [[genotype]]s, it is impossible to select [[mycelium]] that [[Colonization|colonizes]] fast and produces high yield.

'''Passive learning''' is a [[Teaching method|method of learning or instruction]] where students receive information from the instructor and internalize it, and "where the learner receives no feedback from the instructor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/passive-learning.html BusinessDirectory.com, definition].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRQ"&gt;[http://www.units.miamioh.edu/celt/events/docs/CFLING/active%20vs%20passive.pdf Norbert Michel, John James Cater III, Otmar Varela:  ''Active Versus Passive Teaching Styles: An Empirical Study of Student Learning Outcomes'',  Human Resource Development Quarterly, DOI: 10.1002/hrdq, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. / Business].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is often used together with ''[[direct instruction]]'' and ''[[lecture|lecturing]]'', with passive learning being the result or intended outcome of the instruction. This style of learning is [[Traditional education|teacher-centered]] and contrasts to [[active learning]], which is [[student-centered]], whereby students take an active or participatory role in the learning process, and to the [[Socratic method]] where students and instructors engage in cooperative argumentative dialogue.  Passive learning is a traditional method utilized in [[factory model school]]s and modern schools, as well as historic and contemporary religious services in churches ([[sermons]]), [[mosque]]s, and [[synagogue]]s.

Passive learning is not simply the outcome of an educational model.  Passive learners may quietly absorb information and knowledge without typically engaging with the information received or the learning experience. They may not interact with others, share insights, or contribute to a dialogue. An estimated 60 percent of people are passive learners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clomedia.com/2013/01/10/engage-passive-learners/ Engage Passive Learnings, Chief Learning Officer, January 10, 2013].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive vs. active learning==
The effectiveness of traditional instruction and passive learning methods have been under debate for some time.&lt;ref name="HRQ"/&gt;  The modern origins of [[progressive education]], with active learning as a component, can be traced back to the 18th century works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by 20th century theorists such as [[John Dewey]]. Locke wrote that "truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas".&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book

|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Advantages of passive learning include: exposure to new material, greater control by the instructor over the classroom, audience, or students; opportunity for a structured and engaging format; ensuring a complement to the subject matter outside of the [[learning environment]] and [[learning space]]; the ability to clarify course material; presentation of a large amount of information in a short time; instructional materials (lecture notes, handouts, audiovisual media, etc.) can be prepared in advance; important concepts and content can be identified and presented in an organized, structured, and meaningful manner; the potential to facilitate large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  This format can also permit dissemination of materials not yet published or readily available.

A randomized, controlled trial comparing passive (60-minute lecture) and active (30-minute lecture along with interactions between student pairs) showed no differences between the two methods in students' knowledge or attitudes. However, the perception of engagement with the delivered content was lower for the passive learning group.&lt;ref name="Haidet"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=14739758 | doi=10.1023/B:AHSE.0000012213.62043.45 | volume=9 | title=A controlled trial of active versus passive learning strategies in a large group setting | year=2004 | journal=Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract | pages=15–27 | last1 = Haidet | first1 = P | last2 = Morgan | first2 = RO | last3 = O'Malley | first3 = K | last4 = Moran | first4 = BJ | last5 = Richards | first5 = BF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Disadvantages of passive learning include the required assumption that for learning to be successful, the students will receive the subject matter with "open minds, like empty vessels or sponges"; the instructor will fill the minds of the students with knowledge in order to obtain better examination results.&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;[https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/McManus_v49n5p423.pdf Dean A. McManus, ''The Two Paradigms of Education and the Peer Review of Teaching'',  Journal of Geoscience Education, V.49, n.5, November 2001, P423-434].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; Passive learning allows limited opportunity to assess how well students are learning content and for questions, clarification, or discussion.  Students may be reticent about letting instructors know they do not understand key information and they may be reluctant to ask questions in class.  With no opportunity for application, it does not consistently engage students' use of higher-level cognitive skills.  A standard model is lecture-format with one-way communication which does not engage the listener.  It also requires the instructor to have effective speaking and presentation skills. Students are expected to wait for information to be provided and then to follow directions on what to do with that information. Emphasis is placed on repeating information without reflecting or demonstrating an understanding.  This can result in ''surface processing'' instead of [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], less ability to use what is learned, and the study being deemed irrelevant by the students.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantages of passive learning can be compared to the advantages of active learning.  It has been suggested that while active ''engagement'' with material, students, instructors, etc. might be critical to learning, active ''participation'' may not be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurodl.org/?p=archives&amp;year=2014&amp;halfyear=2&amp;article=649 Donna Smith and Katy Smith, ''The Case for 'Passive’ Learning – The 'Silent’ Community of Online Learners'', European Journal of Open,  Distance, and E-Learning].

'''Perforate leaves''', sometimes called '''[[wikt:fenestrate#Adjective|fenestrate]]''', occur naturally in some species of plants. Holes develop as a leaf grows.

The size, shape, and quantity of holes in each leaf can vary greatly depending on the species and can even vary greatly within a given species. Perforation is caused by sections of leaf ceasing cell growth or by dying during an early stage in the development of the leaf. These deformations that are created earliest in the leaf development end up looking more like slashes whereas those that develop later end up looking more like holes. This trait is found in only one species in [[Aponogetonaceae]] and a few genera in [[Araceae]].

It is not fully known what evolutionary purpose perforation serves, but there are several possibilities. Perforation could serve the purpose of reducing the chances of leaves tearing in high winds or it could help to maximize the amount of rain that's able to reach the plant's roots. It could help to cool the plant by producing turbulence around the leaf. Another possibility is that perforation is a defense against herbivory. The holes might make the leaf look less enticing to herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Christopher D. "How Did the Swiss Cheese Plant Get Its Holes?" The American Naturalist 181.2 (2013): 273-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Part of most types of flower}}
[[Image:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram showing the parts of a mature flower. In this example the perianth is separated into a calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals)]]

'''Petals''' are modified [[Leaf|leaves]] that surround the reproductive parts of [[flower]]s. They are often [[advertising coloration|brightly colored]] or unusually shaped to attract [[pollinator]]s. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called a '''''corolla'''''. Petals are usually accompanied by another set of special leaves called [[sepal]]s, that collectively form the ''calyx'' and lie just beneath the corolla. The calyx and the corolla together make up the [[perianth]]. When the petals and sepals of a flower are difficult to distinguish, they are collectively called [[tepal]]s. Examples of plants in which the term ''tepal'' is appropriate include [[Genus|genera]] such as ''[[Aloe]]'' and ''[[Tulipa]]''. Conversely, genera such as ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' and ''[[Phaseolus]]'' have well-distinguished sepals and petals. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as "petaloid", as in [[petaloid monocots]], orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include [[Liliales]], an alternative name is lilioid monocots.

Although petals are usually the most conspicuous parts of animal-pollinated flowers, wind-pollinated species, such as the [[Poaceae|grasses]], either have very small petals or lack them entirely.

==Corolla==
[[File:2007 brugmansia aurea.jpg|thumb|Corolla forming a tube with long points (and a separate green calyx tube)]]
The role of the corolla in plant [[evolution]] has been studied extensively since [[Charles Darwin]] postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Anders Nilsson| title=The evolution of flowers with deep corolla tubes |journal=Nature |volume=334 |issue=6178 |pages=147–149 |year=1988 |doi=10.1038/334147a0 |bibcode=1988Natur.334..147N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corolla of separate tepals is ''apopetalous''. If the petals are free from one another in the corolla, the plant is ''polypetalous'' or ''choripetalous''; while if the petals are at least partially fused together, it is ''gamopetalous'' or ''sympetalous''. In the case of fused tepals, the term is ''syntepalous''. The corolla in some plants forms a tube.

== Variations ==
[[File:Pelargonium peltatum 9245s.jpg|thumb|''Pelargonium peltatum'': its floral structure is almost identical to that of geraniums, but it is conspicuously zygomorphic]]
[[File:Geranium incanum 9156s.jpg|left|thumb|''Geranium incanum'', with an actinomorphic flower typical of the genus]] [[File:White pea flower.jpg|thumb|White pea, a zygomorphic flower]]

Petals can differ dramatically in different species.  The [[merosity|number of petals in a flower]] may hold clues to a plant's classification.  For example, flowers on [[eudicots]] (the largest group of [[dicotyledon|dicots]]) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on [[monocotyledon|monocots]] have three or six petals, although there are many exceptions to this rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The origin and diversification of angiosperms |author= Soltis, Pamela S.|authorlink = Pamela S. Soltis|author2 = Douglas E. Soltis |journal= American Journal of Botany |year= 2004 |volume= 91 | pages= 1614–1626 |url= http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1614 | doi= 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1614 |issue=10 |pmid=21652312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical (see [[Symmetry in biology]] and [[Floral symmetry]]).  If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape, the flower is said to be '''regular''' or '''actinomorphic''' (meaning "ray-formed"). Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane (i.e., symmetry is bilateral) and are termed '''irregular''' or '''zygomorphic''' (meaning "yoke-" or "pair-formed"). In ''irregular'' flowers, other floral parts may be modified from the ''regular'' form, but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry. Examples of [[Floral symmetry|zygomorphic]] flowers may be seen in [[orchid]]s and members of the [[Fabaceae|pea family]].

In many plants of the [[Asteraceae|aster family]] such as the sunflower, ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'', the circumference of the [[Head (botany)|flower head]] is composed of ray florets.  Each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal.  Florets in the centre of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ('''[[hypanthium]]''') above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p. 365}}{{sfn|Foster|2014|loc=[http://plant-phytography.blogspot.ca/2012/10/hypanthium-cup-shaped-or-tubular.html Hypanthium]}}&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;

Petal often consists of two parts: the upper, broad part, similar to leaf blade, also called the ''blade'' and the lower part, narrow, similar to leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], called the ''claw'', separated from each other at the ''limb''. Claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family ''[[Brassicaceae]]'', such as ''[[Erysimum cheiri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|title=Flower|url=http://eb11.co.uk/index.php?p=FLOWER35747-h.htm|first=|last=|volume=10: Evangelical Church – Francis Joseph I.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inception and further development of petals shows a great variety of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1973. ''Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas''. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Petals of different species of plants vary greatly in colour or colour pattern, both in visible light and in ultraviolet. Such patterns often function as guides to pollinators, and are variously known as [[nectar guide]]s, pollen guides, and floral guides.

==Genetics==
The genetics behind the formation of petals, in accordance with the [[ABC Model of Flower Development|ABC model of flower development]], are that sepals, petals, [[stamen]]s, and [[carpels]] are modified versions of each other.  It appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times (perhaps only once), rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.3732/ajb.0800038 |title= One size fits all?

==Significance of pollination==
Pollination is an important step in the sexual reproduction of higher plants.  Pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of [[monoecious|hermaphroditic]] flowers.

Pollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the [[stigma (botany)]] of the same or nearby flowers. However, pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate. This develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators (unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination). Petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators. Henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong.

==Functions and purposes==
Petals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant. In general, petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators.

===Function===
This is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g. the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar. Pollinators have the ability to determine specific flowers they wish to pollinate.&lt;ref&gt;Cares-Suarez, R,  Poch, T, Acevedo, R.F, Acosta-Bravo, I, Pimentel, C,  Espinoza, C, Cares, R.A, Munoz, P, Gonzalez, A.V, Botto-Mahan, C (2011) Do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory?: An experimental assessment in Loasa tricolor (Loasaceae). Gayana Botanica, Volume 68, Pages 176-181&lt;/ref&gt; Using incentives flowers draw pollinators and set up a mutual relation between each other in which case the pollinators will remember to always guard and pollinate these flowers (unless incentives are not consistently met and competition prevails).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chamberlain S.A |author2=Rudgers J.A | year = 2012 | title = How do plants balance multiple mutualists?

===Scent===
The petals could produce different scents to allure desirable pollinators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=Conie|last2=Mohd-Hairul|first2=Ab. Rahim|last3=Ain|first3=Nooraini Mohd.|last4=Namasivayam|first4=Parameswari|last5=Go|first5=Rusea|last6=Abdullah|first6=Nur Ashikin Psyquay|last7=Abdullah|first7=Meilina Ong|last8=Abdullah|first8=Janna Ong|date=2017-11-02|title=Floral micromorphology and transcriptome analyses of a fragrant Vandaceous Orchid, Vanda Mimi Palmer, for its fragrance production sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-017-2872-6|journal=BMC Research Notes|volume=10|pages=554|doi=10.1186/s13104-017-2872-6|issn=1756-0500}}&lt;/ref&gt; or repel undesirable pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Danny|last2=Kallenbach|first2=Mario|last3=Diezel|first3=Celia|last4=Rothe|first4=Eva|last5=Murdock|first5=Mark|last6=Baldwin|first6=Ian T|date=2015-07-01|title=Abstract|url=https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07641.001|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=4|doi=10.7554/elife.07641.001|issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flowers will also mimic the scents produced by materials such as decaying meat, to attract pollinators to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=More, M, Cocucci, A.A, Raguso, R.A|year=2013|title=The importance of oligosulfides in the attraction of fly pollinators to the brood-site deceptive species ''Jaborosa rotacea'' (Solanaceae)|journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume=174|pages=863–876|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/670367?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102751669991|doi=10.1086/670367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
Various colour traits are used by different petals that could attract pollinators that have poor smelling abilities, or that only come out at certain parts of the day. Some flowers are able to change the colour of their petals as a signal to mutual pollinators to approach or keep away.&lt;ref name=SLH&gt;Science Learning Hub. (2012). The University of Waikato. "Attracting pollinators". Date Retrieved: August 2013. [http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Pollination/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/Attracting-pollinators]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape and size===
Furthermore, the shape and size of the flower/petals is important in selecting the type of pollinators they need. For example, large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;
Collectively the scent, colour and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating. Some pollinators include insects, birds, bats and the wind.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;
In some petals, a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed, stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw, and a wider distal part referred to as the blade (or limb). Often the claw and blade are at an angle with one another.

==Types of pollination==

===Wind pollination===
{{main|Anemophily}}
Wind-pollinated flowers often have small, dull petals and produce little or no scent. Some of these flowers will often have no petals at all. Flowers that depend on wind pollination will produce large amounts of pollen because most of the pollen scattered by the wind tends to not reach other flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2406479?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102845746923|title=Wind Pollination in the Angiosperms: Evolutionary and Environmental Considerations|author=Donald R. Whitehead|journal=Evolution|volume=23|issue=1|year=1969|pages=28–35|doi=10.2307/2406479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attracting insects===
Flowers have various regulatory mechanisms in order to attract insects. One such helpful mechanism is the use of colour guiding marks. Insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers, acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye. Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the pōhutukawa (''Metrosideros excelsa'') which acts to regulate colour within a different way. The pōhutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;
Another attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scent which is highly attractive towards humans such as the rose, but some are very fragrant within attracting flies as they have a smell of rotting meat. Dark is another factor in which flowers have grown to adapt these conditions so colour lacks vision at night therefore scent is the solution for flowers which are pollinated by night flying insects such as the moth.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;

===Attracting birds===
Flowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery. Such bird–pollinated native plants include: Kōwhai (''Sophora'' species), flax (''Phormium tenax'', harakeke) and kākā beak (''Clianthus puniceus'', kōwhai ngutu-kākā). Flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit. An example is the tree fuchsia (''Fuchsia excorticata'', kōtukutuku) which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;

===Bat-pollinated flowers===
Flowers can be pollinated by short tailed bats. An example of this is the dactylanthus (''Dactylanthus taylorii''). This plant has its home under the ground acting the role of a parasite on the roots of forest trees. The dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack colour but have the advantage of containing lots of nectar and a very strong scent. These act as a very useful mechanism in attracting the bat.&lt;ref&gt;Physics.org (2012). University of Adelaide. "Flightless parrots, burrowing bats helped parasitic Hades flower".

'''Principlism''' is a system of ethics based on the four moral principles of:

1. Autonomy—free-will or agency, 

2. Beneficence—do good, 

3. Nonmaleficence—do no harm, and 

4. Justice—social distribution of benefits and burdens.

Advocates for principlism argue that from the beginning of recorded history most moral decision-makers descriptively and prescriptively have used these four moral principles; that they are part of or compatible with most intellectual, religious, and cultural beliefs.

==Principlism formalized into national and international law==

Principlism was first formalized as a moral decision-making approach by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in a document called the [[Belmont Report]] on April 18, 1979. The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the [[National Research Act]] (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law. After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution’s Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of the basic ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioral research. The Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety as a statement of the Department’s policy for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

The Belmont Report’s cause of origin can be traced back to December 9, 1946 when the American Military Tribunal started criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians and administrators for [[war crime]]s and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. During the trials, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was drafted for the establishment of standards for judging individuals who conducted biomedical experiments on [[Internment|concentration camp]] prisoners. The Nuremberg Code in its final form was established in 1948 and was the first international document that advocated voluntary [[informed consent]] for participants of research on human subjects.

==Belmont report and its three core principles==

Principlism is a moral approach based on judgments that are generally accepted by most intellectual, cultural and religious traditions. For example, the Belmont Report defines 3 key principles by which to judge the ethicality of biomedical and behavioral research.  These principles are:

1. Respect for persons—Autonomy,

2. Beneficence—do good, and

3. Justice—specifically distributive justice wherein those who bear the burdens of research also receive its benefits.

==Principlism as a practical approach==

Principlism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.

==Specifying and balancing==

Once these principles have been established the practical activity then becomes that of specifying how the principles are to be used in specific situations and balancing the principles with the other competing moral principles. In using this approach, every moral decision will be dilemmatic in that the agent will be to some degree either morally right and morally wrong under a single principle, and/or there will be two or more competing moral principles and the agent will not be able to completely fulfill one or more moral principles without violating or competing with one or more other moral principles. Dilemmatic decision-making is not unusual when making pluralistic social decisions. The Bill of Rights in [[United States Constitution|the United States Constitution]] perfectly exemplifies this process. A citizen’s [[freedom of speech]], for example, does not allow someone to yell “FIRE” in a crowded theater when there is no fire as individual [[Constitutional right|Constitutional Rights]] and Liberties are constrained by other [[individual rights]] and liberties and therefore they must be specified for specific situations and then balanced with the other inevitable competing principles. 

Principlism, presented as a formal criterion, is a [[Linguistic prescription|description and prescription]] of moral decision-making with a deep and rich heritage that has yet to be formalized for pluralistic interdisciplinary groups. However, since most moral decision-making ultimately use this approach, in one form or another, moral decision making in pluralistic environments is possible as Principlism descriptively describes how people do in fact make moral decisions and prescriptively prescribes how people ought to act based on the intersubjective agreements of common morality. Instead of focusing on the epistemic differences of various philosophical and religious perspectives, Principlism focuses on the intersubjective agreements, and that is why it works so effectively in interdisciplinary pluralistic environments.

Principlism could be modified by adding or subtracting certain component principles yet practically the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are broad and comprehensive enough to sufficiently cover most cases and will provide the necessary output power for making interdisciplinary moral decisions.

==Incommensurable beliefs==

Even though pluralistic groups will in large part have shared universal values—Principlism, it is still clearly recognized that there is and will be incommensurable beliefs as to how the specification and balancing procedures found in the principlistic approach ought to be implemented. However, Principlism has the advantage over most other moral approaches in that Principlism emphasizes the shared interdisciplinary [[universal values]] or principles and uses them in a systematic and transparent fashion resulting in a greater shared understanding and/or compromise. Certainly, Principlism does not claim to be able to solve all moral dilemmas caused by conflicts of beliefs, yet Principlism, without a doubt, has tremendous output power for practicing interdisciplinary moral decision-making. 

==Unified approach==

Principlism is unified approach in that each [[Morality|moral principle]] seems to converge into each of the other three principles. For example, it can be argued that Principlism, as a comprehensive moral approach, is just another term for justice. To the extent that justice is socially valued because of how it effectively establishes autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence, both personally and socially, it can be argued that Principlism only needs its fourth principle—justice, in order to fulfill its moral function. However, this argument can also be made with regards to each of the four principles as each principle seems to be able to include each of the other three principles. Personal autonomy results in the maximization of personal benefits—beneficence and the minimization of personal burdens—nonmaleficence within a legitimate social structure—justice. Likewise, nonmaleficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, beneficence, and justice and beneficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, nonmaleficence, and justice. 

The fact that each of the four principles can be argued to be the supreme moral principle further validates the Principlistic approach towards moral decision-making. In other words, Principlism is a unified moral approach in which the addition of each principle strengthens the legitimacy of each of the other principles to the extent that each principle is specified and balanced using independent criteria and yet each principle still supports each of the other principles. 

Science illustrates the importance and necessity of such unification. For example, if several academically distinct fields converge on a unified position that would generally give more credence towards that position. On the other hand, if one [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] has a hypothesis that contradicts several or all of the other academic disciplines, then that would be reason either to reject that hypothesis or at least to give it some pause. One example of such unification would be the comparison of evolution vs. [[creationism]]. Evolution converges in several academic fields such as Biology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Oceanography, Pathology, Medicine, Anthropology, and more. Creationism, on the other hand, is based on the non-academic discipline of [[Faith|religious faith]] and is not supported by any of the empirical academic disciplines. As a result, creationism does not have the same academic stature as evolution and is therefore not considered as a plausible option by any of the empirical or rational academic disciplines. Therefore, other than creationism being a curious sociological, anthropological, or psychological phenomena of culture, religion, and/or belief, creationism has no place in academic empirical rational discourse. Of course academic sciences are by definition limited to empirical and rational discourses and some knowledge is clearly not of that category.  For example, intersubjective experiences of [[sense data]] such as: sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, and emotional states such as: love, and faith, are real and true experiences yet they elude rational and/or empirical quantification. However, since creationism claims to be an academic empirical conclusion, then it is legitimate to hold creationism to academic standards of universal academic consistency. 

Principlism validates itself with its universally recognized moral principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. These principles are distinct moral attributes that converge and unifies moral decision-making even within pluralistic environments.

==Goal of moral decision-making==

The goal in moral decision-making is ultimately to specify and balance each of the four principles recognizing that there is no set hierarchical order of principles in that one or more moral principle may override one or more other moral principles depending on the circumstances. Specifying is the narrowing down or making the broad moral principles relevant for a particular decision and balancing is the attempt to maximize, as much as possible, all of the contributing or competing moral principles.

==Applying principlism==

The following is an approach that can be used towards applying Principlism to a particular case.

'''DETERMINE THE RELEVANT PARTIES'''
       a.	SPECIFYING THE RELEVANT PARTIES:
                i.	Positive rights: (Obligation of others to provide something)
                        1.	Subject, guardian, or [[Social organisation|social institutions]]
                        2.	Relatives
                        3.	Community
                        4.	State government
                        5.	Federal government
                        6.	International government
                        7.	Other
                 ii.	Negative rights: (Obligation of others to not interfere)
                         1.	Subject, guardian, or social institutions
                         2.	Relatives
                         3.	Community
                         4.	State government
                         5.	Federal government
                         6.	International government
                         7.	Other
        b.	BALANCING THE RELEVANT PARTIES: 
                 If appropriate put the relevant parties in hierarchical order, and/or indicate if one or more party has more compelling interests over one or more of the others. 
 
'''I.	AUTONOMY'''
        a.	'''SPECIFYING AUTONOMY:''' (Relate to [[negative and positive rights]] if relevant)
                i.	Personal Authorization
                       1.	Intention: usually communicated by Express, Implied, or Tacit Consent
                       2.	Substantial knowledge: usually provided using the Professional Practice Standard, [[Reasonable person|Reasonable Person]] Standard, or Subjective Standard
                       3.	Substantial freedom: usually effected by such aspects as Persuasion, Coercion, and Manipulation
               ii.	Institutional Authorization
                       1.	Intention: usually implemented by a signed document
                       2.	Substantial knowledge: usually provided by a written document based on the Professional Practice Standard and/or the Reasonable Person Standard
                       3.	Substantial freedom: If the document is not signed then the services are usually not provided 
         b.  '''BALANCING AUTONOMY:''' 
             Balance the above by putting the obligations in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more [[Strict scrutiny|compelling interest]] over the other.
 
'''II.	NONMALEFICENCE'''
        a.	'''SPECIFYING NONMALEFICENCE:'''
                i.	What are the burdens of the various options for the subject and/or relevant parties? 
                ii.	What personal and [[social rights]] need to be considered?
                        1.	Positive rights: Obligation(s) of others for preventing or alleviating a harm
                        2.	Negative rights: Obligation(s) of others to not interfere in a potential or actual harm
        b.  '''BALANCING NONMALEFICENCE:''' 
            Balance the above by putting the obligations in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more compelling interest over the other. 

'''III.	BENEFICENCE'''
        a.	'''SPECIFYING BENEFICENCE:'''
                i.	What are the benefits of the various options for the subject and/or relevant parties?
                ii.	What personal and social rights need to be considered? 
                        1.	Positive rights: Obligations of others for providing a potential or actual benefit
                        2.	Negative rights: Obligations of others to not interfering in a potential or actual benefit
        b.  '''BALANCING BENEFICENCE:''' 
            Balance the above by putting the obligations in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more compelling interest over the other.
 
'''IV.	JUSTICE''' 
        a.	'''SPECIFYING JUSTICE:''' 
                i.	What are the legal or [[social issues]] with regards to the subject and/or relevant parties? 
                        1.	[[Personal rights|Personal Rights]] and Liberties as provided by the State, Federal, or International social structures
                        2.	Social Rights and Liberties as provided by the State, Federal, or International social structures
                        3.	[[Political Rights]] and Liberties as provided by the State, Federal, or International social structures
                 ii.	How do the above issues relate to positive rights (obligations of others to provide) and negative rights (obligations of others to not interfere)?
        b.  '''BALANCING JUSTICE:''' 
            Balance the above by putting them in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more compelling interest over the other.

'''BALANCING THE FOUR PRINCIPLES'''
        a.	     How many of the four principles are relevant for this case?
        b.	In this particular case, which principles are most influential and why?
        c.	Is it possible to maximize most or all of the four principles or do one or more of them override one or more of the others and why?

'''CONCLUSION'''

Summarize the specification and balancing within each of the four principles and then summarize the reasoning behind the balancing of the four principles and present the reasons why the chosen moral decision would have a higher probability of accomplishing the balancing end rather than some other decision.

'''Pulsed Accretion''' in astronomy is the periodic modulation in accretion rate of young stellar objects in [[binary system]]s, producing a periodic pulse in the observed infrared light curves of [[T Tauri stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Eric L. N. Jensen u. a.|Periodical=The Astronomical Journal|Title=Periodic Accretion from a Circumbinary Disk in the Young Binary UZ Tau E |Volume=134|Issue=1|Year=2007|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;241–251|Date=  2007|language=German|DOI=10.1086/518408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In double stars in young stellar objects, a protoplanetary disk is formed around each star, accreted from matter close to the star. In such a binary star system a strongly eccentric orbit produces strong gravitational forces on the circumstellar disks at [[periastron]], and such disturbance can lead to a temporary increase in the accretion rate onto the star. This increased accretion rate leads to a change of intensity in the infrared, such intensity rising by up to tenfold in the protostar [[LRLL 54361]]. Brightness changes in the light curve that have the same period as the orbital period of the binary system, are always assumed to be due to pulsed accretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=James Muzerolle et al.|Periodical=Astrophysics.

'''Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies''', ({{lang-he|מכון שכטר למדעי היהדות}}, '''''Machon Schechter''''') located in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], is an academic institution affiliated with [[Conservative Judaism]]. 
==History==
Founded in 1984 by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (N.Y.) and Israel's [[Masorti movement|Masorti Movement]] as a rabbinical seminary known as "The Seminary of Judaic Studies," the Schechter Institute has been located since 1990 in [[Neve Granot]], a neighborhood behind the [[Israel Museum]].

The campus in Jerusalem, in addition to its graduate school, is home to the Schechter Rabbinical Seminary, TALI Education Fund and Midreshet Yerushalayim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/793446.html The Israeli architectural genome, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Schechter Institute also operates the Legacy Heritage Center for Jewish Culture in the historic former Cafe Lorenz building in [[Tel Aviv]]'s [[Neve Tzedek]] neighborhood.

More than 600 graduate students specialize in fourteen Jewish study tracks including art, women's studies, family and community studies, teaching, informal education, and classical Jewish disciplines such as [[Bible]], [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], and [[Jewish Thought]]. Its newest program - Marpeh - unique to Israel - combines Health-care Chaplaincy with a degree in Family and Community Studies.

The Schechter Institute has 56 full- and part-time faculty members and over 1,200 M.A. graduates. Many work in the Israeli school system as principals and teachers, in the Ministry of Education in management positions, including curriculum planning, or in the nationwide Community Center Association. Schechter research centers include the Center for Women and Jewish Law, the Center for Judaism and the Arts, and the Center for Applied Jewish Law.

The '''scientific community''' is a diverse network of interacting [[scientist]]s. It includes many "[[working groups|sub-communities]]" working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]] is expected to be achieved by the [[scientific method]]. [[Peer review]], through discussion and debate within journals and conferences, assists in this objectivity by maintaining the quality of research methodology and interpretation of results.&lt;ref name=SCMet&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kornfeld |first1=W |last2=Hewitt |first2=CE |year=1981 |title=The Scientific Community Metaphor |journal=IEEE Trans. Sys., Man, and Cyber. |volume=SMC-11 |issue=1 |pages=24–33 |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5693/AIM-641.pdf?sequence=2 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of scientific communities==

The eighteenth century had some societies made up of men who studied nature, also known as [[natural philosophers]] and [[natural history|natural historians]], which included even amateurs. As such these societies were more like local clubs and groups with diverse interests than actual scientific communities, which usually had interests on specialized disciplines.&lt;ref name=Cahan /&gt; Though there were a few older societies of men who studied nature such as the [[Royal Society of London]], the concept of scientific communities emerged in the second half of the 19th century, not before, because it was in this century that the language of modern science emerged, the professionalization of science occurred, specialized institutions were created, and the specialization of scientific disciplines and fields occurred.&lt;ref name=Cahan /&gt;

For instance, the term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and the wider acceptance of the term along with the growth of specialized societies allowed for researchers to see themselves as a part of a wider imagined community, similar to the concept of nationhood.&lt;ref name=Cahan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cahan|first1=David|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287|pages=291–328|chapter=Institutions and Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership, status and interactions==
Membership in the community is generally, but not exclusively, a function of [[education]], [[employment|employment status]], research activity and [[research institute|institutional affiliation]]. [[Achieved status|Status]] within the community is highly correlated with [[Academic publishing|publication record]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Yearley | first1 = Steven | last2 = Collins | first2 = Harry M. | author-link1 = Steven Yearley | author-link2 = Harry Collins | contribution = Epistemological chicken | editor-last = Pickering | editor-first = Andrew | editor-link = Andrew Pickering | title = Science as practice and culture | pages = 301–326 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780226668017 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also depends on the status within the institution and the status of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Höhle, Ester (2015). From apprentice to agenda-setter: comparative analysis of the influence of contract conditions on roles in the
scientific community. Studies in Higher Education 40(8), 1423-1437. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2015.1060704&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers can hold roles of different degrees of influence inside the scientific community. Researchers of a stronger influence can act as mentors for early career researchers and steer the direction of research in the community like ageanda setters.&lt;ref&gt;Höhle, Ester (2015). From apprentice to agenda-setter: comparative analysis of the influence of contract conditions on roles in the scientific community. Studies in Higher Education 40(8), 1423-1437.http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2015.1060704&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scientists are usually trained in [[academia]] through [[university|universities]]. As such, [[academic degree|degrees]] in the relevant scientific sub-disciplines are often considered prerequisites in the relevant community. In particular, the [[PhD]] with its [[doctoral dissertation|research requirements]] functions as a marker of being an important integrator into the community, though continued membership is dependent on maintaining connections to other researchers through publication, technical contributions, and [[scientific conference|conferences]]. After obtaining a PhD an academic scientist may continue through being on an academic position, receiving a [[postdoc|post-doctoral fellowships]] and onto [[professor]]ships. Other scientists make contributions to the scientific community in alternate ways such as in [[industry]], [[education]], [[think tank]]s, or the [[government]].

Members of the same community do not need to work together.&lt;ref name=SCMet /&gt; Communication between the members is established by disseminating research work and hypotheses through articles in [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journals|journals]], or by attending [[academic conference|conferences]] where new research is presented and ideas exchanged and discussed. There are also many informal methods of communication of scientific work and results as well. And many in a coherent community may actually ''not'' communicate all of their work with one another, for various professional reasons.

==Speaking for the scientific community==
Unlike in previous centuries when the community of scholars were all members of few [[learned society|learned societies]] and similar institutions, there are no singular bodies or individuals which can be said today to speak for all science or all scientists. This is partly due to the specialized training most scientists receive in very few fields. As a result, many would lack expertise in all the other fields of the sciences. For instance, due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602|doi=10.1038/493602a|pmid=23364725|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are still multiple societies and academies in many countries which help consolidate some opinions and research to help guide public discussions on matters of policy and government-funded research. For example, the [[United States]]' [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) and [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] sometimes act as surrogates when the opinions of the scientific community need to be ascertained by [[public policy|policy makers]] or the national [[government]], but the statements of the National Academy of Science or the Royal Society are not binding on scientists nor do they necessarily reflect the opinions of every scientist in a given community since membership is often exclusive, their commissions are explicitly focused on serving their governments, and they have never "shown systematic interest in what rank-and file scientists think about scientific matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivity of membership in these types of organizations can be seen in their election processes in which only existing members can officially nominate others for candidacy of membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce Alberts|first=Kenneth R. Fulton|title=Election to the National Academy of Sciences: Pathways to membership|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/21/7405.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.0503457102|pmid=16586925|volume=102|issue=21|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=7405–7406|pmc=1140467|date=2005-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election to the Fellowship of the Royal Society|url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/election/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unusual for organizations like the National Academy of Science to engage in external research projects since they normally focus on preparing scientific reports for government agencies.&lt;ref name="US Academy uncharted waters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Helen|title=Oil money takes US academy into uncharted waters|journal=Nature|volume=494|issue=7437|pages=295|doi=10.1038/494295a|pmid=23426305|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how rarely the NAS engages in external and active research can be seen in its struggle to prepare and overcome hurdles, due to its lack of experience in coordinating research grants and major research programs on the environment and health.&lt;ref name="US Academy uncharted waters" /&gt;

Nevertheless, general [[scientific consensus]] is a concept which is often referred to when dealing with questions that can be subject to [[scientific method]]ology. While the consensus opinion of the community is not always easy to ascertain or fix due to paradigm shifting, generally the standards and utility of the [[scientific method]] have tended to ensure, to some degree, that scientists agree on some general corpus of [[fact]]s explicated by [[scientific theory]] while rejecting some ideas which run counter to this realization. The concept of scientific consensus is very important to science pedagogy, the evaluation of new ideas, and research funding. Sometimes it is argued that there is a [[closed shop]] [[bias]] within the scientific community toward new ideas. [[Protoscience]], [[fringe science]], and [[pseudoscience]] have been topics that discuss demarcation problems. In response to this some non-consensus claims [[scientific skepticism|skeptical organizations]], not research institutions, have devoted considerable amounts of time and money contesting ideas which run counter to general agreement on a particular topic.

[[Philosophy of science|Philosophers of science]] argue over the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limits of such a consensus and some, including [[Thomas Kuhn]], have pointed to the existence of [[scientific revolution]]s in the [[history of science]] as being an important indication that scientific consensus can, at times, be wrong. Nevertheless, the sheer explanatory power of science in its ability to make [[accuracy|accurate]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] predictions and aid in the design and [[engineering]] of new [[technology]] has ensconced "science" and, by proxy, the opinions of the scientific community as a highly respected form of [[knowledge]] both in the [[academia|academy]] and in [[popular culture]].

===Political controversies===
The high regard with which scientific results are held in Western society has caused a number of [[Politicization of science|political controversies over scientific subjects]] to arise. An alleged [[conflict thesis]] proposed in the 19th century between [[religion and science]] has been cited by some as representative of a struggle between tradition and substantial change and [[faith and reason]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. A popular example used to support this thesis is when [[Galileo]] was tried before the [[Inquisition]] concerning the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;Page 37 John Hedley Brooke: Science and Religion – Some Historical Perspectives, Cambridge 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution began after Pope Urban VIII permitted Galileo to write about the Copernican model. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" which caused great offense to him.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo Project - Pope Urban VIII Biography|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though many historians of science have discredited the conflict thesis &lt;ref name="sci rel hist intro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferngren|first=Gary|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|pages=Introduction, p.ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it still remains a popular belief among many including some scientists. In more recent times, the [[creation-evolution controversy]] has resulted in many [[creationism|religious believers in a supernatural creation]] to challenge some [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] assumptions that have been proposed in some of the branches of scientific fields such as [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]], and [[astronomy]]. Although the dichotomy seems to be of a different outlook from a [[Continental Europe|Continental]] [[Europe]]an perspective, it does exist. The [[Vienna Circle]], for instance, had a paramount (i.e. symbolic) influence on the [[semiotic regime]] represented by the [[Scientific]] [[Community]] in Europe.

In the decades following [[World War II]], some were convinced that [[nuclear power]] would solve the pending [[energy crisis]] by providing energy at low cost. This advocacy led to the construction of many [[nuclear power plants]], but was also accompanied by a global political movement opposed to nuclear power due to safety concerns and associations of the technology with [[nuclear weapons]]. Mass protests in the United States and Europe during the 1970s and 1980s along with the disasters of [[Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island]] led to a decline in nuclear power plant construction.

In the last decades or so, both [[Global warming controversy|global warming]] and [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]] have placed the opinions of the scientific community in the forefront of political debate.

The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good security sector governance (SSG)—where security actors are effective and accountable to their people. For example, SSR might guide decision-making on what form should the oversight of armed forces take or how transparent will intelligence agencies be according to legislation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2151(2014)|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2151 (S/RES/2151) on Security sector reform: challenges and opportunities|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121073122/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F2151%282014%29|archivedate=2017-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different nomenclature of the same overall framework include '''security system reform''' ('''SSR'''), '''security sector reconstruction''' ('''SSR''') and '''justice and security sector reform''' ('''JSSR''').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=DCAF|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183845/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security stating that the democratic control of the security sector as essential to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|title=Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security|last=|first=|publisher=OSCE|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829145812/http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A framework for security sector reform (SSR) emerged in 1999 after [[international development]] actors observed from examples in [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from [[War|conflict]] or an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]]. Reportedly, the increasing number of [[Civil war|civil wars]] led development actors to look at the problem of insecurity from the perspective of good governance. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|title=SSR: Securing its success, justifying its relevance|last=Price|first=Megan|date=2014-08-19|work=Clingendael|access-date=|last2=van Veen|first2=Erwin|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234737/https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Female police officer of Denmark.jpg|thumb|The [[Service quality|quality of the service]] provided by the police, such as the pictured [[Police of Denmark]], is a component of security sector governance and reform]]There is no single globally accepted definition of security sector reform (SSR), but it generally refers to a process to reform or rebuild a state's [[National security|security sector]] towards good security sector governance (SSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|title=Elements for an EU-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform, JOIN(2016) 31 final|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2016|isbn=|location=Strasbourg|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825234526/https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|publisher=USAID, US Departments of Defense and State|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024030/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good SSG is usually defined as a number of idealized principles and good practices of a healthy security sector servicing its people. Likewise, the objective of SSR is defined as the application of the same principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as [[public health]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|title=About SSG/R|last=|first=|date=|website=DCAF (Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces)|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012716/http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (]]OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved delivery of security and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability of justice and security service delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The target of SSR are the components of the state that uphold [[national security]]. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight of security in a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|title=The United Nations SSR Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=UN SSR Unit|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519215426/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the scope and target of SSR has usually been defined comprising the following four groups:
* Core security actors, such as armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services;

== Objective ==
[[File:SSG and SSR.png|thumb|A diagram of the relationship between security sector reform and governance relative to time and quality|left]]To observe and measure the quality of SSG as well as set more definite objectives, [[international development]] actors generally break down good security sector governance into different principless that are believed to showcase different subparts of a healthy security sector under democratic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|title=What is Good Governance?|last=|first=|date=2009-06-10|website=United Nations ESCAP|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153306/http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|archivedate=2017-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exact configurations vary, some of the most common principles or objectives of good SSG that are commonly used include [[accountability]], [[rule of law]], and [[effectiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|title=Security Sector Governance and Reform: Guidelines for OSCE Staff|last=|first=|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825185357/http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Thomas G.|date=2000-10-01|title=Governance, good governance and global governance: Conceptual and actual challenges|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713701075|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=21|issue=5|pages=795–814|doi=10.1080/713701075|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors: For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, the [[use of force]] is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent [[law]]s are in place; oversight and [[separation of powers]] mechanisms are established and working; and the state's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] use of force is regulated through strategies and policies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An operational level example would be improved and open interaction between the public and the security sector, including functioning [[freedom of information]] and [[complaint]] institutes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

SSR is aimed at the existence of both national security and [[human security]]. However, the goals of providing national and human security can be conflictual in the context of conflict-torn societies which lack the framework of democratic governance. According to Florian Weigand, the experiences of SSR in [[Afghanistan]], for example, have prompted a debate on the advantages of providing human rather than state security in the process of state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP135.pdf|title=How can security sector reforms contribute to State-Building?

SSR is not understood by researchers to be limited to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, [[Provisional government|transitional]] and [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after [[war]] has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|title=Security Governance in Post-Conflict Peacebuilding|last=Bryden|first=Alan|last2=Hänggi|first2=Heiner|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2005|isbn=978-3-8258-9019-3|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024200/http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanaa, Jane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4327">{{Tort law}}
The '''tort of seduction''' was a civil wrong or [[tort]] in [[common law]] legal systems, and still exists in some jurisdictions. 

An unmarried woman could sue on the grounds of [[seduction]] to obtain damages from her seducer, if her [[Sexual consent|consent to sex]] was based upon his misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="pos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Posner|year=1994|title=Sex and Reason|page=81|isbn=0-674-80279-9|quote=The tort of seduction allows an unmarried woman (formerly her father or other guardian), usually but not always a virgin, to obtain damages from her seducer, provided that he made misrepresentations to obtain her consent to sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
Initially, the tort of seduction was a remedy for a father's property interest in his daughter's chastity.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; However, the damages to which the father would be entitled were based on the father's loss of the working services of a daughter, much as a master could sue if a third-party caused injury to his servant that rendered the servant unable to work, because she was "seduced and debauched" and became pregnant as a result of nonmarital sexual activity. The tort of seduction was one of the most common civil actions toward the end of the 19th century, and fathers were often successful before juries.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20030211.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 20th century, the action was criticised as maintaining "property interests in humans", and the tort was recast to recognize personal injury to the woman, rather than solely deprivation of a father's property right. Most jurisdictions granted the victim (the wronged woman) the right to sue in her own name. (Fathers could still sue as well, on the ground that they had a moral interest in their daughters' chastity).&lt;ref name=findlaw /&gt; The suing woman was "usually but not always a virgin".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt;

==England==
Historically, the seduced female could not bring a suit herself. Rather, it would be brought by her father, acting under the [[legal fiction]] that the parent-child relationship falls under the master-servant relationship. However, if the daughter was a contracted servant, a suit could not be brought by her father against her master.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==Canada==
[[Property and civil rights]] is a [[federalism|provincial power]] in [[Canada]], so all torts can vary by province.

===Ontario===
An Act to make the remedy for cases of seduction more effectual, and to tender the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support, was passed in [[Upper Canada]] on March 4, 1837. Amending traditional [[common law]], it allowed fathers to sue their daughters' masters for the tort of seduction. It also held [[biological father]]s liable for children conceived out of wedlock.

The Seduction Act was repealed in 1978.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey|first=Martha|year=1991|title=Girls and Masters: The Tort of Seduction and the Support of Bastards|journal=Canadian Journal of Family Law|volume=10|pages=137–162|url=http://faculty.law.ubc.ca/cdnjfl/art/1011991.html#bailey|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
The 1934 [[John Brownlee sex scandal]] revolved around a seduction suit.

===Other provinces===
An 1852 statute in [[Prince Edward Island]] allowed for a seduced woman to sue for herself with this tort.,&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; although damages were capped at 100 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. [[Manitoba]] and the [[North West Territories]] enacted similar legislation around the turn of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the tort of seduction has been abolished in "most states".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt; Fears of fraudulent suits, combined with a turn away from the view of property interests in persons, led to the enactment of "[[heart balm]]" statutes, abolishing causes of action for seduction, [[breach of promise]], [[alienation of affection]], [[criminal conversation]], etc. in most states in the 20th century.

The founding of SFG coincided with a period of oscillating developments in India-Pakistan relations. SFG produced an assessment of the [[cost of conflict]] between the two countries. India's then External Affairs Minister [[Yashwant Sinha]], in a [[suo moto]] letter addressed to the President of SFG, described it as a valuable tool for the practitioners of foreign policy. SFG went on to undertake a similar exercise for [[Sri Lanka]]. This report too attracted considerable attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hindustan Times, September 2006, Sri Lanka is the Most Militarised Society [http://www.strategicforesight.com/sfgnews_186.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, its report, The Final Settlement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm#finalsettlement The Final Settlement]&lt;/ref&gt; created a public debate; for the first time it identified the centrality of the water dimension in the [[India-Pakistan relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Bowring in the New York Times on SFG's report The Final Settlement [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/07/opinion/07iht-edbow.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into [[Urdu]] as well as [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

While SFG focused on [[South Asia]] including [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-2282296,prtpage-1.cms|title=How to ensure freedom from future shock - The Economic Times|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its initial period, it has since widened the scope of its work to address [[terrorism]], [[clash of civilizations]], [[cost of conflict]], [[water security]] and global governance issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/indopak-conflict-positive-costs-zero-benefits/103689/|title=Indo-Pak Conflict: Positive Costs, Zero Benefits|work=The Financial Express|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, SFG convened a [[roundtable]] to prepare a common intellectual framework for deconstructing terror. Since then SFG has been invited by Prime Ministers, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and governments of several countries in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] for policy consultations.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Naumann Stiftung and Alliance and Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament [http://www.fnst-freiheit.org/uploads/1404/3rdRTReport.pdf]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, SFG and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe, jointly convened a roundtable at the [[European Parliament]], [[Brussels]], involving serving and former cabinet ministers and parliamentarians from the Middle East and [[Europe]]. The roundtable adopted the [http://www.strategicforesight.com/wir-secrt_brusselsconsensus.htm [[Brussels]] Consensus] on the principles and policies for a safer world. At the roundtable, Dr. Wolfgang Gerhardt, Chairman of the [[Friedrich Naumann Foundation]], said "Strategic Foresight Group has a track record in exploring value-based working solutions to the problems of society. This is their intention here (at the 3rd Roundtable). It is also our intention at the FNSt."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Wolfgang Gerhardt, Chairman of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, speaking at the European Parliament, Brussels, 26 November 2007 [http://www.fnst-freiheit.org/webcom/show_article.php/_c-705/_nr-135/printmode-true/i.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006–2007: West-Islam relations==
The [http://www.strategicforesight.com/wir-thirdroundtable.htm Third International Roundtable]  was organised by Strategic Foresight Group and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] at the European Parliament, Brussels, on 26–27 November 2006. The Roundtable was endorsed by the [[League of Arab States]]. It engaged important public institutions from the Western and Islamic worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Comments on the theme paper of the Second International Roundtable on Constructing Peace, Deconstructing Terror {{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2411/html/national.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325221347/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2411/html/national.htm |archivedate=25 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 40 leaders from Europe, Asia and the Middle East participated in the Roundtable. They included serving [[cabinet ministers]], former ministers, leaders of [[parliamentary]] groups, special envoys of the heads of [[multilateralism|multilateral]] organisations and directors of important institutions. The distinguished group recommended an Inclusive Semi Permanent Conference on Peace in the Middle East, Western Islamic Dialogue and Engagement Initiative, International Historical Study Group on Common Human Civilisation, Arab Islamic [[Renaissance]] Initiative and the promotion of the Compact of Dialogue-Democracy-Development. The Roundtable welcomed the Report of the High Level Group of the [[Alliance of Civilizations]] of the [[United Nations]].

At the beginning of 2007 Strategic Foresight Group brought out its global research report ''An Inclusive World: in which the West, Islam and the Rest have a stake''. Prof [[Shlomo Ben-Ami]], former Foreign Minister of [[Israel]] describes this "as the most comprehensive approach to solve the crisis of our time that has ever been proposed." Prof Kamel Abu Jaber, former Foreign Minister of [[Jordan]], calls it "hope in an otherwise hopeless international system." The philosophy of An Inclusive World could be subject of a new global debate to overcome the divides at the beginning of the 21st [[century]]. The report was debated by [[Oxford University]] at one of the famous Oxford Union debates in May. It also featured three times in the debates at the House of Commons. The European Parliament and the League of Arab States circulated it widely among their members. It was translated into Arabic by the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] based in Alexandria, [[Egypt]].

Speaking on the Middle East at the World Economic Forum's Middle East Summit, [[Sundeep Waslekar]] said that the region's primary risk is a "triple deficit" – a democratization deficit combined with a development deficit leads to a dignity deficit, often manifested in instability and violence.

One of the main conclusions of the Third International Roundtable was a proposal for the Inclusive Semi Permanent Conference for the Middle East. In 2008 SFG brought out a position paper on this subject, which was launched at the [[House of Lords]] in May 2008.

==2008: Peace and Security ==
In 2008, SFG continued its work in the [[Cost of conflict]] series, this time focussing on the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/09/02/13/10285092.html Gulf News, 12 February 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520053309/https://gulfnews.com/news/mena/palestine/conflict-bleeds-middle-east-dry-1.51284 |date=20 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in alignment with its other work. The report on ''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East'' was launched at the United Nations office in Geneva in January 2009. It featured in floor debates in the House of Commons and House of Lords. It was discussed by a panel of ministers and senior diplomats at the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations when the latter hosted its forum in Istanbul in April 2009. The report was also discussed at the World Economic Forum Middle East summit at the Dead Sea in May 2009. It has since featured in several hundred newspapers, websites and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;The Cost of Enduring Middle East Conflict is Prohibitive, Tom Dine, 30 March 2009 [http://www.israelpolicyforum.org/blog/cost-enduring-middle-east-conflict-prohibitive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505232356/http://www.israelpolicyforum.org/blog/cost-enduring-middle-east-conflict-prohibitive |date=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1231&amp;p=business&amp;a=1  Review of Cost of Conflict in the Middle East in the Yemen Times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070405/http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1231&amp;p=business&amp;a=1 |date=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SFG came out with a report on 20 trends that would affect global security and economy in the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiawaterportal.org/Network/interview/ngos/devika_eng.html  Interview with Devika Mistry on Water Scarcity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715185212/http://indiawaterportal.org/Network/interview/ngos/devika_eng.html |date=15 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, SFG expanded the scope of its work with an international conference on Responsibility to the Future. It was co-hosted by the [[United Nations Global Compact]], inaugurated by the [[President of India]] and attended by experts from 25 countries. Following the recommendations of the conference, SFG decided to address issues of water security in Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasecurity.macfound.org/news/entry/ Strategic Foresight Group Launches Project on Water Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051824/http://asiasecurity.macfound.org/news/entry/ |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Middle East.

==2009–2014: Water security==
In 2009, SFG decided to focus on preventing conflicts arising out of resource scarcity, with focus on water.

An international workshop on Water Stress and Climate Change in the Himalayan River Basins was organised in August 2009 in [[Kathmandu]] bringing together experts and policy makers on water issues from [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;First International Workshop on Water Stress and [[Climate Change]] in Asia [http://www.strategicforesight.com/Kathmandu%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Second International Workshop was held in [[Dhaka]] in January 2010. It resulted in the Dhaka Declaration on [[Water Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151168&amp;cid=2|title=bdnews24.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192301/http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151168&amp;cid=2|archivedate=20 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dhaka Declaration highlights the significance of the rivers that flow from the [[Himalayas]] and the urgent need for cooperation between Basin countries. It has been predicted that due to the combined effect of melting of glaciers, extreme weather events and pollution, the rivers in the Eastern Himalayas will lose their flow from anywhere from 5 to 20 percent by 2050. This will have affect river flows mostly in the lean period, undermining plans to produce [[hydroelectricity]] and promote inland water navigation in the region.

The Dhaka Declaration proposes an exchange of scientific data, particularly in the low flow period and joint research projects. It underscores the risk of conflicts due to [[water scarcity]] and floods leading to migration on a large scale. A report titled ''The Himalayan Challenge: Water Security in Emerging Asia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/85801himalayan-challenge.pdf  The Himalayan Challenge: Water Security in Emerging Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, 20 August 2010, India can't talk away inflation [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703579804575441020169731944?mod=googlenews_wsj]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times of India, 25 July 2010, Water Wars: India, China and the Great Thirst [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-25/special-report/28308457_1_water-wars-water-resources-water-deficit]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in June 2010. This report is the first of its kind which evaluates future water balance and risks in India, China, Nepal and Bangladesh until the year 2030. A second report titled ''Himalayan Solutions'' was published in January 2011.

In February 2010, an  international initiative on Water Security in the Middle East was launched at Montreux, Switzerland, on 15–16 February, with two workshops attracting the participation of 60 leading policymakers, including members of Parliament, former Cabinet Ministers, senior leaders of Water Commissions and heads of research institutions from across the Middle East. In preparation for the workshops, SFG had held consultations with leaders in the Middle East, and distinguished experts from several countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategicforesight.com/conference_pdf/57307Montreux%20Report-Final%20-%20Feb.%202010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A workshop was held in Sanliurfa, a town in [[Turkey]] close to the Syrian border to discuss collaborative solutions to the issue of water security in the Middle East. Participants at the level of former Ministers and heads of Departments in Water Ministries participated in the workshop. A report titled ''The Blue Peace: Rethinking Middle East Water'' was launched by the [[President of Switzerland]], [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emwis.org/thematicdirs/news/2011/02/new-strategic-foresight-group-report-blue-peace-rethinking-middle-east-water|title=Euro-Mediterranean Information System on know-how in the Water sector - International portal|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/20/arab-nations-water-running-out|title=What does the Arab world do when its water runs out?|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=33830  Jordan Times, 25 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=207898  Jerusalem Post, 12 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=433959&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16  Gulf Times, 11 May 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923085529/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=433959&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |date=23 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, a High-Level Group was established under the Chairmanship of HRH Prince [[Hassan bin Talal of Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/HLG-%20Jordan%20Times.pdfSite_Id=1&amp;lang=2&amp;NewsID=66309&amp;CatID=13&amp;Type=Home&amp;GType=1  The Jordan Times, 11 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, SFG began addressing the issue of sustainable and collaborative solutions to the [[Nile River]] Basin in [[Africa]]. The Nile has been governed by agreements that date back to colonial times and give [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] majority share of water. The Nile Basin Countries have drafted a new Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) to replace the old agreements. This has created tensions between riparian countries. SFG organised a workshop in [[Zurich]] in early 2012 bringing together members of parliaments, diplomats and scholars from these regions to discuss current and future prospects for the River. It published a report ''Blue Peace for the Nile''&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/84153Blue%20Peace%20for%20the%20Nile.pdf Blue Peace in the Nile, SFG&lt;/ref&gt; which was launched on 22 March 2013, that also happens to be World Water Day.

SFG has developed the concept of Mega Arc of Hydro Insecurity, spanning from Vietnam and Thailand in the East across [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] to the [[Middle East]] and [[Turkey]] and further downwards from [[Egypt]] to [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21538687  Unquenchable Thirst, The Economist, 19 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Will Water Security Increase Tensions Across Asia, Forbes (India), 6 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

HRH Hassan bin Talal, Chairman of the United Nations Secretary General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation launched the SFG report ''Water Cooperation for a Secure World'' &lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/20795water-cooperature-sm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Amman]] on 28 November 2013. The report examines for the first time the relationship between water and peace around the world and is based on the study of 148 countries and 205 shared river basins. It concludes that any two nations engaged in active water cooperation do not go to war. Out of the 148 countries covered, 37 countries are not engaged in any significant degree of cooperation with their neighbouring countries. These 37 countries also face the risk of war.

In the report, SFG developed a new Water Cooperation Quotient,&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28799WCQ-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is a measure of active cooperation by riparian countries in the management of water resources using 10 parameters including legal, political, technical, environmental, economic and institutional aspects. It is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the best performance.

SFG also launched the report ''Rivers of Peace - Restructuring India-Bangladesh Relations'' &lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publications_inner.php?id=33&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013. This report provides a new formula to resolve the impasse over the Teesta River Agreement between India and Bangladesh.

A major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved at a meeting organised by SFG in 2014. The outcome of the meeting which was held in Geneva has been referred to as the "Geneva Consensus On Tigris River".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/WaterResources/showAnalysisAgenda.aspx?ID=2735&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual High-Level Forum on Blue Peace in the Middle East at Istanbul in September 2014. About 90 policymakers, Members of Parliament, serving and former Ministers, media leaders, academics and water experts from across the Middle East came together for this event.  Participants proposed concrete initiatives at bilateral as well as regional levels to promote cooperation and sustainable management of water resources in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-levant.com/blue-peace-initiative-continues-efforts-bring-peace-middle-east/|title="Blue Peace initiative" continues its efforts to bring peace to the Middle East|work=The Levant News|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, SFG launched two reports: ''The Hydro-Insecure: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East ''&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/19317hydro-insecure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Water and Violence: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East'',&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which highlight the challenges of water security and the larger effect it has on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansecurityproject.org/the-middle-east-struggles-with-water-security/|title=The Middle East Struggles with Water Security|work=American Security Project|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the reports highlight that water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty, war and conflict, low women's development and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/mena/jordan/refugees-exacerbate-water-crisis-in-middle-east-1.1475639|title=Refugees exacerbate water crisis in the Middle East|author=Jumana Khamis, Staff Reporter|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 'Hydro Insecure: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East' report, 40 million people are hydro-insecure, out of the total population of Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, which is roughly 140 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/water-cooperation-key-to-ensuring-peace-1.1475648|title=Water cooperation key to ensuring peace|author=Jumana Khamis, Staff Reporter|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFG also analyses major global changes and shares perspectives at international conferences.

==Since 2014: Critical Global Challenges==

SFG is addressing major paradigm shifts due to major scientific, technological, environmental, economic, social, and political factors.

In 2011, SFG published a document titled ''Big Questions of Our Time'' which addresses issues that will affect humanity in the next 50 years, approximately until 2060. It has since been involved in analysing critical global challenges and linkages between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/67141BQOT.pdf Big Questions of Our Time, Strategic Foresight Group, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace was launched in Geneva in 2015. It was co-convened by 15 countries and chaired by [[Danilo Turk]], the former president of Slovenia and former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations. Strategic Foresight Group was selected to help the Panel in developing political and substantive recommendations. The Panel launched its report in September 2017 which advocates a number of specific recommendations on protecting water infrastructure in conflict zones, preferential and concessional finance for trans-boundary water projects, new mechanisms for hydro-diplomacy. &lt;ref&gt;A Matter of Survival: Report of the High Level Panel on Water and Peace

In 2016, Strategic Foresight Group briefed the historic [[United Nations Security Council]] in [[New York City]]. It was for the first time that the UNSC had convened an open debate on "water, peace and security". SFG President [[Sundeep Waslekar]] was one of the four briefers along with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]], Chairman of the [[Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace]] [[Danilo Türk]] and ICRC Vice President [[Christine Beerli]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webtv.un.org/watch/part-1-open-debate-on-water-peace-and-security-security-council-7818th-meeting/5221217671001&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12598.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Strategic Foresight Group launched the second edition of the Water Cooperation Quotient, a rare document analyzing water cooperation in all of the world's shared river basins. The [[InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government]] provided the Foreword, authored by its two co-chairs, Mr [[Bertie Ahern]], former Prime Minister of Ireland and President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], former President of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Water Cooperation Quotient 2017 [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/Water%20Cooperation%20Quotient%202017.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endorsements==
"The study by the Strategic Foresight Group represents a valuable input into global thinking about the situation in the [[Middle East]]. Many of these costs cannot be assigned a monetary value: the loss of human lives, the despair and humiliation of displaced populations, the damage to the very fabric of societies, the rise and persistence of a culture of violence, fear and extremism. The attempts made in the report to quantify the effect of conflict across a wide variety of sectors are nevertheless commendable." — Mr Sergei A.

"The [[International Development Committee]], which I chair, had an informal briefing this morning from Strategic Foresight Group. Its ideas about and analysis of the causes of division, terrorism and extremism are interesting. It also makes some practical suggestions for tackling that." — The Rt. Hon.

"Given these failures, many people will warmly welcome the ''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East'',&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28458Lessons%20Learnt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a report produced by Strategic Foresight Group with wide international backing. This report charts spending on wars, plus the vast annual costs of military, police, security, relief and aid. Despite such spending, I am informed that 91 per cent of Israelis still feels insecure. The report points out that the overall standard of living in the Middle East would have doubled had comprehensive peace been available from 1991. It assesses the cost of lost opportunities and the potential of new, linked-up economies. I trust that this report will lead to changed policies in East and West, and will stimulate co-operative behaviour.

"It is a particular pleasure for us to have the Swedish International Development Agency and Strategic Foresight Group as partners in the Blue Peace Initiative, launched by the countries in the Middle East. This initiative has raised high expectations regarding the future of water and peace in the Middle East. The Blue Peace highlights solutions emerging of this one-year high-level multi stakeholder dialogue. SDC with the partners of the Blue Peace is ready to Action."

"Water was always a source of conflict, but what has changed in recent years is that it is being seen much more clearly in that light. It is, therefore, appropriate that Strategic Foresight Group has gone to the heart of the region which is most conflict prone-the Middle East to look at this aspect of what constitutes an impediment to peace and prosperity."
— [[Baroness Falkner of Margravine]] ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) in the [[House of Lords]] on 27 October 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?gid=2011-10-27a.956.0|title=My Lords, it is a particular...: 27 Oct 2011: House of Lords debates - TheyWorkForYou|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This ground-breaking report is the only document that offers analysis on the risk of conflict and potential for cooperation among the 146 countries that have shared or transboundary rivers. The Water Cooperation Quotient is an effective decision-making tool for water cooperation and a badly needed barometer for assessing risks of war; one that the [[InterAction Council]] urges be employed around the world to promote peace, ensure security and improve human and planetary health through cooperation over shared waters, now and in the future." — [[Olusegun Obasanjo]],  President of Nigeria, 1999-2007 and  Bertie Ahern , Prime Minister of Ireland, 1997-2008 (Co-chairs of InterAction Council)

"This fascinating report provides a unique insight into the state of transboundary water cooperation worldwide and offers a valuable instrument for management of disputes and prevention of conflict. It should become a standard manual in the “toolbox” of policy makers and diplomats and serve in their efforts to devise effective conflict prevention strategies. Moreover, the water cooperation quotient should inspire policy makers to think and use the full potential of water cooperation for the well-being of their peoples." - [[Danilo Turk]],  President of Slovenia, 2007-2012, Chairman of the [[Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace]] 

"This report offers detailed and unassailable analysis on the risk of conflict and same time outlines possibilities for potential cooperation among the 146 countries that share transboundary rivers. The Water Cooperation Quotient is an effective conflict prevention and peace-making tool for water cooperation and it should be present on the mind and action of every decision-making authority around the world." — J. [[Ramos-Horta]] , President of Timor-Leste, 2007-2012, Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, 2006-2007, [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate, 1996

'''The Dalmarnock fire tests''' are a series of fire experiments that were conducted in a real high-rise building in the United Kingdom.

In 2006, the [[BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], conducted this series of large-scale fire tests in a high-rise building in collaboration with the BBC series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'', [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]], [[Glasgow Housing Association]], [[Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service|Strathclyde Fire Brigade]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], Lion TV, [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], [[Building Research Establishment|BRE]], [[Xtralis]] and Powerwall Systems Ltd, among other contributors.

==Description==
The building, a 23-storey reinforced-concrete tower located at 4 Millerfield Place in [[Dalmarnock]], Glasgow, was scheduled for demolition and hence was evacuated of tenants. Three main experiments were conducted over two days, from 25 to 26 July 2006. Tests One and Two took place in identical flats, the main compartment of which had been fitted with regular living room and office furniture, arranged to provide conditions that favour repeatability. Test Three was a smaller smoke management experiment held in one of the two main emergency exit stairwells.

Tests One and Two were fully instrumented with a high sensor density, including measurements of temperature, incident heat, gas velocities, smoke obscuration, wall temperature and structure deflection, among others. The tests varied in that Test One allowed the fire to develop freely to post-[[flashover]] conditions, while Test Two incorporated sensor-informed ventilation management and was extinguished before post-flashover conditions were attained. Both tests had approximately 300 sensors monitoring several different characteristics of the fire environment, but Test One had about 160 additional sensors monitoring the structural response.

These experiments endeavoured to establish a highly monitored fire in a realistic residential scenario, allowing for several different modern fire safety engineering tools to be tested. The comprehensive set of data collected is being used for validation of different [[mathematical model]]s of fire dynamics. Because the data has a spatial resolution high enough to be comparable to typical resolutions of [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] fire models, the tests are specially well suited for validation of this type of models. The tests also form an integral part of the research conducted for the FireGrid research project,&lt;ref name="FireGrid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1156 |title=FireGrid Project |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the development of emergency control systems that use continuous sensor data and computer modelling, to provide forecast of the fire evolution and aid the efficient deployment of resources.

==Analysis and dissemination==
Analysis of the copious amounts of test data collected will take several years to complete. Nevertheless, there has been significant dissemination activities of the findings to date in the form of several related journal and conference papers; a one-day seminar introducing the tests and highlighting the analysis and conclusions to date (held in Edinburgh, November 2007);&lt;ref name="Dalmarnock FireSeat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fireseat.eng.ed.ac.uk/dalmarnock-fire-tests-experiments-and-modelling |title=FireSeat The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book detailing the tests and analysis completed to date was published in November 2007. The book, entitled ''The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling'',&lt;ref name="Dalmarnock Book @ WorldCat"&gt;{{cite web |title=WorldCat: The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/419909727 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises material covering characterisation and comparison of both the Test One and Test Two fires; experimental error analysis; evaluation of the fire detection systems; calculation of heat transfer to the structure; analysis of the structural behaviour; evaluation of ceiling fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) performance; and comparison of both [[a priori and a posteriori]] computational fire, modelling against experimental data allowing for an evaluation of such the current use of tools.

The overall aim of the Dalmarnock fire tests is to improve understanding of how building fire emergencies can be handled in the most effective manner, while providing further insights into the fundamentals of compartment fire dynamics and fire-induced structural behaviour.

'''Tom show''' is a general term for any [[Play (theatre)|play]] or [[Musical theatre|musical]] based (often only loosely) on the 1852 novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. The novel attempts to depict the harsh reality of [[slavery]]. Due to the weak copyright laws at the time, a number of unauthorized plays based on the novel were staged for decades, many of them mocking the novel's strong characters and social message, and leading to the pejorative term "[[Uncle Tom]]".

Even though ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story in a stage play or musical than read the book.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/e_cabin.html "People &amp; Events: Uncle Tom's Cabin Takes the Nation by Storm"] ''Stephen Foster'', The American Experience, PBS, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these shows were essentially [[minstrel shows]] that utilized caricatures and [[stereotype]]s of black people, and thus inverting the intent of the novel. "Tom shows" were popular in the United States from the 1850s through the early 1900s.

== The shows ==

Stage plays based on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''&amp;mdash;"Tom shows"&amp;mdash;began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics&amp;mdash;some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.&lt;ref name="lott"&gt;Lott, Eric. ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-507832-2}}. The information on "Tom shows" comes from chapter 8: ''Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production'', pp.&amp;nbsp;211–233&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the productions also featured songs by [[Stephen Foster]], including "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]," "[[Old Folks at Home]]," and "Massa's in the Cold Ground."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

Stowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of her [[puritan]]ical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]]'s version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was "delighted" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy).&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Asa Hutchinson of the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]], whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.

Eric Lott, in his book ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class'', estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just [[blackface]] [[minstrel shows]] only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes of mockery, some of the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.&lt;ref name="lott" /&gt;

== Productions ==

[[File:Eliza-Crossing-the-Ice-Morgan-1881.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Eliza crossing the ice, in an 1881 theater poster for a production by the Jarrett &amp; London Company and Slavin's Original American Troupe.]]

All "Tom shows" appear to have incorporated elements of [[melodrama]] and [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].

The first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by [[Charles W. Taylor|C.W. Taylor]] at [[Chatham Theatre|Purdy's National Theater]] (New York City); it ran for about ten performances in August&amp;ndash;September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring [[T.D. Rice]]. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly [[racism|racist]] blackface character [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in January 1854 at New York's [[Bowery Theatre]], the ''[[Spirit of the Times]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' reviewer described him as "decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama."

The best-known "Tom Shows" were those of [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] and [[H.J. Conway]].&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt;

Aiken's original ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star [[Cordelia Howard]]); a sequel, ''The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely'' told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his defiant speech received "great cheers" from an audience of Bowery [[b'hoy and g'hal|b'hoys and g'hals]]. Even this most sympathetic of "Tom shows" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[Old Folks at Home]]" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning November 15, 1852 in [[Troy, New York]], the play opened in New York City July 18, 1853, where its success was even greater.

Conway's production opened in [[Boston]] the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; [[P.T. Barnum]] brought it to his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in New York November 7, 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, "buffoons". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced [[Yankee]] character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a [[John C. Calhoun]]. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the ''normal'' mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.

Showmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad caricature for laughs, dressing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with a dainty umbrella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a pig.

== Diluting the message of Stowe's book ==

"Tom shows" were so popular that there were even pro-slavery versions. Among the most popular was ''Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom'', produced in 1852 at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] Museum.&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Lott mentions numerous "offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals" including a full-scale play by [[Christy's Minstrels]] and a parody by Conway himself called ''Uncle Pat's Cabin'', and records that the story in its many variants "dominated northern popular culture… for several years".

According to Eric Lott, even those "Tom shows" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the [[feminism|feminist]] aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism.&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the "lightness and gayety" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, the plays increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).

== Influence ==

The influence of the "Tom shows" can be found in a number of plays from the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's ''Dred'', but also [[J.T. Trowbridge]]'s abolitionist play ''Neighbor Jackwood'', [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[The Octoroon]]'', and a play called ''The Insurrection'', based on [[John Brown (abolitionist)#Raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].

[[File:1903UncleTomFilm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the first "full length" movies. The still shows Eliza telling Uncle Tom that she has been sold and that she is running away to save her child.]]

The influence of the "Tom shows" also carried over into the [[silent film]] era (with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' being the most-filmed story of that time period).&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and "Tom shows," meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film"/&gt;

Several of the early film versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin were essentially filmed versions of "Tom shows." These included:

* A 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the earliest "full-length" movies (although "full-length" at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv03hp.html The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This film, directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], used white actors in [[blackface]] in the major roles and black performers only as [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. This version was similar to many of the "Tom Shows" of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"/&gt;
*Another film version from 1903 was directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starred Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. While no copies of Lubin's film still exist, according to accounts the movie was similar to Porter's version and reused the sets and costumes from a "Tom Show."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/lubinhp.html "Duping" Porter: Sigmund Lubin's Production (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As cinema replaced [[vaudeville]] and other types of live variety entertainment, "Tom shows" slowly disappeared. [[J.C. Furnas]], in his book ''Goodbye to Uncle Tom'', stated that he had seen a production in the 1920s in Ohio; the last touring group specializing in "Tomming" he could locate was apparently operating as late as the 1950s.
