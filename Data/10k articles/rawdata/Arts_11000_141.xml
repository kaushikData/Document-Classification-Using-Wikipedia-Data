The '''56 Group Wales''' ({{lang-cy|'''Grŵp 56 Cymru'''}}) is an artists' organisation founded in [[Wales]] in 1956, with the aim of promoting Welsh [[Modernist]] art and artists.&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was originally simply the '''56 Group''': "Wales" was added in 1967, in response to a feeling that the organisation's "Welsh origins ought to be re-affirmed".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] version of the name was first used on publicity in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The post-war art establishment in Wales was still very conservative and moves had been afoot since the late 1930s to create a modern art group.&lt;ref name="50 years 14"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), pp. 14-15, {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1956, following a failed attempt to become a ''South Wales Academy of Art'', a "rebellion" took place within the ranks of the ''[[The Welsh Group|South Wales Group]]'' and the ''56 Group'' was established.&lt;ref name="50 years 39"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), pp. 39-43, {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists [[Eric Malthouse]], [[David Tinker (artist)|David Tinker]] and [[Michael Edmonds (artist)|Michael Edmonds]] were the leading instigators. They circulated a statement of purpose and aims and an invitation to join the group to ten leading Welsh artists.

{{cquote|That painters and sculptors believe in a positive and dynamic approach which is aware of the tradition of the past and its fulfilment in the Art of the present. 

That the first aims of painting and sculpture lie in the integration of design and emotion; the search for a powerful image that transcends the everyday world around us. 

That the effect of environment is deeper and more all-embracing than the fortuitous mimicry of everyday surroundings. The painter and sculptor consciously seek a place to work where he feels at home. |author=Eric Malthouse, David Tinker and Michael Edmonds |source=''The 56 Group'': statement of purpose, 1956&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of those invited to join, nine accepted: Trevor Bates, [[Hubert Dalwood]], George Fairley, [[Arthur Giardelli]], Robert Hunter, [[Heinz Koppel]], [[Will Roberts]], John Wright and [[Ernest Zobole]].&lt;ref name="Art in Wales"&gt;Eric Rowan, "Art in Wales: An Illustrated History 1850 - 1980", University of Wales Press, Cardiff (1985), pp. 125-129. {{ISBN|0-7083-1408-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brenda Chamberlain (artist)|Brenda Chamberlain]], the only female artist invited, declined.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 7, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all twelve of the founder-members worked in a broadly modernist and internationalist idiom, they did not share a recognisably common style or ideology. Their average age was 36; and ten worked as [[Art education|art lecturers]] (Roberts and Edmonds did not). Only two, Roberts and Zobole, had been born in Wales: Fairley was born in [[Scotland]], Koppel in [[Germany]] and the others in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The 56 Group has always been essentially an exhibiting association of artists who retain their own independence and individuality. The group's first exhibition was held at [[Worcester]] Museum and Art Gallery in June 1957, and versions of the same exhibition were held later the same year at the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]] and [[Tenby]] Civic Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently exhibited widely in both Wales and England. Its first continental exhibition was held in [[Amsterdam]] in 1967, and later exhibitions went to [[Nantes]] in 1974–5, [[Bologna]] in 1983, [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1986–7 and again in 1991, and [[Libramont-Chevigny|Libramont]], Belgium, in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 22, 38, 58–9, 64–5, 69, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition of modern Welsh art held at the [[Jefferson Place Gallery]], [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1965, although not formally associated with the Group, included work by several of its members.&lt;ref name="Art in Wales" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the Group's 56th anniversary year, it could claim to have had a total of 88 full members (plus a number of guest, associate and honorary members);&lt;ref&gt;Full listings of the membership appear in Moore 2012, pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and to have held 225 exhibition showings.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 86. A full listing of exhibitions appears in Moore 2012, pp. 92–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Painter, sculptor and teacher [[Arthur Giardelli]] was the chair of the Group from 1961 to 1998. Some of its success – exhibitions and tours outside Wales – have been attributed to his language skills and European outlook.&lt;ref name="Giardelli Guardian"&gt;David Moore, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/11/arthur-giardelli-obituary Arthur Giardelli obituary], ''The Guardian'' (London), 11 November 2009. Retrieved 2012-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 11, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, marking the 56th anniversary of the group's formation, a touring exhibition visited galleries around Wales. Called ''The 56 Group Wales: The Founders'', it includes artworks of the twelve original founders, as well as work from current members.&lt;ref name="WM three new shows"&gt;Nathan Bevan, [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/arts-in-wales/2012/04/02/radical-post-war-arts-collective-the-56-group-returns-in-three-new-shows-91466-30671922/2/ 'Radical post-war arts collective the 56 Group returns in three new shows'], Western Mail, 2 April 2012. Retrieved 2012-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; For the previous ten years, businessman Barrie Maskell had spent time tracking down and purchasing work made by each of the twelve original members. This included a visit to one of the surviving founders, John Wright, who was living in Spain.&lt;ref name="WM three new shows" /&gt; Fifty-six of Maskell's paintings were chosen for the exhibition. The exhibition was shown at venues in Pontypridd, Cardiff and [[MOMA, Wales|MOMA Wales]] in [[Machynlleth]].&lt;ref name="WM three new shows" /&gt; In the same year, a history of the Group's first 56 years by David Moore was published.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a touring exhibition of the group's work, ''56:56'', opened at Newport Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.yudu.com/Library/A20nlz/SouthWalesArgusGuide/resources/7.htm 'Art tour celebrates 56 years'], ''South Wales Argus'', 11 January 2013. Retrieved 9 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Group's activities have not always been eulogised. [[Will Roberts]], one of the founder members, who was afterwards (in 1964) asked to withdraw from exhibitions because his work was seen as insufficiently radical, later dismissed the Group as having been "set up by art school teachers who wanted to sell their work".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; When Rollo Charles, keeper of art at the National Museum of Wales, commented in 1976 that the Group "is now generally regarded as the official avant garde of Welsh art", critic Bryn Richards responded "[t]his must seem to those who founded the group, with such hope, as a veritable kiss of death".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned Welsh artist [[Kyffin Williams]] was reported in 1981 to have had a strong antipathy for what he described as a group of "predominantly abstract painters or English [[carpetbagger]]s, ... who came down to Wales because they could not make it in the metropolis. The 56 Group has taken over Welsh art, and he [Williams] is out of favour in his homeland as a result."&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 54: quoting "Painting: Kyffin Williams", ''Avant Garde'', Spring/Summer 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amor Vincit Omnia''''' ("Love Conquers All", known in English by a variety of names including '''''Amor Victorious''''', '''''Victorious Cupid''''', '''''Love Triumphant''''', '''''Love Victorious''''', or '''''Earthly Love''''') is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist [[Caravaggio]].  

''Amor Vincit Omnia'' shows [[Cupid|Amor]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Cupid]], wearing dark eagle wings, half-sitting on or perhaps climbing down from what appears to be a table. Scattered around are the emblems of all human endeavours – violin and lute, armour, coronet, square and compasses, pen and manuscript, bay leaves, and flower, tangled and trampled under Cupid’s foot. The painting illustrates the line from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' X.69, ''Omnia vincit amor et nos cedamus amori'' ("Love conquers all; let us all yield to love!"). A musical manuscript on the floor shows a large "V". It has therefore been suggested also that the picture is a coded reference to the attainments of Marchese [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]: his [[Genoa|Genoese]] family ruled [[Chios]] (until the island's capture by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]) in 1622, hence the coronet; the cultivated Marchese also wrote about [[music]] and [[painting]] (pen, manuscript and musical instruments), was constructing an imposing new palazzo (geometrical instruments), studied [[astronomy]] (astral sphere), and was praised for his  military prowess (armour). The symbology thus holds the possible reading: Vincenzo Conquers All. Giustiniani is said to have prized it above all other works in his collection.&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'', pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject was common for the age. Caravaggio’s treatment is remarkable for the realism of his Cupid – where other depictions, such as a contemporary ''Sleeping Cupid'' by [[Battistello Caracciolo]], show an idealised, almost generic, beautiful boy, Caravaggio’s Cupid is highly individual, charming but not at all beautiful, all crooked teeth and crooked grin: one feels that one would recognise him in the street. The shock of the Caravaggio, quite apart from the dramatic [[chiaroscuro]] lighting and the photographic clarity, is the mingling of the [[allegorical]] and the real, this sense it gives of a child who is having a thoroughly good time dressing up in stage-prop wings with a bunch of arrows and having his picture painted. Nevertheless, despite the clear indications of Caravaggio’s practice of painting direct from a live model, there is an undeniable resemblance to the pose of [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/michelangelo-sculptures17.htm Michelangelo's ''Victory''] now in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]], and it is likely the artist had this in mind.

The painter [[Orazio Gentileschi]] lent Caravaggio the wings as props to be used in the painting, and this allows fairly precise dating of 1602–3. It was an immediate success in the circles of Rome’s intellectual and cultural elite. A poet immediately wrote three [[madrigal (poetry)|madrigal]]s about it, and another wrote a Latin [[epigram]] in which it was first coupled with the Virgilian phrase ''Omnia Vincit Amor'', although this did not become its title until the critic [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]] wrote his life of Caravaggio in 1672. 

Inevitably, much scholarly and non-scholarly ink has been spilled over the alleged [[eroticism]] of the painting.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Yet the [[homoerotic]] content was perhaps not so apparent to Giustiniani’s generation as it has become today. Naked boys could be seen on any riverbank or seashore, and the eroticisation of children is very much a cultural artefact of the present-day rather than Caravaggio's. The story that the Marchese kept ''Amor'' hidden behind a curtain relates to his reported wish that it should be kept as a final ''[[pièce de résistance]]'' for visitors, to be seen only when the rest of the collection had been viewed – in other words, the curtain was to reveal the painting, not to hide it. (According to the historian [[Joachim von Sandrart]], who catalogued the Giustiniani collection in the 1630s, the curtain was only installed at his urging at that time). The challenge is to see the ''Amor Vincit'' through 17th century eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1602, shortly after ''Amor Vincit'' was completed, Cardinal [[Benedetto Giustiniani]], Vincenzo’s brother and collaborator in the creation of the Giustiniani collection of contemporary art, commissioned a painting from the noted artist [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Baglione’s ''Divine and Profane Love'' showed Divine Love separating a juvenile Cupid on the ground in the lower right corner (profane love) from a [[Lucifer]] in the left corner. Its style was thoroughly derivative of Caravaggio (who had recently emerged as a rival for Church commissions) and a clear challenge to the recent ''Amor'', and the younger painter bitterly protested at what he saw as the plagiarism. Taunted by one of Caravaggio’s friends, Baglione responded with a second version, in which the devil was given Caravaggio’s face. Thus began a long and vicious quarrel which was to have unforeseeable ramifications for Caravaggio decades after his death when the unforgiving Baglione became his first biographer.

Sandrart described ''Amor'' as "A life size Cupid after a boy of about twelve...[who] has large brown eagle's wings, drawn so correctly and with such strong colouring, clarity and relief that it all comes to life.".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Robb, ''M'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Symonds (diarist)|Richard Symonds]], an English visitor to Rome about 1649/51, recorded the Cupid as being "ye body and face of his (Caravaggio's) owne boy or servant thait (sic) laid with him"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Robb, ''M'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Italian art historian Giani Pappi has put forward the theory that this Cecco may be identical with [[Cecco del Caravaggio]] ('Caravaggio’s Cecco'), a notable Italian follower of Caravaggio who emerged in the decade after the master’s death. While this remains controversial, there is more widespread support for Pappi's further proposal that Cecco del Caravaggio should be identified as an artist known as Francesco Boneri. Cecco Boneri, if this is his name, appears in many of Caravaggio's paintings, as the juvenile angel supporting Christ in ''[[The Conversion of Saint Paul (Caravaggio)|The Conversion of Saint Paul]]'', (1600–1601) possibly as the angel offering a martyr's palm to the saint in ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' (1599–1600) (although seen only as the top of a curly head of hair), as the young Isaac about to have his throat cut in ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|The Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' (1603), as an adolescent David in ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)]]'' (ca. 1610 – the head is Caravaggio's), and as the [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist]] now in the Capitoline gallery in Rome.

The picture remained in the Giustiniani collection until 1812, when it was purchased by the art dealer [[Féréol Bonnemaison]], and sold to [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in 1815 for the Berlin Museums.&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite book|last=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|title=The Age of Caravaggio|year=1985|page=281|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870993801|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15834365W/The_Age_of_Caravaggio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Around the World'''" was the [[theme tune]] from the [[1956 in film|1956]] [[Film|movie]] ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048960/soundtrack Around the World in 80 Days (1956) - Soundtracks] from [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, only an instrumental version of the song appeared, although the vocal version has become by far the better known one. The song was [[songwriter|written]] by [[Harold Adamson]] and [[Victor Young]]; Young died in 1956, several weeks after the film's release and he received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture]] posthumously. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048960/awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Young's orchestral version was a #13 hit on the Billboard charts in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|date=2004|publisher=Billboard Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-7499-4|page=694|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording by Bing Crosby was the B-side of the Victor Young version in 1957, on Festival SP45-1274 in Australia, and was a joint charting success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">[[File:Bent's Hall, 1879.jpg|thumb|right|Bent's Opera House]]
'''Bent's Opera House''', also known as '''Bent's Hall''', is a three-story building located at 444 Main Street in [[Medina, New York]], in the United States. The building is made of Medina Sandstone and features an opera house on the top floor. Construction began in 1864 and was completed early the next year. The building is named for Don Carlos Bent, a local farmer who owned the property and had the structure erected. A formal dedication ceremony was held on February&amp;nbsp;28, 1865, featuring remarks by a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] officer and patriotic pageantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waldo |first=Russell |title=Medina's Old Hitching Post Days-May 19, 1954 |url=http://www.eggstreet.org/Bent's%20History.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524095909/http://www.eggstreet.org/Bent%27s%20History.pdf |archivedate=May 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many decades, Bent's Opera House was a prominent venue in Medina for concerts, plays, shows, commencements, elections, and other public functions. [[P. T. Barnum]] and [[Buffalo Bill|William "Buffalo Bill" Cody]] were among the hundreds of touring performers who brought their talents to the Bent's stage.

As motion pictures and other forms of entertainment became popular in the twentieth century, the Opera House fell into disuse. Yet its legacy was not completely forgotten, as Bent's Hall was included as a contributing property to Medina's [[Main Street Historic District (Medina, New York)|Main Street Historic District]], which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995.

In 2010, [[Bank of America]], the building's last commercial owner, donated the Bent's Hall property to the Orleans Renaissance Group, Inc. (ORG), a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to bringing arts and cultural programs to the greater Medina community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kropf |first=Virginia |title=Historic Medina opera donated to local group |url=http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_b630c1e6-083e-5f7c-9b53-dab2b5aa6850.html?mode=story |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204031509/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_b630c1e6-083e-5f7c-9b53-dab2b5aa6850.html?mode=story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |newspaper=Batavia Daily News |date=November 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of ORG hope to restore the Opera House to its former glory as a functioning performance venue.

In 2012, Bent's Opera House was included on the Preservation League of New York State's annual "Seven to Save" list. This list highlights "valued historic resources [that] are in danger of disappearing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservenys.org/seven-2012/seven-05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311201757/http://www.preservenys.org/seven-2012/seven-05.html |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==
The company was founded in 2000 by Douglas Ross, who had previously run a computer systems company, and Andrew Bilinski, who had worked for the [[US Air Force]], [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] &amp; BDM International.  Ross originally come up with the idea for Booksfree in 1999, and after selling his company was looking at what to do next.  [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million of start-up funding was provided by friends &amp; associates.  In 2008, Booksfree was recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of America’s top 5,000 fastest growing privately held companies.  In February 2009 they shipped their 2 millionth book.  In May 2010, the company launched a complementary online book and audiobook swap service [http://www.booksfreeswap.com BooksfreeSwap].  The free book swap service was developed in response to customer demand for books and audiobooks that were not available through their rental service.  An audiobook download and streaming service [http://www.audiobooksnow.com AudiobooksNow] was started by Booksfree in January 2012 to meet the growing demand for digital content.  On November 2, 2016 Booksfree rebranded itself as [http://www.booklender.com BookLender].  The company felt the name BookLender better represents what the company does.&lt;ref name="FairfaxTimes20070411" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPost20021002"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bookmobile Reinvented; Va.

==Business model==
The company has been described as "the books version of [[Netflix]]",&lt;ref name="O200703"&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Junkies, Rejoice! | url=http://www.booksfree.com/oprah_article.shtml | date=2007-03-01 | accessdate=2008-04-14 | publisher=O the Oprah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore has a similar business model to [[online DVD rental]] companies.  Titles are offered in [[paperback]], [[compact disc|CD]] &amp; [[MP3]] CD [[audiobook]] formats.  Separate monthly membership plans are offered for each medium starting at $9.99 for books, $12.99 for MP3-CD audiobooks &amp; $22.49 for CD &amp; MP3 CD audiobooks.  A combination membership encompassing all media is also available.  Each plan limits the number of items that can be checked out at any one time.  Subscribers can pay a higher monthly fee in order to increase that limit.  It is also possible to rent individual titles without having a membership.&lt;ref name="BFAvailMem"&gt;{{cite web | title=Available Membership Plans | url=http://www.booksfree.com/available_plans.shtml | publisher=Booksfree | accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitive environment==
The company's founders were quoted in 2002 as considering their main competition to be [[libraries]] and online book retailers, noting that each has drawbacks compared with Booksfree.&lt;ref name="WashPost20021002" /&gt;  Comparisons between the services generally focus upon the availability of audiobooks from Booksfree and their decision to not carry [[hardcover]] books.&lt;ref name="PW20070702"&gt;{{cite news |title=Netflix Book Model Draws Competitors |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6456823.html |first=Lynn |last=Andriani |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313081005/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6456823.html |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3621">'''Carola Hansson-Boëthius''' (born 7 September 1942) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] novelist, dramatist and translator.&lt;ref name=ll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordicwomensliterature.net/writer/hansson-carola-0|title=Hansson, Carola|author=Lisbeth Larsson|work=The History of Nordic Women's Literature|accessdate=24 January 2015|language=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Stockholm]], Carola Hansson studied Russian and history of art and literature at [[Uppsala University]]. Together with [[Karin Lindén]], she authored her first work in 1980, ''Samtal med kvinnor i Moskva'', translated into English as ''Moscow Women: Thirteen Interviews'', published in 1983.&lt;ref name="HanssonLidén1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansson|first1=Carola|last2=Lidén|first2=Karin |author3=George Blecher |author4=Lone Thygesen-Blecher|title=Moscow Women: Thirteen Interviews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWeM_GBfM4sC|year=1983|publisher=[[Allison &amp; Busby]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-85031-565-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hansson's first novel, ''Det drömda barnet'' (The Dream Child) was published in 1983, presenting the feelings of fear and longing she experienced in childhood and which typify her later works, especially ''Pojken från Jerusalem'' (1986), ''De två trädgårdarna'' (1989) and ''Resan till det blå huset'' (1991). She became widely recognized in 1994 with ''Andrej'', a novel about the [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] family, which was well received by the critics.&lt;ref name=ll/&gt;&lt;ref name=norstets/&gt; Her most recent work, ''Med ett namn som mitt'' (With a Name like Mine, 2009), follows on from ''Andrej'' in an episode based on a meeting between the author and someone who claims to have known Tolstoy's son, [[Ilya Tolstoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/litteratur/tillbaka-hos-tolstoj_3432801.svd|title=Tillbaka hos Tolstoj |publisher=SvD Kultur|accessdate=24 January 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cath Finntrágha'''''&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Alternative spellings include ''Cath Finntrága'' (Meyer) and ''Cath Fionntrágha''.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''The Battle of Ventry'''''&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Alternative English titles include ''The Battle of Ventry / Ventry Harbour/ Ventry Strand / the White Strand''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Early Modern Irish]] prose narrative of the [[Finn Cycle]]. It dates probably to the 15th century in its current form, but apparently relied on older material. It concerns the deeds of the warrior-hero [[Finn mac Cumaill]] and his ''[[fianna]]'' as they defend Ireland against a foreign invasion led by the world-king Dáire Donn.

==Synopsis==
[[Dáire]] (or Dáiri) Donn, called "king of the great world" and ostensibly the most powerful ruler in Europe, intends to invade Ireland. Apart from seeking to gratify a more general ambition to conquer territory, he has a pretext and motif which are directed at [[Finn mac Cumaill]] in person. First of all, Dáire seeks retribution for the fact that Finn has eloped with the wife and daughter of Bolcán (Vulcan), King of France, when in the mercenary service of the latter. Second, Dáire's sense of honour and pride is ignited by stories about Finn's successes. He musters a large body of forces from all across Europe and invades Ireland at ''Finntraighe'' (lit. 'fair strand'), the shore of [[Ventry]] ([[County Kerry]]), near [[Dingle]]. A mighty and protracted battle ensues. Finn's son [[Oisín]] faces Bolcán in combat, who much like [[Buile Shuibhne|Suibne Geilt]], goes insane and flies off, ultimately landing at Glenn Bolcáin. The young son of the King of Ulster arrives with a troop of boys to rally to Finn's support but is killed. It is only when the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] are called in that the Irish become victorious. When Finn slays Dáire Donn and the Greek amazon Ógarmach, the invaders admit defeat and take flight.

==Manuscripts and textual history==
The text in its present form was probably written in the 15th century and is represented by two vellum manuscripts: (1) Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B. 487, 1–11, and (2) Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 29 (''olim'' 23 L 24), 328–337, 355–361. In a note to Rawlinson B. 487, the scribe [[Finnlaech Ó Cathasaigh]] of Tirawley (County Mayo) declares to have composed the tale for Sadbh Ní Mháille (daughter of Tadg Ó Maille), wife of [[Richard MacWilliam Bourke]] (d. 1479).

Earlier allusions to Finn's battle at Ventry suggest that one or several versions of the story were current as early as the 12th century. The event is first referred to in a love-story of the ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]'', in which Finn sets out to meet the enemy in battle, but interrupts the journey to act as a match-maker for Cáel and Créde. During the seventeen days of the battle, the couple offer assistance to Finn, but on the last day, Cáel drowns at sea in pursuit of an opponent and Créde dies of grief.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;''Acallam na Senórach'', tr. Dooley and Roe, pp. 24–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the 15th-century ''Cath Finntrágha'' appears to offer a thoroughly revised tale, which incorporates miscellaneous narrative material from the Finn Cycle, the [[Ulster Cycle]] and the [[Mythological Cycle]]. It has been argued that much of its framework was suggested by the earlier tale ''[[Cath Trága Rudraigi]]'' (''The Battle of Dundrum Bay''), in which [[Norsemen]] forces invade Ireland and do battle at [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum Bay]] (County Down).

==Antiquarian commentary==
[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] provides a number of interesting insights into the Battle of Ventry in his Ordnance Survey letters of 1841. He noted several burial carns near Cantraw, presumed evidence of a great slaughter, along with local claims of finds of many bones and skulls at the east end of the strand. He also noted a boggy area known for the slaughter of the mighty men,  ''Guin na dTreanfhear''.&lt;ref&gt;John O’Donovan in his Ordnance Survey Letters on the Antiquities of the County of Kerry, of 30 July 1841 (ref. 14/C/30/8 (viii) [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/aai-files/assets/ebooks/OSI-Letters/KERRY_14%20C%2030.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7908">The '''concours de façades de la ville de Paris''' was an architecture competition organized by the city of Paris at the very end of the 19th century.

== History ==
The contest was held annually between 1898 and the late 1930s, with an interruption during World War I. It recognized several buildings completed during the year.

The contest was set up after the creation of the rue Reaumur made in 1897. The city of Paris took inspiration from {{Interlanguage link multi|Concours d'architecture de la Ville de Bruxelles (1872-1876)|fr|3=Concours d'architecture de la Ville de Bruxelles (1872-1876)|lt=a similar contest held in Brussels}}&lt;ref name="Figaro"/&gt; in the 1890s to promote the erection of original buildings on this street; initially restricted to the sole rue Réaumur, the contest was finally extended to the whole of Paris.

'''Cordelia''' is a fictional character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragic play, ''[[King Lear]]''. She is the youngest of King Lear's three daughters, and his favourite. After her elderly father offers her the opportunity to profess her love to him in return for one third of the land in his kingdom, she refuses and is banished for the majority of the play.

== Origin ==
Shakespeare had numerous resources to consult while writing ''King Lear''. The oldest source in print was [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|The History of the Kings of Britain]]'', c.1136.&lt;ref name="Milton" /&gt; This is the earliest written record of Cordelia. Here she is depicted as [[Cordelia of Britain|Queen Cordelia]].

== Role in play ==
[[File:Cordelia's Portion2.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Madox Brown]], ''Cordelia's Portion'']]
=== Introduction ===
In Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', Cordelia is briefly on stage during Act 1, scene 1. Her father Lear exiles her as a response to her honesty when he asks for professions of love from his three daughters to determine how to divide the lands of his kingdom between them. Cordelia's sisters, [[Goneril]] and [[Regan (King Lear)|Regan]], give deceitfully-lavish speeches professing their love, flattering his [[vanity]]. Cordelia, seeing right through her sisters' feigned professions of love, refuses to do the same. Lear deems her answer ("Love, and be silent" 1.1.62) as too simple.&lt;ref name="Milard1989" /&gt; Lear asks her, "What can you say to draw / A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak." (1.1.84-5). Cordelia replies, "Nothing, my lord." (1.1.86). She continues, "Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave / My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty / According to my bond; no more nor less." (1.1 90-2). Unlike her father and sisters, Cordelia is able to differentiate love from property. Feeling outraged and humiliated that Cordelia will not publicly lavish love on him, Lear banishes Cordelia from the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Greenblatt1997" /&gt; She does not return until Act 4, scene 4.
[[File:Edwin Austin Abbey King Lear, Act I, Scene I The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumbnail|[[Edwin Austin Abbey]] (1852–1911)  Cordelia's Farewell, King Lear, Act I, Scene I ]]

=== The ending ===
[[File:James Barry 002.jpg|thumb|''King Lear mourns Cordelia's death'', [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], 1786–1788]]
Cordelia was always Lear’s favourite daughter. After Lear is rejected by Cordelia's wicked sisters, Goneril and Regan, he goes mad. Cordelia returns at the end of the play with the intentions of helping Lear, ultimately reversing her role as daughter to that of mother.&lt;ref name="McFarland2003" /&gt; But when she arrives, Lear can not even recognize her in his state of madness. Nevertheless, she forgives him for banishing her. By the time Lear finally regains his reason and realizes who Cordelia is, they have little time to talk and reconcile. Edmund arrives and sends them both to prison, where Cordelia is ultimately hanged. In Nahum Tate's "happy-ending" revision ''[[The History of King Lear]]'' (1681), which replaced Shakespeare's original version on stage for decades, Cordelia marries Edgar and becomes ruler of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Spencer1965" /&gt;

== Cordelia as a mother figure ==
When Lear offers his kingdom to his three daughters, a role reversal occurs in which the daughters become mother figures for Lear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Suffocating_Mothers.html?id=tar8GPyPcaoC|title=Suffocating Mothers: Fantasies of Maternal Origin in Shakespeare's Plays, Hamlet to the Tempest|last=Adelman|first=Janet|date=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415900393|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dividing his kingdom between his daughters, Lear gives them the power to dictate his own future, just as a father has control over the future of his children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because Cordelia is the daughter he loves most, Lear expects her to care for him as he hands over his power to his children and advances into old age, much like how a mother cares for her baby.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Essentialism''' is the view that every [[entity]] has a set of attributes that are necessary to its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|year=1968|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626|jstor=2024315|doi=10.2307/2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Western thought [[Platonic idealism|Plato's idealism]] held that all things have such an "essence"—an [[Theory of Forms|"idea" or "form"]]. In [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a [[Substance theory|substance]] that, as [[George Lakoff]] put it "make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not ''that'' kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Janicki|2003|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary view—[[non-essentialism]]—denies the need to posit such an "essence'".

Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides Dialogue]]'', depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the "existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt" .&lt;ref name="platostanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/|title=Plato's Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] at least until the time of [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ereshefsky|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hull|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[gender studies]] the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Women and Men|publisher=Basic Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0465047925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"&gt;Suzanne Kelly, Gowri Parameswaran, and Nancy Schniedewind, ''Women: Images &amp; Realities: A Multicultural Anthology'', 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
An ''[[essence]]'' characterizes a [[substance theory|substance]] or a [[Substantial form|form]], in the sense of the forms and ideas in [[Platonic idealism]]. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical [[humanism]] has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable [[human nature]]. This has been criticized by [[Kierkegaard]], [[Marx]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], and many other [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] thinkers.

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy (in particular, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[Philebus]]''), things were said to come into being by the action of a [[demiurge]] who works to form [[substance theory|chaos]] into ordered entities. Many definitions of ''essence'' hark back to the ancient Greek [[hylomorphic]] understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires ''hyle'' (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (''morphe''). Aristotle was the first to use the terms ''hyle'' and ''morphe''. According to [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|his explanation]], all entities have two aspects: "matter" and "form". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its [[quiddity]] or "whatness" (i.e., its "what it is").

Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an [[abstract entity]] of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some ''idea'' in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Plato's parable of the cave]].)

[[Karl Popper]] splits the ambiguous term ''[[Philosophical realism|realism]]'' into ''essentialism'' and ''realism''. He uses ''essentialism'' whenever he means the opposite of [[nominalism]], and ''realism'' only as opposed to [[idealism]]. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like "a puppy is a young dog" should be read from right to left, as an answer to "What shall we call a young dog"; never from left to right as an answer to "What is a puppy?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical essentialism===
Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of ''essence''. Unlike [[existentialism]], which posits "being" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist [[wikt:ontology|ontology]] must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

[[Plato]] believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the "essential" or ideal and the "perceived". [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.) applied the term ''essence'' to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, ''rationality'' is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, [[Bertrand Russell]] said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's "essence" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the ''name'' for it.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of essence was "hopelessly muddled" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

The Egyptian-born philosopher [[Plotinus]] (204–270 CE) brought [[idealism]] to the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Neoplatonism]], and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a "primary essence" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

Despite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, [[aesthetics]], [[heuristics]], [[psychology]], and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate [[Diana Fuss]], who wrote: "Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fuss|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas "ultimate reality" is held to be absolute essence.

Among contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is ''the power to exist'', which defines their "uncreated" Essence.&lt;ref&gt;Levina, Tatiana (Moscow 2013) Realism in Metaphysics: Analytic Questions and Continental Answers (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In 2010, an article by [[Gerald B. Folland]] in the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' stated, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define [[Lie algebra]] as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901121p.pdf Gerald B. Folland, October 2010, Notices of the AMS, p. 1121 "Speaking with the Natives: Reﬂections on Mathematical Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs bild.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] attempts to explain why people will pay more in an auction for the clothing of celebrities if the clothing is unwashed. He believes the answer to this and many other questions is that people cannot help but think of objects as containing a sort of "essence" that can be influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html Paul Bloom, July 2011 Ted talk, "The Origins of Pleasure"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|title=Conceptes and conceptual structure|journal=American Psychologist|year=1989|volume=44|issue=12|pages=1469–1481|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.12.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is [[Susan Gelman]], who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gelman, S. ''The essential child: Origins of essentialism in everyday thought''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toosi|first=N. R.|author2=Ambady, N.|title=Ratings of essentialism for eight religious identities|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.532441|pmid=21572550|pmc=3093246}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Toosi &amp; Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dar-Nimrod|first=I.|author2=Heine, S. J.|title=Genetic essentialism: On the deceptive determinism of DNA|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2011|volume=137|issue=5|pages=800–818|doi=10.1037/a0021860|pmid=21142350|pmc=3394457}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011).

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=S. A.|author2=Kremer, K. E.|title=Understanding natural causes: Children's explanations of how objects and their properties originate|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=2|pages=396–414|doi=10.2307/1131012|pmid=2055130|jstor=1131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rangel|first=U.|author2=Keller, J.|title=Essentialism goes social: Belief in social determinism as a component of psychological essentialism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1056–1078|doi=10.1037/a0022401|pmid=21319911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rangel and Keller, 2011).
Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in [[cognitive development]]. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demoulin|first=Stéphanie|last2=Leyens |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent|title=Lay Theories of Essentialism |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–42|doi=10.1177/1368430206059856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Demoulin, Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 2006).

There are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio &amp; Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanovsky|first=M.|title=Essentialism and folksociology: Ethnicity again|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=241–281|doi=10.1163/156853707X208503|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.7247}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtz|first=P.|author2=Wagner, W.|title=Essentialism and attribution of monstrosity in racist discourse: Right-wing internet postings about africans and jews|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=411–425|doi=10.1002/casp.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Holtz &amp; Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=D.|author2=Deeb, I. |author3=Segall, G. |author4=Ben-Eliyahu, A. |author5=Diesendruck, G. |title=The development of social essentialism: The case of Israeli children's inferences about Jews and Arabs |journal=Child Development |year=2010 |volume=81|issue=3|pages=757–777|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624-2010.01432.x|pmid=20573103|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu &amp; Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.

The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=T. A.|author2=Hornsey, M. J. |author3=Postmes, T. |title=Shifting ground: The variable use of essentialism in contexts of inclusion and exclusion|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1348/014466607X270287|pmid=18171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Morton, Hornsey &amp; Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Medin | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Atran | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = The native mind: biological categorization and reasoning in development and across cultures | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.111.4.960 | pmid = 15482069 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 111 | issue = 4| pages = 960-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] of Yale University has stated that "one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom. P. (2010) Why we like what we like. ''Observer''. 23 (8), 3 [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/october-10/why-we-like-what-we-like.html online link].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastian|first=B.|author2=Haslam, N.|title=Psychological essentialism and stereotype endorsement|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=228–235|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2006).

==In ethics==
Classical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.

Many modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.

==In biology==

One possibility is that before [[evolution]] was developed as a [[scientific theory]], there existed an essentialist view of [[biology]] that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution. The History of an Idea |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06386-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[creation-evolution controversy|religious opponents of evolution]] continue to maintain this view of biology.

Recent work by historians of [[systematics|systematic biology]] has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as [[Linnaeus]] and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called "essentialism story" (or "myth") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from [[Aristotle]] onwards through to [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[William Whewell]] in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.&lt;ref&gt;Amundson, R.

== Gender essentialism ==
{{main|Gender essentialism}}

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication ''Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies'' that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grosz|first1 = Elizabeth|title =Space, Time, and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies |date = 1995|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2017|isbn = 9780415911375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 ''New York Times'' best seller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as ''Women: Images &amp; Realities''.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"/&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. [[Evelyn Fox Keller]],&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Harding]],
&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Harding, ''The Science Question in Feminism'', Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Tuana]]
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'', Indiana University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature.  Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. [[Herodotus]], for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a "softness" which has made Egypt easy to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;DeLapp 177.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity,&lt;ref&gt;Lape 149-52.&lt;/ref&gt; or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism had been operative in [[colonialism]] as well as in critiques of colonialism.

[[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial]] theorists such as [[Edward Said]] insisted that essentialism was the "defining mode" of "Western" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to [[Touraj Atabaki]], manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as [[Eurocentrism]], over-generalization, and reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians reject essentialism because it "dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of [[Subaltern Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''For Keeps''''' is a 1988 American [[coming of age]] [[comedy drama]] film starring [[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Darcy and Stan, two high school seniors in love.  Complications ensue when Darcy becomes [[pregnant]] just before graduation and decides to keep her baby.  This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final "teen" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stiernberg |first=Bonnie |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/02/the-7-best-molly-ringwald-roles.html |title=The 7 Best Molly Ringwald Roles :: Movies :: Lists :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges; before Darcy goes to the [[University of Wisconsin]] to study [[journalism]], she will go on a trip to [[Paris]] with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to [[Caltech]] to study [[architecture]]. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together, where they sleep together, and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the news at Thanksgiving, and neither Darcy's mother Donna, who was abandoned by her husband and brought up Darcy alone, nor Stan's Catholic parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an [[abortion]] or give up the baby for [[adoption]]. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief.

At Christmas, the kids announce their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and get married to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become teenaged mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her [[GED]]. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking; although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from [[post-partum depression]], unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively, does she break from her depression.

Without telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Although Stan takes a second, dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to start drinking heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he take the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing out Stan and [[annul]]ling the marriage. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angrily at her mother's cold attitude.

At Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. Donna finally gets over her past and says she loves and supports Darcy fully. They reconcile, go forward on their plans to attend college in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in the fall, and remark Thea will have a very early [[curfew]] when she is a teenager. Stan says ten p.m. and Darcy says eleven p.m. Then they say if she is really in love her curfew will be eight p.m.

==Production==

===Filming===
The film is set in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]].

The film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including "Maybe, Baby" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and "For Keeps?", before settling on the final question mark-less version.

The promising career of John Zarchen,  thought to be on the verge of breakout in the supporting role of Stan's best friend, Chris, literally hit a wall during the shooting, as Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood, allegedly under the influence of alcohol. He survived  a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role.  This movie also marks the film debut of [[Pauly Shore]], who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan.

The musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song "[[Be My Baby]]", sung by composer [[Ellie Greenwich]].

===Casting===
Actor Adam Silbar was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director [[Paul G. Bens, Jr.]], then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar.  The role ultimately went to Batinkoff.

==Release==

===Critical reception===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] aggregate score gave the film an 18% rotten rating based on 11 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''For Keeps'' (1988)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/for_keeps/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review saying, "The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in "For Keeps," Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married."

[[Janet Maslin]] of [[New York Times]] said, "Most of ''For Keeps'' is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE2DC173FF936A25752C0A96E948260 |title=Movie Review - For Keeps - Film: 'For Keeps,' on Teen-Age Pregnancy |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1988-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, "Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of '80s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |title=DVD Verdict Review - For Keeps |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2004-05-11 |accessdate=2015-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831195031/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |archivedate=2014-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Nusair gave a more negative review saying, "For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini9.htm#forkeeps |title=Mini Reviews (August 2001) - Reviews by David Nusair |publisher=Reelfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===

In [[printing]] and [[publishing]], '''proofs''' are the preliminary versions of publications meant for review by authors, editors, and proofreaders, often with extra-wide margins. '''Galley proofs''' may be uncut and unbound, or in some cases [[electronic publishing|electronically transmitted]]. They are created for [[proofreading]] and [[copyediting]] purposes, but may also be used for promotional and review purposes.&lt;ref name="Tapia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt;

== Historical galley proofs ==

'''Proof,''' in the typographical sense, is a term that dates from c. 1600.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The primary goal of proofing is to create a tool for verification that the job is accurate. All needed or suggested changes are physically marked on paper proofs or electronically marked on electronic proofs by the author, editor, and proofreaders. The [[typesetter|compositor, typesetter]], or printer receives the edited copies, corrects and re-arranges the type or the pagination, and arranges for the press workers to print the final or published copies.

'''Galley proofs''' or '''galleys''' are so named because in the days of hand-set [[letterpress printing]] in the 1650s, the printer would set the page into galleys, namely the metal trays into which type was laid and tightened into place.&lt;ref name="OED.galley"/&gt; A small proof press would then be used to print a limited number of copies for [[proofreading]].&lt;ref name="OED.galley"/&gt; Galley proofs are thus, historically speaking, galleys printed on a proof press. 

From the printer's point of view, the galley proof, as it originated during the era of hand-set physical type, had two primary purposes, those being to check that the compositor had set the copy accurately (because sometimes individual pieces of type did get put in the wrong case after use) and that the type was free of defects (because type metal is comparatively soft, so type can get damaged). 

Once a defect-free galley proof was produced, the publishing house requested a number of galley proofs to be run off for distribution to editors and authors for a final reading and corrections to the text before the type was fixed in the chase for printing.

== Uncorrected proofs ==

An uncorrected proof is a proof version (on paper or in digital form) which is yet to receive final author and publisher approval. The term may also appear on the covers of advance reading copies; see below.

These days, because much typesetting and pre-press work is conducted digitally and transmitted electronically, the term  uncorrected proof is more common than the older term galley proof, which refers exclusively to a paper proofing system. However, if a paper print-out of an uncorrected proof is made on a desk-top printer or copy machine and used as a paper proof for authorial or editorial mark-up, it approximates a galley proof, and it may be referred to as a galley. 
 
Preliminary electronic proof versions are also sometimes called '''digital proofs,''' '''pdf proofs,''' and '''pre-fascicle''' proofs, the last because they are viewed as single pages, not as they will look when gathered into fascicles or signatures for the press.&lt;ref name="Knuth"/&gt;

== Final proofs ==

Proofs created by the printer for approval by the publisher before going to press are called '''final proofs.''' At this stage in production, all mistakes are supposed to have been corrected and the pages are set up in imposition for folding and cutting on the press. To correct a mistake at this stage entails an extra cost per page, so authors are discouraged from making many changes to final proofs, while last-minute corrections by the in-house publishing staff may be accepted. 

In the final proof stage, page layouts are examined closely. Additionally, because final page proofs contain the final [[pagination]], if an index was not compiled at an earlier stage in production, this pagination facilitates compiling a book's [[index (publishing)|index]] and correcting its table of contents.

== Advance reading copies ==

Historically, some publishers have used paper galley proofs as [[advance copy|advance copies or advance reading copies]] (ARCs) or as pre-publication publicity proofs. These are provided to reviewers, magazines, and libraries in advance of final publication. These galleys are not sent out for correction, but to ensure timely reviews of newly published works. The list of recipients designated by the publisher limits the number of copies to only what is required, making advance copies a form of [[print-on-demand]] (POD) publication. 

Pre-publication publicity proofs are normally gathered and bound in paper, but in the case of books with four-color printed illustrations, publicity proofs may be lacking illustrations or have them in black and white only.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They may be marked or stamped on the cover "uncorrected proof," but the recipient is not expected to proofread them, merely to overlook any minor errors of typesetting. 

Galley proofs in electronic form are rarely used as advance reading copies due to the possibility of a recipient editing the proof and issuing it as their own. However, trusted colleagues are occasionally offered electronic advance reading copies, especially if the publisher wishes to quickly typeset a page or two of "advance praise" notices within the book itself.

'''Guerrilla art''' is a [[street art]] [[art movement|movement]] that first emerged in the [[UK]], but has since spread across the world and is now established in most countries that already had developed [[graffiti]] scenes. In fact, it owes so much to the early graffiti movement, in the [[United States]] guerrilla art is still referred to as ‘post-graffiti art’.
  
Guerrilla art differs from other art forms in it has no external boundary between the image and the environment. While a traditional painting can be moved from one gallery to another without the meaning or the artistic credibility of the piece being affected, street art is environmental, the surface to which it is applied to being as fundamental to the piece's meaning as that which is applied. Without the dynamics of modern life, guerrilla art is reduced to ‘art for arts sake’ and would be defined by ''what it is'' as opposed to ''what it does''.

The production of [[guerrilla]] art is focused on cause and effect, not the material piece itself. It aims to produce an effect within the minds of those people who live within the environment being altered. It does not necessarily aim to produce meaningful art in itself.

== Guerrilla artists ==
Guerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce ‘trapped art’, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be [[mass produced]] with little fidelity and put up with [[wheat paste]]. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with [[D*Face]]'s hijacking of the [[Walt Disney]] signature.

It's not a movement that attempts to support or to oppose brand conditioning. It is the general public's artistic response to it.

== Early guerrilla art ==
&lt;!-- Wellington New Zealand--&gt;
&lt;!-- 'Vacant Lot Of Cabbages' (1978) --&gt;
&lt;!-- http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation-enters-te-papas-archives/ --&gt;

In 1978 in downtown Wellington, [[New Zealand]] artist Barry Thomas, in collaboration with Chris Lipscombe, Hugh Walton and others, planted 180 cabbages "on the demolished Duke of Edinburgh/Roxy Theatre site in the centre of Wellington. This cabbage patch, planted in such a way as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested."&lt;ref name="wellington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harper |first1=Jenny |first2=Aaron |last2=Lister |date= |title=Wellington: A City for Sculpture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWhH1fjliCwC&amp;q=barry+thomas#v=snippet&amp;q=barry%20thomas&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of Guerrilla art and [[guerilla gardening]] in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, "astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city." &lt;ref&gt;"The Artists' Co-op: Barry Thomas; Eva Yuen; Ian Hunter; Ross Boyd; Terry Handscombe; Robin White"&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Barton writes in the following months, "it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest", describing the work as "a provocation to the local council and the city's developers".&lt;ref name="wellington" /&gt; Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an "important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history" with links to the "[[Occupy movement]], [[urban farming]] and [[guerrilla gardening]]".&lt;ref&gt;"‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic movement ==
[[Art]]istic [[Art movement|movement]]s are responsive. This movement is a response to the ever-increasing power and importance of the brand in everyday life. Developed, inner-city environments are where both [[brand]]ing and guerrilla art flourish. This is not coincidental.

The most important development in the street art movement and the reason for its 'guerrilla' tag is the adoption of guerrilla marketing techniques over traditional artistic methods. The use of [[guerrilla marketing]] methods to create ‘artistic publicity’ has seen the evolution away from artists as creative individuals and towards artists as brands.

It is this branding and the profound effect it has upon the minds of the general public that drives the guerrilla art movement.

In [[show business]], a '''guest appearance''' is the participation of an outsider performer (such as a [[musician]] or [[actor]]) in an event such as a [[music record]] or [[concert]], [[Performance|show]], etc., when the performer does not belong to the regular cast, band or other performing group. In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a '''guest artist'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dance Encyclopedia |first1= Anatole |last1= Chujoy |first2= Phyllis Winifred |last2= Manchester |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |page= 434 |chapter= Guest Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[performance art]], the terms '''guest role''' or '''guest star''' are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a [[celebrity]]. The latter is often also credited as '''special guest star''' or '''special musical guest star''' by some production companies. 

In [[pop music]], guest appearances are often described with the words '''featuring''', '''with''', or '''and'''. It is abbreviated in credit lists as '''feat.''', '''ft.''', '''f/''', or '''f.'''. 

In a [[television series]], a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes an entire [[story arc]]). 

In [[radio]] and [[television shows]], a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity.

==Classical performance arts==
Guest appearances have been known in [[theatre]], [[ballet]], and [[classical music]] for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of [[air transport]] has made this practice much more practical and global.&lt;ref name=laine&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFD9163BF935A15754C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title= The Ballet Star as Guest Artist |first= Barry |last= Laine |authorlink=Barry Laine |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical music, guest [[orchestra conductor]]s are a common practice.

Guest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff.

The duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary [[contract]]s for several seasons.

==Contemporary music==
&lt;!--This section is redirected to from [[Guest vocalist]].--&gt;
In the early days of the [[pop music]] industry the [[band (music)|band]]s were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, [[Eric Clapton]] was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" of [[the Beatles]]. Still the term "featuring" was used as early as in the July 1954 [[UK Singles Chart]] by "[[The Four Aces]] featuring [[Al Alberts]]" with "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins In The Fountain]]" at 5th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.everyhit.com/ | title=UK Top 40 Hit Database | accessdate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in [[rap music]], and this influenced [[rock music]]ians as well.&lt;ref name=aust&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22799180-16947,00.html |title= Voices Find Gilt by Association |first= Mark |last= Edwards |date= November 22, 2007 |work= [[The Australian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a guest star on a record, the [[production coordinator]] must obtain permission from the [[record label]] of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label to be printed on the album cover, often in the form "''Artist name'',  courtesy of ''Record Label name.''" The permission is not always granted and sometimes negotiations may take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Bobby |last= Borg |year= 2003 |title= The Musician's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Understanding the Music Business |isbn= 0-8230-8357-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for guest appearances==
A common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion-driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star.&lt;ref name=laine/&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Commercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from [[jet lag]]s to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

With a television series, the appearance of a special guest star could mark the moment when a series "[[Jumping the shark|jumps the shark]]"; that is, a doomed attempt to reverse a decline in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Jump the Shark |title= Special Guest Star |url= http://www.jumptheshark.com/forum/Special-Guest-Star/30 |accessdate= October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermanos Conde''' (Conde Brothers) are [[luthiers]], makers of [[classical guitar|classical]] and [[flamenco guitar]]s.

==History==
The Conde dynasty was founded in [[Madrid]] by [[Domingo Esteso]] in 1915. Esteso trained his nephews Faustino and Mariano Conde Sr. Later, the young [[Julio Conde]] joined his brothers.

Domingo Esteso died in 1937, and after that time the three Conde Brothers continued working for Esteso's widow under the name of "Viuda y Sobrinos de Esteso" (Esteso's Widow and Nephews) until 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.condehermanos.com/en/history/#|title=History of the Handcrafted Guitar's Workshop {{!}} Felipe Conde|work=Felipe Conde|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, Julio Conde set up a new handicraft guitar center.

From 1960 until 1988-89 they took over the shop and called themselves ''"Sobrinos de Domingo Esteso Conde Hermanos"'' (Esteso's Nephews, Conde Brothers) or ''"Hermanos Conde Sobrinos de Domingo Esteso"'' (Conde Brothers, Esteso's Nephews).

Mariano Sr. later established his own shop close to the Royal Theatre, calling it "Conde Hermanos Sucesores Sobrinos de Esteso". His two sons, Felipe, born in 1957 and Mariano Jr., born 1959, began their apprenticeship with their father and uncle Faustino when they were about 15 years old. Faustino died in 1988 and Mariano Sr. in 1989.

Felipe and Mariano Conde (sons of Mariano Conde Sr.) manufactured flamenco guitars in their workshop at Felipe V St. nº 2 in [[Madrid]] close to the [[Teatro Real]] (Royal Theatre) and the [[Palacio Real]] (Royal Palace). They were known as ''"Conde Hermanos Sucesores Sobrinos de Esteso"'' (Conde Brothers - Esteso's Nephews Successors)

Felipe and Mariano have now broken off their business association. They work in different workshops and sell different models of guitars.

Felipe Conde works with his son and daughter Felipe Jr. and María at his shop at Arrieta 4, in front of the Royal Theatre, close to the old shop. Mariano Conde works at his shop at Amnistía 1, next to the [[Ópera (Madrid Metro)|Opera metro]] station.

Meanwhile, Julio carried on making guitars until his death in 1995, and now his sons and granddaughter maintain the tradition of "Conde Hermanos" at Atocha 53.

==Notable users==
[[File:Tienda Felipe v.jpg|thumb|Shop front at C/ Felipe Vº, 2]]Famous Flamenco guitarists such as [[Mario Escudero]], [[Oscar Herrero]], [[Paco de Lucía]], [[Melchor de Marchena]], Andrea Nannetti, [[Niño Ricardo]], [[Rafael Riqueni]], [[Sabicas]], [[Esteban de Sanlucar]], [[Regino Sainz de la Maza]] and guitarists with other styles such as [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Jesse Cook]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Toninho Horta]], [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Meiko (American singer)|Meiko]], [[Cat Stevens]] or [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] have played with Hermanos Conde guitars.

The '''Hugh Lane Gallery''', officially '''Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane''' and originally the '''Municipal Gallery of Modern Art''', is an [[art gallery]] operated by [[Dublin City Council]] and its subsidiary the Hugh Lane Gallery Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content/RecreationandCulture/ArtsOffice/HughLane/Documents/FinalCodeofGovernance.pdf|title=Code of Governance|publisher=Hugh Lane Gallery Trust|date=January 2014|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Charlemont House]] (built 1763) on [[Parnell Square]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The gallery was founded by Sir [[Hugh Lane]] on [[Harcourt Street]] in 1908, and is the first known public gallery of [[modern art]] in the world.{{cn|date=June 2015}} There is no admission fee and the gallery is completely wheelchair-accessible. The gallery was closed for reconstruction in 2004, and reopened in May 2006, with a new extension by Gilroy McMahon Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilroymcmahon.com/cultural/projects/dublin-gallery.htm|title=PROJECTS: Cultural - The Hugh Lane Gallery|publisher=Gilroy McMahon Architects|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ie/newbuild/hughlane.html|title=Combining old and new at the Hugh Lane Art Gallery|publisher=Lee McCullough Consulting Engineers|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has a permanent collection and hosts exhibitions, mostly by contemporary Irish artists. It has a dedicated [[Sean Scully]] room. [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]'s studio was reconstructed in the gallery in 2001 after being dismantled and moved from London starting in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francis-bacon.com/blog/francis-bacons-studio-lecture-at-tokyo-momat/|title=‘Francis Bacon’s Studio’ lecture at Tokyo MOMAT|publisher=Estate of Francis Bacon|date=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/studio-hugh-lane-gallery-dublin/337|title=Francis Bacon's studio, Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin|author=Paul Tuthill|publisher=Whitehot Magazine|date=April 2007|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indexed palette.png|frame|A 2-bit indexed color image. The color of each [[pixel]] is represented by a number; each number (the ''index'') corresponds to a color in the color table (the ''[[Palette (computing)|palette]]'').]]

In computing, '''indexed color''' is a technique to manage [[digital image]]s' colors in a limited fashion, in order to save computer [[computer data storage|memory]] and [[Hard disk drive|file storage]], while speeding up display refresh and file transfers. It is a form of [[Vector quantization#Use in data compression|vector quantization compression]].

When an image is [[encoding|encoded]] in this way, color information is not directly carried by the image [[pixel]] data, but is stored in a separate piece of data called a '''[[Palette (computing)|palette]]''': an array of color elements. Every element in the array represents a color, indexed by its position within the array. The individual entries are sometimes known as '''color registers'''. The image pixels do not contain the full specification of its color, but only its index in the ''palette''. This technique is sometimes referred as '''pseudocolor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | author = Charles A. Poynton | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-55860-792-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ra1lcAwgvq4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA38&amp;dq=pseudocolor&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=RrXER6SjLIecsgPI-NGwCA&amp;sig=IE3Yi_P2hkm5mz_kKA-VJ4tWIzw }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''indirect color''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/class5b_01.PDF Computer Graphics, Prof. R. Eckert, Lect. #5, February 2001, Binghamton U., N.Y.]&lt;/ref&gt; as colors are addressed indirectly.

Perhaps the first device that supported palette colors was a [[random access (computing)|random-access]] [[frame buffer]], described in 1975 by Kajiya, Sutherland and Cheadle.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=281022&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author= James Kajiya |author2=Ivan Sutherland |author3=Edward Cheadle | title=A Random-Access Video Frame Buffer|journal=IEEE Conf on Computer Graphics, Pattern Recognition and Data Structures |year=1975 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supported a palette of 256 36-bit RGB colors.

==Palette size==

{{main|Palette (computing)}}

The palette itself stores a limited number of distinct colors; 4, 16 or 
256 are the most common cases. These limits are often imposed by the 
target architecture's [[Video card|display adapter]] 
[[computer hardware|hardware]], so it is not a coincidence that those numbers are 
exact powers of two (the [[binary code]]): 
2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, 
2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;16 and 
2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;256. While 256 values can 
be fit into a single 8-[[bit]] [[byte]] (and then a single indexed color
pixel also occupies a single byte), pixel indices with 16 (4-bit, a 
[[nibble]]) or fewer colors can be packed together into a single byte 
(two nibbles per byte, if 16 colors are employed, or four 2-bit pixels 
per byte if using 4 colors). Sometimes, 1-bit (2-color) values can be 
used, and then up to eight pixels can be packed into a single byte; such
images are considered ''[[binary image]]s'' (sometimes referred as a 
''bitmap'' or ''bilevel image'') and not an indexed color image.

{{Color depth}}

If simple [[video overlay]] is intended through a 
''[[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]'', one 
palette entry is specifically reserved for this purpose, and it is 
discounted as an available color. Some machines, such as the [[MSX]] 
series, had the transparent color reserved by 
hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emu-docs.org/VDP%20TMS9918/Datasheets/TMS9918.pdf Online datasheet for the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Video Chip used in  the MSX.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indexed color images with palette sizes beyond 256 entries are rare. The
practical limit is around 12-bit per pixel, 4,096 different indices. To
use indexed 16 bpp or more does not provide the benefits of the indexed
color images' nature, due to the color palette size in bytes being 
greater than the raw image data itself. Also, useful direct RGB 
[[Highcolor]] modes can be used from 
[[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15 bpp]] and up.

If an image has many subtle color shades, it is necessary to select a 
limited repertoire of colors to approximate the image using 
[[color quantization]]. Such a palette is frequently insufficient to represent 
the image accurately; difficult-to-reproduce features such as 
[[gradient]]s will appear blocky or as strips (''[[colour banding|color 
banding]]''). In those cases, it is usual to employ [[dither]]ing, which
mixes different-colored pixels in patterns, exploiting the tendency of 
human vision to blur nearby pixels together, giving a result visually 
closer to the original one.

Here is a typical indexed 256-color image and its own palette (shown as a
rectangle of swatches):

==Colors and palettes==
{{see also|List of palettes}}

How the colors are encoded within the color palette map of a given indexed color image depends on the target platform.

===Early color techniques===

Many early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s had very limited [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|hardware palettes]] that could produce a very small set of colors. In these cases, each pixel's value mapped directly onto one of these colors. Well-known examples include the [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#Apple II series|Apple II]], [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#C-64|Commodore 64]] and [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#CGA|IBM PC CGA]], all of which included hardware that could produce a fixed set of 16 colors. In these cases, an image can encode each pixel with 4-bits, directly selecting the color to use. In most cases, however, the display hardware supports additional modes where only a subset of those colors can be used in a single image, a useful technique to save memory. For instance, the CGA's 320×200 resolution mode could show only four of the 16 colors at one time. As the palettes were entirely proprietary, an image generated on one platform cannot be directly viewed properly on another.

Other machines of this era had the ability to generate a larger set of colors, but generally only allowed a subset of those to be used in any one image. Examples include the 256-color palette on  [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#Atari 400/800/XL/XE|Atari 8-bit machines]] or the 4,096 colors of the [[VT220|VT241]] terminal in [[ReGIS]] graphics mode. In these cases it was common for the image to only allow a small subset of the total number of colors to be displayed at one time, up to 16 at once on the Atari and VT241. Generally, these systems worked identically to their less-colorful brethren, but a key difference was that there were too many colors in the palette to directly encode in the pixel data given the limited amount of [[video memory]]. Instead, they used a [[colour look-up table]] (CLUT) where each pixel's data pointed to an entry in the CLUT, and the CLUT was set up under program control. This meant that the image CLUT data had to be stored along with the raw image data in order to be able to re-produce the image correctly.

===RGB===

Hardware palettes based on [[component video]] colors such as [[YPbPr]] or the like were generally replaced in the mid 1980s by the more flexible [[RGB color model]], in which a given color can be obtained by mixing different amounts of the three [[primary color]]s red, green, and blue. Although the total number of different colors depends on the number of levels per primary, and on a given hardware implementation (a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB]] provides 512 combinations, a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB]] provides 4,096, and so on), in this model [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]]s (DAC) can generate the colors — simplifying the hardware design — while the software can treat the number per levels used abstractly and manage the RGB colors in a device-independent fashion. With colors stored in RGB format within the palettes of indexed image files, any image can be displayed (through appropriate transformations) on any such system, regardless of the color depth used in the hardware implementation.

Today, display hardware and [[image file formats]] that deal with indexed color images almost exclusively manage colors in RGB format, the de facto standard encoding being the so-called [[True Color|truecolor]] or [[RGB color model#The 24-bit RGB representation|24-bit RGB]], with [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|16,777,216 different possible colors]]. However, indexed color images are not genuinely constrained to a 24-bit RGB color encoding; image palettes can hold any type of color encoding. For example, the [[PDF]] file format does support indexed color in other colorspaces, notably [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], and [[Adobe Distiller]] by default will convert images to indexed color whenever the total number of colors in an image is equal to or less than 256. When using RGB, the [[TIFF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file formats can optionally store the RGB triplets with a precision of 16-bit (65,536 levels per component) yielding a total of 48 bits per pixel. A proposed extension to the TIFF Standard allows&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFFPM6.pdf The TIFF image file format specification]&lt;/ref&gt; non-RGB color palettes, but this was never implemented in software due to technical reasons. The color map table of the [[BMP file format]] indexed color mode stores its entries in BGR order rather than RGB, and has (in the current version) an additional unused byte for padding to conform to [[32-bit]] [[data structure alignment|word alignment]] during processing, but it is essentially still a 24-bit RGB color encoding.  (An earlier version of the BMP format used three bytes per 24-bit color map table entry, and many files in that format are still in circulation, so many modern programs that read BMP files support both variations.)

==Pixel bits arrangements==

Except for very low resolution graphic modes, early home and personal computers rarely implemented an "all-pixels-addressable" design - that is, the ability to change a single pixel to any of the available colors independently.  Their limitations came from employing separate ''color attribute'' or ''color RAM'' areas, leading to [[attribute clash]] effects.  Also, the pixel bits and/or the scan lines of the video memory were commonly arranged in odd ways convenient for the video generator hardware (thus saving hardware costs in a cost-competitive market), but sometimes creating difficulty for the people writing graphics programs. A pixel's bits in indexed-color, all-pixel-addressable images are not always contiguous in video memory or image files (i.e., [[packed pixel|chunky]] organization is not always used.)  Some video hardware, such as the 16-color graphic modes of the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] (EGA) and [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) for [[IBM PC compatible]]s&lt;ref&gt;
Richard Wilton, Programmer's Guide to PC &amp; PS/2 VIDEO SYSTEMS, 1987, Microsoft Press. {{ISBN|1-55615-103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or the [[Amiga]] video buffer&lt;ref&gt;
Inc. Commodore-Amiga, Amiga Hardware Reference Manual, 1991, Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-56776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
are arranged as a series of [[bit plane]]s (in a configuration called [[planar (computer graphics)|planar]]), in which the related bits of a single pixel are split among several independent [[binary image|bitmap]]s.  Thus, the pixel bits are conceptually aligned along the 3D Z-axis.  (The "depth" concept here is not the same as that of pixel [[color depth|depth]].)

Early image file formats, such as [[PICtor PIC image format|PIC]], stored little more than a bare [[memory dump]] of the video buffer of a given machine.

Some indexed-color image file formats such as [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) allow the image's scan lines to be arranged in [[interleaving (bitmaps)|interleaved]] fashion (not linear order), which allows a low resolution version of the image to appear on screen while it is still downloading, so that the computer user can gain an idea of its contents during the seconds before the whole image arrives.  Here is an example of a typical vertically interleaved download in four steps:

[[File:IndexedColorSample InterleavedDownload (Caerulea3 crop).png|center]]

As seen here, the image has been divided into four groups of lines: group A contains every fourth line, group B contains lines immediately following ones in group A, group C likewise contains the lines immediately following those in group B, and group D contains the remaining lines, which are between group C lines (immediately above) and group A lines (immediately below).  These are stored into the file in the order A, C, B, D, so that when the file is transmitted the second received group (C) of lines lie centered between the lines of the first group, yielding the most spatially uniform and recognizable image possible, composed of only two of the groups of lines.  The same technique can be applied with more groups (e.g. eight), in which case at each step the next group to be sent contains lines lying at or near the centers of remaining bands that are not yet filled with image data.  This method, with four or eight groups of lines, was commonly used on the early World Wide Web during the second half of the 1990s.  Rather than leaving the background (black) showing as in the illustration above, the partial image was often presented on screen by duplicating each line to fill the space below it down to the next received image line.  The end result was a continuous image with decreased vertical resolution that would increase to full resolution over a few seconds as the later parts of the image data arrived.

==Advantages==

Indexed color saves a lot of memory, storage space, and transmission time: using [[True Color|truecolor]], each pixel needs 24 bits, or 3 bytes. A typical 640×480 [[Super VGA|VGA]] resolution truecolor uncompressed image needs 640×480×3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;921,600 bytes (900 KiB). Limiting the image colors to 256, every pixel needs only 8 bits, or 1 byte each, so the example image now needs only 640×480×1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;307,200 bytes (300 KiB), plus 256×3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;768 additional bytes to store the palette map in itself (assuming RGB), approximately one third of the original size. Smaller palettes (4-bit 16 colors, 2-bit 4 colors) can pack the pixels even more (to one sixth or one twelfth), obviously at cost of color accuracy.

Indexed color was widely used in early [[personal computer]]s and display adapters' hardware to reduce costs (mainly by requiring fewer of the then-expensive [[RAM]] [[Integrated circuit|chips]]) but also for convenient image management with limited-power [[CPU]]s (of the order of 4 to 8 [[MHz]]), file storage ([[magnetic tape data storage|cassette tape]]s and low density [[floppy disk]]s).  Notable computer graphics systems extensively (or even exclusively) using pseudocolor palettes in the 1980s include [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], and VGA (for [[IBM PC compatible]]s), the [[Atari ST]], and [[Amiga]]'s [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] and [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]].

Image files exchanged over the [[Compuserve]] net in the early 1990s were encapsulated in the [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] format. Later, the [[HTML]] web pages used the GIF along with other indexed color-supporting file formats such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], to exchange limited-color images quickly and store them in limited storage space.

Most [[image file formats]] that support indexed color images also commonly support some [[Image compression|compression]] scheme, enhancing their ability to store the images in smaller files.

Interesting [[List of software palettes#Color gradient palettes|colorized and artistic]] effects can be easily achieved by altering the color palette of indexed color images, for example to produce colorized [[sepia tone]] images. Due to the separate nature of the associated palette element of the indexed color images, they are ideal to remap [[grayscale]] images into [[false color]] ones through the use of [[List of software palettes#False color palettes|false color palette]]s.

Simple [[video overlay]] can be achieved easily through the [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]] technique.

By manipulating the color hardware registers ([[Color look-up table]] or CLUT) of the display adapter in the indexed color graphic modes, full-screen color-animation effects can be achieved without redrawing the image - that is, at low CPU time cost; a single change of the register values affects the whole screen at once.  Color-map animation, also known as [[Color cycling]], is extensively used in the [[demoscene]]. The Microsoft Windows boot logo screen in Windows 95, 98, ME, and 2000 Professional (which uses VGA 320x200x256 color display mode because it is the greatest common denominator on all PCs) employs this technique for the scrolling gradient bar across the bottom of the screen; the picture is a static image with no pixels rewritten after it is initially displayed.  Custom boot screen images could tap the cycled colors to animate other parts of the images.

==Disadvantages==

The main disadvantage of using indexed color is the limited set of simultaneous colors per image. Small 4- or 16-color palettes are still acceptable for little images ([[icon (computing)|icons]]) or very simple graphics, but to reproduce real life images they become nearly useless. Some techniques, such as [[color quantization]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] and [[dithering]] combined together can create indexed 256-color images comparable to the original up to an acceptable level.

|}

Indexed color images are heavily dependent on their own color palettes. Except for a few well known fixed-color palettes (such as that of the [[Color Graphics Adapter]]—CGA), raw image data and/or color map tables cannot be reliably exchanged between different image files without some kind of intermediate mapping. Also, if the original color palette for a given indexed image is lost, it can be nearly impossible to restore it. Here is an example of what happens when an indexed color image (the previous parrot) has been associated with an incorrect color palette:

:[[File:Incorrect 8bits palette sample image.png]]

Indexed color graphic modes for display adapters have the 16- or 256-color limit imposed by hardware. Indexed color images with rich but incompatible palettes can only be accurately displayed one at a time, as in a [[slideshow]]. When it is necessary to show multiple images together, as in a mosaic of [[thumbnail]]s, a common or ''[[Palette (computing)#Adaptive versus master palettes|master palette]]'' is often used, which encompasses as many different hues as possible into a single set, thereby limiting the overall accurate color availability.

The following image is a mosaic of four different indexed color images rendered with a single shared ''master palette'' of [[List of software palettes#6-8-5 levels RGB|6-8-5 levels RGB]] plus 16 additional grays. Note the limited range of colors used for every image, and how many palette entries are left unused.

:[[File:IndexedColorSample (Mosaic).png]]

Many indexed color display devices do not reach the 24-bit limit for the full RGB palette. The [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] for IBM PC compatibles, for example, only provides an [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB]] palette with 262,144 different possible colors in both 16- and 256- indexed color graphic modes.

Some image editing software allows [[gamma correction]] to be applied to a palette for indexed color image files. In general, to apply a gamma correction directly to the color map is bad practice, due to the original RGB color values being lost. It is better to apply the gamma correction with the display hardware (most modern display adapters support this feature), or as an active intermediate step of the rendering software through [[color management]], which preserves the original color values. Only when the indexed color images are intended for systems that lack any kind of [[color calibration]], and they are not intended to be cross-platform, gamma correction may be applied to the color table itself.

==Image file formats supporting indexed color==

These are some of the most representative image file formats that support indexed color modes. Some of these support other modes (e.g. truecolor), but only the indexed color modes are listed here.

:''NOTE: most of the formats will also support a color table with fewer colors than the maximum that a given bit depth can offer.

The '''International Standard Book Number''' ('''ISBN''') is a unique{{efn|Occasionally, publishers erroneously assign an ISBN to more than one title—the first edition of ''[[The Ultimate Alphabet]]'' and ''The Ultimate Alphabet Workbook'' have the same ISBN, 0-8050-0076-3. Conversely, books are published with several ISBNs: A German second-language edition of ''[[Emil und die Detektive]]'' has the ISBNs 87-23-90157-8 (Denmark), 0-8219-1069-8 (United States), 91-21-15628-X (Sweden), 0-85048-548-7 (United Kingdom) and 3-12-675495-3 (Germany).}}{{efn|In some cases, books sold only as sets share ISBNs.

Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International ISBN Agency|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an [[e-book]], a [[paperback]] and a [[hardcover]] edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.

The initial ISBN configuration of recognition{{clarify|date=October 2017|reason=What is a "configuration of recognition", and what does it mean to generate it?}} was generated in 1967, based upon the 9-digit '''Standard Book Numbering''' ('''SBN''') created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the SBN code can be converted to a ten-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit "0").

Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Philip (1992). {{cite web |url= http://www.theindexer.org/files/18-1/18-1_025.pdf |title=Book numbering: The importance of the ISBN }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(245KB)}}. ''The Indexer.'' '''18''' (1): 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another identifier, the [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as [[magazine]]s; and the [[International Standard Music Number]] (ISMN) covers for musical scores.

==History==
The Standard Book Numbering (SBN) [[code]] is a 9-digit commercial [[book]] [[identifier]] system created by [[Gordon Foster]], Emeritus Professor of Statistics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref name="From Archive.org-4646971"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net/isbn.html |title= INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBERING (ISBN) SYSTEM original 1966 report |website= informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net |date=1966 |access-date=20 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430024722/http://www.informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net/isbn.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |first= Gordon |last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the booksellers and stationers [[WHSmith]] and others in 1965.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isbn.org/ISBN_history |title=ISBN History |website= isbn.org |date=20 April 2014 |access-date= 20 April 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140420232459/http://www.isbn.org/ISBN_history |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker&lt;ref name="ktieb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manwal ghall-Utenti tal-ISBN |url= http://ktieb.org.mt/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Manwal-ghall-Utenti-tal-ISBN-Maltese.pdf |publisher=Kunsill Nazzjonali tal-Ktieb |edition=6th |language= Maltese |location=[[Malta]] |date=2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817083617/http://ktieb.org.mt/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Manwal-ghall-Utenti-tal-ISBN-Maltese.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2016 |page=5 |isbn= 978-99957-889-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (regarded as the "Father of the ISBN"&lt;ref name="niso.org"&gt;{{citation |format=PDF |url= http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6294/ISQ_vol8_no3_July1996.pdf |title= Information Standards Quarterly |date=July 1996 |page=12 |number=3 |volume=8 |publisher= ISO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140804153745/http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6294/ISQ_vol8_no3_July1996.pdf | archivedate= 4 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay&lt;ref name="ktieb" /&gt; (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency [[R.R.

The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ktieb" /&gt; The United Kingdom continued to use the 9-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 [[TC 46/SC 9]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] on-line facility only refers back to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |format=PDF |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6897 |title= ISO 2108:1978 |publisher= ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit "0". For example, the second edition of ''[[The Guv'nor and Other Short Stories|Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns]]'', published by Hodder in 1965, has {{Nowrap|"SBN 340 01381 8"}} – 340 indicating the publisher, 01381 their serial number, and 8 being the check digit. This can be converted to {{ISBN|0-340-01381-8}}; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated.

Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with "[[Bookland]]" [[European Article Number]] EAN-13s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm | title=Frequently Asked Questions about the new ISBN standard from ISO | author=TC 46/SC 9 | publisher=LAC‐BAC | place=CA | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610160919/http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm | archivedate=10 June 2007 | df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=See paragraph 5.2 of ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2012) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(548&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or 5 parts (for a 13-digit ISBN):

[[File:ISBN Details.svg|thumb|The parts of a 10-digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN‑13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN‑13 labeled "EAN" is the [[Bookland]] country code.]]

# for a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element – a ''[[GS1]] prefix'': so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt;
# the ''registration group element'' (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),&lt;ref&gt;Some books have several codes in the first block: e.g. A. M. Yaglom's ''Correlation Theory...'', published by [[Springer Verlag]], has two ISBNs, 0-387-96331-6 and 3-540-96331-6. Though Springer's 387 and 540 codes are different for English (0) and German (3); the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit: 6. Springer uses 431 as their publisher code for Japanese (4) and 4-431-96331-? would also have check digit ? = 6.  Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817, and 0-817-96331-? would also get check digit ? = 6. This suggests special considerations were made for assigning Springer's publisher codes, as random assignments of different publisher codes would ''not'' lead the same item number to get the same check digit every time. Finding publisher codes for English and German, say, with this effect amounts to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ''registrant'' element,
# the ''publication element'',&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt; and
# a ''[[checksum]] character'' or [[check digit]].&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt;

A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (''prefix element'', ''registration group'', ''registrant'', ''publication'' and ''check digit''), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with [[hyphen]]s or spaces. Separating the parts (''registration group'', ''registrant'', ''publication'' and ''check digit'') of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.&lt;ref&gt;The International ISBN agency's ''ISBN User's Manual'' says: "The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces" although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed; see [https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation ISBN hyphenation definition]. The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element (more than 1,000 total). The document defining the ranges, listed by agency, is 29 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How ISBNs are issued ===
ISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISBN Canada|url = http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/isbn-canada/Pages/isbn-canada.aspx|website = www.bac-lac.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-01-19|first = Library and Archives|last = Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registration group identifier ===
{{anchor|Registration Group identifier}}
{{anchor|ISBN format}}
The ISBN [[list of ISBN identifier groups|registration group identifier]] is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979),&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt; and can be separated between hyphens, such as {{nobr|"978-1-..."}}. Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.&lt;ref name="ISBN Ranges"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |title= ISBN Ranges |website=isbn-international.org |at=Select the format you desire and click on the Generate button |date= 29 April 2014 |accessdate= 29 April 2014 |author= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101326/https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |archivedate= 29 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single-digit group identifiers within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for [[Bhutan]]. The allocated group IDs are: 0–5, 600–622, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9920–9989, and 99901–99981.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation a complete list of group identifiers].  ISBN.org sometimes calls them ''group numbers''. Their table of identifiers now refers to ''ISBN prefix ranges'', which must be assumed to be group identifier ranges.&lt;/ref&gt; Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hailman |first=Jack Parker |date=2008 |title=Coding and redundancy: man-made and animal-evolved signals |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=209 |isbn=978-0-674-02795-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the 979 prefix element, the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with [[International Standard Music Number]]s (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' manual |work=isbn-international.org |edition=Sixth International |isbn=978-92-95055-02-5 |date=2012 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=no |pages=7, 23 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-5691881"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/export_rangemessagebyprefix.pdf |title=International ISBN Agency – Range Message (pdf sorted by prefix) |page=29 |website=isbn-international.org |date=5 December 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.

=== Registrant element ===
The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element ([[cf.]] [[:Category:ISBN agencies]]) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most bookstores only handle ISBN bearing publications.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form ([[Euro|€]]1399, [[United States dollar|US$]]1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.isbn-international.org/page/directory Publisher's International ISBN Directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921085436/http://isbn-international.org/page/directory |date=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: [[List of group-0 ISBN publisher codes|identifier 0]] and [[List of group-1 ISBN publisher codes|identifier 1]].

Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.

By using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book Book: A Complete Guide to Creating a Book on Your Computer|last=Splane|first=Lily|publisher=Anaphase II Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-0-945962-14-4|location=|pages=37|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some sample &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; codes, illustrating block length variations.

==== Pattern for English language ISBNs ====
English-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-9122662"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |title=ISBN Ranges |date=15 September 2014 &lt;!-- No date available; last modification date used. --&gt; |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=isbn-international.org |author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=International ISBN Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Check digits ==
A [[check digit]] is a form of redundancy check used for [[error detection]], the decimal equivalent of a binary [[check bit]]. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the ten-digit code is an extension of that for SBNs, the two systems are compatible, and SBN prefixed with "0" will give the same check-digit as without – the digit is base eleven, and can be 0-9 or X. The system for thirteen-digit codes is not compatible and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, and does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the thirteen-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an "X".

=== ISBN-10 check digits ===
The 2001 edition of the official manual of the [http://www.isbn-international.org/ International ISBN Agency] says that the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[check digit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |title=ISBN Users' Manual – 4. Structure of ISBN |publisher=Isbn.org |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522043458/http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN – must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of [[11 (number)|11]].

For example, for an &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; of 0-306-40615-2:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (0\times 10) + (3\times 9) + (0\times 8) + (6\times 7) + (4\times 6) + (0\times 5) + (6\times 4) + (1\times 3) + (5\times 2) + (2\times 1) \\
   &amp;=    0 + 27 +   0 +  42 +  24 +   0 + 24  +   3 + 10 + 2\\
   &amp;= 132 = 12\times 11
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, using [[modular arithmetic]], we can say:
:&lt;math&gt;(10x_1+9x_2+8x_3+7x_4+6x_5+5x_6+4x_7+3x_8+2x_9+x_{10})\equiv 0 \pmod{11}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also true for &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ''ascending'' order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (0\times 1) + (3\times 2) + (0\times 3) + (6\times 4) + (4\times 5) + (0\times 6) + (6\times 7) + (1\times 8) + (5\times 9) + (2\times 10) \\
   &amp;=    0 + 6 +   0 +  24 +  20 +   0 + 42  +   8 + 45 + 20\\
   &amp;= 165 = 15\times 11
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, we can say:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4 + 5x_5 + 6x_6 + 7x_7 + 8x_8 + 9x_9 + 10x_{10})\equiv 0 \pmod{11}.&lt;/math&gt;

The two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be [[mathematical proof|proved]] that all possible valid &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a [[prime number]].)
The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN&amp;nbsp;– the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''I'saka: a sketch grammar of a language of north-central New Guinea.'' Pacific Linguistics. ISBN "0-85883-554-4".&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).

=== ISBN-10 check digit calculation ===
&lt;!-- "Damm algorithm" links here --&gt;
Each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.

For example, the check digit for an &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; of 0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (0\times 10)+(3\times 9)+(0\times 8)+(6\times 7)+(4\times 6)+(0\times 5)+(6\times 4)+(1\times 3)+(5\times 2)\\
   &amp;= 130
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (132 = 12 x 11) &amp;minus; this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 0-306-40615-2&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The value &lt;math&gt;x_{10}&lt;/math&gt; required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so, an 'X' should be used.

Alternatively, [[modular arithmetic]] is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The [[remainder]] of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 – 0 = 11 which is invalid. (Strictly speaking the ''first'' "modulo 11" is unneeded, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)

For example, the check digit for the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; of 0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (11 - ( ((0\times 10)+(3\times 9)+(0\times 8)+(6\times 7)+(4\times 6)+(0\times 5)+(6\times 4)+(1\times 3)+(5\times 2) ) \,\bmod\, 11 ) \,\bmod\, 11\\
   &amp;=    (11 - (0 + 27 +   0 +  42 +  24 +   0 + 24  +   3 + 10 ) \,\bmod\, 11) \,\bmod\, 11\\
   &amp;= (11-(130 \,\bmod\, 11))\,\bmod\, 11 \\
   &amp;= (11-(9))\,\bmod\, 11 \\
   &amp;= (2)\,\bmod\, 11 \\
   &amp;= 2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the check digit is 2.

It is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; computes the necessary multiples:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Returns ISBN error syndrome, zero for a valid ISBN, non-zero for an invalid one.
// digits[i] must be between 0 and 10.
int CheckISBN(int const digits[10])
{
        int i, s = 0, t = 0;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
                t += digits[i];
                s += t;
        }
        return s % 11;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 99999-999-9-X&lt;/nowiki&gt;), or &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.

=== ISBN-13 check digit calculation ===
The 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2012) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(284&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how the 13-digit ISBN [[check digit]] is calculated. The &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of [[10 (number)|10]].

Formally, using [[modular arithmetic]], we can say:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + x_5 + 3x_6 + x_7 + 3x_8 + x_9 + 3x_{10} + x_{11} + 3x_{12} + x_{13} ) \equiv 0 \pmod{10}.&lt;/math&gt;

The calculation of an &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.

For example, the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit of 978-0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:
&lt;!-- This is what we'd like to do, but it is far too wide.
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \begin{array}{rlllllllllllll}
s &amp;{}= 1 \times 9 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 7 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 8 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 0 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 3 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 0 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 6 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 4 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 0 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 6 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 1 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 5 \\
 &amp;{}= 9 &amp;{}+21 &amp;{}+ 8 &amp;{}+ 0 &amp;{}+ 3 &amp;{}+ 0 &amp;{}+ 6 &amp;{}+ 12 &amp;{}+ 0 &amp;{}+ 18 &amp;{}+ 1 &amp;{}+ 15 \\
 &amp;{}= 93
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
 s = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3
   =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15
   = 93
 93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3
 10 –  3 = 7

Thus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

In general, the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit is calculated as follows.

Let
:&lt;math&gt;r = \big(10 - \big(x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + \cdots + x_{11} + 3x_{12}\big) \,\bmod\, 10\big).&lt;/math&gt;

Then
:&lt;math&gt;x_{13} = \begin{cases} r &amp;\text{ ; } r &lt; 10 \\ 0 &amp;\text{ ; } r = 10 . \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This check system&amp;nbsp;– similar to the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] check digit formula&amp;nbsp;– does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; formula uses the [[prime number|prime]] modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.

Additionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).

The conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix "978" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; algorithm.

=== {{anchor|Cancelled ISBN}}Errors in usage ===
Publishers and [[library|libraries]] have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Book Publishing I|last=Lorimer|first=Rowland|last2=Shoichet|first2=Jillian|last3=Maxwell|first3=John W.|publisher=CCSP Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9738727-0-5|location=|pages=299|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{ISBN|0-590-76484-5}} is shared by two books – ''Ninja gaiden®: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo'' (1990) and ''Wacky laws'' (1997), both published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]].

Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The [[Library of Congress]] catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase "Cancelled ISBN".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd020.html 020 – International Standard Book Number (R) – MARC 21 Bibliographic – Full]. Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; However, book-ordering systems such as [[Amazon.com]] will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} [[OCLC]] often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.

=== eISBN ===
Only the term "ISBN" should be used; the terms "eISBN" and "e-ISBN" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital ([[e-book]]) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate [[EPUB]], [[Amazon Kindle]], and [[PDF]] formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic "eISBN" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sellbox.com/myth-eisbn-every-ebook-edition-needs-unique-number/|title=The Myth of the eISBN Why Every eBook Edition Needs a Unique Number – Publishing services for self publishing authors and businesses|date=2013-06-28|newspaper=Publishing services for self publishing authors and businesses|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading ==
Currently the [[barcode]]s on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market [[paperback]] book's front cover) are [[European Article Number|EAN-13]]; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an [[EAN-5]] for the [[currency]] and the [[recommended retail price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Frequently asked questions |publisher= ISBN |place= [[U.S.|US]] |date= 12 March 2014 |url= http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416211950/http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |archivedate= 16 April 2014 |df= dmy-all }} — including a detailed description of the EAN-13 format.&lt;/ref&gt; For 10-digit ISBNs, the number "978", the [[Bookland]] "country code", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits).

Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (&lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt;). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher= Collections |contribution-url= http://www.collectionscanada.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm |type= FAQ |title= ISO TC49SC9 |contribution= ISBN |place= [[Canada|CA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2011}}, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the [[Bookland|Musicland]] code for [[Sheet music|musical scores]] with an [[ISMN]]. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an "M" letter; the bar code represents the "M" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.

Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the [[Global Trade Item Number]] (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Standards | contribution-url = http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/transition.asp | contribution = Are You Ready for &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt;? | publisher = ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to [[information technology]] systems. Hence, many [[bookstore|booksellers]] (e.g., [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] [[barcode system]] to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; in North America.

'''Janko Brašić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јанко Брашић}}; [[Oparić]], January  1, 1906 – June 15, 1994) was [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Naive art|naïve]] [[painter]]. He is considered to be one of the foremost contributors to the [[Naïve art]] genre, with a worldwide reputation.

== Biography ==
Brašić was born in 1906 in Oparić near [[Jagodina]]. He began painting in 1927, but his earliest dated works are from 1933 ([[drawing]]s and [[self-portrait]] in [[Oil on canvas|oil]]). He is considered as the founder of the Serbian naive art. He died in his birth village of Oparić in 1994, where he lived and worked all his life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Н. Крстић, ''Завичајни хроничари'', in Наивна уметност у Србији, САНУ, Београд - МНМУ, Јагодина, 2003; 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==About himself==

"I made my self-portrait as a testimony so that my fellow-countrymen would stay calm. If I painted someone else they could accuse me of the lack of resemblance since I got the picture and the man whose portrait I had made wouldn't be there for them to see him immediately. Well, this is how it was!… It was easy for me to make the portrait of myself … I looked at myself in the mirror and that's how I painted."&lt;ref&gt;''Vreme'', May 15, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Style ==
As a chronicler of his time, he managed for a moment to check the passing of the old and patriarchal way of life, preserving the fluid of the past time. Rustic, elemental realism is his way of maintaining the primeval contact with his environment. Void completely of professional routine, his painting makes a harsh, sonorous impression.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In a review of his work, an art critic wrote:
"The development of Serbian naive art officially starts with the work of Janko Brašić. His earliest works ([[portrait]]s) date from 1933. Rustic elementary realism is his way of expressing primordial relations with his surroundings. Lacking professional routine his painting seem bitter and sounding. Scenes are mainly presented in a rural landscape; they possess bright colorization, without explicitly expressed focus. However, the most expressive are his psychological portraits. With almost six decades of fruitful work Janko Brašić will remain the symbol of naive art in Serbia and Oparić will be widely famous as his homeland...".

== Exhibitions and awards ==
His first group exhibition was organized in 1935 by the [http://www.ulupuds.org.rs/eng/index1.php Association of Serbian Artists] in the [[Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion]] in Belgrade. It was an exhibition of portraits, in which Brašić exhibited a portrait of King Peter II and a self-portrait in oil. Besides scenes from rural life, historical myths and anecdotes – portraits dominate in Brašić's opus. 
The greatest collection of his paintings is at [http://www.mnmu.rs Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA)], Jagodina, Serbia.

'''Karin Ragnhild Maria Hübinette''', née Pettersson (18 April 1966), is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] journalist and television presenter. She is the sister of politician [[Hillevi Engström]].&lt;ref name="medievarlden.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievarlden.se/nyheter/2014/03/karin-huebinette-tillbaka-till-agenda|title=Karin Hübinette tillbaka till Agenda|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hübinette started her career as the presenter of the debate show Svart eller vitt, which was broadcast on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="sydsvenskan.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/karin-hubinette--tillbaka-med-egen-agenda/|title=Karin Hübinette – tillbaka med egen agenda|work=Sydsvenskan|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that she presented [[Uppdrag granskning]] and Kvällsöppet, and was also a reporter at [[Sveriges Radio]]. She then worked solely for [[SVT]] presenting the news shows [[Agenda (Swedish TV program)|Agenda]] and [[Aktuellt]]. She is a board member of the company Hands on AB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solidinfo.se/foretag/hands-on-i-stockholm-ab/personer|title=Hands on i Stockholm AB|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When her sister [[Hillevi Engström]], who is a politician for the [[Moderate Party]], became secretary of employment after the general elections in 2010, Hübinette had to resign from her work as a journalist at Agenda and Aktuellt.&lt;ref name="medievarlden.se"/&gt; She however remained working at SVT, where she became a foreign reporter for the show Korrespondenterna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/karin-hubinette-far-nytt-jobb/ Karin Hübinette får nytt jobb] Expressen Retrieved 6 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; One year later she started presenting her own talk show, called ''Hübinette'', which aired for two seasons in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name="sydsvenskan.se"/&gt;

Karin Hübinette returned to presenting Agenda in 2014 after the program changed format and added [[Camilla Kvartoft]] and others as presenters.&lt;ref name="svt.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/kultur/hubinette-atervander-till-agenda|title=Hübinette återvänder till Agenda|work=svt.se|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if her sister appears on the show, one of the other presenters can interview her.&lt;ref name="svt.se"/&gt;

In the first edition of the Book of Mormon (1830), Mary was referred to as "the mother of God, after the manner of the flesh,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[The Book of Mormon]] |location= Palmyra, NY |publisher= E.B. Grandin |year= 1830 |page= 25}}. [http://www.inephi.com/25.htm Online reprint] at ''inephi.com'' by John Hajicek.&lt;/ref&gt; a reading that was changed by [[Joseph Smith]] to "the mother of the Son of God" in subsequent editions (1837–).&lt;ref&gt; {{lds|1 Nephi|1-ne|11|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latter Day Saint author [[Hugh Nibley]] has argued that the change was made to "avoid confusion, since during the theological controversies of the early Middle Ages the expression 'mother of God' took on a special connotation which it still has for many Christians".

'''Moral rights''' are [[rights]] of creators of [[copyright]]ed works generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]], the right to have a work published [[anonymity|anonymously]] or [[pseudonym]]ously, and the right to the integrity of the work.&lt;ref&gt;"moral, adj.". OED Online. September 2011. Oxford University Press. 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is "prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P123_20726], Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, September 9, 1886, art. 6bis, S. Treaty Doc. No. 27, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sundara Rajan, Mira T.|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkzKM4pvyB4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Copyright and Creative Freedom: A Study of Post-Socialist Law Reform|page= 41-42|series= Routledge Studies in International Law|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis| ISBN= 978-0-20396-776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rigamonti, Cyrill P.|title= Deconstructing Moral Rights|journal=Harvard International Law Journal|volume= 47|issue= 2 |date=Summer 2006|page= 353-412}}&lt;/ref&gt; before they were included in the ''[[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]'' in 1928.&lt;ref name=kwall&gt;Kwall, Roberta Rosenthal (2010) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=smES_wO_NscC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=the+soul+of+creativity+kwall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YW7GYnpF9Q&amp;sig=AE0n0MnGyJmeY8gbK7z1rQcxphQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CMWmTqqrObLE0AHRy_2hDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Soul of Creativity: Forging a Moral Rights Law for the United States''], Stanford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-80475-643-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} [[Canada]] recognizes moral rights (''droits moraux'') in its ''Copyright Act'' (''Loi sur le droit d'auteur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-14.html Copyright Act] (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] became a signatory to the convention in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/results.jsp?countries=US&amp;cat_id=11 Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated a version of moral rights under its copyright law under Title 17 of the U.S. Code.

Some jurisdictions allow for the [[waiver]] of moral rights.&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|44-45}} In the United States, the ''[[Visual Artists Rights Act]] of 1990 (VARA)'' recognizes moral rights, but applies only to a narrow subset of works of [[visual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura (December 2002) "Copyright and moral rights", ''Information Outlook'', Vol. 6, No. 12, p. 40 (Copyright Corner)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions like Austria differentiate between narrow and wide moral rights. Whilst the former is about integrity of the work, the latter limits usages, which may harm the author's integrity. Some copyright timestamp services allow an author to publish allowed and disallowed usage intentions to prevent a violation of such wider moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.registeredcommons.org/faq/#f15 RegisteredCommons.org FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berne Convention==
Through the Rome Revision of the Berne Convention in 1928, the Berne Convention accepted two forms of moral rights; paternity and integrity. These rights are included in Article 6bis of the ''Berne Convention'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Independent of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion,  modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to the said work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P123_20726], Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, September 9, 1886, art. 6bis, S. Treaty Doc. No. 27, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Europe===

In most of Europe, it is not possible for authors to assign or even waive their moral rights. This is following a tradition in European copyright itself, which is regarded as an item of property which cannot be sold, but only licensed. Parties certainly can agree not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in and amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hoppe-Jänisch |first=Daniel |date=19 May 2015 |title=IP Assignment Clauses in International Employment Contracts |publisher=Lexology |publication-place=London |page=9 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=365c8b4a-efe5-45c7-872f-88ca68042d7a |accessdate=3 August 2015 | quote=European copyright systems provide for a stronger connection between the copyright and the author of the protected work. This makes sense if one considers that even though the German ''Urheberrecht'' or the French ''droit d'auteur'' are often translated as ''copyright'', the literal translation is ''author’s right''. It comprises not only proprietary rights but also moral rights. In many European jurisdictions, only the proprietary rights are assignable; in others, copyrights, including the proprietary rights, cannot be assigned at all but authors may only grant others a license to exploit the protected work. Moral rights are usually not assignable and can be waived only to a limited extent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
{{main|Moral rights in Canadian copyright law}}
Section 14.1 of [[Copyright law of Canada|Canada's Copyright Act]] protects the moral rights of authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-14.html Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)]&lt;/ref&gt; The moral rights cannot be assigned, but can be waived contractually. Many publishing contracts in Canada now contain a standard moral right waiver.

Moral rights in Canada were famously exercised in the case of ''[[Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.'' (1982) 70 C.P.R. (2d) 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case [[Toronto Eaton Centre]], a large shopping mall, had commissioned the artist Michael Snow for a sculpture of Canada Geese.  Snow successfully stopped Eaton's from decorating the geese with bows at Christmas.

===In China===
Article 20 of the [[s:Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (1990)|Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (1990)]] provides unlimited term of protection of the rights of authorship, alteration, and integrity of an author. As Article 55 of the same Law provides retroactive protection of unexpired term on the date of entry into force of this Law, the Chinese perpetual moral rights are retroactive as well. The [[s:Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (2001)|2001]] version retains this provision and the original Article 55 becomes Article 59.

===In Ghana===
Art. 18, [http://portal.unesco.org/culture/admin/file_download.php/gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf?URL_ID=30226&amp;filename=11416586343gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf&amp;filetype=application%2Fpdf&amp;filesize=526153&amp;name=gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf&amp;location=user-S/ Copyright Act, 2005]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} provides perpetual moral rights. The moral rights in Art. 6 are for proper attribution and against any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author or where the work is discredited by the act.

===In Hong Kong===
Moral Rights is specified under Copyright Ordinance (Chapter 528) Division IV, starting from section 89.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/chi/home.htm Please visit Hongkong legislation website for specified ordinance sections]&lt;/ref&gt; Author of computer program does not have Moral Rights (section 91). Moral Rights cannot be transferred unless on the death of moral rights holder (section 105 and 106).

===In India===

Moral rights are recognised under section 57 of India copyright act. Section 57 of India Copyright act refers to Author's Special rights. It states:

:(1) Independently of author's copyright, and even after the assignment either wholly or partially of the said copyright, the author of the work shall have the right to claim authorship of the work as well as the right to restrain, or claim damages in respect of 
::(a) any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the said work; or
::(b) any other action in relation to the said work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.
:(2) The right conferred upon an author of a work by sub section (1), other than the right to claim authorship of the work, may be exercised by the legal representatives of the author. 

The issue of moral rights was discussed in Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India &amp; Ors.(Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India &amp; Ors CS/OS/No.2074/1992 decided on 21st Feb 2005. Court of Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog). The case pertained to a mural that was commissioned in 1957 by Government of India during construction of Vigyan Bhavan at New Delhi. The mural in question was made of bronze had span of 140 feet sweep of 40 feet. The mural remained on display and was much appreciated till pulled down in 1979 and then consigned to storerooms of Union of India. Delhi High Court specifically referred to Berne Convention in delivering judgement. Court also awarded damages Rs. 500000 (half million) and also decreed in favor of the Amar Nath Sehgal that he would have an absolute right to recreate the mural at any place and right to sale the same.

The Court accepted existence of moral rights despite the work being commissioned work and copyright had passed over to union of India and suit being brought 13years after the said act(defense of limitations as pleaded by Government was rejected by the court).

===In Macao===
Article 41 of the [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/99/33/declei43_en.asp Decree-Law_n.o_43/99/M] provides inalienable, unrenounceable and imprescriptible author’s personal rights.

===In Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], the Copyright Act has provided authors' perpetual moral rights with regard of attribution and protection against alteration in bad faith, even if the works are in the [[public domain]], as follows:
*Article 25 of the Copyright Act 1928 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117617051400.htm]
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1944 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117633033100.htm]
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1948, unchanged from the 1944 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117637123100.htm] (The effective jurisdiction of the Republic of China became limited to [[Taiwan Area]] in 1949.)
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1964, unchanged from the 1948 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117653063000.htm]
*Article 26 of the Copyright Act 1985 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117674062800.htm]
*Article 26 of the Copyright Act 1990, unchanged from the 1985 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117679011100.htm]
*Section 3, Articles 15-21 of the Copyright Act 1992, with the Article unchanged in the subsequent versions of the Copyright Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117681052200.htm] [http://www.tipo.gov.tw/en/AllInOne_Show.aspx?path=1485&amp;guid=26d93e21-7218-4b04-a4a8-44af93325c92&amp;lang=en-us]

===In the United States===

Moral rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title = United States Copyright Office|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a less robust tradition in the United States. Copyright law in the United States emphasizes protection of financial reward over protection of creative attribution.&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|xiii}} The exclusive rights tradition in the United States is inconsistent with the notion of moral rights as it was constituted in the Civil Code tradition stemming from post-Revolutionary France. When the United States acceded to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], it stipulated that the Convention's "moral rights" provisions were addressed sufficiently by other statutes, such as laws covering [[slander and libel]].&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|30}}

Some individual states have moral rights laws, particularly pertaining to visual art and artists (''See'', ''e.g.'' [[California Art Preservation Act]], [[Artists Authorship Rights Act (New York)]]). However, it is unclear if these laws, or portions thereof, are preempted by federal laws, such as the Visual Artists Rights Act.

In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'', the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe made a claim of "mutilation" (akin to a moral rights claim) in 1975 in [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]] against American TV network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for airing re-edited versions of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Monty Python, v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.'', 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir 1976) [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/538/538.F2d.14.75-7693.76-7023.913.1058.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514191609/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/538/538.F2d.14.75-7693.76-7023.913.1058.html |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was primarily decided on the basis of whether the BBC was licensed in such a way as to allow ABC to edit the videos (paragraph 20).

====Visual Artists Rights Act====
[[Visual Artists Rights Act|The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990]] grants authors of a "work of visual art" - e.g. photographs, paintings, sculptures, etc. - the non-transferable&lt;ref&gt;At {{USCSub|17|106A|e|1}}, "The rights conferred ... may not be transferred"&lt;/ref&gt; right to

*claim authorship
*prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
*prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
*prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation
*prevent the destruction of a work of art if it is of "recognized stature"&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura (December 2002) "Copyright and moral rights", ''Information Outlook'', Vol. 6, No. 12, pp. 40-41 (Copyright Corner)&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are distinct from any rights of copyright and ownership of a copy of the work.&lt;ref&gt;At {{USCSub|17|106A|e|2}}, "Ownership of the rights ... is distinct from ownership of any copy of that work, or of a copyright or any exclusive right under a copyright in that work."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adaptation right====
Copyright holders have the right to control adaptations, or the preparation of "[[derivative works]]". This right is given under [[copyright law in the United States|copyright law]]. ''See'' 17 U.S.C. § 106.

====Lanham Act====
Section 43 of the [[Lanham Act]] governs false and misleading advertising, and can apply in some instances to attribution of protected works. However, it cannot be used to create moral rights for works outside of the Act. ''See'' ''[[Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox]]''.

====Courtesy of non-attribution====
Authors occasionally wish to distance themselves from work they've been involved with, some to the point of not wishing to be recognized as the work's author. One way they may do this is by signing the work under a pseudonym. [[Alan Smithee]] was a traditional, collective pseudonym used between 1968 and 1999 by discontented [[Hollywood]] [[film director]]s who no longer wanted to be credited. This courtesy was not always extended, however. The director of ''[[Highlander II: The Quickening|Highlander II]]'', [[Russell Mulcahy]], wanted his name removed after the completion bond company took over film production, but he was contractually obliged not to impugn the film and he was told that using a pseudonym would impugn it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

If the work was [[unfinished work|unfinished]], sometimes the original author will choose a pseudonym as permission for the copyright holder to do whatever they wish to finish and market the unwanted work, cutting ties from the product.

'''Censorship of music''' refers to the practice of editing of [[music|musical works]] for various reasons, stemming from a wide variety of motivations, including moral, political, or religious reasons. Censorship can range from the complete government-enforced legal prohibition of a musical work, to private, voluntary removal of content when a musical work appears in a certain context.

==Motivations==
===Decency===
Songs are commonly edited for broadcast on [[radio]] and [[television]] to remove content that may be considered objectionable to an outlet's [[target audience]]—such as [[profanity]], or references to subjects such as [[sexual activity|sex]] and [[recreational drug|drug usage]]. This is typically done to comply with any relevant [[broadcast law]] or [[codes of conduct]], and to make the songs more marketable to a mainstream audience.&lt;ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt; Songs edited for content in this manner by are often referred to as a "[[clean version]]" or a "[[radio edit]]" (the latter also referring to songs that may be edited for length on radio airplay, and in the past, space limitations on 45 RPM [[vinyl record]]s).&lt;ref name=cp-attentionspans&gt;{{cite news|title=QuickHitz offers radio hit parade edited for short attention spans|url=http://www.theprovince.com/news/QuickHitz+offers+radio+parade+edited+short+attention+spans/10102495/story.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|agency=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3395823.stm|title=Banned on the run|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common editing techniques include distorting vocals to obscure offending words (including muting, [[bleep censor|bleeping]], and [[backmasking]]), or replacing them with alternative lyrics.&lt;ref name="guardian-sandm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ewing|first=Tom|title=How pop is provoking the censors again|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/09/rihanna-lyrics-censorship-radio-one|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of censorship required may vary between broadcasters, depending on [[standards and practices]] and their target audience; for example, [[Radio Disney]] imposes stricter content guidelines than conventional U.S. radio stations, as it primarily targets a youth audience and family listening.&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/08/454606994/the-art-of-the-clean-version|title=The Art Of The 'Clean Version'|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some radio stations may relegate unedited versions of tracks containing objectionable content to airplay during [[Watershed (broadcasting)|time periods deemed appropriate]], such as late-night hours.&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"/&gt; Joel Mullis, an Atlanta sound engineer who became well-known in the industry for his work on radio edits, noted that his job was often complicated by differing standards between broadcasters (such as [[BET]] and [[MTV]]), requiring different edits to meet their individual needs. Mullis' edit of the [[Ying Yang Twins]]' "[[Wait (The Whisper Song)]]" was constructed by splicing in vocals from other Ying Yang Twins songs, but Mullis eventually had to bring the group back to his studio after facing demands for additional edits.&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt;

In some cases, a [[record label]] may choose to withhold a release entirely if they believe that its subject matter would be too controversial; [[Ice-T]] and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]] both had [[gangsta rap]] albums withheld or indefinitely delayed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] over content concerns, with Ice-T's [[Home Invasion (album)|''Home Invasion'']] delayed due to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] and controversy over "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]"—a song by Ice-T's metal band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], and Paris's ''[[Sleeping with the Enemy (album)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]'' over its songs "[[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] Killa" and "Coffee, Doughnuts, &amp; Death". [[Insane Clown Posse]] faced similar issues after they signed to [[Disney]]-owned [[Hollywood Records]]; despite compliance with the label's demands to censor specific songs and lyrics, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'' was recalled almost immediately after its release (but not before selling 18,000 copies out of 100,000 shipped). All three acts moved to different labels (including [[Priority Records]] and [[Island Records]]), which released their respective albums without objections.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/violent-j-breaks-down-insane-clown-posses-joker-card-lps-20150213/the-great-milenko-1997-20150213|title=Violent J Gives the Twisted Stories Behind ICP's Best LPs|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/1997/07/25/great-milenko/|title=The Great Milenko|date=1997-07-25|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/controversial-rap-album-covers/paris-sleeping-with-the-enemy|title=A History of Scandalous Rap Album Covers: Paris, Sleeping with the Enemy (1992)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notable examples ====
Multiple edits of [[CeeLo Green]]'s song "[[Fuck You (CeeLo Green song)|Fuck You]]" exist, including one which changed the titular lyric to "Forget You", and one which muted "fuck" without replacing it. Green also performed a [[Parody music|parody]] of the song about [[Fox News]] in an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/11/10/cee-lo-green-colbert-fox-news/|title=Cee-Lo Green swaps 'Fox News' for 'F--k You' on 'Colbert'|last=|first=|date=2010-11-10|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129454158|title=Cee Lo's Viral Hit: Blunt and Sweet|date=August 26, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/30/cee.lo.song.video/index.html|title=Cee Lo's YouTube hit you won't hear on radio|last=Brown|first=Damon|date=August 30, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Black Eyed Peas]] re-wrote "Let's Get Retarded"—a song from their album ''[[Elephunk]]'', as "[[Let's Get It Started]]" to serve as a promotional song for television coverage of the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]]. "Let's Get It Started" was subsequently released as a standalone single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1487022/black-eyed-peas-collaborating-with-darkness.jhtml|title=Black Eyed Peas To Make Their Own 'Walk This Way' — With The Darkness|date=14 May 2004|publisher=MTV|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard-jingles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/super-bowl-xlvii/481117/10-hits-you-didnt-know-were-jingles|title=10 Hits You Didn't Know Were Jingles|website=Billboard|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When performing his song "[[Power (Kanye West song)|Power]]" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[Kanye West]] similarly replaced an entire verse, which contained profanities as well as lyrics directly criticising the program (such as "Fuck ''SNL'' and the whole cast") with newly-written lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/kanye-west-power-lyrics-changed-saturday-night-live-performance-nbc-article-1.186295|title=Kanye uses 'Power' to change lyrics on 'SNL'|work=New York Daily News|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs containing potentially objectionable [[double entendre]]s or [[mondegreen]]s have also been subject to censorship. For example, the title and chorus of [[Britney Spears]]' single "[[If U Seek Amy]]" was intended to be misheard as "[[Sexual intercourse|F-U-C-K me]]"; her label issued a radio edit which changed the word "seek" to "see", in order to remove the wordplay.&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{cite web | author=Guy Adams | title=Britney forced to rerecord 'sexually offensive' song | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]| date=January 21, 2009 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10552846 | accessdate=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtvone"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gil Kaufman | title=Britney Spears' 'If U Seek Amy' Poses Censorship Problems For Radio | work=MTV.com |publisher=MTV Networks| date=February 12, 2009 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602458/20090109/spears_britney.jhtml | accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised by radio stations over The Black Eyed Peas' "[[Don't Phunk With My Heart]]" upon its release, as the word "phunk" (a deliberate misspelling of "funk") could be misinterpreted by listeners as sounding like the word "fuck".&lt;ref name=mtvone/&gt; [[Meghan Trainor]] recorded an alternate version of her debut single "[[All About That Bass]]" for Radio Disney and conservative [[adult contemporary]] stations, which removed the song's suggestive metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6266667/ac-radio-disney-are-all-about-that-edited-bass|title=AC, Radio Disney Are All About That (Edited) 'Bass'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt;

Censorship of music is not limited to lyrical content; [[MTV]] edited the [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] song "[[Paper Planes]]" to replace sounds of gunfire in its chorus with alternative sound effects, and remove a reference to cannabis. Similar sound edits occurred when M.I.A. performed the same song on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (broadcast by then-corporate sibling [[CBS]]). M.I.A. subsequently criticized both MTV and ''Late Show'' for censoring her song.&lt;ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom  |last=Breihan |title=M.I.A. and the Double Standard of MTV Censorship|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/12/mia_and_the_dou.php|archivedate=February 19, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219004257/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/12/mia_and_the_dou.php|dead-url=yes|work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIAPlanesBlognytobserver"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2007/12/tube-surfing-mias-paper-planes/ | title=Tube Surfing: M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' | author=Gillian Reagen | work=[[The New York Observer]] | date=December 17, 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Some listeners have expressed dissatisfaction over the editing of songs for radio airplay, arguing that it compromises the artistic integrity of the original song, and encourage listeners to seek out alternative platforms that are not subject to such censorship, such as digital streaming. At the same time, edits are considered a necessary concession to receive the radio airplay that can influence a song's overall performance.&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt; [[N.W.A.]]'s debut album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' (which had attracted controversy for its song "[[Fuck tha Police]]") contains a song entitled "[[Express Yourself (N.W.A song)|Express Yourself]]", which criticizes radio censorship of music as inhibiting [[free expression]], and also criticizes other rappers for releasing inoffensive songs without profanity in order to receive radio airplay. Despite its themes, "Express Yourself" is the only song on the album to not contain profanities.&lt;ref name="smh-expressyourself"/&gt;

=== Sensitivity ===
Some songs may be pulled or downplayed by broadcasters if they are considered to be inappropriate to play in the aftermath of specific events. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], many broadcasters altered their music programming for these reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = The Pop Life; After the Horror, Radio Stations Pull Some Songs | work= [[The New York Times]]| date = November 19, 2001 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E2D9153BF93AA2575AC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| accessdate = August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]], whose program directors compiled an [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum|internal list]] of "lyrically questionable" songs. The list included all [[Rage Against the Machine]] songs, as well as various songs with themes related to war, destruction, flight, or [[New York City]]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' noted several unusual choices on the list, including "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]", two [[Cat Stevens]] songs (Stevens had converted to the [[Islamic faith]] and changed his name to Yusuf Islam), and [[John Lennon]]'s "explicitly pacifist anthem '[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Eliza|title=It's the End of the World as Clear Channel Knows It|work=[[Slate.com|Slate]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=http://slate.com/id/1008314/|accessdate=September 17, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015200337/http://slate.com/id/1008314/| archivedate= October 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austin-imagine"&gt;{{cite web

Following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in February 2003, [[Mark Wills]]' "[[19 Somethin']]" was temporarily pulled by some radio stations as it contains a lyric referencing the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2003|title=Singles minded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OA8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=19+Somethin+pulled+columbia+disaster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0AH0eUw4-7&amp;sig=3-MHmFYaADmGOfeiaIBV_wn0K4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixmsaT0ObUAhUo34MKHbvADQ4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage|journal=Billboard|volume=|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s then-upcoming music video for "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]" generated controversy due to its politicized and "unpatriotic" imagery (such as a [[fashion show]] featuring women dressed in military equipment, and a scene where the singer throws a [[grenade]]-shaped [[lighter]] to a [[George W. Bush]] lookalike to light his [[cigar]]), which were considered to be especially sensitive in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]]. Due to the negative response, Madonna pulled the video prior to its planned premiere, as she did not want to "risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/04/01/madonna-pulls-controversial-american-life-video/|title=Madonna pulls controversial ''American Life'' video|date=2003-04-01|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/antiwar.artsfeatures|title=Madonna takes swipe at Bush|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2003-02-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, after [[Gary Glitter]] was convicted of child sexual abuse in [[Vietnam]], the [[National Football League]] banned the original recording of his song "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll]]" (which was popularly played at U.S. sporting events)&lt;ref name="SIV"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1992/11/30/127693/the-vibes-of-victory-sports-fans-know-that-the-strains-of-rock-and-roll-part-ii-can-turn-chumps-to-champs|title=Sports fans know that the strains of 'Rock and Roll Part II' can turn chumps to champs|publisher=Time Inc.|author=Lisa Twyman Bessone|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from being played at its games. While the NFL still allowed a [[cover version]] of the song to be played, in 2012 the league instructed its teams to "avoid" playing the song entirely, following negative reception from British media over its continued use by the [[New England Patriots]], and the possibility it could be played during [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6273999/why-convicted-child-sex-offender-gary-glitters-hey|title=Why Convicted Child-Sex Offender Gary Glitter’s ‘Hey Song’ Is Still Getting Played|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/gary-glitter-10-1269123|title=NFL bosses ban Gary Glitter's 'Rock And Roll Part II' from the Super Bowl|date=2012-02-02|work=NME|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Chris Brown]]'s alleged physical altercation with his then-girlfriend [[Rihanna]], various radio stations began to voluntarily pull Brown's music from their playlists as a condemnation of his actions.&lt;ref name="mtv-willmore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Will More Radio Stations Stop Playing Chris Brown?|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1604845/will-more-radio-stations-stop-playing-chris-brown/|website=MTV.com|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Brown's songs, TV appearances yanked from air|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1604786/chris-browns-songs-tv-appearances-yanked-from-air/|website=MTV.com|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, [[HMV]] removed the entire catalogue of [[Lostprophets]] from its stores after the band's lead singer [[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)|Ian Watkins]] was charged with thirteen sexual offences against children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/29/lostprophets-removed-hmv-ian-watkins|title=Lostprophets' music removed from HMV following Ian Watkins trial|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=2013-11-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
Songs and albums may, in some cases, be censored due to [[copyright]] problems (particularly related to [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]) or other legal issues.

The [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the Australian Music Retailers Association (AMRA) maintain a self-regulatory system known as the "Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice", which utilizes a three-tier ratings system for objectionable content in music recordings. "Level 1" applies to content of a "moderate impact" (including "infrequent aggressive or strong coarse language; or
moderate-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes"), "Level 2" for "strong impact" ("frequent aggressive or strong coarse language", or strong references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes), and "Level 3" for "high impact" content (graphic and high-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes). The Level 3 classification was introduced in March 2003, and requires purchasers to be over the age of 18. The code bans the distribution or sale of any recording with material that exceeds Level 3 classification, which includes content "which promote, incite, instruct or exploitatively or gratuitously depict drug abuse, cruelty, suicide, criminal or sexual violence, child abuse, incest, bestiality or any other revolting or abhorrent activity in a way that causes outrage or extreme disgust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2453315.stm |title= Australia plans CD 'censorship' |work= BBC News |date= 2002-11-12|access-date= 2018-03-22 |language= en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/senate/legal_and_constitutional_affairs/completed_inquiries/2010-13/classificationboard/report/~/media/wopapub/senate/committee/legcon_ctte/completed_inquiries/2010-13/classification_board/report/c09.ashx |title= Inquiry |last=|first= |date= |website= Parliament of Australia |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date= March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian customs law also bans the import of any product that "describe[s], depict[s], express[es] or otherwise deal[s] with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-singapore-pornography/singapore-pilot-fined-in-australia-for-laptop-child-porn-idUKSIN10289320080213|title=Singapore pilot fined in Australia for laptop child porn|agency=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, copies of an album by [[grindcore]] band Intense Hammer Rage were seized by the [[Australian Customs Service]], and the three band members were each fined [[Australian dollar|AUD$]]500 each for violating customs law.

In May 1990, Nick Franklin, acting news director of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s radio station [[Triple J]], was suspended by the ABC's management after having played a portion of [[N.W.A.]]'s song "[[Fuck tha Police]]". The song had received airplay on the station for several months, but ABC Radio head Malcom Long requested that the song be given a "rest"; in the offending segment, Franklin discussed the song's vulgar lyrics and subject matter. In protest of the suspension, Triple J staff went on strike, and the station [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunted]] by playing the N.W.A. song "Express Yourself" on a loop. The stunt ended after the ABC resolved the dispute and reinstated Long. The song was ultimately played 82 times in a row.&lt;ref name="smh-expressyourself"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/express-yourself-the-day-triple-j-played-the-same-nwa-song-82-times-in-a-row-20150902-gjdk0d.html|title=Express yourself: The day Triple J played the same N.W.A. song 82 times in a row|last=Casimir|first=Paul Chamberlin and Jon|date=2015-09-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, content broadcast by radio and television is self-regulated under the code of ethics of the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] by a group known as the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC), which acts upon complaints submitted by the general public. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) can intervene in more substantial cases.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

In 2011, the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic]] panel of the CBSC, in response to a complaint against [[CHOZ-FM]], ruled that the original version of [[Dire Straits]]' 1985 single, "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" violated the ethics code, because of its use of the word "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]"—a homophobic slur. However, the CRTC called upon the CBSC to review the decision with a national panel, as it "elicited a strong public reaction and created uncertainty for private radio stations across the country." In particular, the CRTC asked the CBSC to consider the overall context of the slur in relation to the rest of the song, as well as how the word was used at the time of the song's release.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/CRTC+asks+review+Dire+Straits+song/4144591/story.html|title=CRTC asks for review of Dire Straits song ban|last=Abma|first=Derek|agency=Postmedia News|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBSC overturned the ruling; while panellists agreed that the slur was inappropriate, it was considered to be satirical and non-hateful in context. It was also noted that lead singer [[Mark Knopfler]] had substituted the word himself with alternatives (such as "queenie") during live performances, which was considered an admission that his original choice in words was in bad taste. The CBSC stated that it was up to individual stations whether or not they would play the unedited version.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The ruling and controversy were ridiculed by critics; veteran Canadian radio personality [[Alan Cross]] commented that the controversy made Canada look "silly", remarking that "I talked to people from the U.S. and the U.K. and they were like, 'What's wrong with you people? Don't you get it? It's a joke. It's a satire. You didn't understand the context?" ''[[National Post]]'' columnist Chris Selley described the CBSC's new ruling as a "comedy classic" and "colossal waste of time", explaining that "it's one thing for a censor to decide whether something is legitimately artistic; it's another for it to declare whether or not it enjoys the art, as if it somehow mattered."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-broadcast-standards-ruling-on-money-for-nothing-a-comedy-classic|title=Chris Selley: Broadcast Standards ruling on Money for Nothing a comedy classic|date=2011-09-01|work=National Post|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/canada-lifts-ban-on-dire-straits-money-for-nothing-20110901|title=Canada Lifts Ban on Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{See also|Censorship in China}}
During the rule of [[Mao Zedong]], "[[Yellow Music]]" became subject to criticism and censure, since the [[Communist Party of China]] saw Shanghai ''[[shidaiqu]]'' [[C-pop|pop music]]&lt;ref name="shanghai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/article/367361/shanghai-love |title=From Shanghai with love |date=31 December 2001 |work=South China Morning Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; as indecent, and critics saw the sentiments of love songs as appealing only to the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''. The genre was also criticized over its connections to American [[jazz]] music, due to [[Anti-American sentiment]] from the [[Korean War]]. This resulted in many artists associated with shidaiqu, including [[Li Jinhui]] (who had been credited as a leading figure in the genre) and [[Chen Gexin]], being branded as "[[Right-wing politics|rightists]]" and persecuted. Shanghai pop was displaced by [[Political music in China|revolutionary music]] that promoted [[Maoism]] and other ideologies of the Communist Party. In 1966, [[Tian Han]]—writer of the Chinese national anthem "[[March of the Volunteers]]"—was imprisoned over his allegorical play ''Xie Yaohuan'' (which was critical of Mao's regime) in one of the opening salvos of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. His works were banned, leading to "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East is Red]]"—a song which glorified Mao's [[cult of personality]], being used as the ''de facto'' national anthem at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiQJmCxVICcC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Jazz Planet |editor= E.

To appeal to the country's conservatism, television broadcasters have sometimes [[List of banned K-pop videos|pulled music videos from airplay]] for containing content they deem to be inappropriate, such as violent or sexually suggestive content. While Korea's three major television networks—[[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]—have all banned videos at some point, the [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] KBS is known for doing so more often due to its stricter regulations, which additionally forbid songs that encourage inappropriate behaviour (especially among youth), or contain references to brand names or Japanese words. This results in some songs, such as [[Psy (rapper)|Psy]]'s "[[Gentleman (Psy song)|Gentleman]]" (which was banned by KBS for a scene in which the singer kicks over a [[traffic cone]]) being banned only by KBS, but still receiving airplay by other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/6531811/gain-hawwah-interview-religion-south-korea|title=Gain Goes In on New 'Hawwah' EP, Religion and South Korea's Conservative Music Industry|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170614000718|title=G-Dragon, NCT 127 songs deemed unsuitable for KBS|work=The Korea Herald|date=2017-06-14|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/04/11/10-songs-banned-korean-broadcast|title=10 songs banned from Korean broadcast|website=SBS PopAsia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/04/03/crayon-pops-uh-ee-banned-for-shiny-japanese-word/|title=Crayon Pop’s ‘Uh-ee’ Banned for Shiny Japanese Word|last=Gale|first=Alastair|date=2014-04-03|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/01/25/kbs-bans-one-shinees-jonghyuns-new-songs|title=KBS bans one of SHINee's Jonghyun's new songs|website=SBS PopAsia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/04/18/south-korean-tv-network-bans-psys-video/|title=South Korean TV Network Bans Psy’s Video|last=Kwaak|first=Jeyup S.|date=2013-04-18|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] was historically known for [[List of songs banned by the BBC|censoring]] various songs from being played on its [[BBC Radio|radio]] and [[BBC Television|television]] stations; from the 1930s through 1960s, the BBC had banned songs such as "[[Hold My Hand (1953 song)|Hold My Hand]]" for its religious references, pop arrangements of classical tunes (though barring "[[Sabre Dance]]" because it was "not a well-loved classic whose perversion we would be encouraging"), and during [[World War II]], songs that were "slushy in sentiment", such as "[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]", due to concerns that it would affect the morale of soldiers. "[[Mack the Knife]]" was also banned from airplay outside of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', as the BBC felt it would be offensive outside of the context of the play.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/unfit-for-aunties-airwaves-the-artists-censored-by-the-bbc-765106.html|title=Unfit for Auntie's airwaves: The artists censored by the BBC|date=14 December 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Kinks]]' "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" was briefly banned under the BBC's anti-[[product placement]] rules, as its lyrics contain references to the brand name [[Coca-Cola]].

The [[Sex Pistols]]' 1977 single "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was controversial upon its release, as it was critical of the British government and monarchy (among other things, referring to the United Kingdom as a "fascist regime"), and was released during the year of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|silver jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1219770.stm |title= Sex Pistols cover tops chart |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "God Save the Queen" was banned by the BBC and all [[independent local radio]] stations, but still peaked at #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] during the week of the official Jubilee celebration. It was alleged that the chart's rules were changed for that week only to exclude sales from record shops that sold their own records (in this case, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]), in a deliberate effort to prevent the controversial song from reaching the number-one spot and causing wider offence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2010060.stm|title=Bragg attacks Pistols' royal views|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/12/artsfeatures.popandrock|title=Leaders of the banned|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2002-04-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-charting-the-number-ones-that-somehow-got-away-1145809.html|title=Music: Charting the number ones that somehow got away|date=1998-02-20|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] song "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" generated controversy due to its suggestive lyrics; the chorus contained double entendres such as "when you want to suck to it" and "when you want to come", which were interpreted as being oblique references to [[oral sex]] and [[ejaculation]] respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/27/radio-1-relax-ban-john-peel-1984-archive|title=Shake-up planned at Radio 1 after Relax ban|last=Harron|first=Mary|date=1984-01-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 morning DJ [[Mike Read]] stopped the song on-air during a chart rundown to point out its "obscene" lyrics, and announced that he would no longer play the song during his show. The BBC subsequently restricted the song to evening airplay. When the band made statements in a ''[[Daily Express]]'' interview confirming the possibility of sexual connotations in the lyrics, the BBC banned "Relax" entirely. The ban only [[Streisand effect|increased interest]] in the single, causing it to become the number-one song in Britain only two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/959284.stm|title='Banned' Frankie tops chart|date=6 October 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 began to play a version of [[The Pogues]]' popular Christmas song "[[Fairytale of New York]]" that censored the words "faggot" and "slut" from one of its verses. The BBC cited concerns over the homophobic slurs as reasoning, despite the song having historically been played without censorship. The BBC reversed the decision after it was criticized by listeners, the band itself, and the mother of the song's featured vocalist [[Kirsty MacColl]]. Radio 1 controller [[Andy Parfitt]] argued that "While we would never condone prejudice of any kind, we know our audiences are smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom. In the context of this song, I do not feel that there is any negative intent behind the use of the words, hence the reversal of the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/18/bbc.radio|title=Radio 1 censors Christmas standard|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=2007-12-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7150693.stm|title=Radio 1 backs down in Pogues row|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the song's [[Sadomasochism|subject matter]] was deemed too inappropriate for airplay pre-watershed, BBC Radio 1 played an edited version of [[Rihanna]]'s song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" during the daytime hours, and referred to the song using the alternate title "Come On". As Rihanna objected to the censorship of the song's title, the BBC later compromised by referring to the song as "S&amp;M (Come On)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657491/rihanna-s-and-m-renamed.jhtml|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Renamed Again By BBC Radio|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2011-08-02|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/music/854875-rihannas-s-m-outrage-exposed-as-pr-stunt|title=BBC Radio 1 ban 'S&amp;M' from daytime radio|date=2011-07-02|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reasons, Ofcom deemed the song's music video to be unfit for broadcast pre-watershed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the 2013 death of former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], "[[Ding-Dong!

BBC Radio 1 did not play the full song during ''[[The Official Chart]]'' programme, and instead played a short snippet accompanied by a ''[[Newsbeat]]'' report about the campaign.

In 1985, the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC), founded by [[Tipper Gore]], published the "Filthy Fifteen"—a list of fifteen songs it deemed to be the most objectionable due to their references to drugs and alcohol, sexual acts, violence, or "[[occult]]" activities.&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/pmrcs-filthy-15-where-are-they-now-20150917|title=PMRC's 'Filthy 15': Where Are They Now?|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group pushed for the adoption of a [[Content rating|ratings system]], and for lyrics to be printed on the back covers of albums so they could be previewed by parents.&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) opposed these proposals; during a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing on the matter in September, musicians such as [[John Denver]] and [[Frank Zappa]] argued that such guidelines would inhibit [[free expression]]. Zappa, in particular, argued that the PMRC's proposal for a method to "assist baffled parents in the determination of the 'suitability' of records listened to by 'very young children'" would reduce American music to "the intellectual level of a [[Saturday morning cartoon]]".&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;

Following the hearings, the RIAA introduced a standard [[Parental Advisory]] label (which took its current form, reading "Parental Advisory — Explicit Content", in 1994 following subsequent hearings), which is designed to be applied to the cover art of songs and albums which may contain objectionable content; the RIAA recommends that it be used on releases containing "strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification." The Parental Advisory label is a voluntary scheme; some retailers—particularly [[Walmart]]—adopted policies to enforce the label program by not stocking music releases which carried it.&lt;ref name="Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory|title=Parental Advisory Label ("PAL") Program|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=July 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701220958/http://riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory|archivedate=July 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR-pal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/10/29/130905176/you-ask-we-answer-parental-advisory---why-when-how|title=You Ask, We Answer: 'Parental Advisory' Labels — The Criteria And The History|last=Cole|first=Tom|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gangsta rap]] generated controversies due to its often-provocative subject matter. "[[Fuck tha Police]]", a song from [[N.W.A.]]'s debut album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', proved to be particularly controversial.

===Iran===
[[File:Googoosh in concert.jpg|thumb]]
Although music has been big element when it comes to the pre-Islamic cultures of Iran it became confined in courts or performed by street artists after Iran spread. Music played a large role in the lives of Islamic people. However, they were eventually told they must do without it. In fact it got to the point where music was entirely eliminated meaning no concerts were allowed of any kind and musical instruments were to be destroyed back in the late 70’s. Iran’s reason for eliminating music was because it was believed to be betraying their country and its youth. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leone|first=Massimo|date=November 2012|title=My schoolmate: protest music in present-day Iran|url=http://ky5ry5jk2j.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=My+Schoolmate%3A+Protest+Music+in+Present-Day+Iran&amp;rft.jtitle=Critical+Discourse+Studies&amp;rft.au=Leone%2C+Massimo&amp;rft.date=2012&amp;rft.issn=1740-5904&amp;rft.eissn=1740-5912&amp;rft.volume=9&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=347&amp;rft.externalDocID=R04953625&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=My schoolmate: protest music in present-day Iran|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmasi|first=Farzaneh|date=Winter 2013|title=Intimating Dissent: Popular Song, Poetry, and Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Iran|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/ethnomusicology.57.1.0057|journal=Intimating Dissent: Popular Song, Poetry, and Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Iran|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrast with the global music industry ==
Although global physical music sales (such as CDs) have been declining in recent years, in [[East Asia]] (particularly [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]), however, physical music sales have been rising consistently.&lt;ref name="ifpi" /&gt;

The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] credits this phenomenon to "[[K-Pop]] fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets".&lt;ref name="ifpi"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1549940/francis-keeling-universal-musics-global-head-of-digital|title= Francis Keeling, Universal Music’s Global Head of Digital Business: Google Streaming Service ‘Is the Biggest Funnel We Can Have’|accessdate= 7 May 2013|publisher=''[[Billboard magazine]]''|quote=According to IFPI, global physical format sales declined from 61% in 2011 to an estimated 58% in 2012. However, in Japan, CD and DVD sales posted strong increases (sales numbers or percentages were not provided). While in South Korea physical sales are expected to rise for the third consecutive year, with IFPI crediting K-Pop fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets, with driving the format's sustained popularity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a music executive from [[Universal Music Group]], CDs are becoming "the new merchandise in Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindvall|first=Helienne|title=How K-Pop &amp; J-Pop Are Saving Physical Music Sales|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|publisher=Digital Music News|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518191654/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|archivedate=18 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Several controversies have arrived based on the way the industry has been treating its artists.

=== Control of artists personal lives ===
It is not uncommon for record labels to prohibit their pop artists from dating for a certain period of time or for as long as they have a contract with the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/3-ways-the-japanese-entertainment-industry-keeps-idol-singers-from-dating|title=3 ways the Japanese entertainment industry keeps idol singers from dating|work=Japan Today|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan managers may attempt to discourage their artists from dating or engaging in behavior that may tarnish their images by keeping a busy schedule and only letting artists know about their schedules a day at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artists who break this contract, as in the case of [[Minami Minegishi]] from [[AKB48]], run the risk of getting dropped from their music group or contract.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35368705|title=The dark side of Asia’s pop music industry|last=Oi|first=Mariko|date=2016|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea has similar rules for musical pop artists. Artists have more freedom to date and get married, however managers have strong control over their personal lives and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Taiwan, artists are also expected to behave in certain ways, as they cannot discuss taboo topics such as politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Mythos''''' is a three-part documentary that consists of a series of lectures given by [[Joseph Campbell]]. Campbell conceived of the original lectures, filmed over the last six years of his life, as a summation of what he had learned about the human mythic impulse, in terms of [[psychology]], [[ethnology]] and [[comparative mythology]]—what he called "the one great story of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&amp;p9999_action=details&amp;p9999_wid=258 ''Mythos''] page on [http://www.jcf.org JCF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformations: A False Step==
After Campbell's death and the posthumous celebrity brought by the airing in 1988 of ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', the filmmakers who had recorded the lectures quickly cobbled together a much-abridged, hastily edited series for [[PBS]] entitled ''Transformations of Myth Through Time''. An even-more-highly redacted version was briefly released under the title ''The World of Joseph Campbell''.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time"&gt;[https://www.jcf.org/works/help/faq/from-transformations-of-myth-through-time-to-mythos/ The Transformations of Myth Through Time] and Mythos: from [http://www.jcf.org JCF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mythos'' Emerges==
Campbell's estate, represented by his widow [[Jean Erdman]] and, eventually, by the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]] (JCF), asked that these versions, which were unlicensed and did not accurately represent Campbell's thoughts, be pulled from the market, and proposed the production of a twenty-hour television series in four parts that followed Campbell's original vision more closely: ''Mythos''.

Volume One of ''Mythos'' was released in 1999. Volume Two was released in 2000. Both parts are narrated by [[Susan Sarandon]].

After these initial releases, the original distributor, Unipix, promptly went bankrupt, and production on the series halted.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time" /&gt;

The JCF re-released the first two volumes in 2007 and 2008 in conjunction with [[Acorn Media]] as part of the ''[[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]]'' series and the third volume was released in 2011. The decision was eventually made that the planned fourth volume, dealing with James Joyce's novels, was to be released in 2013 as a separate product.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time" /&gt; This was motivated by the difficulties to make its contents fit with the overall format of ''Mythos''.

The three volumes of ''Mythos'' were released together as ''Mythos - The Complete Series'' in September 2012.

'''''Nouvelles de la république des lettres''''' (''News from the [[Republic of Letters]]'')&lt;ref&gt;ISSN 1873-0019&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[periodical]] devoted to reviews of current publications, edited and in large part written by [[Pierre Bayle]]. It began publication in 1684, and is the first known [[book review]] journal.

Bayle edited it from  March 1684  through February 1687; it was continued by [[Daniel de Larroque]], [[Jean Barrin]] and [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]] through April 1689. Publication was suspended from then until January 1699 when it was resumed under the editorship of  [[Jacques Bernard (theologian)|Jacques Bernard]]. He continued it through December 1710; it was then suspended until January 1716, when he resumed and continued until the final issue in June 1718.&lt;ref name=BNF1&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/NoticeBib?allerA=7&amp;noPage=6&amp;idNoeud=1.2.1.1.1.1.1&amp;host=catalogue Bibliotheque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WC1&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/nouvelles-de-la-republique-des-lettres-mois-de-mars-1864-maijuin-1718-non-summum-ex-fulgore-sed-ex-fumo-dare-lucem-c/oclc/367386300&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although written in French, it was  published in [[Amsterdam]] to escape French censorship. The initial publisher was [[Henri Desbordes]] from 1684 through 1689 and 1699 through May 1708, and subsequently by [[Pierre Mortier]] from June 1708 through December 1710, and [[David Mortier]] from January 1716 through June 1718.&lt;ref name=BNF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WC1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bost, Hubert.

Amsterdam: APA-Holland University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication was monthly from the beginning through 1710; after that, it was published bi-monthly.&lt;ref name=BNF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WC1 /&gt;

A reproduction was published in Geneva by Slatkine in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb35291969z/PUBLIC Bibliothèque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater also operates a training center with programs in improv comedy, [[sketch comedy]] and stand-up comedy. PHIT's most notable alumnus is stand-up comedian [[Kent Haines]], who was the 2008 winner of the Philly's Phunniest contest at [[Helium Comedy Club]] and has appeared on public radio show [[The Sound of Young America]] and Season 4 of [[Comedy Central]]'s program [[Live at Gotham]]. In addition to Haines, other comedians from Philadelphia who appeared on stage at PHIT have gone on to perform at major comedy venues in cities like New York and Los Angeles, founded their own theatre companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvsaudience.net/blog/2009/09/01/a-new-non-profit-for-comedy-the-philadelphia-joke-initiative/ |title=A New Non-profit for Comedy: The Philadelphia Joke Initiative |date=09-01-2009 |accessdate=2010-02-15 |work=comicvsaudience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in touring productions for [[The Second City]].

== History ==
PHIT was founded as a nonprofit in October 2005 by Greg Maughan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/17590/a-e--stage |title=Improv walks a tight rope |last=Robb |first=J. Cooper |newspaper=The Philadelphia Weekly |date=09-03-2008 |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with assistance from local improvisers Bobbi Block, Matt Holmes and Alexis Simpson. The original purpose of the theater was to offer improv comedy instruction for beginning to advanced students. Over time PHIT expanded its mission to include sketch comedy instruction, and became an important presenter and producer for all varieties of [[alternative comedy]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2008-11-13/news/25255998_1_comedysportz-short-form-improv-live-arts-festival |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923034833/http://articles.philly.com/2008-11-13/news/25255998_1_comedysportz-short-form-improv-live-arts-festival |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-09-23 |title=No Script, no problem |first=Wendy |last=Rosenfield |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers of Philadelphia's local FOX affiliate, [[WTXF-TV]], voted PHIT as the city's Best Comedy Club in their 2009 Hot List competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfoxphilly.cityvoter.com/winners/best-of-the-philly-hot-list/4745/arts-and-entertainment/comedy-club?place=151350 |work=myfoxphilly.com |title=2009 Best Comedy Club - Philly hot list|date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==
PHIT hosts a variety of comedy shows every night of the week:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phitcomedy.com/tickets/|title=GET TICKETS|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; improv, sketch, stand-up, and variety comedy shows, as well as occasional movie screenings. The theater produces weekly performances by ten improv comedy house teams (The Future, Big Baby, Hoffman, 1816, Fjord, Channel 77, Swan Year, Metropolis, PG-13, and Hackett Park), three sketch comedy house teams (The Flat Earth, Dog Mountain, and Goat Rodeo) as well as independent improv and sketch groups. Also on PHIT's regular schedule are several variety comedy shows (People of Interest, Theme Show, Gimmick Show, Videostew+Monologues), a Panel Comedy show (A Few Answers Short), a "found comedy" night (Guilty Pleasures), a sketch open mic called Sketch Up or Shut Up, and an open improv jam. PHIT also hosts Dynamite Series covering a wide variety of comedic disciplines (Dirty Laundry, Study Hall).  PHIT has also presented shows by performing groups from New York's [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]], Magnet Theater, and The Peoples Improv Theater; and individuals including [[Kevin Allison]] of MTV's [[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]], [[Susan Messing]] of Chicago's [[Annoyance Theater]], [[Kevin McDonald]] of [[The Kids in the Hall]], and [[Dave Hill (comedian)|Dave Hill]]. Every first Sunday of the month PHIT hosts an improvised show Story UP! for kids ages 5 and up.

From March 2006 until January 2008, PHIT produced a monthly improv comedy show at Fergie's Pub in Philadelphia's Center City. From January 2007 until December 2013, the theater has hosted regular performances at The Shubin Theatre, in addition to producing additional shows at others venues. In 2009, the theater produced a weekend of shows collectively titled "Philly Invades NYC" at Under Saint Marks' in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvsaudience.net/blog/tag/philly-improv-theater-invades-nyc/ |title=PHIT and C vs. A Invade New York City this week |work=ComicVsAudience.com |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=01-04-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 PHIT opened its permanent home on Second Stage at the Adrienne Theater in Center City Philadelphia at 2030 Sansom Street. In 2016 PHIT expanded to occupy the Mainstage in the Adrienne Theater.

=== Philly Fringe Festival ===
PHIT has participated in the Philadelphia Live Arts and Philly Fringe Festival every year since 2006. In 2008, the theater programmed performances by improv and sketch comedy groups on all 16 days of the festival, anchoring these shows around an original improv-to-script musical comedy titled "The Hoppers Hit the Road". The production garnered considerable attention and positive reviews in mainstream local media, including a review by [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/20080901_Seems_like_every_year__at_least_one_Fringe_musical.html |title=Even wordy script can't keep 2 singing brothers down |first=Howard |last=Shapiro |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |location=Philadelphia |date=09-01-2008 |accessdate=09-03-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009 festival, the theater presented an ambitious schedule of performances - this time in the Fringe Festival's newly created Improv/Comedy category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennsylvania.broadwayworld.com/article/Philly_Improv_Theater_Set_For_16_Days_of_Performances_During_2009_Philly_Fringe_9319_20090919 |title=Philly Improv Theater Set For 16 Days of Performances During 2009 Philly Fringe, 9/3-19 |work=BroadwayWorld.com |date=2009-09-19 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training program ==
Since its inception, the theater has offered a core curriculum of classes teaching basic to advanced improvising techniques. PHIT's curriculum is based heavily on similar programs at Chicago's [[Second City Training Center]] and [[IO Theater|iO]] (formerly ImprovOlympic), and New York's [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]]. In February 2009, PHIT introduced a similar core curriculum in [[sketch comedy]] writing. PHIT uses local performers as instructors for its improv core curriculum, and a mix of local and nationally recognized teachers (including Kevin Allison of [[MTV]]'s [[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]] and former [[Saturday Night Live]] writer Ali Farahnakian)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennsylvania.broadwayworld.com/article/Philly_Improv_Theater_Continues_With_New_Shows_and_New_Clases_Throughout_October_20090911 |title=Philly Improv Theater Continues With New Shows and New Clases Throughout October |date=09-11-2009 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its sketch comedy program. In 2015 PHIT launched its Kids &amp; Teens program offering classes to kids in grades K-12.

'''Simone Deveaux''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[TV series]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. She is portrayed by [[Tawny Cypress]].

==Character's background==

===Genesis===
When Simone Deveaux is introduced in the [[Genesis (Heroes episode)|premiere episode]], she is an art dealer living in [[New York City]] who is romantically involved with artist [[Isaac Mendez]]. However, she becomes increasingly distressed with Isaac's [[heroin]] addiction and his claims that he can paint the future.

In the episode "[[One Giant Leap]]", Simone takes down a painting of [[Claire Bennet|Claire]] and [[List of characters in Heroes#Zach|Zach]] and tells Isaac that she is selling the paintings so that he can go to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. When Isaac refuses, she leaves him. Later that day, [[Peter Petrelli]], who until recently had been a [[nurse|hospice nurse]] caring for [[List of characters in Heroes#Charles Deveaux|Simone's father]], confesses his love for her. Although the two spend the night together, Simone doesn't want to rush into a new relationship.

Several days later, Simone tells Peter that her father has died. When Peter inquires about the painting by Isaac which she sold recently, Simone tells him [[List of Heroes characters#Daniel Linderman|Mr. Linderman]] bought it.

After Peter's brother [[Nathan Petrelli|Nathan]] retrieves the painting, he and Simone view it together. Nathan destroys the painting, which angers Simone. However, she is able to show Peter a digital replica and the image depicted seems to be a dead man resembling Peter. Nevertheless, Peter decides to go to the Union Wells high school [[homecoming (Heroes)|homecoming]] shown in the picture. Simone is gradually starting to believe that Isaac can paint the future, and hopes Peter will come back alive.

In the episode "[[Fallout (Heroes episode)|Fallout]]", Peter has a vision in which he sees all of the series' [[Characters of Heroes#Main characters|main characters]] in New York, seemingly running away from him. Among them is Simone, who runs towards him, only to be stopped by Isaac and dragged away.

Two weeks later, in "[[Godsend (Heroes)|Godsend]]", Simone visits Peter, who has been [[coma]]tose for the whole time, in the hospital. She later returns with Nathan to Isaac's loft, where she is greeted by a reformed Isaac. He states that he was in a clinic and can now paint without using heroin, and tells Simone he still loves her. Suddenly, Isaac's new friends [[Hiro Nakamura]] and [[Characters of Heroes#Ando Masahashi|Ando Masahashi]] arrive. After introductions, Hiro mentions that the Linderman Group has a sword he wants. Simone states that Linderman is an avid [[art collector]], and recommends Hiro take a painting with him to see Linderman in Las Vegas.

During the events of "[[Distractions (Heroes)|Distractions]]", Simone goes to Isaac for help in locating Peter Petrelli. After the two talk, Isaac tells her to keep the key to his apartment. Later, in the same episode, Simone meets with Isaac on the roof of her departed father's building and they discuss the future before going to dinner together.

In the episode "[[Unexpected (Heroes)|Unexpected]]", Simone visits Isaac, but the painter tells her that he thinks Peter might have left New York (though he is in fact aware that he is still somewhere in the city). She doesn't believe him, and thinks that he is trying to drive a wedge into her and Peter's relationship out of jealousy. Isaac reasons that he is trying to protect her from Peter, for he is too dangerous. Simone then attempts to give Isaac his key back, but again he refuses, and says that he will do anything for her. Simone only wants for him to find Peter.

Later, Simone confronts Nathan, telling him to reveal Peter's condition as well as the powers of others, in order to get help. However, Nathan refuses, afraid of being considered a freak and taken in for testing and probably lose the elections. Seeing Nathan is not going to budge, Simone leaves, remarking that she's "voting for the other guy". Nathan warns her not to say anything, but she doesn't respond.

Simone returns to the apartment again, but she is accidentally shot in the chest by Isaac, who had been trying to shoot down the invisible Peter. Peter then reappears and she collapses in his arms. As she dies, her hand opens up to reveal Isaac's key.

In "[[Parasite (Heroes)|Parasite]]", [[Candice Wilmer]] uses her illusion ability to transform into Simone and taunt Isaac.

In the first season's finale, "[[How to Stop an Exploding Man]]", Simone returns in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] role. After Peter blacks out in an empty street, he has a dream of the past, awakening on the Deveaux building's rooftop. Peter witnesses a past conversation he had with Simone, and another between Charles Deveaux and his mother. It is revealed that not only do Mrs. Petrelli and Mr. Deveaux know about the main characters' powers, but also about the bomb.

===Brave New World===
In the graphic novel ''[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 4|From the Files of Primatech: 1991]]'', [[List of characters in Heroes#Dr. Jonas Zimmerman|Dr. Jonas Zimmerman]] brings Simone along with Barbara (Niki and Tracy's triplet) to his father Charles at the Primatech headquarters. Simone then leaves with Charles and Barbara.

==Production==

Isaac's love interest was originally written as a [[bohemian]] white woman named Stella. However, after [[Ali Larter]], not Cypress, was awarded the role of [[Niki Sanders]], ''Heroes'' creator [[Tim Kring]] offered the role of Stella to her. The character was changed from a bohemian to an art dealer, and the name was changed to Simone Deveaux.&lt;ref name=BlackVoices&gt;{{cite web |last = Gibbs |first = Kevin, Jr. |title = '5 Questions' With Tawny Cypress |work= Black Voices| publisher = [[America Online|AOL]] |date = 2006-12-07 |url = http://blackvoices.aol.com/black_entertainment/television_features_reviews_clips/qacanvas/_a/5-questions-with-tawny-cypress/20061201152509990001 | accessdate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers had discussed several storyline possibilities for Simone such as pregnancy and becoming another "Horn Rimmed Glasses" ([[Mr. Bennet (Heroes)|Noah Bennet]]).&lt;ref name= USAToday&gt;{{cite web|last = Keck |first = William |title = Simone goes out with a bang |work = [[USA Today]]|date = 2007-02-20|url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-02-19-heroes-cypress_x.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cypress believed Simone to be "the [[Lois Lane]] of the Heroes world."&lt;ref name=CraveOnline&gt;{{cite web | last = Topel | first = Fred | title = Tawny Cypress &amp; Santiago Cabrera | publisher = Crave Online | date = 2007-02-13 | url = http://www.craveonline.com/comics/articles/04647467/tawny_cypress__santiago_cabrera.html | accessdate = 2007-02-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070219005916/http://www.craveonline.com/comics/articles/04647467/tawny_cypress__santiago_cabrera.html | archivedate = 2007-02-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, however, the creative staff could not decide what direction to take Simone. ''Heroes'' creator Tim Kring informed her of Simone's fate in December 2006.&lt;ref name= USAToday /&gt;

'''''Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul''''' ([[French language|French]] for "'''Sun in the sky of Saint-Paul'''") is a [[painting]] in oil on canvas, 73 × 115.5&amp;nbsp;cm, created in 1983 by Russian-French artist [[Marc Chagall]]. It is held in a private collection.

==The painting==

The painting depicts the recognisable view of [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]], one of the oldest medieval towns on the French Riviera, dominated by the church at its top. The work is particularly rich in color and has a very balanced composition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/welt_print/article1026325/Millionenpreise-fuer-Chagalls-Spaetwerk-bei-Kornfeld-in-Bern.html ''MIllionenpreise für Chagalls Spätwerk bei Kornfeld in Bern''] Die Welt July 14th 2007. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The blue sky above the town contains a large, bright yellow sun as well as various other elements from the artist’s iconography – animals, musicians and the flying couple. By juxtaposing this imagery, Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul combines Chagall’s love of his Mediterranean home with his characteristic dream-like pictorial vision. With its free-flowing style and bright, translucent colours, the work exemplifies the effect that the south of France had on Chagall’s art.&lt;ref name=Sothebys&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/impressionist-modern-art-evening-sale-l14002/lot.81.html Impressionist, Modern &amp; Surrealist Art Evening Sale] Sotheby's London. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘The Southern French landscape has astonished Chagall with its wealth of colours and its lyrical atmosphere, had captivated him with the beauty of its flowers and foliage. These impressions found their way into his paintings of that period, refined their peinture and lent them a hitherto unknown radiance’.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Erben. "Marc Chagall". London, 1957, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its fantastical, dream-like composition, the painting becomes an expression of the artist’s internal feelings and souvenirs rather than an objective projection of the outside world and of the familiar landscape. As such, Chagall’s paintings defy symbolic meaning and categorisation. In particular, his dreamscapes resist interpretation despite the ubiquity of repeated pictorial symbols; through repetition they become both familiar and meaningless, manifestations of a rich and colourful imagination that can be understood not through intellect but through intuition.&lt;ref name="Sothebys"/&gt; As the artist himself proclaimed: ‘For me a picture is a surface covered with representations of things (objects, animals, human beings) in a certain order in which logic and illustration have no importance. The visual effect of the composition is what is paramount’.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Compton. "Chagall (exhibition catalogue)". Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1985, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soraya is a versatile artist working in watercolours, oils, pastels, acrylics and mixed media in a variety of subject matters such as musicians, café scenes and African market scenes amongst others. Many of her subjects are travel based and people in everyday life situations feature a great deal in her work, light and colour are the two important elements in her paintings together with semi abstract passages and a sense of ambiguity where she allows the viewer to make up the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sorayafrench.com|title = Homepage|last =|first =|website = Soraya French|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Squallis Puppeteers''' are a [[Louisville, Kentucky]] based [[puppetry]] troupe.  The troupe was founded by Jess Myers, Nora and Carrie Christenson in 1997.  Their performances include a yearly Fool's Day Bash, held on [[April Fools' Day]].  They became a non-profit organization in 2003.  Squallis uses donations, grants, and everyday materials to form together huge, creative, 7-feet-tall extravagant puppets as well as puppet shows.

On the first Saturday of every month Squallis opens its doors to the public, where they offer a family-friendly environment, puppet performance, and a kids puppet making workshop.  These shows help teach kids life lessons, while also providing a sense of creativity and imagination to their lives.

{{ about|the Wisconsin mansion|the 1965 song|Summer Wind}}

'''Summerwind''', formerly known as '''Lamont Mansion''', is a ruined [[mansion]] on the shores of West Bay Lake in [[Vilas County, Wisconsin|Vilas County]], [[Wisconsin]]. Located on private land, its ruins are closed to the public. A number of [[urban legends]] and [[ghost story|ghost stories]] in [[popular culture]] have contributed to its reputation as a [[haunted house]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Beth|last2=Norman|first2=Michael|title=Ghosts had a favorite haunt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19851021&amp;id=Y24aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7137,598546|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Excerpts from "Haunted Heartland"|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|date=October 21, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends ==
According to popular accounts, Summerwind was built in the early 20th century as a fishing lodge on the edge of West Bay Lake in [[Vilas County, Wisconsin|Vilas County]], in northeastern [[Wisconsin]], and in 1916, purchased by [[Robert P. Lamont|Robert Patterson Lamont]]. According to some stories circulated, Lamont employed Chicago architects for the remodeling. Some versions of the story name the architects as [[Thomas Tallmadge|Tallmadge and Watson]]. Supposedly the renovations took two years to complete.&lt;ref name="QCT2"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|title=Summerwind: More ghostly than ever |first=Bill|last=Wundram|date=October 29, 1995|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/summerwind-more-ghostly-than-ever/article_15955edb-9e1e-5fa2-9e9d-4d07361011df.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/corey-schjoth/haunted-travel-wisconsins_b_5021201.html|title=Haunted Travel: Wisconsin's Most Notorious Haunted House |first=Corey|last=Schjoth|date=March 25, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends include claims that Lamont fired a pistol at a [[ghost]] one night and was so frightened that he and his family abandoned the house. Other legends include claims that subsequent owners Arnold and Ginger Hinshaw were so disturbed by hauntings that Arnold suffered a "nervous breakdown" and Ginger attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QCT1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/haunted-house-keeps-visitors-wondering/article_0434804e-eccb-51b1-8a18-cc3b71d20b7b.html|title=Haunted house keeps visitors wondering|first=Bill|last=Wundram|date=October 28, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCT"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Wisconsin Trails]]'' / ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''|url=http://www.wisconsintrails.com/travel/Wisconsins-10-most-haunted-places-228389291.html|title=Travel – Wisconsin's 10 most haunted places|first=Chad|last=Lewis|date=2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SW1&gt;{{cite book  | last =Godfrey | first =Linda S. | title =Strange Wisconsin: More Badger State Weirdness| publisher =Big Earth Publishing | year =2007 | page = 59 | isbn =978-1-931599-85-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRBPbFHCoV4C&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raymond Bober ==
Although most Land O' Lakes natives refer to the property as Lamont's mansion, supernatural tales first disseminated by Ginger Hinshaw's father Raymond Bober claim the mansion was haunted and refer to it as "Summerwind".&lt;ref name="Lightning" /&gt; Some versions of the story claim that Bober purchased the property only to abandon it because the mansion's rooms had the supernatural power to change shape and dimensions at will. In 1979, Bober (writing under the [[pen name]] "Wolfgang Von Bober"), authored a book called ''The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience'' in which he claimed the mansion was haunted by 18th century explorer [[Jonathan Carver]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=boberbook&gt;{{cite book |last=Von Bober |first=Wolffgang |title=''The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience'' |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=1979 |isbn=0-8117-0329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bober's narrative, the property was often unoccupied due to alleged [[supernatural]] activity and the Hinshaws could not get workers to enter the home to do remodeling work.&lt;ref name=101wismist&gt;{{cite book |last=Balousek |first=Marv |title=101 Wisconsin Unsolved Mysteries |publisher=Badger Books |date=2000-11-15 |isbn=1-878569-70-8|page= 17-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However according to one of Bober's neighbors, Bober did not live in the mansion, never spent the night in it and instead lived in a trailer on the property. At least two previous residents reportedly denied claims that the house was haunted and locals claimed the haunting stories did not begin until Bober's book was published.&lt;ref name="Razed" /&gt; A 1980 Life magazine photo essay including Summerwind among "Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses" apparently spread the supernatural tales originated in Bober's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses |first= Henry (Photographer) |last= Groskinsky |journal= Life Magazine |date= November 1980 |page= 152}} [http://theweirdusmessageboard.yuku.com/topic/2474/Life-Magazine-Haunted-House-Article-November-1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author Marv Balousek, locals never believed the home was haunted and were dismayed when the home became somewhat of a supernatural [[tourist attraction]].&lt;ref name=101wismist /&gt;

== Fire ==
In 1985, officials for the Town of [[Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin|Land O' Lakes]] made an attempt to demolish the vacant home. The Vilas County Sheriff said it was a staging area for local teens who burglarized or vandalized nearby cottages.&lt;ref name="Razed" /&gt; This attempt failed, but the abandoned mansion was later destroyed by fire following a lightning strike on June 19, 1988. Later that week, fire officials reported that the fire was not suspicious and arson was not suspected since neighbors reported being awakened when lightning struck the vacant home. However, fire officials also said that teenagers frequently used the location for parties and that they may have left a fire burning.&lt;ref name="Lightning" /&gt;

== Potential restoration ==
In 2014, owners Harold and Babs Tracy and the Fox Valley Ghost Hunters sought funding to rebuild the mansion as a [[bed and breakfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/ghost-fans-hope-to-rebuild-mansion--haunting-and-all-b99381544z1-281025652.html |title= Ghost fans hope to rebuild mansion — haunting and all |first= Jim |last= Stingl |newspaper= Milwaukee Journal |location= [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin |date= 30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.vilascountynewsreview.com/lifestyle/group-looking-rebuild-summerwind-sets-benefit |title= Group looking to rebuild Summerwind sets benefit |newspaper= Vilas County News-Review |date= 30 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wjfw.com/stories.html?sku=20141028184624&amp;display=video |title= Paranormal group speaking on historic Summerwind mansion |first= Hayley |last= Tenpas |website= WJFW TV-12 |location= [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin]] |date= 28 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Summerwind was featured on a [[Discovery Channel]] episode of ''[[A Haunting]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Haunting of Summerwind|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/a-haunting/the-haunting-of-summerwind-869201/|website=A Haunting Season 1 Episode 2|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5429">'''Swedish realism''' is the period in [[Swedish literature]] that encompassed the last two decades of the 19th century. It is generally considered to have ended in the 1910s but the exact year is a matter of debate.

==August Strindberg==

[[Image:Portrait of August Strindberg by Richard Bergh 1905.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Strindberg, painted by Richard Bergh, 1906]]
[[August Strindberg]] (1849-1912) was a writer world-famous for his dramas and prose, noted for his exceptional talent and complex intellect.&lt;ref name=StrindbergA&gt;Algulin pp.115-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrindbergG&gt;Gustafson, pp.238-257&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 he published ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]]'' (''Röda Rummet''), which brought him immediate fame. ''The Red Room'' was a satirical novel that relentlessly attacked the political, the academic, the philosophical and the religious worlds.&lt;ref name=StrindbergA&gt;Algulin pp.115-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrindbergG&gt;Gustafson, pp.238-257&lt;/ref&gt;

After several harsh disputes, Strindberg left Sweden in 1883. In 1884, he briefly returned to Stockholm to stand trial in a [[blasphemy]] case against his collection of short stories ''[[Married (Strindberg)|Married]]'' (''Giftas''). He was acquitted, but the trial sparked a psychological turmoil that lasted for some 10 years, during which he wrote some of his internationally best known works: the self-examinatory ''Tjänstekvinnans son'' (1886–87), ''En dåres försvarstal'' (1887-87); and also plays ''Fadren'',  ''[[Fröken Julie]]'' and ''Mäster Olof'' (1886–88).&lt;ref name=StrindbergA&gt;Algulin pp.115-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrindbergG&gt;Gustafson, pp.238-257&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 Strindberg engaged himself in [[occultism]], in particular [[alchemy]], leading to a mental breakdown known as his Inferno-crisis. The following year (1897), Strindberg moved back to Sweden and settled in the city [[Lund]]. There, he resurrected his literary production by publishing ''[[Inferno (Strindberg)|Inferno]]''.&lt;ref name=StrindbergA&gt;Algulin pp.115-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrindbergG&gt;Gustafson, pp.238-257&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Strindberg moved back to Stockholm. He continued writing but also engaged himself energetically in debates in a wide range of subjects. His most notable writings during this period were his dramas, such as ''[[The Dance of Death (Strindberg)|The Dance of Death]]'' (1900) and ''[[A Dream Play]]'' (1901).&lt;ref name=StrindbergA&gt;Algulin pp.115-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrindbergG&gt;Gustafson, pp.238-257&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 90s poets ==

The Swedish 1890s is noted for its poetic [[neo-romanticism]], a reaction to the socio-realistic literature of the 1880s. The first literary key figure to emerge was [[Verner von Heidenstam]] (1859-1940), and his literary debut in 1887 with the collection of poetry ''Vallfart och vandringsår'' (Pilgrimage and Wander-Years).&lt;ref&gt;Algulin, pp.137-140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustafson, vol2, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Adventures of Nils.jpg|right|thumb|100px|''Adventures of Nils'', English translation, 1992]] --&gt;
[[Selma Lagerlöf]] (1858-1940) was the arguably brightest star of the 1890s, and her impression has lasted up to modern times. She wrote several highly regarded works which are still among the toplists on Swedish libraries, such as ''[[Gösta Berlings saga]]'' (1891), an [[Epic poetry|epic]] tale of the unmoral Gösta Berling who gets haunted by the Devil, and ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]'' (1906-1907), a geographical adventure of Nils who travels Sweden on the back of a goose. Lagerlöf was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1909 for the imagination and spiritual perception that characterized her writings.&lt;ref name=LagerlofNobel&gt;''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1909/index.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1909]'', The Official Web Site of the Nobel Foundation, October 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aluglin, pp.158-160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustaf Fröding]] (1860-1911) was another key figure of the 1890s. His active literary period only spanned between 1891&amp;ndash;1898, because of mental problems. Fröding was above all renowned for his flowing poetry. His popularity was at first based on his  bubbling sense of humor and free treatment of the poetic verse; but later readers also found in it a profound [[humanism]] and imaginative depth.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafson, pp.296-303&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik Axel Karlfeldt]] (1864-1931) was, like Fröding, a depictor of rural life in his native province (in Karlfeldt's case, [[Dalarna]]). His poetry had the intention of sparking a cultural identity within Dalarna, and spoke warmly of traditions, family values, and so on. Although his poetry was narrow, Karlfeldt was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1931 ([[posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly), possibly as a result of internal politics within the [[Swedish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustafson, pp.303-311&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Glass Bead Game''''' ({{lang-de|link=no|'''Das Glasperlenspiel'''}}) is the last full-length novel of the German author [[Hermann Hesse]]. It was begun in 1931 and published in [[Switzerland]] in 1943 after being rejected for publication in Germany due to Hesse's anti-Fascist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm |title=Hermann Hesse |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm |archivedate=4 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in 1946, Hesse went on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. In honoring him in its Award Ceremony Speech, the [[Swedish Academy]] said that the novel "occupies a special position" in Hesse's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1946/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1946 – Hermann Hesse: Award Ceremony Speech|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Glass Bead Game" is a literal translation of the German title, but the book has also been published under the title '''''Magister Ludi''''', [[Latin]] for "Master of the Game", which is an honorific title awarded to the book's central character. "Magister Ludi" can also be seen as a [[pun]]: ''lud-'' is a Latin stem meaning both "game" and "school". However, the title Magister Ludi is misleading, as it implies the book is a straightforward [[bildungsroman]]. In reality, the book touches on many different genres, and the bulk of the story is on one level a parody of the biography genre.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Ziolkowski, Foreword to The Glass Bead Game, p. xix. Picador. {{ISBN|0-312-27849-7}}.   Ziolkowski cites [[Thomas Mann]]'s recognition of the source of the book's humor as "the parody of biography and the grave scholarly attitude."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Glass Bead Game'' takes place at an unspecified date centuries into the future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book's narrator writing around the start of the 25th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. xii. Owl Books. {{ISBN|0-8050-1246-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called [[Castalia]], which was reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia is home to an austere order of [[intellectual]]s with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to cultivate and play the Glass Bead Game, whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school within Castalia known as Waldzell. The rules of the game are only alluded to—they are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine. Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music, mathematics, and cultural history. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics.

The novel is an example of a [[bildungsroman]], following the life of a distinguished member of the Castalian Order, Joseph Knecht, whose surname means "servant" (and is [[cognate]] with the English word ''knight''). The plot chronicles Knecht's education as a youth, his decision to join the order, his mastery of the Game, and his advancement in the order's hierarchy to eventually become ''Magister Ludi'', the executive officer of the Castalian Order's game administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hesse | first = Hermann | authorlink = Hermann Hesse | title = The Glass Bead Game | publisher = Owl Books |year=1943 | pages = 352–354 | isbn = 0-8050-1246-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
The beginning of the novel introduces the Music Master, the resident of Castalia who recruits Knecht as a young student and who is to have the most long-lasting and profound effect on Knecht throughout his life. At one point, as the Music Master nears death in his home at Monteport, Knecht obliquely refers to the Master's "sainthood". As a student, another meaningful friendship develops with Plinio Designori, a student from a politically influential family, who is studying in Castalia as a guest. Knecht develops many of his personal views about what larger good Castalia can achieve through vigorous debates with Designori, who views Castalia as an "[[ivory tower]]" with little to no impact on the outside world.

Although educated within Castalia, Knecht's path to "Magister Ludi" is atypical for the order, as he spends a significant portion of his time after graduation outside the boundaries of the province. His first such venture, to the Bamboo Grove, results in his learning Chinese and becoming something of a disciple to Elder Brother, a recluse who had given up living within Castalia. Next, as part of an assignment to foster goodwill between the order and the [[Catholic Church]], Knecht is sent on several "missions" to the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] monastery of Mariafels, where he befriends the historian Father Jacobus – a relationship which also has profound personal impact for Knecht.

As the novel progresses, Knecht begins to question his loyalty to the order, gradually coming to doubt that the intellectually gifted have a right to withdraw from life's big problems. Knecht, too, comes to see Castalia as a kind of ivory tower, an ethereal and protected community, devoted to pure intellectual pursuits but oblivious to the problems posed by life outside its borders. This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis, and, according to his personal views regarding spiritual awakening, Knecht does the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order, ostensibly to become of value and service to the larger culture. The heads of the order deny his request to leave, but Knecht departs Castalia anyway, initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend Designori's energetic and strong-willed son, Tito. Only a few days later, the story ends abruptly with Knecht drowning in a mountain lake while attempting to follow Tito on a swim for which Knecht was unfit.

The fictional narrator leaves off before the final sections of the book, remarking that the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography. The concluding chapter, entitled "The Legend", is reportedly from a different biography. After this final chapter, several of Knecht's "posthumous" works are then presented. The first section contains Knecht's poetry from various periods of his life, followed by three short stories labeled "Three Lives". The stories are presented as exercises by Knecht imagining his life had he been born in another time and place. The first story tells of a [[pagan]] [[Rain dance|rainmaker]] named Knecht who lived "many thousands of years ago, when [[Matriarchy|women ruled]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Hesse. ''The Glass Bead Game''. Penguin. Hammondsworth 1975 p 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the [[shaman]]'s powers to summon rain fail, and he offers himself as a sacrifice for the good of the tribe. The second story is based on the life of [[Hilarion|St Hilarion]] and tells of Josephus, an early Christian hermit who acquires a reputation for piety but is inwardly troubled by self-loathing and seeks a confessor, only to find that same penitent had been seeking him.

The final story concerns the life of Dasa, a prince wrongfully usurped by his half brother as heir to a kingdom and disguised as a [[Cowman (profession)|cowherd]] to save his life. While working with the herdsmen as a young boy, Dasa encounters a [[yogi]] in [[meditation]] in the forest. He wishes to experience the same tranquility as the yogi, but is unable to stay. He later leaves the herdsmen and marries a beautiful young woman, only to be [[cuckolded]] by his half brother (now the Rajah). In a cold fury, he kills his half brother and finds himself once again in the forest with the old yogi, who, through an experience of an alternate life, guides him on the spiritual path and out of the world of illusion ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]).

The three lives, together with that as Magister Ludi, oscillate between extroversion (rainmaker, Indian life – both get married) and introversion (father confessor, Magister Ludi) while developing the four basic psychic functions of [[analytical psychology]]: sensation (rainmaker), intuition (Indian life), feeling (father confessor), and thinking (Magister Ludi).

===Earlier plans===
Originally, Hesse intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. xiv-xv. [[Picador]]. {{ISBN|0-312-27849-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter stories, "authored" by Knecht in ''The Glass Bead Game'', at the end of the novel.

Two drafts of a fourth life were published in 1965, the second version being recast in the first person and breaking off earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Prosa aus dem Nachlass'' (Suhrkamp 1965), translated by [[Ralph Manheim]] in ''Tales of Student Life'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dated 1934, they describe Knecht's childhood and education as a Swabian theologian. This Knecht has been born some dozen years after the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] in the time of [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg|Eberhard Ludwig]], and in depicting the other characters Hesse draws heavily on actual biographies: [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], [[Johann Friedrich Rock]], [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf]] make up the cast of [[Pietism|Pietist]] mentors. Knecht is heavily drawn to music however, both that of the acknowledged master [[Pachelbel]] and the more exotic [[Dieterich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]]. The fragment breaks off as the young contemporary of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] happens upon an organ recital in Stuttgart.

===Central characters===
* Joseph Knecht: The story's main character. He is the Magister Ludi for a majority of the book.
* The Music Master: Knecht's spiritual mentor who, when Knecht is a child, examines him for entrance into the elite schools of Castalia.
* Plinio Designori: Knecht's foil in the world outside.
* Father Jacobus: Benedictine monk and Joseph Knecht's antithesis in faith.
* Elder Brother: A former Castalian and student of various Chinese scripts &amp; ideologies.
* Thomas van der Trave: Joseph Knecht's predecessor as Magister Ludi.
* Fritz Tegularius: A friend of Knecht's but a portent of what Castalians might become if they remain insular.

==The game==
The Glass Bead Game is "a kind of synthesis of human learning"&lt;ref name="Time1949"&gt;

==Allusions==
Many characters in the novel have names that are allusive word games.&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt; For example, Knecht's predecessor as Magister Ludi was Thomas van der Trave, a veiled reference to [[Thomas Mann]], who was born in [[Lübeck]], situated on the Trave River. Knecht's brilliant but unstable friend Fritz Tegularius is based on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], while Father Jacobus is based on the historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]].&lt;ref name="names"&gt;[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. ix. Owl Books. {{ISBN|0-8050-1246-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Carlo Ferromonte is an italianized version of the name of Hesse's nephew, Karl Isenberg, while the name of the Glass Bead Game's inventor, Bastian Perrot of [[Calw]], was taken from Heinrich Perrot, who owned a machine shop where Hesse once worked after dropping out of school.&lt;ref name="names" /&gt; The name of the pedagogic province in the story is taken from Greek legend of the nymph [[Castalia]], who was transformed into an inspiration-granting fountain by the god Apollo.

==As utopian literature==
Freedman wrote in his biography of Hesse that the tensions caused by the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Germany]] directly contributed to the creation of the ''Glass Bead Game'' as a response to the oppressive times.&lt;ref name="Ralph Freedman 1979. p 348"&gt;Ralph Freedman. Hermann Hesse. Pilgrim of Crisis. Jonathan Cape. London. 1979. p 348.&lt;/ref&gt; "The educational province of Castalia, which provided a setting for the novel, came to resemble Hesse's childhood [[Swabia]] physically while assuming more and more the function of his adopted home, neutral [[Switzerland]], which in turn embodied his own antidote to the crises of his time. It became the "island of love" or at least an island of the spirit."&lt;ref name="Ralph Freedman 1979. p 348"/&gt; Freedman opined that in the Glass Bead Game "contemplation, the secrets of the Chinese [[I Ching]] and Western mathematics and music fashioned the perennial conflicts of his life into a unifying design."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Freedman. Hermann Hesse. Pilgrim of Crisis. Jonathan Cape. London. 1979. p 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 2010, ''The Glass Bead Game'' was dramatised by [[Lavinia Greenlaw]] for [[BBC Radio 4]].  It starred [[Derek Jacobi]] as the Biographer, [[Tom Ferguson (actor)|Tom Ferguson]] as Knecht and David Seddon as Plinio.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4 listing, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t100y bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Return of the Condor Heroes''''', also called '''''The Giant Eagle and Its Companion''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamm|first=John Christopher|year=2005|title=Paper Swordsmen: Jin Yong and the Modern Chinese Martial Arts Novel|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824828950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Rojas, Carlos|editor2=Chow, Eileen|title=Rethinking Chinese Popular Culture: Cannibalizations of the Canon|series=Routledge Contemporary China Series|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9781134032235}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[wuxia]] novel by [[Jin Yong]] (Louis Cha). It is the second part of the ''[[Condor Trilogy]]'' and was preceded by ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' and followed by ''[[The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber]]''. It was first serialised between 20 May 1959 and 5 July 1961 in the Hong Kong newspaper ''[[Ming Pao]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The date conforms to the data published in Chen Zhenhui (陳鎮輝), ''Wuxia Xiaoshuo Xiaoyao Tan'' (武俠小說逍遙談), 2000, Huizhi Publishing Company (匯智出版有限公司), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story revolves around the protagonist, [[Yang Guo]], and his lover and martial arts master, [[Xiaolongnü]], in their adventures in the ''[[jianghu]]'' (also called the ''wulin'', the community of martial artists), where love between master and apprentice is seen as taboo. Jin Yong revised the novel in 1970 and again in 2004. There are 40 chapters in the second and third revisions. Each chapter has a title composed of four Chinese characters. Most of the revisions are either clarifications or minor alterations of character motivations or names. The Chinese title of the novel translates to ''The Divine Eagle and the Heroic Couple''.

==Plot==
The protagonist, [[Yang Guo]], is the orphaned son of [[Yang Kang]], one of the antagonists in ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'', who is also the sworn brother of Guo Jing. The couple [[Guo Jing]] and [[Huang Rong]] take care of Yang Guo for a short period of time before sending him to the [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Sect]] on [[Mount Zhongnan]] for better guidance in moral values and orthodox martial arts. In Quanzhen, Yang Guo is often picked on and bullied by his fellow students, and discriminated against by his master, Zhao Zhijing. Yang Guo flees from Quanzhen and ventures unknowingly into the nearby Tomb of the Living Dead, where the [[Ancient Tomb Sect]] is based. There, he meets [[Xiaolongnü]], a mysterious maiden of unknown origin, and becomes her apprentice. They live together in the tomb for many years until Yang Guo grows up.

Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü develop romantic feelings for each other, but their romance is forbidden by the prevailing norms of the ''jianghu'' (or ''wulin'', the community of martial artists). Throughout the story, their love meets with several tests, such as the misunderstandings that threaten to tear them apart, and their encounter with Gongsun Zhi, whom Xiaolongnü almost marries at one point. Finally, after their reunion and marriage, Xiaolongnü leaves Yang Guo again, owing to her belief she cannot recover from a fatal poison and promises to meet him again 16 years later, to prevent him from committing suicide. While Yang Guo is wandering the ''jianghu'' alone, he meets several formidable martial artists and a giant eagle, and improves his skills tremendously after learning from them. His adventures gradually mold him into a courageous hero and perhaps the most powerful martial artist of his time. Yang Guo serves his native land by helping the [[Han Chinese]] people of the [[Song dynasty|Song Empire]] resist invaders from the [[Mongol Empire]]. At the end of the novel, he is reunited with Xiaolongnü and they leave to lead the rest of their lives in seclusion after receiving praises and blessings from the ''wulin''.

The '''Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll''' as they became known, or the polls on determining the bankability of movie stars began quite early in the movie history. At first, they were popular polls and contests conducted in film magazines, where the readers would vote for their favorite stars, like the poll published in [[New York Morning Telegraph]] on 17 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Biography_Files/03_m_n.htm | author = Q. David Bowers | title = Volume 3: Biographies - SNOW, Marguerite (actress 1910-1915) | date = 1995 | publisher = www.thanhouser.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines appeared and disappeared often and among the most consistent in those early days were to polls in the [[Motion Picture Magazine]].

Though this and numerous other magazines, like [[Photoplay]], continued with this type of polls, the standards for the polling were set by the [[Quigley Publishing Company]]. They published a poll, which became known as the "Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll", from a questionnaire given to movie exhibitors every year between 1915&lt;ref name=herald1940&gt;{{cite news | author = William R. Weaver | title = The money-making stars of a quarter of a century: the box office favorites from 1915 to 1939 as recorded in the files of the Herald - Annual polls and canvasses record early money-makers | newspaper = [[Motion Picture Herald]] | pages = 123-124 | date = 28 September 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013 by [[Quigley Publishing Company]].

The list was based on a poll of [[Film exhibitor|movie theater owners]], who were asked to name who they felt were the previous year's top 10 moneymaking stars. The Top 10 Poll, which appeared annually in Quigley's ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'' and ''[[International Television &amp; Video Almanac|The Motion Picture Almanac]]'', was long regarded as one of the most reliable barometers of a movie star's box-office power, as film exhibitors base their decisions on one economic criterion: those stars who will bring patrons into their theaters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1203 Grave Marker Tumba (3).jpg|thumbnail|Tumba, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]

The [[Kongo people|Kongo]] place stone figures called '''tumba''' (a [[Kongo language|Ki-Kongo]] word, pl. bitumba) on the graves of powerful people. Bitumba were created in [[Zaire]] and [[Angola]] during the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth. The term tumba comes from the old [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for “tomb”— this genre may have been inspired by grave monuments for European merchants and missionaries in [[Kongo Kingdom|Kongo]] cemeteries.

==Materials and Dimensions==
Bituma were executed in soft stone. Their average height it close to 50 centimeters; the smallest bituma measure between 15 and 20 centimeters and the largest are approximately a meter in height.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Artist Robert Verly gathered a large number of statues in the north of Angola near the Zaire border and, in the May 1955 issue of Zaire, he classified the objects by type and proposed an explanation for their use.&lt;ref name="Verly 1955"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verly|first=Robert|title=La Statuaire de pierre du Bas-Congo (Bamboma-Musurongo)|journal=Zaire|year=1955|volume=5|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1978, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du [[Zaire]] at the Center for International Commerce of Zaire in [[Kinshasa]] mounted an exhibition of 72 bitumba called "Sculptures Stones from Lower Zaire."&lt;ref name="Cornet 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Pierres sculptees du Bas-Zaire|year=1978|location=Kinshasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and Themes==
Bitumba sculptures are unique in their variety of styles. Robert Farris Thompson has identified about twenty workshops that explain stylistic individuality. The wide dispersal of the works, however, has made it impossible to localize their centers of production. 

Bitumba are express a variety of themes. The most widely found - about twenty percent of statues belong to this type - is a figure who raises his hands in front of his face in a gesture often interpreted as praying. The second most prevalent theme is that of mother and child. The art of Lower Zaire, and especially the art of [[Mayombe]], is known for privileging [[maternity]] subjects. The third theme is that of the "thinker," who holds on hand on the hip and the other pressed to check in an attitude of meditation.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;

{{for|the class of words|Profanity}}
'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
