An '''advance reading copy''', '''advance review copy''', '''advance reader's edition''', '''advance copy''', or a '''reader's edition''' ('''ARC''' or '''ARE''') is a free copy of a new [[book]] given by a publisher to booksellers, librarians, journalists, celebrities, or others, or as a contest or school prize,&lt;ref name="ltblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/blogs/librarything/2007/05/page/2/|title=Archive for May, 2007|work=The Librarything Blog|accessdate=25 February 2012|author=Tim|date=May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519130920/http://www.librarything.com/blog/2007_05_01_archive.php|archivedate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the book is printed for mass distribution.

==Overview==
ARCs may lack the final [[dust jacket]], formatting, and binding of the finished product. The text of an advance edition may also differ slightly from the market book (the final version that is distributed for sale), because changes may be made after advance readers make comments or find errors in the manuscript. When a celebrity reader or journalist gives an endorsement, that may be added to the dust-cover and other promotional items.

ARCs are normally distributed three to six months before the book is officially released to reviewers, bookstores, magazines, and (in some cases) libraries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Book collectors often seek ARCs, which may contain text errors or typos that add value, as coins or stamps with errors do.

On rare occasions (for instance, on the publication of an eagerly awaited or controversial book), a publisher may require the recipients of an ARC to sign a [[Confidentiality agreement|confidentiality of content agreement]]. However, in most cases the sheer number of ARCs produced and distributed makes that impractical. A typical genre publisher will produce 5,000 ARCs for a new book by a moderately popular writer.&lt;ref name="ltblog"/&gt;

Before it was a common practice to produce and distribute ARCs in this way, publishers used uncorrected, bound [[galley proof]]s only for the editing and proof-reading process. Typically, they were bound in plain paper covers without illustrations, printed in black and white, and significantly larger than their market book counterparts. In contrast, ARCs usually are printed in full color, and have bindings, format, and illustrations that are similar to those of the market book. The phrase 'uncorrected proof' appears on the ARC cover.

Although ARCs are usually free promotional items, some early versions of books, even some labeled by the publisher as ARCs, are sold to the public. An example is ''[[Captain Vorpatril's Alliance]]'' by [[Lois McMaster Bujold]].

==Digital advance copies==

Publishers who produce galley proofs in electronic form rather than as a physical book do not use them as ARCs. However, with the rise of ebooks and ereaders, it is now common for ARCs (in contrast to galley proofs) to be distributed as [[EBook|eBooks]] on websites such as NetGalley. Both traditionally published and self-published ARCs may be available for distribution on such sites. Recently, '''eARC''' has come into common use for advance copies of eBooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lili|title=The In’s and Out’s of NetGalley|url=http://blog.netgalley.com/guest-post-the-ins-and-outs-of-netgalley/|website=NetGalley|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage dates back to at least 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBooks and Advanced Reading Copies (eARCs)|url=https://bitethebook.com/2010/11/10/ebooks-and-advanced-reading-copies-earcs/|website=Bite The Book|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted by [[Baen Books]] for their trade eBooks from at least 2013 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebooks beta|url=https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/235/are-baen-earc-editions-generally-very-different-from-final-published-books|website=Stack Exchange|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Biderman''' (born August 15, 1951) is an American film and television writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawn |first=Randee |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSTRE5370LK20090408 |title=Cops' View of Mean Streets Makes for Potent Drama |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the creator and executive producer of the NBC/TNT series ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'' (2009–2013), and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Drama Series for an episode of ''[[NYPD Blue]]''. She created, wrote, and produced the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] drama ''[[Ray Donovan]].

==Early years==
Biderman grew up in Florida and New York. When she was sixteen, she attended boarding school at The Stockbridge School, in the [[Berkshire Mountains]] in Massachusetts, where she was very interested in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/arts/television/just-another-career-criminal-writer.html|title=Just Another Career Criminal Writer|last=Rochlin|first=Margy|date=2013-06-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biderman and her sister spent much of their youth in the company of writers, artists and musicians when living at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] in New York, where “[[Leonard Cohen]] was the boy next door” and her mother’s home in Miami was a sort of halfway house for civil rights activists recently out of prison. The poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] was a close family friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishjournal.com/mobile_20111212/119992/|title=Anything is fair game for ‘Ray Donovan’ showrunner — Jewish Journal|last=Pfefferman&lt;/a&gt;|first=BY &lt;a href='http://jewishjournal.com/author/naomi-pfefferman/'&gt;Naomi|website=jewishjournal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biderman lived for most of the 1980s with French filmmaker [[Roger Vadim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19840115&amp;id=l7YsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uxMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6975,3341295&amp;hl=en |title=Tipoff: 'Bittersweet' is a bankroll |newspaper=Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |date=January 15, 1984 |page=2C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Biderman adapted the novel ''[[Smilla's Sense of Snow]]'' into the screenplay of the 1997 [[Smilla's Sense of Snow (film)|movie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/smilla-film-review.html|title=Smilla's Sense of Snow|website=partners.nytimes.com|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008-09 television season, Biderman developed the police drama series ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'', which aired as a midseason replacement for NBC. The series focuses on patrol officers and detectives in South Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-little-drama-that-could-southland-returns-to-tnt/article/108978|title=The little drama that could -- 'Southland' -- returns to TNT|work=Washington Examiner|date=January 2, 2011|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biderman wrote the pilot episode, and served as an executive producer for the first season alongside [[John Wells (TV producer)|John Wells]] and [[Christopher Chulack]]. She wrote the episodes "Mozambique," "See the Woman," "Sally in the Alley" (with consulting producer [[Angela Amato Velez]]) and "Derailed."

''Southland'' was renewed for a second season and Biderman remained an executive producer and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2009/tv/news/nbc-picks-up-southland-drama-1118003122/|title=NBC picks up ‘Southland’ drama|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2009-05-02|work=Variety|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC reversed the decision and cancelled ''Southland'' after six episodes had been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/southland-canceled-89824|title='Southland' canceled|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was then picked up by the TNT network, and the previously-produced episodes were aired as the show's second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/06/southland-rises-again-on-tnt-a-chat-with-executive-producer-ann-biderman/|title="Southland" Rises Again: A Chat with Executive Producer Ann Biderman|last=Brophy-Warren|first=Jamin|date=2010-01-06|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biderman co-wrote the second-season premiere "Phase Three" with Wells and wrote the episode "U-Boat."

TNT renewed the series for a third season but dramatically reduced its production budget. Biderman stepped down as executive producer but remained an executive consultant. She co-wrote the third-season premiere "Let It Snow" with Wells.

Biderman created the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Ray Donovan]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2013/01/mark-gordon-ann-biderman-introduce-showtimes-fixer-ray-donovan-tca-403107/|title=Mark Gordon, Ann Biderman Introduce Showtime’s Fixer ‘Ray Donovan’: TCA|last=Team|first=The Deadline|date=2013-01-13|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as showrunner during the first season, and wrote several episodes, including the pilot. After the second season, Biderman stepped down as showrunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ray-donovan-showrunner-ann-biderman-727529 |title='Ray Donovan' Showrunner Ann Biderman Out (Exclusive) |publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter'' |date=August 28, 2014 |first=Lacey |last=Rose |accessdate=August 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Army of Darkness''''' (referred to as '''''Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness''''' on its title card&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness - Studio Canal | url= http://www.studiocanal.co.uk/Film/Details/d8aec917-9448-499e-98fa-9e7f006298f3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1992 American [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] film directed and co-written by [[Sam Raimi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/search/all/Army%20of%20Darkness |title=Army of Darkness|last=Williams|first=Karl|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-produced by [[Robert Tapert]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] and co-written by [[Ivan Raimi]]. It stars Campbell and [[Embeth Davidtz]]. It is the third installment in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' franchise, and continuing from ''[[Evil Dead II]],'' [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) is trapped in the [[Middle Ages]] and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.

The film was produced as part of a production deal with [[Universal Studios]] after the financial success of ''[[Darkman]]''. Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]] were responsible for the Ash &amp; Sheila makeup effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero &amp; Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/army_of_darkness_credits.html |title=Book Of The Dead - The Definitive Evil Dead Website |publisher=Bookofthedead.ws |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Army of Darkness'' premiered at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a [[Cult film|cult following]], along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to [[Irvin Shapiro]], who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.

== Plot ==
After being transported to the Middle Ages, [[Ash Williams]] is captured by [[King Arthur|Lord Arthur]]'s men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.

According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]].'' Ash then starts his search for the ''Necronomicon''. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. 

When he arrives at the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely{{snd}} "[[Klaatu barada nikto]]"{{snd}} he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough "nikto". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.

Upon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.

Back in his present time, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a [[Winchester rifle]] from the Sporting Goods department, and exclaims "hail to the king, baby" before passionately kissing the woman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/army-of-darkness-bubba-ho-top-comic-ash-elvis-evil-dead/|title=Ash Vs.

===Original ending===
In the film's original ending, Ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/canceled-movie-twists-saved/|title=10 Canceled Twists That Would’ve Saved Movies (And 10 That Would’ve Hurt Them)|author=Leon Miller|date=July 30, 2018|work=ScreenRant|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2018/08/21/bruce-campbell-ash-vs-evil-dead-3-sam-raimi-rob-tapert-lucy-lawless-starz/|title=Bruce Campbell Talks 'Ash Vs.

==Production==

===Development===
Plans to make a third ''[[Evil Dead]]'' film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of ''[[Darkman]]''.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;{{cite news | last = Muir | first = John Kenneth | authorlink = John Kenneth Muir | title = The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi | work = | page = 152 | language = | publisher = Applause | year = 2004 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' made enough money internationally that [[Dino De Laurentiis]] was willing to finance a sequel.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt;  Director and script writer [[Sam Raimi]] drew from a variety of sources, including literature with ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' and [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and films like ''[[The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'', ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'',  [[The Three Stooges]], and  ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan The Barbarian]]''. ''Evil Dead II'', according to [[Bruce Campbell]], "was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made".&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Warren (film historian and critic) | title = The Evil Dead Companion | work = | page = 143 | language = | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2000 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotional drawings were created and published in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.  The working title for the project was ''Medieval Dead'',before it was later known as''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Warren2"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title "Army of Darkness" came from an idea by [[Irvin Shapiro]], during the production of ''Evil Dead II''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Raimi. DVD audio commentary, 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay and pre-production===
Initially, Raimi invited [[Scott Spiegel]] to co-write ''Army of Darkness'' because he had done a good job on ''Evil Dead II'', but he was busy on rewrites for the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]''.&lt;ref name="Warren3"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called ''Easy Wheels'', Sam and his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] decided to co-write the film together.&lt;ref name="Warren4"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of ''Darkman''.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; After filming ''Darkman'', they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script.&lt;ref name="Warren4"/&gt; Campbell remembers, "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting".&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt; Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.&lt;ref name="Warren6"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; ''Darkman'' was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so ''Army of Darkness'' became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.&lt;ref name="Warren5"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer [[Robert Tapert]] to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from [[Victor Fleming]]'s film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt; A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the ''Joan of Arc'' storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt;

[[Traci Lords]] was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, "I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell]," with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | title=Traci Lords |publisher= (chat transcript), [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] | date = January 25, 2001 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030729085136/http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | archivedate=July 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
[[Principal photography]] took place between soundstage and on-location work. ''Army of Darkness'' was filmed in [[Bronson Canyon]] and [[Vasquez Rocks|Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park]]. The interior shots were filmed on an [[Front projection|Introvision]] stage in [[Hollywood]]. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the [[stop-motion animation]] work of [[Ray Harryhausen]].&lt;ref name="Muir2"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional [[rear projection]] that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt; According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".&lt;ref name="Robley"&gt;{{cite news | last = Robley | first = Les Paul | authorlink =  | title = Mobilizing ''Army of Darkness'' via "Go-Animation" |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |page = 74 | language = | publisher = | date = March 1993 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.&lt;ref name="Warren9"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near [[Acton, California|Acton]], California on the edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.&lt;ref name="Muir3"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.&lt;ref name="Warren7"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Money problems forced cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.&lt;ref name="Muir4"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.&lt;ref name="Muir5"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesa remembers, "Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes".&lt;ref name="Muir5"/&gt; Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons{{clarify|date=January 2012}} that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.&lt;ref name="Muir5"/&gt;

===Post-production===
While [[Dino De Laurentiis]] gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production.&lt;ref name="Muir6"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt; In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with [[Bridget Fonda]].&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt; Raimi recalls, "Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".&lt;ref name="Warren11"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the [[Hannibal Lecter]] character which Universal needed so that they could film a [[Hannibal (film)|sequel]] to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.&lt;ref name="Muir8"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for ''Army of Darkness''' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.

For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the [[Frank Frazetta]]-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.&lt;ref name="Warren12"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi ran into further troubles when the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating.&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt; In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt;

===Music===
[[Danny Elfman]], who composed the score for ''Darkman'', wrote the "March of the Dead" theme for ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Warren8"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After the re-shoots were completed, [[Joseph LoDuca]], who composed the music for ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', returned to score the film.&lt;ref name="Muir7"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the [[Seattle Symphony]].&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt; The score was released during the [[MondoCon]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on October 3 and 4, 2015, on [[Gramophone record|Vinyl]], over [[Mondo Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3356356/mondo-announces-army-darkness-vinyl-soundtrack/ |title=Mondo Announces ‘Army Of Darkness’ Vinyl Soundtrack |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date=August 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time ''Army of Darkness'' turns into a retread of ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle."&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = March 5, 1994 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305759,00.html | accessdate = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential sequel==
In March 2013, shortly before the release of ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'', a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next ''Evil Dead'' film will be ''Army of Darkness 2''. Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Crump |url=http://screenrant.com/army-of-darkness-2-evil-dead-4-sam-raimi/ |title=Sam Raimi’s Next Project is ‘Army of Darkness 2′ Not ‘Evil Dead 4′ |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Hewitt |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=36976 |title=Empireonline.com |location=gb |publisher=Empireonline.com |date=October 9, 2015 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[WonderCon]] panel in March 2013, Campbell and [[Fede Alvarez]], director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarez's ''Evil Dead 2'' and Raimi's ''Army of Darkness 2'' to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/bruce-campbell-and-evil-dead-director-fede-alvarez-would-love-to-merge-original-and-remake-storylines/|title=Bruce Campbell and ‘Evil Dead’ Director Fede Alvarez Would Love to Merge Original and Remake Storylines|work=slashfilm.com|last=Fischer|first=Russ|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Author --&gt; Joe Comicbook @ComicBook |url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/10/18/bruce-campbell-confirms-he-will-do-army-of-darkness-sequel/ |title=Bruce Campbell Confirms He Will Do Army Of Darkness Sequel |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fede Alvarez posted a status update on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/fedalvar/statuses/394170890709000192?screen_name=fedalvar |title=Fede Alvarez on Twitter: "“@thielebenjamin: Hey @fedalvar will you be directing the Army Of Darkness 2 movie?” Sam Raimi will!" |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzMjP7cE6S0&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrzMjP7cE6S0 |title=Bruce Campbell says No Army of Darkness 2 |publisher=YouTube.com |date=November 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turek |first=Ryan |url=http://m.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/177109-bruce-campbell-wants-to-set-the-record-straight-about-army-of-darkness-2-and-he-feels-bad-for-you |title=Bruce Campbell Wants to Set the Record Straight About Army of Darkness 2, And He Feels Bad for You |publisher=M.shocktillyoudrop.com |date=November 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1932 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[United States]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}
The '''art of the Low Countries''' consists of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[printmaking]], [[pottery]] and other forms of [[visual art]] produced in the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]], and since the 19th century in [[Belgium]] in the [[southern Netherlands]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north. 

From the late Middle Ages until about 1700 the Low Countries were a leading force in the art of northern Europe, thereafter becoming less important. In the earlier [[High Middle Ages]] [[Mosan art]], from an area partly in the Low Countries, had had a similar role.
  
The art of the Low Countries includes the traditions of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and the [[Renaissance in the Low Countries]], before the political separation of the region.  After the separation, a protracted process lasting [[Eighty Years' War|between 1568 and 1648]], [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] in the north and [[Flemish Baroque painting]], especially the art of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], were the cornerstones of art.  

==Early Netherlandish==
{{main|Early Netherlandish painting}}

Early Netherlandish art includes those artists who were active during the 15th and early 16th centuries in the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]], especially in the flourishing cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. It begins approximately with the careers of [[Robert Campin]] and [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] around 1400 and ends with [[Gerard David]] about 1520. Other major figures include [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hugo van der Goes]], and [[Petrus Christus]].&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, ''Early Netherlandish Painting''. London: Harper Collins (1971), ''passim.'' {{ISBN|0-06-430002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Mannerism==
{{main|Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting}}
The 16th century was a period of response to [[Italian Renaissance art]] and the development of several distinctly Netherlandish themes. At the start of the century [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painted fantastic images, often for courtly viewers, that left a long legacy. [[Jan Mabuse]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Frans Floris]] were all instrumental in adopting Italian models and incorporating them into their own artistic language. The spread of [[Mannerism]] throughout Europe produced important forms of [[Northern Mannerist]] art in the Low Countries. Finally, [[Joachim Patinir]] was a recognized innovator of [[landscape painting]], while [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Aertsen]] helped establish [[genre painting]] as a popular subject matter.

==Baroque and classicism==
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Tonic'', [[Städel|Städelsches Kunstinstitut und Städtische Galerie]], Frankfurt am Main. Oil on oak, 48 x 36 cm. Adriaen Brouwer worked in both the northern and southern Netherlands and reflects shared artistic tendencies.&lt;ref name="vlieghe"&gt;Hans Vlieghe, "Flemish Art, Does It Really Exist?," ''Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 26 (1998), pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{For|painting in the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Southern Netherlands]], respectively|Dutch Golden Age painting|Flemish Baroque painting}}
The 17th century was a period dominated by the distinct individuals [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] in the newly independent Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Mariët Westermann, "After Iconography and Iconoclasm: Current Research in Netherlandish Art, 1566-1700," ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 84 (Jun., 2002), pp. 351-372, esp. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch and Flemish painters both followed many of the same themes, including [[still life]], genre, [[landscape painting|landscape]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and [[classicism]]. Other artistic tendencies clearly differentiated art in the south from the north: the [[Counter-Reformation]], which spurred on patronage for large [[altarpiece]]s in the south, was absent from the Dutch Republic, while Flemish painting did not see the development of the types of calm, single-figure genre paintings championed by the likes of [[Jan Vermeer]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe" /&gt;

==1700–1830==
The most famous painter from the region in the late 17th and early 18th century is [[Antoine Watteau]], whose hometown of [[Valenciennes]] had been annexed by [[France]] a decade before he was born. Otherwise, few painters from about 1700 until the end of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1830 have been incorporated into the art historical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Montias, "Socio-Economic Aspects of Netherlandish Art from the Fifteenth to the Seventeenth Century: A Survey," ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 72, (Sep., 1990), pp. 358-373, esp. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zirka Zaremba Filipczak, ''Picturing Art in Antwerp'', 1550-1700. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press (1987): 177–201. {{ISBN|0-691-04047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch painters such as [[Jacob de Wit]] adopted a lofty [[Rococo]] style, indebted somewhat to Rubens, for ceiling decorations, but there was little work available.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Slive, ''Dutch Painting 1600-1800'', New Haven, Conn: [[Yale University Press]] (1995), 304–305 {{ISBN|0-300-06418-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other painters, such as [[Cornelis Troost]], looked to [[England]] and especially the works of [[William Hogarth]], for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, ''op. cit.'',  310–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 1830==
Art after 1830 in Belgium and the Netherlands follow separate paths as the countries further develop their own identities. [[James Ensor]] is an important figure from Belgium, while [[Vincent van Gogh]], from the Netherlands, posthumously reached the level of modern [[superstar]] painter.

'''Arts NSW''' (ANSW) is an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]] responsible for administering the government's policies that support the arts, artists and the various cultural bodies within the state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]]. Arts NSW is led by its Executive Director, Mary Darwell, who reports to the [[Departmental secretary|Secretary]] of the [[Department of Justice (New South Wales)|Department of Justice]], Andrew Cappie-Wood.  The agency advises the [[Minister for the Arts (New South Wales)|Minister for the Arts]], presently [[The Honourable|the Hon.]] [[Don Harwin]] {{small|[[Legislative Council of New South Wales|MLC]]}}, who is ultimately responsible to the [[Parliament of New South Wales]]. 

==History==
The role of an 'arts' minister, overseeing the management and support for all cultural activities in New South Wales, before the early 1970s was an unheard of concept in politics. However, by the early 1970s, various governments in Australia recognised the need for a steering authority for state support for the arts. In response, premier [[Bob Askin]] appointed [[George Freudenstein]] as the first Minister for Cultural Activities on 11 March 1971. On his appointment Freudenstein requested the establishment of an organisation to enable him to carry out his responsibilities and the Premier agreed. On 13 May 1971 the '''Ministry of Cultural Activities''' was established, taking over responsibility for various legislation and bodies that had previously been under the purview of the [[Department of Education (New South Wales)|Department of Education]], including the [[NSW State Records|Archives Office of New South Wales]], [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], [[State Library of New South Wales]], [[Australian Museum]], [[Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences]], [[Sydney Observatory]], the Advisory Committee on Cultural Grants, [[Screen NSW|NSW Film Council]], and the [[Sydney Opera House]] Trust. In the case of the opera house, the Ministry had responsibility for its completion and final official opening on 20 October 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Cultural Activities |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/404 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083450/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/404 |archivedate=30 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Freudenstein's departure on 3 January 1975, a new Minister for Culture, Sport and Recreation was appointed and on 6 January 1975, the Ministry of Cultural Activities was replaced by the new '''Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation'''.&lt;ref name=CSR&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/403 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930180811/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/403 |archivedate=30 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement lasted until 14 May 1976 when the new Labor Government of [[Neville Wran]] transferred the responsibility for cultural activities to the [[Department of Premier and Cabinet (New South Wales)|Premier's Department]]. This became the '''Cultural Activities Division''' under the administration of the Premier himself.&lt;ref name=CSR/&gt; This situation continued until 1984, when Wran established the '''Office of the Minister for the Arts''' within the Premier's Department and commissioned himself with the title of Minister for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division of Cultural Activities (1976-1984) Office of the Minister for the Arts (1984-1988) |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3629 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=29 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929221355/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3629 |archivedate=29 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1988 a '''Ministry for the Arts''' independent of the Premier's Department was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry for the Arts |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3630 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929221445/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3630 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ministry was abolished on 3 March 2006 and its responsibilities were moved to the new '''[[New South Wales Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation|Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/5059 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929203818/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/5059 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Arts NSW''' became the new dedicated division for the Minister and it transferred to "Communities NSW" in July 2009 and then the "[[Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Development (New South Wales)|Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services]]" from 4 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts NSW |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/6374 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929221409/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/6374 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the appointment of [[Troy Grant]] as the minister in 2014 (who also served as the [[Minister for Police and Emergency Services (New South Wales)#Police|Minister for Police]] and [[Minister for Justice (New South Wales)#Justice|Minister for Justice]]), Arts NSW has been within the Department of Justice.

'''Basil Ionides''' (20 June 1884 – 23 September 1950) was a British architect who published two best-selling books, ''Colour and Interior Decoration'' (1926) and ''Colour in Everyday Rooms'' (1934).  He is best known for his 1929 interior design of the rebuilt [[Savoy Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Biography==
Ionides was born in [[Scotland]], the fourth son of Luke Ionides and grandson of [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]], [[Greeks|Greek]] ambassador to London.&lt;ref name=codexgeo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects – DSA Architect Biography Report (June 19, 2008, 11:44 pm)|publisher=www.codexgeo.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328002933/http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317|archive-date=28 March 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Glasgow School of Art]] 1900–1903.  While there, he wrote architecture articles.  He served his apprenticeship with Alexander Nisbet Paterson, during which he designed his first building, the double villa in Winton Drive, when he was only 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.primelocation.com/SAGR/SAGL/Brochures/SAGL192317B1.PDF |title=A handsome, early Victorian detached villa in an affluent enclave |publisher=media.primelocation.com |accessdate=19 June 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the completion of his apprenticeship in 1904 or 1905, he moved to London and joined the office first of [[Leonard Stokes]] and then of [[Harold Ainsworth Peto]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317 Profile of Basil Ionides at the ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects'' (2006).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328002933/http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317 |date=28 March 2007 }} Retrieved on 19 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ionides entered independent practice in 1908 and designed a number of English houses.  During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] and was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]].  He relinquished the commission, however, preferring to serve as an ordinary [[seaman]], as he did not like giving orders to more experienced men.  He was injured in 1917 and returned to private practice, particularly performing interior work.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Ionides married the Honourable Nellie Samuel (1883–1962),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p11830.htm#i118300 Information about Nellie Samuel and Basil Ionides at thePeerage.com.] Retrieved on 19 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the widow of Walter Henry Levy, daughter of the [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|1st Viscount Bearsted]], in 1930 after meeting her while he was decorating her residence in [[Berkeley Square]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/03/arts/art-architecture-when-good-eye-and-goodly-fortune-come-together.html?pagewanted=all |title=ART/ARCHITECTURE; When Good Eye And Goodly Fortune Come Together – New York Times|publisher=query.nytimes.com|accessdate=19 June 2008|last=Owens|first=Mitchell | date=3 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert in Oriental [[porcelain]] and collected art works, many of which were donated to Richmond Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderven-vanderven.com/media/VandervenMedia/letter_tefaf2004.html|title=Vanderven &amp; Vanderven Oriental Art|publisher=www.vanderven-vanderven.com|accessdate=19 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618221434/http://www.vanderven-vanderven.com/media/VandervenMedia/letter_tefaf2004.html|archivedate=18 June 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basil and Nellie had one child, Adam, who died at the age of nine.  The Ionides acquired Buxted Park in 1931.&lt;ref name=handpicked&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handpicked.co.uk/opencms/sites/default/HPH/hotels/buxted_park/about/history.html|title=History |publisher=www.handpicked.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080729004304/http://www.handpicked.co.uk/opencms/sites/default/HPH/hotels/buxted_park/about/history.html| archivedate= 29 July 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a combination of Basil's discerning eye and Nellie's fortune as the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Oil]] heiress, they restored the Park and became important art collectors.  But fire destroyed much of the house in 1940, and the top story was lost entirely, with much of their collection.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; Ionides scavenged architectural pieces from bombed-out buildings around the country with which to rebuild his stately home (now a hotel).&lt;ref name=handpicked/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeremy-clarke.freeserve.co.uk/west%20park.htm "Buxted Park and the Medley Evelyn Connection", ''Felbridge &amp; District History Group'' (2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727191228/http://www.jeremy-clarke.freeserve.co.uk/west%20park.htm |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[High Sheriff of Sussex]] for 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=36444|page=1449|date=28 March 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionides was an important [[Art Deco]] designer.  He was best known as the architect (with Frank A. Tugwell) for the rebuilding of the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London in 1929 and for Claridge's Restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elegant-lifestyle.com/claridges.htm "Claridge's Hotel, London, England", ''Elegant-Lifestyle.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Savoy Hotel]]'s restaurant, he famously sculpted Kaspar, the Black Cat, who acts as a good-luck guest at tables if thirteen would otherwise be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodmapper.com/idx_result.asp?mood=204&amp;place=152|title=moodmapper – Kaspar the Cat – The Savoy Hotel|publisher=www.moodmapper.com|accessdate=19 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629005035/http://www.moodmapper.com/idx_result.asp?mood=204&amp;place=152|archivedate=29 June 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published the important books ''Colour and Interior Decoration'' in 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Blue Mountain Theatre''' is a theatre company created in [[London]] in 1989 to provide theatre pieces for [[black British]] audiences.

Influenced by the thriving theatrical community in [[Jamaica]], the group attempted to perform pieces that would serves as a social event rather than what they viewed as traditional elitist audiences. Titles have included ''Betrayed'', ''Affairs'', ''Smallie'', ''Forbidden Love'', ''Confessions of a Black Woman'' and more recently ''Wicked Bitches'' and ''Dutty Wine''.

[[File:Chronicles of the Canongate 1st series.jpg|thumb|right|180px|First edition title page]]
'''''Chronicles of the Canongate''''' is a collection of stories by Sir [[Walter Scott]], published in 1827 and 1828. They are named after the [[Canongate]], in [[Edinburgh]].

* 1st series (short stories, 1827):
** "The Highland Widow"
** "The Two Drovers"
** "The Surgeon's Daughter"
* 2nd series (novel, 1828):
** ''St Valentine's Day'', or, ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''

The second series is sometimes taken as part of the [[Waverley Novels]].

==The Highland Widow==

===Plot summary===
The MacTavish family lived near [[Oban]] in 1775. Hamish MacTavish ''Mohr'' ("Senior"), a daring freebooter, had met his death in an encounter with the Saxon red-coats, by whom the Highlands were garrisoned after the [[battle of Culloden]]. His wife, who had shared all his dangers, strove to inspire their only son with his father's love of adventure and hatred of servile toil; but as he grew up the lad evinced no inclination for lawless pursuits, and, unable to endure his mother's taunts at his want of spirit, enlisted in one of the regiments formed in Scotland to oppose the French in the [[American war of independence]]. Before sailing he sent her some money by Phadraick, and returned to spend a few days with her, when she fiercely reproached him for daring to act in opposition to her will, and, failing to alter his purpose, drugged his parting-cup, thus causing him to exceed his furlough, and render himself liable to the lash as a deserter. She then urged him to flee to her kinsmen, while she baffled his pursuers; but he resolved to await the arrival of the sergeant and men of his regiment who, he felt sure, would be sent to arrest him. They came and summoned him to surrender, but because they could not assure him against the lash, and provoked by his mother, he shot the sergeant dead. The other soldiers secured him, and he was marched as a prisoner to Dumbarton castle, where he was tried by court-martial and condemned to be shot. His captain and a Presbyterian minister interceded for him; but the English general in command was determined to make an example, and the next morning his sentence was carried out in the presence of his comrades.

His mother, who had attempted to follow him, was met by the minister wandering in a wild glen, and on hearing her son's fate, she uttered terrible imprecations, and renounced all further intercourse with the world. She lived, however, for many years in her lonely cottage, regarded with awe and pity by her neighbours as the victim of destiny, rather than the voluntary cause of her son's death and her own wretchedness. At length, while two women, who had been set to watch her last moments, were sleeping, she disappeared from her bed, and was never heard of again.

===Characters===
* Hamish MacTavish ''Mohr'', an outlaw
* Elspat, his wife
* Hamish ''Bean'' ("Junior"), their son
* Miles Phadraick, a farmer
* Rev Michael Tyrie, a Presbyterian minister
* Green Colin, captain of Hamish Bean's regiment
* Allan Break Cameron, his sergeant

==The Two Drovers==

===Plot summary===
In 1795, Robin Oig was just starting from [[Doune]] with a drove of cattle for England, when his father's sister, who was supposed to be gifted with second sight, drew his dirk from the folds of his plaid, and, exclaiming that there was Saxon blood on it, induced him to entrust the weapon to Morrison, who undertook to return it when asked for. At [[Falkirk]] the Highlander met his bosom friend, Wakefield, and they travelled southwards together. Having reached [[Cumberland]], they separated to hire pasturage for their beasts, and it happened that while the Englishman bargained with the bailiff, the Highlander came to terms with the squire, and they thus both secured the same enclosure. On discovering this, Wakefield reproached his comrade with having played him false, and, angrily refusing his offer that they should share the field, had to be content with a barren moor belonging to the landlord of the alehouse, where they had agreed to pass the night.

The squire had invited Oig to sup with him, and mentioned having passed Morrison a few miles off. On reaching the inn the Highlander met with a cold reception from the assembled company, who sided with Wakefield, and egged him on to challenge Oig to a Cumberland tussle. But the Highlander would have shaken hands, and, refusing to fight except with swords, he attempted to leave the room. Wakefield, however, opposed his doing so, and struck him senseless to the ground. Frantic with rage when he revived, and prevented by the hostess from attacking his comrade, Oig sullenly went out, warning him to beware. Striding over the moonlit moor to meet Morrison, he obtained his dirk on the pretence that he had enlisted, and, returning to the alehouse, he stabbed Wakefield through the heart.

At his trial the judge made every allowance for the provocation Oig had received, but pointed out to the jury that, as he went to recover possession of his weapon, there was ample time for his passion to have subsided, and for him to have reflected on the guilt of his meditated revenge. He was, accordingly, convicted of murder, and having been sentenced to be hanged, he met his fate with the observation, "I give a life for the life I took, and what can I do more?"

===Characters===

* Hortence Bennet, his lover

==The Surgeon's Daughter==

===Plot summary===
Gideon Gray was a surgeon who lived in [[Fife]] in the late 18th century. The surgeon's services were unexpectedly sought by a pregnant woman and her husband, who arrived in the village, as strangers, just before she gave birth. The following day the father left, and within a month the mother was carried off by her father, who persuaded Mr Gray to undertake the care and education of the boy, and deposited a thousand pounds in trust for him. Four years afterwards Mrs Gray died in giving birth to a daughter, and the two children were brought up together. At the age of fourteen Richard, who had been led by his nurse to believe himself born to wealth and honour, was informed by his guardian of his real position, and, after consulting with Mr Lawford and his companion Tom Hillary, he decided to remain an inmate of Mr Gray's family as his apprentice, with Hartley as a fellow pupil. As they grew up both the young men fell in love with Menie, and when the doctor proposed that Hartley should become his partner, and endeavour to secure her affections, it transpired that she and Richard were already secretly engaged. Hartley determined to make a voyage to India, and learnt with astonishment that his rival, at the instigation of Hillary, who was now a captain in the Company's service, intended to spend two years there before marrying, in the hope of realising a fortune.

Having obtained the money left by his grandfather in Mr Gray's hands, and enlisted as a recruit, he sailed from [[Edinburgh]] with his friend for the depot at [[Ryde]]; but, on recovering from a drinking bout before landing, he found himself in the military hospital, deserted by Tom Hillary, and robbed of all his belongings. Hartley, however, was acting as one of the medical officers, and, having earned the gratitude of the commandant, General Witherington, by successfully treating two of his children who were suffering from smallpox, was able to obtain a commission for his fellow-student. The general and his wife had discovered that Richard was their first-born, and when he was introduced to them the shock of hearing him describe himself as an orphan, deserted by his parents, caused the death of his mother, upon which the father was seized with a fit of frenzy, and on recovering could not face his son again. Hartley had, however, been previously entrusted with his history, as well as a gift of money for him, and they sailed together for [[Madras]]. Having killed his colonel in a duel, Richard fled to the court of a native prince, while Hartley obtained great reputation as a medical practitioner. One of his patients was Barak el Hadji, who promised him his influence with [[Hyder Ali]], should he at any time need it.

[[File:Bangalore Fort.jpg|thumb|right|Bangalore Fort in 1860]]
Some months afterwards he was startled by the presence of Menie Gray at a public breakfast, chaperoned by the [[Begum]], who, he learnt, was the wealthy widow of a Rajah. At a private interview with his old master's daughter, Hartley elicited from her that she had come out at Richard's invitation to be married, and was on her way to meet him in [[Mysore]]. Mistrusting her lover, he offered his protection should she need it, and the next day he received a note from her telling him she was sold to [[Tippoo Saib]]. Unable to obtain an audience of the governor, Hartley resolved to solicit the intervention of Hyder Ali, and, having reached [[Seringapatam]], he sought the aid of El Hadji, who introduced him to another Fakir of higher rank. Following his directions, he accompanied a troop of native cavalry to Tippoo's encampment near [[Bangalore]], and witnessed his return thither, escorted by a magnificent bodyguard, including artillery and elephants. The Begum, who had previously arrived with her retinue, and Menie under her protection, was at once invited to an interview with the prince in his garden the following day. Accordingly, at noon the discharge of cannon announced that he had left his palace; and on the arrival of his visitor, attended by Richard as her principal officer, she was conducted to a cushion on his right hand. An attendant then proclaimed the appointment of Richard as governor of the city, and the Begum in return presented Tippoo with the litter containing Menie.

The old Fakir, however, came forward, and, throwing off his disguise, ascended the throne as Hyder Ali. Having reproved his son, he commanded him to restore the gift to the care of Hartley, but allowed the ceremony of investiture to proceed. As Richard, however, who had plotted with Paupiah to betray his trust, was about to mount the elephant in waiting for him, the Rajah made a sign, upon which the animal seized him by the neck with its trunk, and crushed him to death with its foot. The Begum was then ordered to bear her share in compensating her intended victim for the indignity she had suffered, and afterwards deprived of her power and riches. Menie returned to her native village, and the gallant Hartley died from a distemper caught in the courageous pursuit of his profession.

In the [[visual arts]], '''color theory''' or '''colour theory''' is a body of practical guidance to [[color]] mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the [[color wheel]]: [[primary color]], [[secondary color]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/research/rgb-cmyk-colour-systems/ | last1 = Dekel | first1 = Gil |title=RGB and CMYK Colour systems |date=2016-03-28 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tertiary color]]&lt;!-- {{http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory}} --&gt;. Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of [[Leone Battista Alberti]] (c. 1435) and the notebooks of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1490), a tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of color (''Opticks'', 1704) and the nature of [[primary color]]s. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to [[colorimetry]] and [[vision science]].&lt;!-- {{http://utah.agclassroom.org/files/uploads/estore/color_garden.pdf}} --&gt;

[[File:Pigment Colours - Classification.jpg|thumb|Classification of pigment colors]]

The foundations of pre-20th-century color theory were built around "pure" or ideal colors, characterized by different sensory experiences rather than attributes of the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in traditional color theory principles that are not always remedied in modern formulations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The most important problem has been a confusion between the behavior of [[light]] mixtures, called [[additive color]], and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called [[subtractive color]]. This problem arises because the absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.

A second problem has been the failure to describe the very important effects of strong luminance (lightness) contrasts in the appearance of colors reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) as opposed to colors of light; "colors" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. Thus, a strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.

A third problem has been the tendency to describe color effects holistically or categorically, for example as a contrast between "yellow" and "blue" conceived as generic colors, when most color effects are due to contrasts on three relative attributes that define all colors:

# Value, (light vs. dark, or white vs. black),
# Chroma,[saturation, purity, strength, intensity] (intense vs. dull), and
# Hue (e.g. the name of the color family:red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta).

Thus, the visual impact of "yellow" vs. "blue" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues.

These confusions are partly historical, and arose in scientific uncertainty about color perception that was not resolved until the late 19th century, when the artistic notions were already entrenched. However, they also arise from the attempt to describe the highly contextual and flexible behavior of color perception in terms of abstract color sensations that can be generated equivalently by any visual media.

Many historical "color theorists" have assumed that three "pure" primary colors can mix ''all possible colors'', and that any failure of specific paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colorants. In reality, only imaginary "primary colors" used in colorimetry can "mix" or quantify all visible (perceptually possible) colors; but to do this, these imaginary primaries are defined as lying outside the range of visible colors; i.e., they cannot be seen. Any three real "primary" colors of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colors, called a [[gamut]], which is always smaller (contains fewer colors) than the full range of colors humans can perceive.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Historical background ==

Color theory was originally formulated in terms of three "primary" or "primitive" colors—red, yellow and blue ([[RYB color model|RYB]])—because these colors were believed capable of mixing all other colors. This color mixing behavior had long been known to printers, dyers and painters, but these trades preferred pure pigments to primary color mixtures, because the mixtures were too dull (unsaturated).

[[File:GoetheFarbkreis.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goethe]]'s color wheel from his 1810 ''[[Theory of Colours]]'']]

The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th century theories of [[color vision]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues that are produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'' (1810) by the German poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and ''The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast'' (1839) by the French industrial chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]]. [[Charles Hayter]] published ''A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information'' (London 1826), in which he described how all colours could be obtained from just three.
[[File:Color diagram Charles Hayter.jpg|thumb|Page from ''A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information'' by [[Charles Hayter]]]]

Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors—red, green and blue violet ([[RGB color model|RGB]])—modeled through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary colors in the differing responses to light by three types of color receptors or ''cones'' in the [[retina]] ([[trichromacy]]). On this basis the quantitative description of color mixture or [[colorimetry]] developed in the early 20th century, along with a series of increasingly sophisticated models of [[color space]] and color perception, such as the [[opponent process]] theory.

Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary colors most effective in inks or photographic dyes: [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by a black ink, known as the [[CMYK]] system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the color of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color mixing with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that ''absorbed'' only one of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (−R+G+B), magenta only green (+R−G+B), and yellow only blue violet (+R+G−B). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples. A wider range of color can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in [[Pantone]]'s [[Hexachrome]] printing ink system (six colors), among others.

[[File:Munsell-system.svg|thumb|right|Munsell color system|[[Munsell color system|Munsell]]'s color system represented as a three-dimensional solid showing all three color making attributes: ''lightness'', ''saturation'' and ''hue''.]]

For much of the 19th century artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or was augmented by science books written for the lay public, in particular ''Modern Chromatics'' (1879) by the American physicist [[Ogden Rood]], and early color atlases developed by [[Albert Munsell]] (''Munsell Book of Color'', 1915, see [[Munsell color system]]) and [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by artists teaching or associated with the German [[Bauhaus]], in particular [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Faber Birren]] and [[Josef Albers]], whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color design principles.

== Traditional color theory ==

=== Complementary colors ===
[[File:Chevreul's RYB chromatic diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Chevreul]]'s 1855 "chromatic diagram" based on the [[RYB color model]], showing [[complementary colors]] and other relationships]]

{{Main|Complementary colors}}

For the mixing of colored light, Isaac Newton's [[color wheel]] is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors which cancel each other's hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture.  Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other's hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

A key assumption in Newton's hue circle was that the "fiery" or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the "center of gravity" or centroid of three triangle points, and so on.

[[File:Color star-en (tertiary names).svg|thumb|Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors of the [[RYB color model]]]]

According to traditional color theory based on [[subtractive primary color]]s and the [[RYB color model]], yellow mixed with purple, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors. These contrasts form the basis of [[Chevreul]]'s law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color. Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the complementary color to blue.

However, when complementary colors are chosen based on definition by light mixture, they are not the same as the artists' primary colors.  This discrepancy becomes important when color theory is applied across media. Digital color management uses a hue circle defined according to [[additive primary colors]] (the [[RGB color model]]), as the colors in a computer monitor are additive mixtures of light, not subtractive mixtures of paints.

One reason the artist's primary colors work at all is that the imperfect pigments being used have sloped absorption curves, and thus change color with concentration. A pigment that is pure red at high concentrations can behave more like magenta at low concentrations. This allows it to make purples that would otherwise be impossible. Likewise, a blue that is ultramarine at high concentrations appears cyan at low concentrations, allowing it to be used to mix green. Chromium red pigments can appear orange, and then yellow, as the concentration is reduced. It is even possible to mix very low concentrations of the blue mentioned and the chromium red to get a greenish color. This works much better with oil colors than it does with watercolors and dyes.

So the old primaries depend on sloped absorption curves and pigment leakages to work, while newer scientifically derived ones depend solely on controlling the amount of absorption in certain parts of the spectrum.

Another reason the correct primary colors were not used by early artists is that they were not available as durable pigments. Modern methods in chemistry were needed to produce them.

=== Warm vs. cool colors ===

The distinction between "warm" and "cool" colors has been important since at least the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color12.html |title=color temperature |publisher=handprint |date=2009-04-19 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast, as traced by etymologies in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], seems related to the observed contrast in landscape light, between the "warm" colors associated with daylight or sunset, and the "cool" colors associated with a gray or overcast day. Warm colors are often said to be hues from red through yellow, browns and tans included; cool colors are often said to be the hues from blue green through blue violet, most grays included. There is historical disagreement about the colors that anchor the polarity, but 19th-century sources put the peak contrast between red orange and greenish blue.

Color theory has described perceptual and psychological effects to this contrast. Warm colors are said to advance or appear more active in a painting, while cool colors tend to recede; used in interior design or fashion, warm colors are said to arouse or stimulate the viewer, while cool colors calm and relax. Most of these effects, to the extent they are real, can be attributed to the higher saturation and lighter value of warm pigments in contrast to cool pigments. Thus, brown is a dark, unsaturated warm color that few people think of as visually active or psychologically arousing.

Contrast the traditional warm–cool association of color with the [[color temperature]] of a theoretical radiating [[black body]], where the association of color with temperature is reversed. For instance, the hottest [[star]]s radiate blue light (i.e., with shorter wavelength and higher frequency), and the coolest radiate red.  

[[File:Color temperature black body 800-12200K.svg|thumb|center|500px|The hottest radiating bodies (e.g. stars) have a "cool" color, while the less hot bodies radiate with a "warm" color (image in [[Kelvin scale]])]]

This contrast is further seen in the psychological associations of colors with the [[Relativistic Doppler effect]] seen in astronomical objects.  Traditional psychological associations, where warm colors are associated with advancing objects and cool colors with receding objects, are directly opposite those seen in [[astrophysics]], where stars or galaxies moving towards our viewpoint from Earth are [[blueshifted]] (advancing) and stars or galaxies moving away from Earth are [[redshifted]] (receding).
[[File:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|center|Doppler [[redshift]] for receding and [[blueshift]] for advancing]]

=== Achromatic colors ===

Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be ''unsaturated'', ''achromatic'', ''near neutral'', or ''neutral''. Near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness. Pure achromatic, or ''neutral'' colors include black, white and all grays.

''Near neutrals'' are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or grey, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color; e.g., next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish. &lt;!-- this isn't just "in the color theory"... it's a property of human color vision --&gt;

Black and white have long been known to combine "well" with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent ''saturation'' or ''brightness'' of colors paired with it, and white shows off all hues to equal effect.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

=== Tints and shades ===
{{Main|Tints and shades}}

When mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the pigments in paint mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a color's complement.

It is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called ''shades''—or lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called ''tints''. However it is not always the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in hue. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).

=== Split primary colors ===

In [[painting]] and other visual arts, two-dimensional [[color wheel]]s or three-dimensional [[color solid]]s are used as tools to teach beginners the essential relationships between colors. The organization of colors in a particular color model depends on the purpose of that model: some models show relationships based on [[Color vision|human color perception]], whereas others are based on the color mixing properties of a particular medium such as a computer display or set of paints.

This system is still popular among contemporary painters,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} as it is basically a simplified version of Newton's geometrical rule that colors closer together on the hue circle will produce more vibrant mixtures. However, with the range of contemporary paints available, many artists simply add more paints to their palette as desired for a variety of practical reasons.&lt;!-- isn't a "split primary" palette also adding more paints? --&gt; For example, they may add a scarlet, purple and/or green paint to expand the mixable [[gamut]]; and they include one or more dark colors (especially "earth" colors such as yellow ochre or burnt sienna) simply because they are convenient to have premixed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;!-- I thought it was because mixtures of orange/yellow with black didn't achieve the desired effect --&gt; Printers commonly augment a CMYK palette with [[spot color|spot]] (trademark specific) ink colors.

=== Color harmony ===

It has been suggested that "Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Burchett, K. E. (2002). "Color harmony". ''Color Research and Application'', 27 (1), pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgment. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color. In addition, context always has an influence on responses about color and the notion of color harmony, and this concept is also influenced by temporal factors (such as changing trends) and perceptual factors (such as simultaneous contrast) which may impinge on human response to color. The following conceptual model illustrates this 21st century approach to color harmony:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Color harmony} = f(\text{Col} 1, 2, 3, \dots, n) \cdot (ID + CE + CX + P + T)&lt;/math&gt;

Wherein color harmony is a function (''f'') of the interaction between color/s (Col 1, 2, 3, …, ''n'') and the factors that influence positive aesthetic response to color: individual differences (''ID'') such as age, gender, personality and affective state; cultural experiences (''CE''), the prevailing context (''CX'') which includes setting and ambient lighting; intervening perceptual effects (''P'') and the effects of time (''T'') in terms of prevailing social trends.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2010). "Color harmony revisited". ''Color Research and Application'', 35 (4), pp. 267–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. Göttingen, 1775, plate III.jpg|thumb|Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. Göttingen, 1775, plate III.]]

In addition, given that humans can perceive over 2.8 million different hues,&lt;ref&gt;Pointer, M. R. &amp; Attridge, G.G. (1998). "The number of discernible colors". ''Color Research and Application'', 23 (1), pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that the number of possible color combinations is virtually infinite thereby implying that predictive color harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound.&lt;ref&gt;Hard, A. &amp; Sivik, L. (2001). "A theory of colors in combination – A descriptive model related to the NCS color-order system". ''Color Research and Application'', 26 (1), pp. 4–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, many color theorists have devised formulae, principles or guidelines for color combination with the aim being to predict or specify positive aesthetic response or "color harmony". 

Color wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination principles or guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as "color harmony"; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines (or formulas) suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as "simple harmonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color Harmonies|last=Garau|first=Augusto|publisher=University of Chicago press|year=1993|isbn=0226281965|location=|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, split complementary color schemes usually depict a modified complementary pair, with instead of the "true" second color being chosen, a range of analogous hues around it are chosen, i.e. the split complements of red are blue-green and yellow-green. A triadic color scheme adopts any three colors approximately equidistant around a color wheel model. Feisner and Mahnke are among a number of authors who provide color combination guidelines in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Feisner, E. A. (2000). ''Colour: How to use colour in art and design''. London: Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahnke, F. (1996). ''Color, environment and human response''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- the above paragraph (and frankly this whole section) is absurdly vague.  we should get some sources about psychological research with color, and attribute controversial subjective statements to particular authors, instead of presenting them as fact. --&gt;

[[File:020 schiffermueller1.jpg|thumb|Ignaz Schiffermüller, Versuch eines Farbensystems (Vienna, 1772), plate I.]]

Color combination formulae and principles may provide some guidance but have limited practical application. This is because of the influence of contextual, perceptual and temporal factors which will influence how color/s are perceived in any given situation, setting or context. Such formulae and principles may be useful in fashion, interior and graphic design, but much depends on the tastes, lifestyle and cultural norms of the viewer or consumer.

As early as the ancient Greek philosophers, many theorists have devised color associations and linked particular connotative meanings to specific colors. However, connotative color associations and color symbolism tends to be culture-bound and may also vary across different contexts and circumstances. For example, red has many different connotative and symbolic meanings from exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic and feminine; to a symbol of good luck; and also acts as a signal of danger. Such color associations tend to be learned and do not necessarily hold irrespective of individual and cultural differences or contextual, temporal or perceptual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If it's Purple, Someone's Gonna Die|first=Patti|last=Bellantoni|publisher=[[Elsevier]], [[Focal Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-240-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that while color symbolism and color associations exist, their existence does not provide evidential support for color psychology or claims that color has therapeutic properties.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2010). "Colour psychology and colour therapy: Caveat emptor". ''Color Research and Application''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulae ===
There are tried and true formulae for finding colour harmony. To use these formulas all that is needed is to choose a section (or sections) of the color wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GCFLearnFree.org|title=Beginning Graphic Design: Color|date=2016-10-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LLXnUdUIc&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monochromatic ====
The monochromatic formula chooses only one color (or hue). Variations of the color are created by changing the value and saturation of the color. Since only one hue is used, the color and its variations are guaranteed to work.

== Current status ==

Colour theory has not developed an explicit explanation of how specific media affect color appearance: colors have always been defined in the abstract, and whether the colors were [[ink]]s or [[paint]]s, [[oil paint|oil]]s or [[watercolor painting|watercolor]]s, [[reversal film|transparencies]] or reflecting [[photographic printing|print]]s, [[computer display]]s or [[movie theater]]s, was not considered especially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/renaissance.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Albers]] investigated the effects of relative contrast and color saturation on the illusion of transparency, but this is an exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interaction of Color. Revised and Expanded Edition|first=Josef|last=Albers|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11595-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comics Code Authority''' ('''CCA''') was formed in 1954 by the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] as an alternative to government regulation, to allow the comic publishers to self-regulate the content of [[American comic book|comic books in the United States]]. Its code, commonly called "the Comics Code", lasted until the early 21st century. Many have linked the CCA's formation to a series of Senate hearings and the publication of psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]''.

Members submitted comics to the CCA, which screened them for adherence to its Code, then authorized the use of their seal on the cover if the book was found to be in compliance. At the height of its influence, it was a ''[[de facto]]'' [[censorship|censor]] for the U.S. comic book industry.

By the early 2000s, publishers bypassed the CCA and [[Marvel Comics]] abandoned it in 2001. By 2010, only three major publishers still adhered to it: [[DC Comics]], [[Archie Comics]], and [[Bongo Comics]]. Bongo broke with the CCA in 2010. DC and Archie followed in January 2011, rendering the Code completely defunct.

== Founding ==
The [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] (CMAA) was formed in September 1954 in response to a widespread public concern over gory and horrific comic-book content.&lt;ref name=time /&gt; It named New York Magistrate Charles F. Murphy, 44, a specialist in [[juvenile delinquency]], to head the organization and devise a self-policing "code of ethics and standards" for the industry.&lt;ref name=time /&gt; He established the Comics Code Authority (CCA), basing its code upon the largely unenforced code drafted by the [[Association of Comics Magazine Publishers]] in 1948, which in turn had been modeled loosely after the 1930 Hollywood [[Production Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America|year=2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York, NY|pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This code banned graphic depictions of [[violence]] and [[Graphic violence|gore]] in [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror comics]], as well as the [[sexual innuendo]] of what aficionados refer to as "[[good girl art]]". [[Fredric Wertham]]'s 1954 book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' had rallied opposition to this type of material in comics, arguing that it was harmful to the children who made up a large segment of the comic book audience. The [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency|Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] hearings in 1954, which focused specifically on comic books, had many publishers concerned about government regulation, prompting them to form a self-regulatory body instead.

Before the CCA was adopted, some cities already had organized public burnings and bans on comic books.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Matthew J. ''Secret Identity Crisis: Comic Books and the Unmasking of Cold War America'' (Continuum, 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-8264-2998-8}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The city councils of [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], passed ordinances banning crime and horror comics, although an attempt by [[Los Angeles County]], [[California]] was deemed unconstitutional by the courts.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820350,00.html "The Press: Horror on the Newsstands"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 27, 1954. [https://www.webcitation.org/5w9r9k7nU?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820350-1,00.html WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the previous code, the CCA prohibited the presentation of "policemen, judges, government officials, and respected institutions … in such a way as to create disrespect for established authority." But it added the requirements that "in every instance good shall triumph over evil" and discouraged "instances of law enforcement officers dying as a result of a criminal's activities." Specific restrictions were placed on the portrayal of [[kidnapping]] and [[concealed weapon]]s. Depictions of "excessive violence" were forbidden, as were "lurid, unsavory, gruesome illustrations." [[Vampire]]s, [[werewolves]], [[ghoul]]s and [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]] could not be portrayed. In addition, comics could not use the words ''horror'' or ''terror'' in their titles. The use of the word ''crime'' was subject to numerous restrictions. Where the previous code had condemned the publication of "sexy, wanton comics," the CCA was much more precise: depictions of "sex perversion", "sexual abnormalities", and "illicit sex relations" as well as [[seduction]], [[rape]], [[Sadomasochism|sadism, and masochism]] were specifically forbidden. In words echoing the [[Hollywood Production Code]], love stories were enjoined to emphasize the "sanctity of marriage" and those portraying scenes of passion were advised to avoid stimulating "lower and baser emotions."

In his introduction to ''Archie Americana Series Best of the Fifties'', editor Victor Gorelick reminisced about the Code, writing, "My first assignment, as a new art assistant, was to remove cleavages and lift up low cut blouses on [[Katy Keene]]."&lt;ref name=americanap&gt;{{cite book|title=Archie Americana Series Best of the Fifties Volume 2 | year=1992 | page = 4 | publisher=Archie Comic Publications | chapter = Introduction | first = Victor | last =  Gorelick}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote of Archie artist  [[Harry Lucey]] that, "His sometimes suggestive storytelling – and he was one of the best – almost cost him his job.  When his pencilled stories came in, the characters were dressed on one page only.  The inker, a woman by the name of [[Terry Szenics]], would have to clothe them on the remaining pages."&lt;ref&gt;Gorelick, page ?&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the CCA had no official control over publishers, most distributors refused to carry comics that did not carry the seal.&lt;ref&gt;Silberkeilt, Michael, cited in Costello, page ?&lt;/ref&gt; However, two major publishers of comics – [[Dell Comics]] and [[Gold Key Comics]] – did not display the seal because their output was subject to a higher authority: their licensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Arndt |first= Richard J |date=October 23, 2016 |title=From Dell to Gold Key to King - with the New York Times in Between |url=https://issuu.com/twomorrows/docs/alterego144preview|magazine=Alter Ego #141 |location= |publisher= TwoMorrows|access-date=December 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and enforcement ===
Some publishers thrived under these restrictions, while others adapted by canceling titles and focusing on Code-approved content; still others went out of business. In practice, the negative effect for not having CCA approval was lack of distribution from comic book wholesalers, who, as one historian observed, "served as the enforcement arm of the Comics Code Authority by agreeing to handle only those comics with the seal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cbldf.org/comics-code-history-the-seal-of-approval/ | title = Comics Code History: The Seal of Approval | first = Dr. Amy Kiste | last = Nyberg | publisher = [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]] | date = n.d. | accessdate = January 17, 2013 | archivedate = October 1, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111001032230/http://cbldf.org/comics-code-history-the-seal-of-approval/ | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publisher [[William Gaines]] believed that clauses forbidding the words "crime", "horror", and "terror" in comic book titles had been deliberately aimed at his own best-selling titles ''[[Crime SuspenStories]]'', ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'', and ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, F: "The Mad World of William M. Gaines", pages 112–114, Lyle Stuart, Inc, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"An Interview With William M. Gaines", Comics Journal #83 pages 76–78, Fantagraphics, Inc, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;   These restrictions, as well as those banning vampires, werewolves, and zombies, helped make [[EC Comics]] unprofitable; all of its titles except ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' were canceled in the year following the CCA's introduction, and attempts by EC to launch Code-friendly replacement titles were unsuccessful.  ''Mad'' itself survived because Gaines had converted the publication to a magazine format, to which the Code did not apply.

Wertham dismissed the Code as an inadequate half-measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= February 5, 1955|title=Whip, Knife, Shown as 'Comics' Lures|first= Emma |last=Harrison|page= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comics analyst [[Scott McCloud]], on the other hand, later commented that it was as if, in drawing up the code, "the list of requirements a film needs to receive a G rating was doubled, and there were no other acceptable ratings!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCloud |first1=Scott |authorlink1=Scott McCloud | title=Reinventing Comics: How Imagination and Technology Are Revolutionizing an Art Form |year=2000 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0-06-095350-0 |oclc=44654496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Judgment Day" ===
In one early confrontation between a comic-book publisher and Code authorities, [[EC Comics]]' William Gaines reprinted the story "[[EC Comics#"Judgment Day"|Judgment Day]]", from the pre-Code ''[[Weird Fantasy]]'' #18 (April 1953), in ''[[Incredible Science Fiction]]'' #33 (Feb. 1956).&lt;ref name="Newfangles"&gt;[[Maggie Thompson|Thompson, Don &amp; Maggie]], "Crack in the Code", ''Newfangles'' #44, February 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The reprint was a replacement for a Code-disapproved story – "An Eye for an Eye", drawn by Angelo Torres&lt;ref name=gcdisf /&gt; – but was itself also objected to because of the central character being [[Black people|black]].&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; The story, by writer [[Al Feldstein]] and artist [[Joe Orlando]],&lt;ref name=gcdisf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/12592/#106097|title=GCD :: Issue :: Incredible Science Fiction #33|work=comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an allegory against [[racism|race prejudice]], which point was necessarily nullified if the lead character was not black.&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; Following an order by Code administrator Judge Charles Murphy to change the final panel, which depicted a black astronaut, Gaines engaged in a heated dispute with Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Digby. ''Tales from the Crypt: The Official Archives'' (St. Martin's Press, New York, NY 1996) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He threatened to inform the press of Murphy's objection to the story if they did not give the issue the Code Seal, causing Murphy to reverse his initial decision and allow the story to run.&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; Soon after, however, facing the severe restrictions placed upon his comics by the CCA, and with his "[[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Direction|New Direction]]" titles floundering, Gaines quit comic book publishing to concentrate on ''Mad''.&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt;

== 1960s–1970s ==

=== Underground comics ===
In the late 1960s, the [[underground comics]] scene arose, with artists such as [[Robert Crumb]] creating comics that delved into graphic subject matter banned by the Code. Since these comics were distributed largely through unconventional channels, such as [[head shop]]s, they were able to skirt the problem of mainstream distributors who were wary of carrying non-CCA-approved comics.  This allowed underground comics to achieve moderate success without CCA approval.

=== "Wolfman" and credits ===

Writer [[Marv Wolfman]]'s name was briefly a point of contention between DC Comics and the CCA.  In the supernatural-mystery anthology ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'' #83 (Jan. 1970), the book's host introduces the story "The Stuff that Dreams are Made of" as one told to him by "a wandering wolfman". (All-capitals comics lettering made no distinction between "wolfman" and "Wolfman".) The CCA rejected the story and flagged the "wolfman" reference as a violation. Fellow writer [[Gerry Conway]] explained to the CCA that the story's author was in fact named Wolfman, and asked whether it would still be in violation if that were clearly stated. The CCA agreed that it would not be, as long as Wolfman received a writer's credit on the first page of the story; this led to DC beginning to credit creators in its supernatural-mystery anthologies.&lt;ref name=cbr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/06/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-119/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=September 6, 2007 |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed |number=119 |first=Brian |last=Cronin |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719015214/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/06/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-119/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Updating the Code ===
The Code was revised a number of times during 1971, initially on January 28, 1971, to allow for, among other things, the sometimes "sympathetic depiction of criminal behavior... [and] corruption among public officials" ("as long as it is portrayed as exceptional and the culprit is punished"&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt;) as well as permitting some criminal activities to kill law-enforcement officers and the "suggestion but not portrayal of seduction."&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; Also newly allowed were "vampires, ghouls and werewolves... when handled in the classic tradition such as [[Frankenstein]], [[Dracula]], and other high calibre literary works written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Saki]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]] and other respected authors whose works are read in schools around the world".&lt;!--quote corrected to match the source as linked – I can't tell whether someone's "corrected" the grammar along the way...--&gt; Zombies, lacking the requisite "literary" background, remained taboo. To get around this restriction, Marvel in the mid-1970s called the apparently deceased, mind-controlled followers of various Haitian supervillains "[[zuvembie]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aushenker|first=Michael |title=Disposable Heroes|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=36|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice carried over to Marvel's superhero line: in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', when the reanimated superhero [[Wonder Man]] returns from the dead, he is referred to as a "zuvembie".&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Gerry (writer). "At Last: The Decision!” ''Avengers'' #151 (September 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; DC comics published their own zombie story in [[Swamp Thing]] #16 (May 1975), where the deceased rise from their graves, while a soul-devouring demon appears in Swamp Thing #15 (April 1975).

Around this time, the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] approached [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] to do a story about drug abuse.&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; Lee agreed and wrote a three-part ''[[Spider-Man]]'' story, portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. While the Code did not specifically forbid depictions of drugs, a general clause prohibited "All elements or techniques not specifically mentioned herein, but which are contrary to the spirit and intent of the code, and are considered violations of good taste or decency".&lt;ref name=cronin /&gt; The CCA had approved at least one previous story involving drugs, the premiere of [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #205 (Oct. 1967), which clearly depicted the title character fighting [[opium]] smugglers.&lt;ref name=cronin&gt;Cronin, Brian. [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/09/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-226/ "Comic Legend: ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' #85 was the first Comics Code approved story involving drugs"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/648Tt2H5e?url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/09/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-226/ |date=2011-12-23 }}, ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'', "Comic Book Legends Revealed" #226 (column), September 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Code administrator Leonard Darvin "was ill" at the time of the Spider-Man story,&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; and acting administrator [[John L. Goldwater]] (publisher of [[Archie Comics]]) refused to grant Code approval because of the depiction of narcotics being used, regardless of the context,&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; whereas the ''Deadman'' story had depicted only a wholesale business transaction.&lt;ref name=cronin /&gt;

Confident that the original government request would give him credibility, and with the approval of his publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee ran the story in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96–98 (May–July 1971), without CCA approval. The storyline was well received, and the CCA's argument for denying approval was deemed counterproductive. "That was the only big issue that we had" &lt;!--do not change someone's verbatim quote, which is "That was the only big issue that we had." See the cited, linked interview--&gt; with the Code, Lee recalled in a 1998 interview:

{{quote|text=I could understand them; they were like lawyers, people who take things literally and technically. The Code mentioned that you mustn't mention drugs and, according to their rules, they were right. So I didn't even get mad at them then. I said, 'Screw it' and just took the Code seal off for those three issues. Then we went back to the Code again. I never thought about the Code when I was writing a story, because basically I never wanted to do anything that was to my mind too violent or too sexy. I was aware that young people were reading these books, and had there not been a Code, I don't think that I would have done the stories any differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html |title=Stan the Man &amp; Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas |work=[[Comic Book Artist]] |issue=2 |date=Summer 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lHwfKOI2?url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html |archivedate=November 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee and Marvel drew criticism from DC head [[Carmine Infantino]] "for defying the code", stating that DC will not "do any drug stories unless the code is changed".&lt;ref name="Newfangles" /&gt; As a result of publicity surrounding the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]]'s sanctioning of the storyline, however, the CCA revised the Code to permit the depiction of "narcotics or drug addiction" if presented "as a vicious habit". DC itself broached the topic in the Code-approved ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Green Arrow]]'' #85 (Sept. 1971), with writer [[Denny O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] beginning a story arc involving Green Arrow's teen sidekick [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] as a [[heroin]] addict. A cover line read, "DC attacks youth's greatest problem... Drugs!"&lt;ref name=cronin /&gt;

== 1980s–2010s ==
By the 1980s, greater depiction of violence had become acceptable. For example, [[Moon Knight]] #21 (July. 1982) encounters zombies, and ''[[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]]'s [[House of Mystery]]'' #2 (Feb. 1986) contained numerous [[decapitation]]s but was still Code-approved.

A late adopter of the code was [[Now Comics]], which began displaying the Code seal on titles released in the spring of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Now's ''[[Speed Buggy]]'' title began displaying the seal as of its 20th issue, cover-dated May 1989: [http://www.comics.org/issue/277245 Grand Comics Database entry], accessed Nov. 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bongo Comics]], established in 1993 primarily to publish comics based upon ''[[The Simpsons]]'' television series, also chose to display the seal.

=== Abandonment ===
By the 2000s, advertisers no longer made decisions to advertise based on the appearance of the stamp.&lt;ref name=defunct /&gt; Most new publishers to emerge during this time did not join the CCA, regardless of whether their content conformed to its standards.&lt;ref name=defunct&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/comics-code-authority-defunct-since-2009-110124.html |title=The Comics Code Authority – Defunct Since 2009? |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=January 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9t7DXvg?url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/comics-code-authority-defunct-since-2009-110124.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DC Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], and other CCA sponsors began publishing comics intended for adult audiences, without the CCA seal, and comics labeled for "mature readers" under imprints such as DC's [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] and Marvel's [[Epic Comics]], and [[DC Comics]] imprints [[Helix (comics)|Helix]] and [[WildStorm]] were not submitted to the CCA.

In 2001, Marvel Comics withdrew from the CCA in favor of its own [[Marvel Rating System]] designating appropriate age groups; in 2010 [[Bongo Comics]] discontinued using the Code without any announcements regarding its abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Rich. [http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/01/21/bongo-dropped-comics-code-a-year-ago-and-no-one-noticed/ "Bongo Dropped Comics Code A Year Ago – And No One Noticed"], BleedingCool.com, January 21, 2011.

The CMAA, at some point in the 2000s, was managed by the trade-organization management firm the Kellen Company, which ceased its involvement in 2009. In 2010, some publishers, including Archie, placed the seal on its comics without submitting them to the CMAA. Archie Comics President Mike Pellerito stated that the code did not affect his company the way that it did others as "we aren't about to start stuffing [[Women in Refrigerators|bodies into refrigerators]]".&lt;ref name=defunct /&gt;

In January 2011, DC Comics announced that it would discontinue participation, adopting a rating system similar to Marvel's.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee, Jim]]. [http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/01/20/from-the-co-publishers/ "From the Co-Publishers"], "The Source" (column), [[DC Comics]], January 20, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/5w9tg57jI?url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/01/20/from-the-co-publishers/ WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; The company noted that it submitted comics for approval through December 2010, but would not say to whom they were submitted.&lt;ref name=defunct /&gt; A day later, [[Archie Comics]], the only other publisher still participating in the Code, announced it also was discontinuing it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/archie-drops-CCA-in-february-110121.html |title=Archie Dropping Comics Code Authority Seal in February |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |date=January 21, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9rtZDZ0?url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/archie-drops-CCA-in-february-110121.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering the Code defunct.

The [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]] acquired, from the defunct CMAA, the  [[intellectual property right]]s to the Comics Code seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbldf.org/homepage/cbldf-receives-comics-code-authority-seal-of-approval/ |title=CBLDF Receives Comics Code Authority Seal of Approval|date=September 29, 2011|publisher=[[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]] [[press release]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111115000000/http://cbldf.org/homepage/cbldf-receives-comics-code-authority-seal-of-approval/ | archivedate=November 15, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">'''Constantin Dimitrescu-Iași''' (November 25, 1849&amp;ndash;April 16, 1923) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n philosopher, sociologist and pedagogue.

==Biography==
Born in [[Iași]], his father was the magistrate Dimitrie Dimitrescu. He attended primary school in his native city from 1856 to 1860, followed by high school from 1860 to 1867. His classmates there included [[Alexandru Lambrior]], [[George Panu]] and [[Calistrat Hogaș]]. From 1867 to 1869, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of [[Iași University]], and at the same time worked as a substitute Latin teacher. From 1869 to 1870, Dimitrescu-Iași taught at [[Botoșani]]. He again taught at Iași from 1870 to 1872, continuing his university studies in the process. From 1872 to 1875, he was a teacher in [[Bârlad]]. He then went to Germany to study at the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] (1875-1876) and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (1876-1877). From 1879 to 1885, he taught aesthetics, history of philosophy, logic, psychology and pedagogy at Iași University.&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt;

In 1885, Dimitrescu-Iași transferred to [[Bucharest University]], where he taught history of ancient and modern philosophy, ethics and aesthetics until his retirement in 1919. An inspector general with the [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]], he was also director of the Iași higher normal school, of the [[Central University Library, Bucharest|Bucharest University Library]] (1898-1910) and of the pedagogic seminary run by the university (1899-1919). He served as rector of Bucharest University for twelve years,&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt; from October 1898 to January 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://filosofie.unibuc.ro/istoric/ Istoric] at the Bucharest University Philosophy Faculty site&lt;/ref&gt; Although he joined ''[[Junimea]]'' in 1878, Dimitrescu-Iași did not endorse its political orientation, indeed condemning its positions in a series of articles that appeared in ''Drapelul'' and ''Democrația'' from 1897 to 1898. Dimitrescu-Iași led ''Revista pedagogică'' magazine from 1891 to 1898 and was quite familiar with the principles of modern pedagogy.&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt; A close associate of [[Spiru Haret]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://150.uaic.ro/personalitati/psihologie-si-stiinte-ale-educatiei/constantin-dimitrescu/ Constantin Dimitrescu-Iaşi (1849-1923)] at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University site&lt;/ref&gt; he made a substantial contribution to the 1898 law for the reform of secondary and higher education. He died in [[Turnu Severin]].&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt;

==Views==
His philosophical outlook was deeply influenced by the European positivism and evolutionism of the 19th century's second half, from which he adopted numerous ideas, sometimes uncritically. Dimitrescu-Iași considered that people were machines in motion, mere complexes of physiological phenomena. An adherent of a [[monism]] tinged with materialism, he believed in the unity of matter and spirit and advocated an ethics based on scientific data. He was the first to teach sociology in Romania; his courses were based on [[Darwinist]] arguments. In his teaching, he helped circulate certain socialist ideas, but was against their practical application. He wrote several studies on the [[sociology of literature]] (''Recenzentul''; ''Spiritul democratic în literatură, arte, știință'') that did not consistently apply rigorous argumentation.&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt;

In the field of aesthetics, Dimitrescu-Iași attempted to reconcile positivism and evolutionism with the ideas of Romantic German philosophy, starting from [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]'s formalism, of which he considered himself a disciple. He set forth his ideas in ''Der Schönheitsbegriff'' ("The Concept of the Beautiful"), which he partly translated in 1895 in ''România literară și științifică'', as well as in several articles that appeared under the pen name Faust in the newspapers ''Dreptatea'' (1896), ''Drapelul'' and ''Democrația'' (1896-1898). He played an important role in leading Romanian aesthetics toward a more precise understanding of the role and function of art in society. Emphasizing the importance of the natural sciences for aesthetics, he tended to base his opinions on the experimental sciences. He believed that beauty could be explained by experimental methods working together with psychology, particularly those of [[Völkerpsychologie]]. Using Herbart's opinions and the experimental findings of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Fechner]], [[Adolf Zeising]], [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer]] and [[Robert von Zimmermann]], he distinguished between two aspects of beauty (one purely formal and objective, the other subjective), and theorized that their coming into harmony defined beauty's essence.&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt;

For Dimitrescu-Iași, poetic beauty was purely subjective, based on imagination and feeling; the term "beauty" in this case was merely a convention, and the material itself comprised its imagery. But poetic creations could only be considered beautiful through the lens of formal relations between images, the only ones which defined their originality. The artist was seen as a superior being in terms of physiological development, giving rise to the notion of "dynasties of talent". However, these are influenced by their natural and social surroundings, which explains the appearance of creative individuals under democratic conditions.&lt;ref name="c279"/&gt;

His view of literary criticism was that the discipline needed to avoid a mechanical application of aesthetic theories, instead explaining the origin, development and dissipation of literary trends. By adhering to objectivity, it forms judgments based not on the value of the work's subject, but on the originality of formal relations and the author's sincerity. This is because in art, beauty is equivalent to truth, and is more thoroughly explained by the laws of emotional life. Some of his opinions allowed him to understand and sympathize with many of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]'s principles, whom he assisted in his journalistic activity.&lt;ref name="c279"&gt;Stănuța Crețu, ''Dicționarul literaturii române de la origini pînă la 1900'', p. 485. Bucharest: Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste România, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10198">[[File:Opera Dardanella ad p15.JPG|thumb|300px|Advertisement for a Dardanella performance, 1929]]
'''Dardanella''' was a touring theatre company from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia) established by Willy A. Piedro in 1926. Arising from a background of [[musical theatre]], the troupe focused on realistic stories, both adaptations of foreign works and original [[stage play]]s about life in the Indies. Starring Dewi Dja' and Tan Tjeng Bok, the troupe performed original works by Piedro and [[Andjar Asmara]]. Popular both in the Indies and abroad, Dardanella dissolved during an international tour after 1936. Several of its members later went into film.

==Background==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the theatre in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia) generally emphasised music, with the dialogue being sung. These early performances were given different names depending on their type, such as ''[[bangsawan]]'' and ''komedi stambul''. In the mid-1920s companies in the country began adapting more European stylings, with an emphasis on spoken dialogue and a reduction in the amount of music used during the performance; troupes using this new format referred to the genre as ''[[toneel]]'', an adaptation of the Dutch word for theatre.{{sfn|Cohen|2003|pp=215–217}}{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=338}}

==Career==
[[File:Dr Samsi advertisement, Doenia Film October 1931 p14.jpg|thumb|300px|Advertisement for the premiere of ''Dr Samsi''; the play became Dardanella's most popular.]]
Dardanella was established by Willy A. Piedro (born Willy Klimanoff), a [[Penang]]-born actor of Russian descent. His [[Native Indonesians|native]] wife, Dewi Dja' (also spelled Devi), joined as an actor; another early member was Tan Tjeng Bok, an ethnic Chinese ''[[keroncong]]'' singer who was known for his sword work, Ferry Kock, and [[Astaman]];{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=14, 17}} many of these actors had been in other troupes before.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=348}} The troupe gave their first performance on 21&amp;nbsp;June 1926 in [[Sidoarjo]], [[East Java]].{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} They were advertised as a ''toneel'' troupe to indicate their affinity for European stage traditions.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=338}}

Initially the troupe's works were written by Piedro. He adapted numerous [[Hollywood]] productions for the stage, including ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1921), ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924), and ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' (1925). These adaptations generally starred Tan Tjeng Bok, who earned the nickname "[[Douglas Fairbanks]] of [[Java]]" ("{{lang|nl|Douglas Fairbanks van Java}}") for his work.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=14, 17}} Piedro also wrote his own stage plays based on everyday life in the Indies (mostly in Java), such as ''Roos van Serang'', ''Fatima'', and ''North of Borneo''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=14, 17}}

The group attracted the theatre and film critic [[Andjar Asmara]] in November 1930; he left his publication ''Doenia Film'' to join as he believed the troupe dedicated to the betterment of the ''toneel'' as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests like the earlier ''stambul'' troupes.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=6, 14, 20}} Andjar's wife [[Ratna Asmara|Ratna]] also joined.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} He numerous wrote stage plays for the troupe, generally dealing with more serious and mature topics than Piedro; these were in part aimed at the growing [[intellectualism|intellectual]] native population.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=6, 14, 20}}

Dardanella began losing its popularity in the early 1930s.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=24}} In 1936 Dardanella went to India to record a film adaptation of Andjar's ''Dr Samsi'', which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous [[Indo people|Indo]] discovered he had an illegitimate child.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=136–138}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=23}} This plan was not brought to fruition, and afterwards Piedro, Dja', and some thirty-odd players went to the United States via Egypt and Europe, soon disbanding.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}}{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}} Meanwhile, Andjar and Ratna Asmara returned to the Indies, establishing their own troupe named Bollero with [[Bachtiar Effendi]], who had joined Dardanella shortly before its dissolution.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}}{{sfn|Said|1982|p=138}}

In the 1940s numerous former Dardanella actors and personnel entered the film industry, including Andjar and Ratna Asmara,{{sfn|Said|1982|p=138}} as well as Ferry Kock and his wife Dewi Mada.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=204}} Several stage plays used by the troupe were also adapted to film, including ''[[Rentjong Atjeh]]'' (''Rencong of Aceh''; 1940),{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=210}} and ''[[Gadis Desa]]'' (''Maiden from the Village''; 1949).{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}}

==Style and reception==
Their plays were presented in [[Malay language|Malay]] and often adapted works by other writers.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Some works, such as those by [[Victor Ido]], were translated from the original when adapted for stage.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Dardanella and its contemporary rival [[Miss Riboet's Orion]]&amp;nbsp;– established a year before&amp;nbsp;– were some of the first travelling troupes in the Indies to use original works; earlier ''[[bangsawan]]'' and ''stambul'' troupes had used broad outlines of foreign works.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=6}}{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}} The two were the most popular troupes from the Indies of their time.{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}}

A review in ''[[The Straits Times]]'' following a performance of ''The Worshippers of Papua'' in 1935 found the troupe's performances comparable to those of European theatrical acts and notes that large European audiences attended the shows. The reviewer described the show as "entertaining [audiences] in a way they had never been entertained before".{{sfn|The Straits Times 1935, Patrons}}

The Indonesian cultural critic Hairus Salim HS notes that Dardanella's use of Malay in a time of [[Indonesian National Awakening|increased nationalism]] worked to unite the different peoples of the [[Indonesian archipelago|archipelago]] with a single language; he also cites the diverse cultural background of its players as presenting a single but varied Indonesian identity.{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4914">The '''Death of the Virgin Mary of Košátky''' is a [[Bohemia]]n panel painting from the period around 1340-1350.
[[File:Dormition of the Virgin from Košátky.JPG|thumb|400 px|Dormition of the Virgin from Košátky]]

== History of the painting ==
The picture was discovered in 1922 in the Chapel of the Black Madonna at [[Košátky]] Castle near [[Mladá Boleslav]] and loaned to the Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of Art. It originally belonged to the Krabice of Veitmile family that purchased [[Košátky]] fortress in 1420, and its actual owner was in all likelihood Beneš Krabice of Veitmile (Benesch von Weitmühl), the chronicler and director of the construction of [[St Vitus Cathedral]]. From this family, the picture came into the Kolowrat family through marriage. The Kolowrats owned it until 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Matějček A, 1950, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The picture is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/dormition-of-the-virgin-33412 Dormition of the Virgin, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and context ==
The picture is painted in tempera on an oak panel covered with stretched canvas. A preparatory drawing is etched into the chalk base and its contours outlined in black.

The work is a highly advanced example of the Gothic style, combining elements of Northern European Gothic and the strong influence of Italian, more specifically [[Sienese School|Sienese painting]]. It was painted by an unknown master during the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] and belongs to the broader circle of paintings executed in a similar way, such as the [[Master of Vyšší Brod|Vyšší Brod Altarpiece]], the [[Kaufmann Crucifixion]] and the panels of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum|Morgan Collection]] (the ''Small Morgan Panels''). The panel was probably originally the wing of a diptych, the second part of which was the [[Holy Trinity of Wrocław|Wrocław Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pešina J, 1976, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the quality of its execution, the picture ranks among the finest known works dating from the 14th century. It is at the same time the most Italian work of the entire [[Bohemia]]n school.&lt;ref&gt;Kutal J, 1972, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of space reveals that the artist was acquainted with the central [[Sienese School|Italian painting of Siena]] (namely that of [[Simone Martini]]). Its composition is monumental and complex, while the facial type is derived from the Venetian school (namely Paolo di Venezia). A peculiar aspect of the work is the figure of [[Jesus|Christ]] (holding the soul of Mary), who doesn’t ascend in a [[Aureola|mandorla]] above the group but stands among the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]]. The mandorla is substituted by small stylised clouds around the figure.

The theme of depicting the [[Death of the Virgin|death of the Virgin Mary]] itself is Byzantine in origin. In [[Bohemia]], the oldest depiction of this kind (the Koímēsis) is a miniature on [[parchment]] inserted into the relic panels of a St George reliquary dating from 1306. Later works then gradually abandon the Byzantine scheme, replacing it with the motif of ''Last Prayer of the Virgin Mary''. This was first recorded in the Czech lands from the 1360s.&lt;ref&gt;Pazderová J, 2014, pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dysgeusia''', also known as '''parageusia''', is a distortion of the sense of taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with [[ageusia]], which is the complete lack of taste, and [[hypogeusia]], which is a decrease in taste sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel K. Feske and Martin A. Samuels, ''Office Practice of Neurology'' 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Elsevier Science, 2003) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary [[symptom]]. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and [[diagnosis]] is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other [[sensory systems]]. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.

==Symptoms==

The alterations in the sense of [[taste]], usually a metallic taste, and sometimes [[Olfaction|smell]] are the only symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=HJ|last2=Ishii|first2=EK|last3=MacTurk|first3=RH|title=Age-related changes in the prevalence of smell/taste problems among the United States adult population. Results of the 1994 disability supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 November 1998|volume=855|pages=716–22|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb10650.x|pmid=9929676|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230764|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration in the sense of taste is due to [[gum disease]], [[dental plaque]], a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a [[Common cold|cold]], the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if [[lesions]] are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.

==Causes==

===Chemotherapy===

A major cause of dysgeusia is [[chemotherapy]] for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in [[oral mucositis]], oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of [[inflammation]] of the mouth, along with sores and [[mouth ulcer|ulcers]] in the tissues.&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raber-Durlacher|first1=Judith E.|last2=Barasch|first2=Andrei|last3=Peterson|first3=Douglas E.|last4=Lalla|first4=Rajesh V.|last5=Schubert|first5=Mark M.|last6=Fibbe|first6=Willem E.|title=Oral Complications and Management Considerations in Patients Treated with High-Dose Chemotherapy|journal=Supportive Cancer Therapy|date=July 2004|volume=1|issue=4|pages=219–229|doi=10.3816/SCT.2004.n.014|pmid=18628146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial [[organisms]] residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-[[pathogenic]] agents to cause serious infection, which may result in a decrease in [[saliva]]. In addition, patients who undergo [[radiation therapy]] also lose salivary tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid16772071"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiseman|first1=Michael|title=The treatment of oral problems in the palliative patient|journal=Journal (Canadian Dental Association)|date=June 2006|volume=72|issue=5|pages=453–8|pmid=16772071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva is an important component of the taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matsuo R | year = 2000| title = Role of saliva in the maintenance of taste sensitivity | doi = 10.1177/10454411000110020501 | journal = Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. | volume =  11| issue = 2| pages = 216–29| pmid=12002816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively.&lt;ref name=Speilman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Speilman A. L. | year = 1990| title = Interaction of Saliva and Taste | doi = 10.1177/00220345900690030101 | pmid = 2182682| journal = J Dent Res | volume =  69| issue = 3| pages = 838–843}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva.&lt;ref name=Speilman /&gt; It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have suffered from either dysgeusia or another form of taste impairment.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt; Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cisplatin]], and [[etoposide]].&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt; The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt;

===Taste buds===

Distortions in the [[taste buds]] may give rise to dysgeusia. In a study conducted by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]] of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of [[microvilli]] and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway.  Radiation to head and neck also results in direct destruction of taste buds, apart from effects of altered salivary output.&lt;ref name=Masahide /&gt;

===Zinc deficiency===

Another primary cause of dysgeusia is [[zinc]] deficiency. While the exact role of zinc in dysgeusia is unknown, it has been cited that zinc is partly responsible for the repair and production of taste buds. Zinc somehow directly or indirectly interacts with [[carbonic anhydrase VI]], influencing the concentration of gustin, which is linked to the production of taste buds.&lt;ref name=Heckman/&gt; It has also been reported that patients treated with zinc experience an elevation in [[calcium]] concentration in the saliva.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; In order to work properly, taste buds rely on calcium receptors.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;Joseph M. Bicknell, MD and Robert V. Wiggins, MD, “Taste Disorder From Zinc Deficiency After Tonsillectomy,” ''The Western Journal of Medicine'' Oct.1988: 458.&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc “is an important cofactor for [[alkaline phosphatase]], the most abundant [[enzyme]] in taste bud membranes; it is also a component of a parotid salivary protein important to the development and maintenance of normal taste buds.”&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

===Drugs===

There are also a wide variety of drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, including [[zopiclone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Limited|title=Product Information IMOVANE (zopiclone) Tablets|url=http://www.sanofi.com.au/products/aus_pi_imovane.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2014|location=ADVERSE EFFECTS|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-[[antihistamines]], such as [[azelastine]] and [[emedastine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=F. Estelle R.|title=Advances in H1-Antihistamines|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 November 2004|volume=351|issue=21|pages=2203–2217|doi=10.1056/NEJMra033121|pmid=15548781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 250 drugs affect taste.&lt;ref name=Samuel&gt;Samuel K. Feske and Martin A. Samuels, ''Office Practice of Neurology'' 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Elsevier Science, 2003) 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sodium]] channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by [[amiloride]], and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by [[antiproliferative]] drugs.&lt;ref name=Samuel /&gt; Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include [[lithium carbonate]] and [[tetracyclines]].&lt;ref name=Samuel /&gt; Drugs containing [[sulfhydryl]] groups, including [[penicillamine]] and [[captopril]], may react with zinc and cause deficiency.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; [[Metronidazole]] and [[chlorhexidine]] have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciancio|first1=Sebastian G.|title=Medications' impact on oral health|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|date=October 2004|volume=135|issue=10|pages=1440–8; quiz 1468–9|pmid=15551986|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2004.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that prevent the production of [[angiotensin II]] by inhibiting [[angiotensin converting enzyme]], [[eprosartan]] for example, have been linked to dysgeusia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castells|first1=X.|title=Drug points: Dysgeusia and burning mouth syndrome by eprosartan|journal=BMJ|date=30 November 2002|volume=325|issue=7375|pages=1277|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7375.1277|pmid=12458247|pmc=136926}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like [[Amlodipine]] also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;Pugazhenthan Thangaraju, Harmanjith Singh, Prince Kumar and Balasubramani Hariharan,"Is Dysguesia going to be a rare or a common side-effect of Amlodipine?,"''Ann Med Health Sci Res,''Mar-Apr 2014: {{PMC|4083725}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous causes===
[[Xerostomia]], also known as dry mouth syndrome, can precipitate dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the [[pons]], [[thalamus]], and [[midbrain]], all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors.&lt;ref name=RK&gt;R. K. Mal and M. A. Birchall, “Dysgeusia related to urinary obstruction from benign prostatic disease: a case control and qualitative study,” ''European Archives of Oto-Rhino Laryngology'' 24 Aug. 2005:178.&lt;/ref&gt; In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed.&lt;ref name=RK /&gt; Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, it has been observed that the areas responsible for [[urinary system]] and taste in the pons and [[cerebral cortex]] in the brain are close in proximity.&lt;ref name=RK /&gt;

Many of the causes for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of miscellaneous factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as [[gastric reflux]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman M. Mann, MD, “Management of Smell and Taste Problems,” ''Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine'' Apr. 2002: 334.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of [[pine nut]]s can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These [[pesticides]] include [[organochloride]] compounds and [[carbamate]] pesticides. Damage to the [[peripheral nerves]], along with injury to the [[chorda tympani]] branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; A surgical risk for [[laryngoscopy]] and [[tonsillectomy]] include dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; Patients who suffer from the [[burning mouth syndrome]], most likely [[menopausal]] women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Lauria, Alessandra Majorana, Monica borgna, Raffaella Lombardi, Paola Penza, Alessandro padovani, and Pierluigi Sapelli, “Trigeminal small-fiber sensory neuropathy causes burning mouth syndrome,” ''Pain'' 11 Mar. 2005: 332, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normal function===

The sense of taste is based on the detection of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have [[taste buds]], which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells at the base of the taste bud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=Joseph G|title=Within reach of an end to unnecessary bitterness?|journal=The Lancet|date=October 2000|volume=356|issue=9239|pages=1371–1372|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02836-1|pmid=11052575}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beidler|first1=L. M.|title=Renewal of cells within taste buds|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=1 November 1965|volume=27|issue=2|pages=263–272|doi=10.1083/jcb.27.2.263|citeseerx=10.1.1.281.8593}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fungiform papillae]] are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while [[circumvallate papillae]] and [[foliate papillae]] are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The [[salivary glands]] are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromley|first1=SM|title=Smell and taste disorders: a primary care approach|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 January 2000|volume=61|issue=2|pages=427–36, 438|pmid=10670508|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0115/p427.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single taste bud is composed of four different types of cells, and each taste bud has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of [[chromatin]]. Type II cells have prominent [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple [[mitochondria]] and large [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Type I, II, and III cells also contain [[synapses]]. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms [[microvilli]] at the ends.&lt;ref name=Masahide&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yasuda|first1=Masahide|last2=Tomita|first2=Hitoshi|title=Electron Microscopic Observations of Glossal Circumvallate Papillae in Dysgeusic Patients|journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica|date=8 July 2009|volume=122|issue=4|pages=122–128|doi=10.1080/00016480260046508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve [[cranial nerves]]. The [[chorda tympani]] is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the [[oral cavity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
In general, [[gustatory]] disorders are challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions are tied to the sense of [[Olfaction|smell]], the [[somatosensory system]], and the perception of [[pain]] (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deems|first1=DA|last2=Doty|first2=RL|last3=Settle|first3=RG|last4=Moore-Gillon|first4=V|last5=Shaman|first5=P|last6=Mester|first6=AF|last7=Kimmelman|first7=CP|last8=Brightman|first8=VJ|last9=Snow JB|first9=Jr|title=Smell and taste disorders, a study of 750 patients from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center|journal=Archives of Otolaryngology--head &amp; Neck Surgery|date=1 May 1991|volume=117|issue=5|pages=519–28|doi=10.1001/archotol.1991.01870170065015|pmid=2021470}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to [[olfactory]] disorders.&lt;ref name=Hummel&gt;Hummel T, Knecht M. Smell and taste disorders. In: Calhoun KH, ed. Expert Guide to Otolaryngology. Philadelphia, Pa: American College of Physicians; 2001:650-664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of dysgeusia begins with the patient being questioned about [[salivation]], swallowing, chewing, oral pain, previous [[ear infections]] (possibly indicated by hearing or balance problems), [[oral hygiene]], and stomach problems.&lt;ref name=Schiffman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Franklin H.|last2=Schiffman|first2=Susan S.|title=Taste and Smell in Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 May 1983|volume=308|issue=21|pages=1275–1279|doi=10.1056/NEJM198305263082107|pmid=6341841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial history assessment also considers the possibility of accompanying diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypothyroidism]], or [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Schiffman /&gt; A clinical examination is conducted and includes an inspection of the tongue and the oral cavity. Furthermore, the [[ear canal]] is inspected, as lesions of the [[chorda tympani]] have a predilection for this site.&lt;ref name=Schiffman /&gt;

===Gustatory testing===

In order to further classify the extent of dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the [[anterior]] and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt; In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt;

[[Sensory threshold|Threshold]] tests for [[sucrose]] (sweet), [[citric acid]] (sour), [[sodium chloride]] (salty), and [[quinine]] or [[caffeine]] (bitter) are frequently performed with natural stimuli. One of the most frequently used techniques is the "three-drop test."&lt;ref name=Ahne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahne|first1=Gabi|last2=Erras|first2=Angelo|last3=Hummel|first3=Thomas|last4=Kobal|first4=Gerd|title=Assessment of Gustatory Function by Means of Tasting Tablets|journal=The Laryngoscope|date=August 2000|volume=110|issue=8|pages=1396–1401|doi=10.1097/00005537-200008000-00033|pmid=10942148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this test, three drops of liquid are presented to the subject. One of the drops is of the taste stimulus, and the other two drops are pure water.&lt;ref name=Ahne /&gt; Threshold is defined as the concentration at which the patient identifies the taste correctly three times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ahne /&gt;

Suprathreshold tests, which provide intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, are used to assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour).&lt;ref name=Seiden&gt;Seiden, Allen M., “Taste and Smell Disorders (Rhinology &amp; Sinusology),” Thieme Publishing Group Aug. 2000: 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another [[sensory system]], such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale.&lt;ref name=Seiden /&gt; For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tones.&lt;ref name=Seiden /&gt; Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.

Other tests include identification or discrimination of common taste substances. [[Topical anesthesia]] of the tongue has been reported to be of use in the diagnosis of dysgeusia as well, since it has been shown to relieve the symptoms of dysgeusia temporarily.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt; In addition to techniques based on the administration of chemicals to the tongue, [[electrogustometry]] is frequently used. It is based on the induction of gustatory sensations by means of an anodal electrical [[direct current]]. Patients usually report sour or metallic sensations similar to those associated with touching both poles of a live battery to the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillman|first1=JA|last2=Morton|first2=RP|last3=Goldsmith|first3=D|title=Automated electrogustometry: a new paradigm for the estimation of taste detection thresholds|journal=Clinical Otolaryngology and Allied Sciences|date=April 2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=120–5|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00328.x|pmid=10816215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although electrogustometry is widely used, there seems to be a poor correlation between electrically and chemically induced sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Claire|last2=Quiñonez|first2=Carlo|last3=Nordin|first3=Steven|title=Reliability and Validity of Electrogustometry and its Application to Young and Elderly Persons|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1995|volume=20|issue=5|pages=499–503|doi=10.1093/chemse/20.5.499|pmid=8564424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic tools===

Certain diagnostic tools can also be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the [[nerve]]-to-[[brainstem]] pathways. For example, the [[blink reflex]] may be used to evaluate the integrity of the [[trigeminal nerve]]–[[Pontine nuclei|pontine brainstem]]–[[facial nerve]] pathway, which may play a role in gustatory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jääskeläinen|first1=Satu K|last2=Forssell|first2=Heli|last3=Tenovuo|first3=Olli|title=Abnormalities of the blink reflex in burning mouth syndrome|journal=Pain|date=December 1997|volume=73|issue=3|pages=455–460|doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural imaging is routinely used to investigate [[lesions]] in the taste pathway. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] allows direct visualization of the [[cranial nerves]].&lt;ref name=Lell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lell|first1=M|last2=Schmid|first2=A|last3=Stemper|first3=B|last4=Maihöfner|first4=C|last5=Heckmann|first5=JG|last6=Tomandl|first6=BF|title=Simultaneous involvement of third and sixth cranial nerve in a patient with Lyme disease|journal=Neuroradiology|date=18 December 2002|volume=45|issue=2|pages=85–7|doi=10.1007/s00234-002-0904-x|pmid=12592489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it provides significant information about the type and cause of a lesion.&lt;ref name=Lell /&gt; Analysis of [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] [[blood flow]] in the oral cavity in combination with the assessment of [[autonomous]] [[cardiovascular]] factors appears to be useful in the diagnosis of [[autonomic nervous system]] disorders in [[burning mouth syndrome]] and in patients with inborn disorders, both of which are associated with gustatory dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckmann|first1=Josef G.|last2=Hilz|first2=Max J.|last3=Hummel|first3=Thomas|last4=Popp|first4=Michael|last5=Marthol|first5=Harald|last6=Neundörfer|first6=Bernhard|last7=Heckmann|first7=Siegfried M.|title=Oral mucosal blood flow following dry ice stimulation in humans|journal=Clinical Autonomic Research|date=October 2000|volume=10|issue=5|pages=317–321|doi=10.1007/BF02281116|pmid=11198489}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cell cultures]] may also be used when fungal or bacterial infections are suspected.

In addition, the analysis of [[saliva]] should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of [[taste|taste receptors]], including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor.&lt;ref name=Matsuo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsuo|first1=R|title=Role of Saliva in the Maintenance of Taste Sensitivity|journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology &amp; Medicine|date=April 2000|volume=11|issue=2|pages=216–229|doi=10.1177/10454411000110020501|pmid=12002816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry.&lt;ref name=Matsuo /&gt; Studies have shown that [[micrograph|electron micrographs]] of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate [[pathological]] changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henkin|first1=Robert I.|title=Idiopathic Hypogeusia With Dysgeusia, Hyposmia, and Dysosmia|journal=JAMA|date=26 July 1971|volume=217|issue=4|pages=434–40|doi=10.1001/jama.1971.03190040028006|pmid=5109029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==

===Artificial saliva and pilocarpine===

Because medications have been linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important.&lt;ref name=Giudice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giudice|first1=M.|title=Taste Disturbances Linked to Drug Use: Change in Drug Therapy May Resolve Symptoms|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal / Revue des Pharmaciens du Canada|date=1 March 2006|volume=139|issue=2|pages=70–73|doi=10.1177/171516350613900208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xerostomia]], or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Patients can lessen the effects of xerostomia with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges, or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral [[pilocarpine]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits.&lt;ref name=Preetha&gt;Preetha, A. and R. Banerjee, "Comparison of Artificial Saliva Substitutes, ''Trends in Biomaterials and Artificial Organs'', Jan. 2005: 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilocarpine is a [[cholinergic]] drug meaning it has the same effects as the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]]. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the [[salivary glands]] to actively produce saliva.&lt;ref name="Medications and Drugs"&gt;"Medications and Drugs," 6 May 2004, 25 Oct. 2009, &lt;http://www.medicinenet.com/pilocarpine/article.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the [[taste buds]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt;

===Zinc deficiency===

====Zinc supplementation====

[[Image:Zinc gluconate.png|thumb|right|alt=Zinc Gluconate.|Zinc Gluconate.]]

Approximately one half of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a [[zinc deficiency]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Many medications are known to [[chelate]], or bind, [[zinc]], preventing the element from functioning properly.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, research has been conducted to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients suffering from [[idiopathic]] dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose [[placebo]].&lt;ref name=Heckman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckmann|first1=SM|last2=Hujoel|first2=P|last3=Habiger|first3=S|last4=Friess|first4=W|last5=Wichmann|first5=M|last6=Heckmann|first6=JG|last7=Hummel|first7=T|title=Zinc gluconate in the treatment of dysgeusia--a randomized clinical trial|journal=Journal of Dental Research|date=1 January 2005|volume=84|issue=1|pages=35–8|doi=10.1177/154405910508400105|pmid=15615872|url=https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/2919/heckmann_zinc_4148.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; A recommended daily oral dose of 25–100&amp;nbsp;mg appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the [[blood serum]].&lt;ref name=Heyneman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyneman|first1=Catherine A|title=Zinc Deficiency and Taste Disorders|journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=February 1996|volume=30|issue=2|pages=186–187|doi=10.1177/106002809603000215|pmid=8835055}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a sufficient amount of evidence to determine whether or not zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.&lt;ref name=Heyneman /&gt;

====Zinc infusion in chemotherapy====

It has been reported that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;Hong, Jae Hee, et al., "Taste and Odor Abnormalities in Cancer Patients," ''The Journal of Supportive Oncology'', Mar./Apr. 2009: 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt; In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment.&lt;ref name=Yamagata&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamagata|first1=T|last2=Nakamura|first2=Y|last3=Yamagata|first3=Y|last4=Nakanishi|first4=M|last5=Matsunaga|first5=K|last6=Nakanishi|first6=H|last7=Nishimoto|first7=T|last8=Minakata|first8=Y|last9=Mune|first9=M|last10=Yukawa|first10=S|title=The pilot trial of the prevention of the increase in electrical taste thresholds by zinc containing fluid infusion during chemotherapy to treat primary lung cancer|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Clinical Cancer Research : CR|date=December 2003|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557–63|pmid=15053297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations.&lt;ref name=Yamagata /&gt; A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not have an effect on the development of taste disorders in cancer patients.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the [[immune system]], and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to [[immunocompromised]] cancer patients.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.&lt;ref name=Halyard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halyard|first1=MY|title=Taste and smell alterations in cancer patients--real problems with few solutions|journal=The Journal of Supportive Oncology|date=2008|volume=7|issue=2|pages=68–9|pmid=19408460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altering drug therapy===

[[Image:Eprosartan.svg|thumb|right|alt=Eprosartan.|[[Eprosartan]].]]

The effects of drug-related dysgeusia can often be reversed by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication.&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;Bromley, Steven M., "Smell and Taste Disorders: A Primary Care Approach," American Family Physician 15 Jan. 2000, 23 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000115/427.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from [[hypertension]] was being treated with [[valsartan]].&lt;ref name=Castells&gt;Castells, Xavier, et al., "Drug Points: Dysgeusia and Burning Mouth Syndrome by Eprosartan," ''British Medical Journal'', 30 Nov. 2002: 1277.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of [[eprosartan]], an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]].&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication.&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned.&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed [[amlodipine]] in order to treat his hypertension.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadasivam|first1=Balakrishnan|last2=Jhaj|first2=Ratinder|title=Dysgeusia with amlodipine ? a case report|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=February 2007|volume=63|issue=2|pages=253|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02727.x|pmid=17274793|pmc=2000565}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; When he ran out of his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the "de-challenge" and "re-challenge" that took place in both instances.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt;

===Alpha lipoic acid===

[[Image:AlphaLipoicAcid.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Alpha Lipoic Acid.|[[Alpha Lipoic Acid]].]]

[[Alpha lipoic acid]] (ALA) is an [[antioxidant]] that is made naturally by human cells.&lt;ref name=UMMC&gt;University of Maryland Medical Center, "Alpha-lipoic Acid," 26 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/alpha-lipoic-000285.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be administered in capsules or can be found in foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast.&lt;ref name=UMMC /&gt; Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful [[free radicals]] that can cause damage to tissues and organs.&lt;ref name=UMMC /&gt; It has an important role in the [[Krebs cycle]] as a [[coenzyme]] leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular [[glutathione]], and nerve-growth factors.&lt;ref name=Femiano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Femiano|first1=F|last2=Scully|first2=C|last3=Gombos|first3=F|title=Idiopathic dysgeusia; an open trial of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) therapy|journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|date=December 2002|volume=31|issue=6|pages=625–8|doi=10.1054/ijom.2002.0276|pmid=12521319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve [[nerve conduction velocity]].&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; Because flavors are perceived by differences in [[electric potential]] through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a [[neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for [[burning mouth syndrome]] spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt;

===Managing dysgeusia===

In addition to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold in order to reduce any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using [[sialogogue]]s such as chewing sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt;

===Psychological impacts===

People who suffer from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the disorder has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake and can lead to [[weight loss]], [[malnutrition]], impaired immunity, and a decline in health.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt; Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt; Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing [[Depression (mood)|depression]], loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss.&lt;ref name=Padala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padala|first1=Kalpana P.|last2=Hinners|first2=Cheryl K.|last3=Padala|first3=Prasad R.|title=Mirtazapine Therapy for Dysgeusia in an Elderly Patient|journal=The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=14 July 2006|volume=08|issue=3|pages=178–180|doi=10.4088/PCC.v08n0310b|pmid=16912823|pmc=1540398}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult.&lt;ref name=Yamagata /&gt; Other problems that may arise include [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food.&lt;ref name=Bicknell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bicknell|first1=JM|last2=Wiggins|first2=RV|title=Taste disorder from zinc deficiency after tonsillectomy|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=October 1988|volume=149|issue=4|pages=457–60|pmid=3227690|pmc=1026505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms including [[paranoia]], [[amnesia]], cerebellar malfunction, and [[lethargy]] can also manifest when undergoing [[histidine]] treatment.&lt;ref name=Bicknell /&gt; This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.

==Future research==

Every year, more than 200,000 individuals see their physicians concerning [[chemosensory]] problems, and many more taste disturbances are never reported.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, "Taste Disorders," 25 June 2008, 23 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/smelltaste/taste.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large number of persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD /&gt; These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD /&gt; Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the [[University of Connecticut Health Center]] is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function.&lt;ref name=UCHC&gt;The University of Connecticut Health Center, "Taste and Smell: Research," 26 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.uchc.edu/uconntasteandsmell/research/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order to improve the lives of taste disorder sufferers.

'''En plein air''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ plɛn ɛːʁ}}, [[French language|French]] for outdoors, or '''plein air painting''') is the act of [[painting]] outdoors. This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look.

== History ==
[[File:Sargent MonetPainting.jpg|thumb|''[[Claude Monet]] Painting by the Edge of a Wood'' (1885) by [[John Singer Sargent]]. Oil on canvas. 54.0 &amp;times; 64.8&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Tate Gallery]], London.]]
Artists have long painted outdoors, but in the mid-19th century, working in natural light became particularly important to the [[Barbizon school]], [[Hudson River School]], and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].

In 1830, the Barbizon School in France, inspired by [[John Constable]], enabled artists like Charles-François Daubigny and Théodore Rousseau to more accurately depict the appearance of outdoor settings in various light and weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auricchio | first=Laura | date=October 2004 | title=The Transformation of Landscape Painting in France | journal=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | url= https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lafr/hd_lafr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1800s, the en plein air approach was incorporated with the impressionists’ style, and artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]], and [[Edgar Degas]] began creating their work outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Malafronte | first=Allison | date=October 2009 | title=The History of the Plein Air Movement | journal=American Artist | pages=20–24 | url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43929615/history-plein-air-movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; From France, the movement expanded to America, starting in California then moving to other American locales notable for their natural light qualities, including the Hudson River Valley in New York.

The [[Macchiaioli]] were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes. Their movement began in Florence in the late 1850s.

The [[Newlyn School]] in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/newlyn-school.htm |title=Newlyn School, Landscape Painting Artist Colony, Cornwall: History, Artists, Stanhope Forbes, Frank Bramley |publisher=Visual-arts-cork.com |date= |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of painting ''en plein air'' increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes (like those for [[toothpaste]]). Previously, painters made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry [[pigment]] powders with [[linseed oil]].

The act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/06/05/1309330/artists-who-work-en-plein-air.html |title=Artists who work 'en plein air' share their motivations: Arts |publisher=adn.com |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808223036/http://www.adn.com/2010/06/05/1309330/artists-who-work-en-plein-air.html |archivedate=8 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/landscapes/a/plein_air_paint.htm |title=Plein Air Painting - Painting Outside Plein Air |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=16 August 2010|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment and challenges ==
[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, 1898, painting Le chemin, oil on canvas, 22 x 32 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], 1898, painting ''Le chemin'', oil on canvas, 22 × 32 cm]]
It was during the mid-19th century that the ''box easel'', typically known as the ''French box easel'' or [[Easel#field|''field easel'']], was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and [[Palette (painting)|palette]] made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Invention of box/ Field easel|url = http://artmovement.weebly.com/invention-of-box-field-easel.html|website = Realism &amp; Impressionism|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a [[brief case]] and thus are easy to store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pleinair/ |title=Plein Air |publisher=PBS |date=6 August 2007|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs which can also hold a few wet painting canvases or panels within the lid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickblick.com/pochade/boxes/ ''Pochade Boxes'']&lt;/ref&gt; These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pochade box|url=http://www.artworkessentials.com|website=Artwork Essentials|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors, animals, bugs, onlookers, and environmental conditions such as weather. [[Acrylic paint]] may harden and dry quickly in warm, sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting ''en plein air'' incorporates the use of oil paint.

== Advocates ==
French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painters such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] advocated plein air painting, and much of their work was done outdoors in the diffuse light of a large white umbrella. Claude Monet was an avid en plein air artist who deduced that to seize the closeness and likeness of an outside setting at a specific moment one had to be outside to do so rather than just paint an outside setting in their studio.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F. S., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages (15th ed.), Boston, Cengage Learning, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Russia, painters such as [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Valentin Serov]], [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[I. E. Grabar]] were known for painting ''en plein air''.

But enthusiasts of plein air painting were not limited to the [[Old World]]. [[American Impressionism|American impressionists]] too, such as those of the [[Old Lyme]] school, were avid painters ''en plein air''. American impressionist painters noted for this style during this era included [[Guy Rose]], [[Robert William Wood]], Mary DeNeale Morgan, John Gamble, and [[Arthur Hill Gilbert]]. In Canada, the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and [[Tom Thomson]] are examples of ''en plein air'' advocates.

[[Image:Faux paint sample 1.jpg|right|thumb|Examples of faux paintings.]]
[[Image:zebra wood.jpg|right|thumb|Example of the faux painting of a wood design]]
'''Faux painting''' or '''faux finishing''' are terms used to describe decorative paint finishes that replicate the appearance of materials such as marble, wood or stone.&lt;ref&gt;Shekhar, R.K.C. (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLRZlNuSTMkC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=dictionary%20painting%20faux&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20painting%20faux&amp;f=false Academic Dictionary of Architecture]''. Delhi: Isha Books, p. 110. {{ISBN|9788182051850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the French word [[wikt:faux|faux]], meaning false, as these  techniques started as a form of replicating materials such as marble and wood with paint, but has subsequently come to encompass many other decorative finishes for walls and furniture including simulating recognisable textures and surfaces.

== History ==
Faux finishing has been used for millennia, from [[cave painting]] to the tombs of [[ancient Egypt]], but what we generally think of as faux finishing in the [[decorative art]]s began with [[plaster]] and [[stucco]] finishes in [[Mesopotamia]] over 5,000 years ago.

Faux painting became popular in classical times in the forms of faux [[marble]], faux [[wood]], and [[trompe l'oeil]] [[murals]].  Artists would apprentice for 10 years or more with a master faux painter before working on their own.  Great recognition was awarded to artists who could actually trick viewers into believing their work was the real thing.  Faux painting has continued to be popular throughout the ages, but experienced major resurgences in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] revival of the nineteenth century and the [[Art Deco]] styles of the 1920s.  During the recent history of decorative painting, faux finishing has been mainly used in commercial and public spaces.

==20th century revival==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, faux finishing saw another major revival, as [[wallpaper]] began to fall out of fashion.  At this point, faux painting became extremely popular in home environments, with high-end homes leading the trend.   While it can be quite expensive to hire a professional faux finisher($80.00/hr.), many faux painting methods are thought to be simple enough for a beginning home owner to create with a little instruction. Some, however, fail to take important details like corners into consideration and end up with a do-it-yourself looking job. Some professionally applied finishes in the high-end, Bay-Area homes of northern California, for example, were as simple as oil glaze/oil-based paint/penetrol or as complicated as applications with peacock feathers and 4 different colors applied using 4 different techniques. People are attracted to the simplicity of changing a faux finish, because it can be easily painted over compared with the trouble of removing wallpaper. Trouble with removing wallpaper comes when people who have no formal training don't follow proper procedures during preparation such as priming with an oil-based primer, then following that with another product which makes the paper come off relatively easy.

In modern-day faux finishing, there are two major materials/processes used.  [[Glaze (painting technique)|Glaze]] work involves using a translucent mixture of paint and glaze applied with a brush, roller, rag, or sponge, and often mimics textures, but it is always smooth to the touch.  Plaster work can be done with tinted plasters, or washed over with earth pigments, and is generally applied with a trowel or spatula.  The finished result can be either flat to the touch or textured.

== Faux finishes ==
* [[Marbleizing]] or faux marbling is used to make walls and furniture look like real marble.  This can be done using either plaster or glaze techniques.
* [[Fresco]] is a simple technique, uses mixtures of tint and joint compound to add mottled color and subtle texture to plain walls,
* [[Graining]], wood graining, or faux bois (French for "fake wood") is often used to imitate exotic or hard-to-find wood varieties.
* [[Trompe l'oeil]], "fool the eye" in French, is a realistic painting technique often used in murals, and to create architectural details as well as depth and 3 dimensionality. 
* [[Venetian plaster]] is a smooth and often shiny plaster design that appears textured but is smooth to the touch.  Venetian plaster is one of the most popular and traditional plaster decorations. Authentic Venetian Plaster is made from marble dust and ground up limestone.
* [[Color wash]] is a free-form finish that creates subtle variations of color using multiple hues of glaze blended together with a paint brush.
* [[Strié]], from the French for "stripe" or "streak", is a glazing technique that creates soft thin streaks of color using a paint brush.  It is a technique often used to simulate fabrics such as linen and denim.
* [[Rag painting]] or ragging is a glazing technique using twisted or bunched up rags to create a textural pattern.
* Sponging is a free-form finish achieved by applying glaze to the wall by dabbing a sea sponge, in various shapes to achieve either simple design (resembling the wall papers) and more sophisticated ones.

==History==
The company was founded by [[Erling Persson]] in 1947, when he opened his first shop in [[Västerås]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="h&amp;m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.hm.com/AboutSection/en/About/Facts-About-HM/People-and-History/Our-History.html |title=H&amp;M: Our-History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319073126/http://about.hm.com/AboutSection/en/About/Facts-About-HM/People-and-History/Our-History.html |archivedate=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shop, called Hennes (Swedish for "hers"), exclusively sold women's clothing. A store was opened in [[Norway]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hm.com/no/abouthm/theworldofhm/europe/norway__worldofhm_countrycode_no.nhtml;jsessionid=C2725F05113C12482E28CB6626118089|title=Mote og kvalitet til beste pris – H&amp; NO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Persson acquired the hunting apparel retailer [[Mauritz Widforss]], which led to the inclusion of a menswear collection in the product range and the name change to Hennes &amp; Mauritz.&lt;ref name="h&amp;m" /&gt;

The company's three brands- Cheap Monday, Monki, and Weekday- continue to be run as separate concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aCPlw86kilnQ|title=H &amp; M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB: H&amp;M Acquires Remaining Shares in|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207031454/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aCPlw86kilnQ|archivedate=7 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monki in Tsuen Wan Plaza 2014.jpg|thumb|Monki in [[Tsuen Wan Plaza]], [[Hong Kong]]]]
Monki is "a wild and crazy international retail concept that believes that, it needs to fight ordinary and boost imagination with an experience out of the ordinary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monki.com/About/Monki_World|title=Monki - Monki World|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502112438/http://www.monki.com/About/Monki_World|archivedate=2 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand sells fashion for young women in stores in 13 markets, and is available online in 18 markets at ''monki.com''.

==Labour practices==
In August 2011, nearly 200 workers passed out in one week at a Cambodian factory supplying H&amp;M. Fumes from chemicals, poor ventilation, malnutrition and even "mass hysteria" have all been blamed for making workers ill. The minimum wage in Cambodia is the equivalent of just $66 (£42) a month, a level that human rights groups say is not even half that required to meet basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/02/cambodian-workers-peoples-tribunal-factory | title = Cambodian workers hold "people's tribunal" to look at factory conditions  | date = 2 February 2012|work=The Guardian | accessdate =2 February 2012 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladeshi and international labour groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in [[Dhaka]], major European and North American retailers, including H&amp;M, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/big-brands-rejected-bangladesh-factory-safety-plan-122206229.html;_ylt=AnVOsdd0ELiYKWzzSu_voqq3scB_;_ylu=X3oDMTQ1anZ1YTM5BG1pdANMYXRlc3ROZXdzIExpc3RpbmcEcGtnAzZkOTA2NmZiLTg4MWYtM2RlNS04M2Q5LThkOWZiOGM1MDBjNgRwb3MDMgRzZWMDTWVkaWFTdG9yeUxpc3RUZW1wBHZlcgM2OWJkMWU1MC1hZTczLTExZTItYmRiZi03MjgzNTZkYWU1MDg-;_ylg=X3oDMTFlamZvM2ZlBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDc2VjdGlvbnM-;_ylv=3|title=Big brands rejected Bangladesh factory safety plan|date=26 April 2013|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that in a conscious actions sustainability report for 2012, H&amp;M published a list of factories supplying 95% of its garments. Most retailers and brands do not share this information, citing commercial confidentiality as a reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/h-and-m-sustainability-report|title=H&amp;M: how does the fashion retailer's sustainability report stack up?|author=Lucy Siegle|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2013, ''[[The Ecologist]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url =http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/1745659/conservative_mp_promoted_cotton_trade_linked_to_child_labour.html | title = Conservative MP 'promoted cotton trade linked to child labour' | work = The Ecologist | date = 2 January 2013 | accessdate =1 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allegations by [[Anti-Slavery International]] that H&amp;M is continuing its association with the Uzbek government in exploiting child and adult forced labour as cotton harvesters in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.antislavery.org/english/campaigns/cottoncrimes/default.aspx | title = Stop H&amp;M Being Complicit in Cotton Crimes | work = Anti-Slavery International website | accessdate = 1 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the April [[2013 Savar building collapse]] H&amp;M and other retailers signed on to the [[Accord on Factory and Building Safety in Bangladesh]]. On 19 May 2013, a textile factory that produced apparel for H&amp;M in [[Phnom Penh]], Cambodia collapsed injuring several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324787004578497091806922254 |title=H&amp;M Clothes Made in Collapsed Cambodian Factory - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has raised concerns regarding industrial safety regulations.

On 25 November 2013, H&amp;M's global head of sustainability committed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/25/us-hm-wages-idUSBRE9AO0I820131125 |title=

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that H&amp;M, as the world's second-largest clothing retailer, will aim to pay all textile workers "living wage" by 2018, stating that governments are responding too slowly to poor working conditions in Bangladesh among other Asian countries where many clothing retailers source a majority if not all of their garments. Wages were increased in Bangladesh from 3,000 taka ($40) to 5,300 taka ($70) a month in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/10/hennes-mauritz-bangladesh-idUSL6N0N12AX20140410|title=H&amp; calls for faster factory inspections in Bangladesh|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, CleanClothes.org, an NGO involved in garment labour working conditions, reported on a lack of specific fire safety renovations in H&amp;M suppliers' factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanclothes.org/resources/publications/hm-bangladesh-september-2015.pdf|title=Evaluation of H&amp;M Compliance with Safety Action Plans for Strategic Suppliers in Bangladesh|publisher=The Clean Clothes Campaign|date=September 2015| access-date =23 October 2016|quote=16% of H&amp;M factories haven't removed locking doors ... 61% of H&amp;M factories with no fire exits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, [[SumOfUs]] launched a campaign to pressure H&amp;M to honour the commitment to protect Bangladesh's garment workers which it had signed onto following the [[2013 Savar building collapse|Rana Plaza collapse]] in [[Bangladesh]] in 2013, which killed over 1100 people, mostly garment workers, in unsafe factories housed in an eight-storey building not designed for factories. SumOfUs alleged that "H&amp;M is drastically behind schedule in fixing the safety hazards its workers have to face every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://actions.sumofus.org/a/h-and-m-honour-your-commitments-to-protect-garment-workers-in-bangladesh|title=H&amp;M: Honour your commitments to protect garment workers in Bangladesh|work=SumOfUs|accessdate = 2016-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 the Guardian reported children were employed to make H&amp;M products in [[Myanmar]] and were paid as little as 13p (about 15cents US) an hour  – half the full legal minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/child-labour-myanmar-high-street-brands|title=How high street clothes were made by children in Myanmar for 13p an hour|first=Gethin|last=Chamberlain|date=5 February 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On January 6, 2010, it was reported that unsold or refunded clothing and other items in one New York City store were cut up before being discarded, presumably to prevent resale or use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=January 2011}} {{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/nyregion/06about.html?ref=nyregion | title = A Clothing Clearance Where More Than Just the Prices Have Been Slashed  | date = 6 January 2010 | work = The New York Times | accessdate =6 January 2010 | first=Jim | last=Dwyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2012, H&amp;M was reported to have stolen an artist's work, using it on multiple items without compensating the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/hm-is-getting-slammed-for-allegedly-copying-an-artists-design-for-a-bunch-of-its-own-products-2012-1| title = H&amp;M Is Getting Slammed For Allegedly Copying An Artist's Design  | date = 25 January 2012 | accessdate =24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the Swedish fashion chain withdrew faux-leather headdresses from Canadian stores after consumers complained the items, part of the company's summer music festival collection, were insulting to Canada's Aboriginal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/aug/09/h-and-m-withdraws-offensive-headdresses-canada|title=H&amp;M withdraws 'offensive' headdresses|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2015, the H&amp;M South Africa division had been accused with racism for lack of black models in their photoshots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2015-11-06-hm-in-racist-debacle-over-positive-image-tweet-for-lack-of-black-models/|title=H&amp;M in racist debacle over 'positive image' tweet for lack of black models|work=[[The Times (South Africa)|TimesLive]]|date=2015-11-06 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; later claiming that White models convey a more "Positive Image" than that of black models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsone.com/3247456/hm-apologizes-racist-tweets/|title=H&amp;M South Africa Racist Tweets - News One|work=[[News One]]|date=2015-11-10 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Since January 2012 H&amp;M introduced the [[H&amp;M Design Award]], an annual design prize for fashion graduates. The prize is established to support young designers with the beginning of their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/24490|title=The H&amp;M Design Award|author=|date=13 January 2012|website=dexigner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in February 2013, H&amp;M will offer patrons a voucher in exchange for used garments. Donated garments will be processed by I:CO, a retailer that repurposes and recycles used clothing with the goal of creating a zero-waste economy. The initiative is similar to a clothes-collection voucher program launched in April 2012 by [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] in partnership with [[Oxfam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9726240/HandM-to-launch-global-clothes-collecting-initiative.html|title=H&amp; to launch global clothes collecting initiative – Telegraph|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.hm.com/content/hm/NewsroomSection/en/NewsRoom/NewsroomDetails/global-clothes-collecting-initiative.html|title=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico-spirit.com/us/Home-1.html|title=I:CO-System – I:CO – RETHINK.

In April 2014, H&amp;M joined Zara and other apparel companies in changing their supply chain to avoid endangered forests. H&amp;M teamed with Canopy, a non-profit, to remove endangered and ancient forests from their dissolvable pulp supply chain for their viscose and rayon fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/zara-h-m-fashion-sustainable-forests-logging-fabric|title=Deforestation for fashion: getting unsustainable fabrics out of the closet|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, H&amp;M announced that it will award a million-euro annual prize to advance recycling technology and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/aug/25/fashion-chain-hm-offers-1m-recycling-prize-for-reusable-clothing|title=Fashion Chain H&amp;M Offers $1m Recycling Prize for Reusable Clothing|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 August 2015|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H&amp;M Foundation is a non-profit foundation which was established in order to implement positive change and improve living standards, such as education for children, worldwide access to clean water, strengthening women on a global scale, and being environmentally aware. It is privately funded by the Persson Family, founders and owners of H&amp;M. 
Since 2013, the Persson Family has made huge contributions to the foundation, donating SEK1.1 billion (US$154 million) to the H&amp;M Foundation.

'''Holbeinesque jewellery''' includes pendants, brooches and earrings in the neo-Renaissance or Renaissance Revival style, and once again became fashionable in the 1860s. The designs differ from the older stylised and pious [[neo-Gothic]] jewellery, in that they are extravagantly opulent - this richness of form and colour which had appealed to the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] court was rediscovered by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] jewellers and their patrons, reviving a fashion that flourished into the early 1900s. 

The style is characterised by a large, centrally-placed [[cabochon]] gemstone, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] or [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] mounted in gold and colourful enamel work, such as [[basse-taille]], [[champlevé]], [[cloisonné]] and [[ronde bosse|en ronde bosse]]. Beneath this, a drop-shaped pearl or diamond-set lozenge was suspended. The back of each piece is often elaborately engraved using scroll and foliate ornamentation. Such designs were inspired by the art of [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], and were often copied from jewellery depicted in Holbein's portraits of Tudor ladies from the court of [[Henry VIII]] by jewellers such as [[John Brogden (jeweller)|John Brogden]] and his fellow worker, [[Carlo Giuliano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holbeinesquejewellery.tumblr.com|title=Holbeinesque Jewellery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jewellery houses producing Holbeinesque pieces, were those of Jules Wièse, [[Boucheron]], [[Chaumet]] and Vever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langantiques.com/university/index.php/Vever|title=Vever - AJU|work=Langantiques.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides paintings of his sitters wearing their jewellery, Holbein also left detailed drawings of pieces, some copied from his sitters' pieces, some of his own design.

The motifs used came from classical mythology or from 16th-century [[Mannerist]] ornamentation, involving hybrid human/animal forms known as [[grotesque]]s, torsos ending in columns or pedestals called [[Term (architecture) |terms]], and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]. [[Putti]], [[quatrefoil]] and fantastic masks were often used for embellishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faycullen.com/antique_necklaces/600/eo725c4gp.html|title=Victorian Moonstone Necklace|work=Faycullen.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbeinesque jewellers could avail themselves of a vast range of reference sources for their designs. Many jewellery items survived from the Renaissance, books on design by artists of the 15th and 16th centuries, and court portraits of the rich and influential figures of the period by artists such as [[Raphael]], Holbein and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jckonline.com/article/288115-Inspiration_for_Gothic_Renaissance_Revival_Style_Jewels.php|title=Inspiration for Gothic &amp; Renaissance Revival Style Jewels|work=Jckonline.com|accessdate=2015-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126191539/http://www.jckonline.com/article/288115-Inspiration_for_Gothic_Renaissance_Revival_Style_Jewels.php|archivedate=2013-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ira Hamilton Hayes''' (January 12, 1923&amp;nbsp;– January 24, 1955) was a [[Pima people|Pima]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and a [[United States Marine]] who was one of the six flag raisers immortalized in the iconic photograph of the [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|flag raising on Iwo Jima]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2006/0901/1156791312212.html |title = An Irishman's Diary |last = Ó'Riain |first = Seán |publisher = The Irish Times |date = 2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/HD/Historical/Whos_Who/Hayes_IH.htm |title = Corporal Ira Hamilton Hayes, USMCR |work = Who's Who in Marine Corps History |publisher = History Division, United States Marine Corps |accessdate = 2006-09-01 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061031191959/http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/HD/Historical/Whos_Who/Hayes_IH.htm |archivedate = 2006-10-31 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes was an enrolled member of the [[Gila River Indian Community|Gila River Pima Indian Reservation]] located in the [[Pinal County|Pinal]] and [[Maricopa County|Maricopa]] counties in [[Arizona]]. He enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] on August 26, 1942 and, after recruit training, volunteered to become a [[Paramarine]]. He fought in the [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] and [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] [[Military campaign|campaigns]] in the [[Pacific Theatre of Operations]].

On February 23, 1945, he helped to raise an American flag over [[Mount Suribachi]] on Iwo Jima, an event photographed by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]]. Hayes and the other five flag-raisers became national heroes as a result. In 1946, he was instrumental in revealing the true identity of one of the other pictured Marines, who was killed in action on Iwo Jima. However, Hayes was never comfortable with his fame, and after his service in the Marine Corps, he descended into [[alcoholism]]. He died of exposure to cold and alcohol poisoning after a night of drinking on January 23–24, 1955. He was buried with [[Military funeral|full military honors]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on February 2, 1955.

Hayes was often commemorated in art and film, before and after his death. In 1949, he portrayed himself raising the flag in the motion picture movie, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. A giant Marine figure of Hayes raising the flag on Iwo Jima with the other five participants is included on the 1954 [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

He was the subject of an article by journalist [[William Bradford Huie]], which was adapted for the feature film ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' (1961), starring [[Tony Curtis]] as Hayes. The movie inspired songwriter [[Peter La Farge]] to write "[[The Ballad of Ira Hayes]]," which became popular nationwide in 1964 after being recorded by [[Johnny Cash]]. In 2006, Hayes was portrayed by [[Adam Beach]] in the World War II movie ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]],'' directed by [[Clint Eastwood]].

==Early life==
Ira Hayes was born in [[Sacaton, Arizona]], a town in the [[Gila River Indian Community]] in [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]]. He was the eldest of six children born to Nancy Hamilton (1901–1972) and Joseph Hayes (1887–1978).&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 38"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hayes children were: Ira (1923–1955), Harold (1924–1925), Arlene (1926–1929), Leonard (1927–1952), Vernon (1929–1958), and Kenneth (born 1931).&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 38"/&gt; Joseph Hayes was a [[World War I]] veteran who supported his family by [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] and its cotton harvesting.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Hayes was a devout [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and a [[Sunday school]] teacher at the [[Assemblies of God]] church in Sacaton.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt;

Ira was remembered by his family and friends as being a shy and sensitive child. Sara Bernal, his first cousin, said, "Joseph Hayes was a very quiet man; he would go days without saying anything unless you spoke to him first. The other Hayes children would play and tease me, but not Ira. He was quiet, and somewhat distant. Ira didn't speak unless spoken to. He was just like his father."&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers pp. 39-41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; His boyhood friend Dana Norris said, "Even though I'm from the same culture, I could never get under his skin. Ira had the characteristic of not wanting to talk. But we Pimas are not prone to tooting our own horns. Ira was a quiet guy, such a quiet guy."&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers pp. 39-41"/&gt; Despite this, Hayes was a precocious child who displayed an impressive grasp of the [[English language]], a language that many Pima never learned to speak.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt; He learned to read and write by the age of four and was a voracious reader.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt;

In 1932, the family settled in [[Bapchule, Arizona]], approximately 12 miles northwest of Sacaton.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt; The Hayes children attended grade school in Sacaton and high school at the Phoenix Indian School in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Hayes confided to his classmate Eleanor Pasquale after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], that he was determined to serve in the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquale said,  "Every morning in school, [the students] would get a report on [[World War II]]. We would sing the anthems of the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], and the [[United States Navy|Navy]]."&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers pp. 41-42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes completed two years at the [[Phoenix Indian School]] and served in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in May and June 1942. He worked as a [[carpenter]] before enlisting in the service.&lt;ref name="California Indian Education: Ira Hayes: O'odham USMC Airborne Warrior"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaindianeducation.org/native_american_veterans/ira_hayes.html|title=Ira Hayes: O’odham USMC Airborne Warrior|website=www.californiaindianeducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Marine Corps==

===World War II===

Hayes enlisted in the [[Marine Corps Reserve]] on August 26, 1942.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed recruit training in Platoon 701 at Marine Corps Base, San Diego (renamed in 1948, [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego]]) and in October volunteered for Marine [[paratrooper]] (Paramarine) training at the Marine Parachute School at [[Gillespie Field|Camp Gillespie]] located east of San Diego. He received the codename of ''Chief Falling Cloud''. On November 30, he graduated from the Parachute Training School and received his silver "[[Parachutist badge|jump wings]]".&lt;ref name="California Indian Education: Ira Hayes: O'odham USMC Airborne Warrior" /&gt; On December 1, he was promoted to [[Private first class|Private First Class]].&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt;

On December 2, 1942, he joined Company B, 3rd Parachute Battalion, Divisional Special Troops, [[3rd Marine Division]], at [[Camp Elliott]], [[California]]. On March 14, 1943, Hayes sailed for [[New Caledonia]] with the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which was assigned to Camp Kiser there on March 25 until September 26; the unit was redesignated in April as Company K, 3rd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Airborne, Attached Units&amp;nbsp;— The U.S. Airborne during World War II, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment [http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/1stmarine/1st_marine.html]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[I Marine Amphibious Corps]]. The 3rd battalion was shipped to [[Guadalcanal]] and remained there until it was sent to [[Vella Lavella]], arriving on October 14 for occupational duty. On December 4, Hayes landed with the 3rd battalion on Bougainville and fought against the [[Japan]]ese as a platoon [[automatic rifle]]man ([[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|BAR man]]) with Company K during the [[Bougainville Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped back to Guadalcanal, and he stayed there until sometime in February when the Paramarines were sent back to California. The 1st Parachute Regiment was officially disbanded at [[Camp Pendleton, California]], in February 1944.

Hayes was transferred to Company E, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]] of the newly activated [[5th Marine Division]] at Camp Pendleton. Hayes sailed to [[Hawaii]] with his company in September for continued training with the 5th division as it trained for the invasion and capture of Iwo Jima.

====Raising the flag on Iwo Jima====

[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|'''Hayes''' is pictured to the far left]]
The 5th Marine Division landed on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] on February 19, 1945. Hayes's Second Platoon, Easy Company, 2/28 Marines, landed on the southern beach near Mount Suribachi off of the [[USS Talladega]] after transferring from the [[USS Missoula (APA-211)|USS Missoula]].&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; On February 23, Marines from the Third Platoon of Easy Company, 2/28 Marines, captured and raised an American flag on top of Mount Suribachi at approximately 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.

In the early afternoon, Hayes's squad leader, Sergeant [[Michael Strank]], was ordered to take three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon, Easy Company, to bring supplies up Mount Suribachi and raise a larger flag on the summit. Strank chose Corporal [[Harlon Block]], Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]], and Hayes for the patrol. Marine Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]], a battalion runner for Easy Company, was ordered up the mountain with the replacement flag. The four Marines together with Gagnon and Private First Class [[Harold Schultz]] (Navy corpsman [[John Bradley (Navy)|John Bradley]] was misidentified as a flag-raiser until June 23, 2016),&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; raised the second flag attached onto another steel pipe found by Hayes and Sousley, while at the same time the smaller flag came down. Schultz from Third Platoon, was part of the original 40-man patrol that climbed up Mount Suribachi.

On March 14, another American flag was officially raised at Marine headquarters at the base of Mount Suribachi to signal the Marine occupied Iwo Jima, and the flag on top of Mount Suribachi that Hayes helped to raise there was taken down. Hayes fought on the island until it was secure on March 26, and left Iwo Jima with his unit on March 27. Easy Company had many casualties, Hayes was one of five Marines remaining from his platoon of forty-five men including their corpsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/specials/nativeamerican01/flag.html|title=American Indian Heritage Month: Iwo Jima Flag Raiser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|raising of the second American flag on Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945 was immortalized by AP photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]] and became an icon of the world war. Soon afterwards, the two surviving flag-raisers Hayes and Gagnon, and Bradley who was believed to be in Rosenthal's photograph,&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; became national heroes. Harlon Block who was killed in action on Iwo Jima in March 1945, was misidentified as being Sergeant [[Henry O. Hansen|Henry Hansen]] from Third Platoon, Easy Company who was also killed in action. Hayes had attempted to correct the misrepresentation of his friend Block for Hansen (Hansen helped raise the first flag) in April 1945, but was silenced by a Marine Corps officer in Washington, D.C. who was placed in charge of the flag-raisers.

====7th war bond selling tour====
[[File:Seventh-War-Loan-Drive-Poster-1945.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Seventh-War-Loan-Drive-Poster (May 11–July 4, 1945)]]
Hayes and his unit left Iwo Jima on the [[USS Winged Arrow]]&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; bound for Hawaii on March 27, 1945. Hayes continued to train at Camp Tarawa again with his unit until April 15, 1945, when he boarded a plane to [[Washington, D.C.]] with orders to join C Company, 1st Headquarters Battalion, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. with the two other surviving second flag-raisers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin Roosevelt]] paid for the war by selling war bonds and had requested the flag raisers (in Joe Rosenthal's photograph) participation before he died on April 12. Hayes and Gagnon, and Bradley, were assigned to making public appearances in connection with selling government [[war bond]]s for the [[Series E bond|Seventh War Loan Drive]]. On April 20, the three met with [[Harry S. Truman|President Harry Truman]] at the [[White House]]. The bond tour began on May 11 in [[New York City]], after Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley raised the same flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi, at the Nation's capital during a ceremony at the Capitol steps on May 9. Hayes was in charge of the flag. The bond tour ended on July 4 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;The Mighty Seventh War Loan: {{cite web |url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406193329/http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes however, finished his participation in the bond drive on May 24 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] and returned to Washington, D.C. with orders to rejoin E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines at [[Camp Tarawa]] in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; He arrived at [[Hilo, Hawaii]] by plane and rejoined E Company on May 29.

On June 19, Hayes was promoted to corporal. He served on [[Occupation of Japan|occupation duty]] in Japan with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines from September 22 to October 26, 1945. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California on December 1, 1945. On February 21, 1946, he was awarded a Navy Commendation from the Marine Corps for meritorious service in combat during World War II.

==Post World War II==
[[File:Hayes in LA.jpg|thumb|'''Ira Hayes''' (left) with Los Angeles mayor [[Fletcher Bowron]] (1947)]]
Hayes attempted to lead a normal civilian life after the war. "I kept getting hundreds of letters. And people would drive through the reservation, walk up to me and ask, "Are you the Indian who raised the flag on Iwo Jima?"&lt;ref name=Viola&gt;{{cite book|last = Viola| first = Herman J.| title = Warriors in Uniform: The Legacy of American Indian Heroism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JYXMqa1MYNsC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22Are+you+the+Indian+who+raised+the+flag+on+Iwo+Jima%22&amp;q=%22Are%20you%20the%20Indian%20who%20raised%20the%20flag%20on%20Iwo%20Jima%22| date    = November 18, 2008| work    = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]| isbn = 978-1-4262-0361-9| pages = 93–94| chapter = Fighting the Metal Hats: World War II| author2 = Campbell, Ben Nighthorse}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although Hayes rarely spoke about the flag raising, he talked more generally about his service in the Marine Corps with great pride.

Hayes seemed to be disturbed that Harlon Block was still being misrepresented publicly as "Hank" Hansen. One day in 1946, Hayes walked and hitchhiked 1,300 miles from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona to Edward Frederick Block, Sr.'s farm in [[Weslaco, Texas]], to reveal the truth to Block's family about their son Harlon being in the Rosenthal photograph. He was instrumental in having the mistaken second flag-raiser controversy resolved by the Marine Corps in January 1947. Block's family was grateful to Hayes, especially Harlon's mother. She said that she had known from the time she first saw the photo in the newspaper, that it was Harlon in the photo. Mrs. Block took what Hayes said and wrote to her congressman.

[[File:USMC War Memorial Night.jpg|thumb|The [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]]]
In 1949, Hayes appeared briefly as himself in the film ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]],'' starring [[John Wayne]]. In the movie, Wayne handed the American flag to Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley, who at the time were considered the three surviving second flag-raisers (the second flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi is used in the film and is handed directly to Gagnon).

After this Hayes was unable to hold on to a steady job for a long period, as he had become alcoholic. He was arrested 52 times for [[alcohol intoxication]] in public at various places in the country, including Chicago in October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 7, 1955 |title=Then There Were Two |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823714,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his [[alcoholism]], he once said: "I was sick. I guess I was about to crack up thinking about all my good buddies. They were better men than me and they're not coming back. Much less back to the [[White House]], like me."&lt;ref name=Viola/&gt; Hayes was sober while attending the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] dedication on November 10, 1954 where he was lauded by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as a hero. A reporter there approached Hayes and asked him, "How do you like the pomp and circumstance?" Hayes hung his head and said, "I don't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last      = Jeffers

His disquiet about his unwanted fame and his subsequent post-war problems were first recounted in detail by the author [[William Bradford Huie]] in "The Outsider," published in 1959 as part of his collection ''Wolf Whistle and Other Stories''. ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' was filmed in 1961, was directed by World War II veteran turned film director [[Delbert Mann]] and starred [[Tony Curtis]] as Hayes.&lt;ref name=imdbout&gt;{{IMDb title| id=55270 | title=The Outsider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 film ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], suggests that Hayes suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

On the morning of January 24, 1955, Hayes was found dead lying near an abandoned adobe hut near where he lived in Sacaton, Arizona. He had been drinking and playing cards on the reservation with his friends and brothers Vernon and Kenneth. An altercation ensued between Hayes and a Pima Indian named Henry Setoyant, and all left except Hayes and Setoyant. The Pinal County coroner concluded that Hayes's death was caused by [[hypothermia|exposure]] and [[alcohol poisoning]]. However, his  brother Kenneth, a [[Korean War]] veteran, believes that the death resulted from the altercation with Setoyant. The reservation police did not conduct an investigation into Hayes's death, and Setoyant denied any allegations of fighting with Hayes.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 503"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[autopsy]].

In the film, ''The Outsider,'' his death is dramatized for the screen. He is shown drunk and freezing on a mountain top and unable to climb down. He falls asleep and is shown frozen to death with his arm and hand reaching upwards, like the time he raised the flag on Mount Suribachi. In the song "[[The Ballad of Ira Hayes]]," his death is described as dying an indigent death: being drunk and drowning in two inches of water in a ditch.

On February 2, 1955, Hayes was buried in Section 34, Grave 479A at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. At the funeral, fellow flag-raiser [[Rene Gagnon]] said of him: "Let's say he had a little dream in his heart that someday the Indian would be like the white man&amp;nbsp;— be able to walk all over the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chavers| first     = Dean| title     = Modern American Indian Leaders: Their Lives and Their Work| url  = https://books.google.com/?id=p1t0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Let's+say+he+had+a+little+dream+in+his+heart+that+someday+the+Indian+would+be+like+the+white+man| volume    = 1

==1993 Marine Corps commemoration==
[[File:Sacaton-Ira Hayes Memorial.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ira H. Hayes Monument located in the Mathew B. Juan-Ira H. Hayes Veterans Memorial Park in Sacaton, Arizona]] 
On November 10, 1993, the [[United States Marine Corps]] held a ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) commemorating the 218th anniversary of the Marine Corps. Of Ira Hayes, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|USMC Commandant]] General [[Carl Epting Mundy, Jr.|Carl Mundy]] said:

{{quotation|One of the pairs of hands that you see outstretched to raise our National flag on the battle-scarred crest of Mount Suribachi so many years ago, are those of a Native American ... Ira Hayes ... a Marine not of the ethnic majority of our population.

Were Ira Hayes here today ... I would tell him that although my [[Carl Epting Mundy, Jr.#Remarks on minority officers|words on another occasion]] have given the impression that I believe some Marines ... because of their color ... are not as capable as other Marines ... that those were not the thoughts of my mind ... and that they are not the thoughts of my heart.

I would tell Ira Hayes that our Corps is what we are because we are of the people of America ... the people of the broad, strong, ethnic fabric that is our nation. And last, I would tell him that in the future, that fabric will broaden and strengthen in every category to make our Corps even stronger ... even of greater utility to our nation. That's a commitment of this commandant ... And that's a personal commitment of this Marine.}}

== Military awards ==
Hayes' Navy Commendation Ribbon was updated to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with [[Combat "V"]] for meritorious service.&lt;ref&gt;The Combat Distinguishing Device (Combat "V") denotes he was "''exposed to personal hazard during direct participation in combat''" SECNAVINST 1650.1H.&lt;/ref&gt; He rates the [[Combat Action Ribbon|Navy Combat Action Ribbon]] for combat participation in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;The Combat Action Ribbon is a personal award, awarded by the Navy and Marine Corps, ''retroactive from December 7, 1941'': Public Law 106-65--October 5, 1999, 113 STAT 588, Sec 564&lt;/ref&gt; The {{frac|5|16}}" silver star on his Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon was a Marine Corps, World War II, campaign participation star (discontinued) for Iwo Jima, not a 2nd Presidential Unit Citation award ([[Service star|{{frac|3|16}}" bronze star]]). Hayes' 39 months of service did not meet the Marine Corps four-year (48 months) service requirement in World War II for the [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]].

FLEET MARINE FORCE, PACIFIC&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, takes pleasure in COMMENDING, CORPORAL IRA H. HAYES, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS, for service as set forth in the following

CITATION:

For meritorious and efficient performance of duty while serving with a Marine infantry battalion during operations against the enemy on VELLA LAVELLA AND BOUGAINVILLE, BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS, from 15 August to 15 December 1943, and on IWO JIMA, VOLCANO ISLANDS, from 19 February to 27 March 1945.

He then began teaching at the [[University of Wales]] before moving on to the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he also completed a PhD on the Russian avant-garde. Davies finally retired from teaching at the Gwent College of Higher Education in 1988.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcaconwy.org/ivor_davies-84.aspx |title=The Royal Cambrian Academy – Ivor Davies |publisher=Rcaconwy.org |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s4c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/bydoliw_archive/e_ifordavies.shtml |title=Byd o Liw |publisher=S4C |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Davies is passionate about the [[Welsh culture|culture]], [[Welsh language|language]] and [[Politics of Wales|politics]] of Wales, which inspire his artwork. For a number of years he has sponsored the ''Ivor Davies Award'' at ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (''Art Space'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], for an artwork "that conveys the spirit of activism in the struggle for language, culture and politics in Wales".&lt;ref name="eisteddfod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/uploads/publications/336.pdf|date=15 October 2009|title=Visual Arts Exhibition, Y Lle Celf at Blaenau Gwent|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies' early works in the 1960s used explosives as an expression of society's destructive nature. Davies took part in the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in London in 1966.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s4c"/&gt; More recent work has included painting, installations; he has also designed and installed a [[mosaic]] of [[Saint David]] at [[Westminster Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Germaine Greer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/19/germaine-greer-catholic-art-papal-visit |title=Catholic art was once the domain of Titian.

==Reception==
Sean Woods of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: "In his masterful new book Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, which comes out this week, Grann chronicles a tale of murder, betrayal, heroism and a nation's struggle to leave its frontier culture behind and enter the modern world... Filled with almost mythic characters from our past – stoic Texas Rangers, corrupt robber barons, private detectives, and murderous desperadoes like the Al Spencer gang – Grann's story amounts to a secret history of the American frontier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sean|title='Killers of the Flower Moon': Inside David Grann's New True-Crime Epic|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/killers-of-the-flower-moon-inside-new-true-crime-epic-w476689|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=rollingstone.com|date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Lost City of Z) burnishes his reputation as a brilliant storyteller in this gripping true-crime narrative, which revisits a baffling and frightening—and relatively unknown—spree of murders occurring mostly in Oklahoma during the 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-53424-6|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|publisher=publishersweekly.com|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Vulliamy of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said "The genocide by white America against Native nations during the century leading up to Grann’s period is a metaphor for humanity’s decimation of the natural world which the Natives saw as sacred. Grann’s book is a timely and disturbing chapter in the original, terrible atrocity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vulliamy|first1=Ed|title=Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/01/killers-of-the-flower-moon-david-grann-review|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Kondracki was originally from [[Toronto]], Kondracki studied English literature and theatre at [[McGill University]], and later completed an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in film directing at [[Columbia University]].

She is also a director on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and ''[[Better Call Saul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[New York Observer]]|url=http://observer.com/2016/04/better-call-saul-2x08-recap-masterpiece-theater/|title=‘Better Call Saul’ 2×08 Recap: Masterpiece Theater|first=Sean T.|last=Collins|date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was chosen to direct episodes of the iconic Australian story of [[Picnic at Hanging Rock (TV series)]] and this proved controversial. Commentators declared that the series should have chosen an Australian woman in preference to a Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canadian-director-caught-up-screen-australia-nationalism-storm-953656|title=Canadian Director Caught Up in Screen Australia Nationalism Storm|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flatbed Letterpress Diagram.svg|thumb|375px|The general form of letterpress printing with a [[platen]] press, showing the relationship between the forme (the type), the pressure, the ink, and the paper]]
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006317 023 Mitarbeiter der Druckerei Offizin Haag-Drugulin.jpg|thumb|A printer inspecting a large forme of type on a cylinder press. Each of the islands of text represents a single page, the darker blocks are images. The whole bed of type is printed on a single sheet of paper, which is then folded and cut to form many individual pages of a book.]]

'''Letterpress printing''' is a technique of [[relief printing]] using a [[printing press]], a process by which many copies are produced by repeated direct impression of an inked, raised surface against sheets or a continuous roll of paper.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Letterpress Printing|date=2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/337488/letterpress-printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; A worker composes and locks [[movable type]] into the "bed" or "chase" of a press, [[ink]]s it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.

In practice, letterpress also includes other forms of relief printing with printing presses, such as [[wood engraving]]s, photo-etched zinc "cuts" (plates), and linoleum blocks, which can be used alongside metal type, or wood type, in a single operation, as well as [[stereotype (printing)|stereotypes]] and [[electrotype]]s of type and blocks.&lt;ref name="Stewart Intro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Alexander A.|title=The Printer's Dictionary of Technical Terms|year=1912|publisher=North End Union School of Printing|location=Boston, Mass.|pages=vi–ix|url=https://archive.org/details/printersdictiona00stew}}&lt;/ref&gt; With certain letterpress units it is also possible to join movable type with slugs cast using [[hot metal typesetting]]. In theory, anything that is "type high" or .918 inches can be printed using letterpress.&lt;ref name="Linoleum Block Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafka|first1=Francis|title=Linoleum Block Printing|date=1972|publisher=Courier Corporation|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qkEub3-3kC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century until the 19th century and remained in wide use for books and other uses until the second half of the 20th century. Letterpress printing remained the primary way to print and distribute information until the 20th century, when [[offset printing]] was developed, which largely supplanted its role in printing books and newspapers. All forms of data collection were affected by the invention of letterpress printing, as were many careers such as teachers, preachers, physicians and surgeons and artist-engineers.&lt;ref name="The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenstein|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107632752|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

==History==
{{Main article|Movable type|Printing press|Spread of the printing press|Typography}}
[[File:The Caxton Celebration - William Caxton showing specimens of his printing to King Edward IV and his Queen.jpg|thumb|Printer operating a Gutenberg-style screw press]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited with the development in the western hemisphere, in about 1440, of modern movable type printing from individually cast, reusable letters set together in a form (frame or chase). Movable type was first invented in China using ceramic type in 1040 AD. Gutenberg also invented a wooden printing press, based on the extant [[wine press]], where the type surface was inked with leather-covered [[ink ball]]s and paper laid carefully on top by hand, then slid under a padded surface and pressure applied from above by a large threaded screw. It was Gutenberg's "screw press" or hand press that was used to print 180 copies of the Bible. At 1,282 pages, it took him and his staff of 20 almost 3 years to complete. 48 copies remain intact today.&lt;ref name="600 Years of Printing History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Over 600 Years of Printing History|url=http://thebeautyofletterpress.com/letterpress/|website=beautyofletterpress.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of presswork gradually replaced the hand-copied manuscripts of scribes and illuminators as the most prevalent form of printing.&lt;ref name="The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe" /&gt; Printers' workshops, previously unknown in Europe before the mid-15th century, were found in every important metropolis by 1500.&lt;ref name="The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe" /&gt; Later metal presses used a knuckle and lever arrangement instead of the [[screw]], but the principle was the same. Ink rollers made of [[composition roller|composition]] made inking faster and paved the way for further automation.

===Industrialization===
[[File:Fitzwilliam Press Room 1917.jpg|thumb|1917 press room, using a [[line shaft]] power system. At right are several small platen [[jobbing presses]], at left, a [[cylinder press]].]]
With the advent of [[industrial revolution|industrial mechanisation]], inking was carried out by rollers that passed over the face of the type, then moved out of the way onto an ink plate to pick up a fresh film of ink for the next sheet. Meanwhile, a sheet of paper slid against a hinged platen (see image), which then rapidly pressed onto the type and swung back again as the sheet was removed and the next sheet inserted. As the fresh sheet of paper replaced the printed paper, the now freshly inked rollers ran over the type again. Fully automated 20th-century presses, such as the Kluge and [[Original Heidelberg Platen Press|"Original" Heidelberg Platen]] (the "Windmill"), incorporated pneumatic sheet feed and delivery.

[[Rotary press]]es were used for high-speed work. In the oscillating press, the form slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper got wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the inking rollers while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a [[newspaper]] press, a papier-mâché mixture called a [[flong]] used to make a mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal [[stereotype]] plate cast against it. The plates were clipped to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous reel of paper at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.
This invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.

==North American history==

===Canada===
Letterpress printing was introduced in Canada in 1752 in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] by [[John Bushell]] in the newspaper format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014|title=Printing and typesetting|website=Canadian Science and Technology Museum|url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/about/printing.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper was named the [[Halifax Gazette]] and became Canada's first newspaper. Bushell apprenticed under [[Bartholomew Green (printer, born 1699)|Bartholomew Green]] in Boston. Green moved to Halifax in 1751 in hopes of starting a newspaper, as it did not exist in the area. Two weeks and a day after the press he was going to use for this new project arrived in Halifax, Green died. Upon receiving word about what happened, Bushell moved to Halifax and continued what Green had started. The Halifax Gazette was first published on March 23, 1752, making Bushell the first letterpress printer in Halifax, and eventually Canada. There is only one known surviving copy which was found in the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014|newspaper=Halifax Gazette|title=Nova Scotia Archives|url=https://novascotia.ca/archives/virtual/gazette/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
One of the first forms of letterpress printing in the United States was [[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick]] started by [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]]. This was the first form of a newspaper with multiple pages in the Americas. The first publication of [[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick]] was September 25, 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Breig, James|date=2014|title=Early American newspapering|website=Colonial Williamsburg|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring03/journalism.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival and rise of craft letterpress==
[[File:Proof Press in Rupriikki Media Museum.jpg|thumb|Proof press, 1850]]
Letterpress started to become largely out-of-date in the 1970s because of the rise of computers and new self-publishing print and publish methods. Many printing establishments went out of business from the 1980s to 1990s and sold their equipment after computers replaced letterpress's abilities more efficiently. These commercial print shops discarded presses, making them affordable and available to artisans throughout the country. Popular presses are, in particular, [[Vandercook]] cylinder [[proof presses]] and [[Chandler &amp; Price]] [[platen presses]]. In the UK there is particular affection for the Arab press, built by Josiah Wade in Halifax.
Letterpress recently has had a rebirth in popularity because of the "allure of hand-set type"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Holson, Laura|date=2006|title=Retro printers, grounding the laser jet|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/arts/design/10hols.html?ex=1323406800&amp;en=ee024b5adc6e4fd8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the differences today between traditional letterpress and computerized printed text. Letterpress is unique and different from standard printing formats that we are currently used to. Letterpress commonly features a relief impression of the type, although this was considered bad printing in traditional letterpress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014|title=Letterpress printing|website=Graphic Design|url=http://www.graphicdesign.com/article/whats-big-deal-about-letterpress/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterpress's goal before the recent revival of letterpress was to not show any impression. The type touched the paper slightly to leave a transfer of ink, but did not leave an impression. This is often referred to as "the kiss"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Franklin, Allison|date=2016|title=Resurgence of the Letterpress, Actually Thanks to the Internet|website=INK SOLV 30 blog|url=http://inksolv30.com/blogs/news/82102406-resurgence-of-the-letterpress-actually-thanks-to-the-internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this former technique would be [[newspapers]].  Some letterpress practitioners today have the distinct goal of showing the impression of type, to distinctly note that it is letterpress but many printers choose to maintain the integrity of the traditional methods. Printing with too much impression is destructive to both the machines and to the type. Since its revival letterpress has largely been used for fine art and stationery as its traditional use for newspaper printing is no longer relevant for use.

Letterpress is considered a [[craft]] as it involves using a skill and is done by hand. Fine letterpress work is crisper than offset litho because of its impression into the paper, giving greater visual definition to the type and artwork, although it is not what letterpress traditionally was meant for. Today, many of these small letterpress shops survive by printing fine editions of books or by printing upscale invitations, [[stationery]], and [[greeting card]]s. These methods often use presses that require the press operator to feed paper one sheet at a time by hand. Today, the juxtaposition of this technique and offbeat humor for greeting cards has been proven by letterpress shops to be marketable to independent boutiques and gift shops. Some of these printmakers are just as likely to use new printing methods as old, for instance by printing using photopolymer plates on restored vintage presses.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Martha Stewart's influence===
Letterpress publishing has recently undergone a revival in the USA, Canada, and the UK, under the general banner of the "Small Press Movement". Renewed interest in letterpress was fueled by [[Martha Stewart Weddings]] magazine, which began using pictures of letterpress invitations in the 1990s.{{citation needed|reason=Needs an independent source for the influence|date=May 2017}} In 2004 they state "Great care is taken in choosing the perfect wedding stationery – couples ponder details from the level of formality to the flourishes of the typeface. The method of printing should be no less important, as it can enliven the design exquisitely. That is certainly the case with letterpress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2004|title=Letterpress|website=Martha Stewart Weddings|url=http://www.marthastewartweddings.com/225427/letterpress}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to having printed letterpress invitations, the beauty and texture became appealing to couples who began wanting letterpress invitations instead of engraved, thermographed, or offset-printed invitations.

===Education===
The movement has been helped by the emergence of a number of organizations that teach letterpress such as [[Columbia College Chicago]]'s [[Center for Book and Paper Arts (Columbia College Chicago)|Center for Book and Paper Arts]], [[Art Center College of Design]] and Armory Center for the Arts both in Pasadena, Calif., New York's [[Center for Book Arts]], [[Studio on the Square]] and [[The Arm NYC]], the Wells College Book Arts Center in Aurora, New York, the [[San Francisco Center for the Book]], Bookworks, Seattle's [[School of Visual Concepts]], Olympia's [[The Evergreen State College]], [[Black Rock Press – University of Nevada, Reno|Black Rock Press]], [[North Carolina State University]], Washington D.C's Corcoran College of Art and Design, [[Penland School of Crafts]], the [[Minnesota Center for Book Arts]], the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, CA, Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, and the Bowehouse Press at VCU in Richmond, VA.

===Economical materials===
Affordable copper, magnesium and photopolymer platemakers and milled aluminum bases have allowed letterpress printers to produce type and images derived from digital artwork, fonts and scans. Economical plates have encouraged the rise of "digital letterpress" in the 21st century, allowing a small number of firms to flourish commercially and enabling a larger number of boutique and hobby printers to avoid the limitations and complications of acquiring and composing metal type. At the same time there has been a renaissance in small-scale [[Type foundry|type foundries]] to produce new metal type on Monotype equipment, Thompson casters and the original American Type Founders machines.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Process==
The process of letterpress printing consists of several stages: composition, imposition and lock-up, and printing. In a small shop, all would occur in a single room, whereas in larger printing plants, such as with urban newspapers and magazines, each might form a distinct department with its own room, or even floor.

===Composition===
[[File:Handsatz Zubehoer.jpg|thumb|Tools for composing by hand: block of type tied up, a [[composing stick]], a bodkin, and string, all resting in a type galley.]]
{{main article|Typesetting}}
Composition, or typesetting, is the stage where pieces of movable type are assembled to form the desired text. The person charged with composition is called a "compositor" or "typesetter", setting letter by letter and line by line.

Traditionally, as in manual composition, it involves selecting the individual type letters from a [[type case]], placing them in a [[composing stick]], which holds several lines, then transferring those to a larger type galley. By this method the compositor gradually builds out the text of an individual page letter by letter. In mechanical typesetting, it may involve using a keyboard to select the type, or even cast the desired type on the spot, as in [[hot metal typesetting]], which are then added to a galley designed for the product of that process. The first keyboard-actuated typesetting machines to be widely accepted, the [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] and the [[Monotype]], were introduced in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

The Ludlow Typograph Machine, for casting of type-high slugs from hand-gathered brass matrices, was first manufactured in Chicago in 1912 and was widely used until the 1980s. Many are still in use and although no longer manufactured, service and parts are still available for them.

After a galley is assembled to fill a page's worth of type, the type is tied together into a single unit so that it may be transported without falling apart. From this bundle a [[galley proof]] is made, which is inspected by a proof-reader to make sure that the particular page is accurate.

===Imposition===
[[File:New Testament in chase.jpg|thumb|A single-page forme for printing the front page of the [[New Testament]]. The black frame surrounding it is the "chase", and the two objects each on the bottom and left side are the "[[Quoin (printing)|quoins]]"]]
{{main article|Imposition}}
Broadly, imposition or imposing is the process by which the tied assemblages of type are converted into a form (or forme) ready to use on the press. A person charged with imposition is a stoneman or stonehand, doing their work on a large, flat imposition stone (though some later ones were instead made of iron).

In the more specific modern sense, imposition is the technique of arranging the various pages of type with respect to one another. Depending on page size and the sheet of paper used, several pages may be printed at once on a single sheet. After printing, these are cut and trimmed before folding or binding. In these steps, the imposition process ensures that the pages face the right direction and in the right order with the correct margins. Printing formes are put together in multiples of 12 pages.{{dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- This seems to vary? --&gt; The stonehand arranges the pages in such a way that the folios (page numbers) of facing pages add up to the form's total + 1 (12 + 1 = 13, 24 + 1 = 25 etc.){{why|date=February 2018}}

Low-height pieces of wood or metal [[Furniture (typesetting)|furniture]] are added to make up the blank areas of a page. The printer uses a mallet to strike a wooden block, which ensures tops (and only the tops) of the raised type blocks are all aligned so they will contact a flat sheet of paper simultaneously.

Lock-up is the final step before printing. The printer removes the cords that hold the type together, and turns the [[Quoin (printing)|quoins]] with a key or lever to lock the entire complex of type, blocks, furniture, and chase (frame) into place.  This creates the final forme, which the printer takes to the printing press. In a newspaper setting, each page needs a truck to be transported – 2 pages need 2 trucks hence the term ''double truck''. The first copy is proofed again for errors before starting the printing run.

===Printing===
{{main article|Printing press}}
The working of the printing process depends on the type of press used, as well as any of its associated technologies (which varied by time period).

Hand presses generally required two people to operate them: one to ink the type, the other to work the press. Later mechanized [[jobbing press]]es require a single operator to feed and remove the paper, as the inking and pressing are done automatically.

The completed sheets are then taken to dry and for finishing, depending on the variety of printed matter being produced. With newspapers, they are taken to a [[folding machine]]. Sheets for books are sent for [[bookbinding]].

You can distinguish a traditional letterpress printer from a digital printer by its debossed lettering. A traditional letterpress printer made a heavy impression into the stock and producing any indentation at all into the paper would have resulted in the print run being rejected. Part of the skill of operating a traditional letterpress printer was to adjust the machine pressures just right so that the type just kissed the paper, transferring the minimum amount of ink to create the crispest print with no indentation. This was very important as when the print exited the machine and was stacked having too much wet ink and an indentation would have increased the risk of set-off (ink passing from the front of one sheet onto the back of the next sheet on the stack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meridianpress.co.uk/blog/45/thoughts-on-traditional-letterpress-printing | title=Thoughts on traditional letterpress printing | website=Meridian Press | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129141131/http://www.meridianpress.co.uk/blog/45/thoughts-on-traditional-letterpress-printing | archivedate=November 29, 2014 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photopolymer Plates===
{{main article|Photopolymer}}
The letterpress printing process remained virtually unchanged until the 1950s when it was replaced with the more efficient and commercially viable [[offset printing]] process. The labor-intensive nature of the [[typesetting]] and need to store vast amounts of lead or wooden type resulted in the letterpress printing process falling out of favour.

In the 1980s dedicated letterpress practitioners revived the old craft by embracing a new manufacturing method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 4427759 | status = patent | gdate = 1984-January-24 | fdate = 1982-January-21 | pridate = 1982-January-21 | invent1 = Gruetzmacher, Robert R. | invent2 = Munger, Stanley H. | assign1 = E. I. Du Pont De Nemours And Company | title = Process for preparing an overcoated photopolymer printing plate }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed them to create raised surface printing plates from a negative and a [[photopolymer plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 4320188 | status = patent | gdate = 1982-March-16 | fdate = 1980-October-17 | pridate = 1979-October-18 | invent1 = Heinz, Gerhard | invent2 = Richter, Peter | invent3 = Jun, Mong-Jon |assign1 = Basf Aktiengesellschaft | title = Photopolymerizable compositions containing elastomers and photo-curable elements made therefrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photopolymer plates are light sensitive. On one side the surface is cured when it is exposed to [[ultraviolet light]] and other side is a metal or plastic backing that can be mounted on a base. The [[relief printing]] surface is created by placing a [[negative (photography)|negative]] of the piece to be printed on the photosensitive side of the plate; the light passing through the clear regions of the negative causes the photopolymer to harden. The unexposed areas remain soft and can be washed away with water.

With these new printing plates, designers were no longer inhibited by the limitations of handset wooden or lead type. New design possibilities emerged and the letterpress printing process experienced a revival. Today it is in high demand for [[wedding stationery]] however there are limitations to what can be printed and designers must adhere to some design for letterpress principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Designing for Letterpress | url=https://www.magva.com/designing-for-letterpress | website=MAGVA Design + Letterpress | accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants on the letterpress==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
The invention of ultra-violet curing inks has helped keep the rotary letterpress alive in areas like self-adhesive labels. There is also still a large amount of [[flexography|flexographic printing]], a similar process, which uses rubber plates to print on curved or awkward surfaces, and a lesser amount of [[relief print]]ing from huge wooden letters for lower-quality poster work.

Rotary letterpress machines are still used on a wide scale for printing self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which are as good as any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP ([[Computer to plate|computer-to-plate]]) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no [[anilox]] roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an [[Offset printing|offset]] press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. – and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes. But as the letterpress machines are the same like a decade before, they can furthermore only be used with one colour of choice simultaneously. If there are more colours needed, they have to be exchanged one after the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letterjazz.com/#letterpress|title=characteristics of letterpress|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Craftsmanship==
{{Howto|section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Wood letterpress blocks.jpg|thumb|left|Wooden type for English printing]]
Letterpress can produce work of high quality at high speed, but it requires much time to adjust the press for varying thicknesses of type, engravings, and plates called makeready.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; The process requires a high degree of craftsmanship, but in the right hands, letterpress excels at fine typography. It is used by many small presses that produce fine, handmade, limited-edition books, [[artists' books]], and high-end [[ephemera]] such as greeting cards and [[street literature|broadsides]]. Because of the time needed to make letterpress plates and to prepare the press, setting type by hand has become less common with the invention of the [[photopolymer]] plate, a photosensitive plastic sheet that can be mounted on metal to bring it up to type high.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

To bring out the best attributes of letterpress, printers must understand the capabilities and advantages of what can be a very unforgiving medium. For instance, since most letterpress equipment prints only one color at a time, printing multiple colors requires a separate press run in register with the preceding color. When offset printing arrived in the 1950s, it cost less, and made the color process easier.&lt;ref name="Making an Impression"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bednar|first1=Joseph|title=Making an Impression|work=BusinessWest|date=November 23, 2010|url=http://businesswest.com/blog/making-an-impression-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inking system on letterpress equipment is the same as offset presses, posing problems for some graphics. Detailed, white (or "knocked out") areas, such as small, [[serif]] type, or very fine [[halftone]] surrounded by fields of color can fill in with ink and lose definition if Rollers are not adjusted correctly. However, a skilled printer overcomes most of these problems. However, a letterpress provides the option of a wider range of paper, including handmade, organic, and tree-free. Letterpress printing provides a wide range of production choices. The classic feel and finish of letterpress papers takes printing back to an era of quality and craftsmanship. Even the smell of the ink, more apparent on a letterpress-printed page than with offset, may appeal to collectors.

While less common in contemporary letterpress printing, it is possible to print halftone photographs, via photopolymer plates. However, letterpress printing's strengths are crisp lines, patterns, and typography.

===Creating artwork===
Creating files for letterpress is similar to conventional printing.
* Ink Color: Files are created  using [[spot color]]s, or [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] not [[RGB color model|RGB]]. A [[spot color]] is specified for each color used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Hans E. J. |last=Neugebauer|translator1-last=Wyble|translator1-first=D.|translator2-last=Kraushaar|translator2-first=A.|date=2005|title=The Theoretical Basis of Multi color Letterpress Printing|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|volume=30|issue=5|pages=322-331|doi=10.1002/col.20135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper Color: Dark ink on a light paper gives the best image. Inks are translucent and the paper color shows through. For light colors on dark paper, printers use [[foil stamping]] or [[engraving]] instead of letterpress. To build up color density, letterpress pieces can be run through the press two times using the same color.
* Screens: [[Gray-scale]] images can be used if made with a coarse screen (85 line or less). A second color should be used instead of screening a color in most cases.
* Thickness: Art must be above ¼ point and with no hairlines.
* [[Font]]s: Type must be five points or larger for best results. For reversed type the point size should be 12-point or larger, as smaller type with its thin stroke can fill in, or plug. An [[Computer font|outline stroke]] is often applied to allow for ink gain.
* Solids: Letterpress solids print differently than conventionally printed [[Lithography|lithographic]] solids. While letterpress does lay down a thick film of ink, the process tends to show the texture of the sheet. Also, solid areas do not give the appearance of depth that fine type and thin lines do. Solid areas can also cause the paper to ripple, especially on thinner sheets.
* [[Printing registration|Registration]]: Letterpress does register well, however, it does not have the capabilities of modern [[offset printing]]. [[Trap (printing)|Trapping]] and key lines do not work well in letterpress printing. A blank area should be incorporated between colors. Black and very dark colors may be overprinted over lighter colors.
* Depth: The type depth is dependent on the paper. Typically, letterpress papers are thick and soft so the type creates a deep impression. When making fold-over items, the printer typically backs off the pressure to avoid embossing the backside of the piece.
* Image and File Prep:  Letterpress excels at line copy and type, so vector images work well. Crop marks should be shown as a register color. Images need to [[Bleed (printing)|bleed]] (extend past the trim line).
* [[Die cutting (web)|Die cut]], [[Embossing (paper)|Emboss]] and Scores: These effects work well with most Letterpress paper. Images to emboss or die cut are called out in a different color layer (typically magenta). Scores are typically indicated with a cyan line. Any intricate shapes or patterns should be reviewed with the printer. For thick cover stocks many printers use a "kiss cut" (partially through the stock) rather than a score.
* [[Envelope]]s: It is best to print on the flap of a ready-made envelope. Other areas of the ready-made envelopes can be printed, but bruising can occur on the other side of the envelope.&lt;ref name="Boxcar Press File Prep"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boxcar Press File Preparation|url=https://www.boxcarpress.com/file-preparation/|publisher=Boxcar Press|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several dozen colleges and universities around the United States have either begun or re-activated programs teaching letterpress printing in fully equipped facilities. In many cases these letterpress shops are affiliated with the college's library or art department, and in others they are independent, student-run operations or extracurricular activities sponsored by the college. The College &amp; University Letterpress Printers' Association (CULPA) was founded in 2006 by Abigail Uhteg at the Maryland Institute College of Art to help these schools stay connected and share resources. Many universities offer degree programs such as: [[Oregon College of Art and Craft]], Southwest School of Art, [[Middle Tennessee State University]], [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Indiana University]], [[Miami University]], [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]], and [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Letterpress Commons Degree Programs"&gt;{{cite web|website=Letterpress Commons|title=Matriculated Programs|url=https://letterpresscommons.com/matriculated-programs/#Map_of_Matriculated_Programs|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current renaissance of letterpress printing has created a crop of hobby press shops that are owner-operated and driven by a love of the craft. Several larger printers have added an environmental component to the venerable art by using only [[Renewable energy#Wind power|wind-generated electricity]] to drive their presses and plant equipment.
Notably, a few small boutique letterpress shops are using only solar power.

In [[Berkeley, California]], letterpress printer and lithographer [[David Goines]] maintains a studio with a variety of platen and cylinder letterpresses as well as lithography presses.&lt;ref name="berkeleyside.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Citrawireja|first1=Melati|title=A visit with David Goines: Berkeley's legendary letterpress printer and lithographer|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/07/22/david-goines-berkeleys-legendary-letterpress-printer-and-lithographer/|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=Berkleyside|date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has drawn attention both from commercial printers and fine artists for his wide knowledge and meticulous skill with letterpress printing. He collaborated with restaurateur and free speech activist [[Alice Waters]], the owner of [[Chez Panisse]], on her book ''30 Recipes Suitable for Framing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=Alice|title=30 Recipes Suitable for Framing}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has created strikingly colorful large posters for such [[Bay Area]] businesses and institutions as [[Acme Bread]] and [[UC Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="berkeleyside.com"/&gt;

In London, [[St Bride Library]] houses a large collection of letterpress information in its collection of 50,000 books: all the classic works on printing technique, visual style, typography, graphic design, calligraphy and more. This is one of the world's foremost collections and is located off Fleet Street in the heart of London's old printing and publishing district. In addition, regular talks, conferences, exhibitions and demonstrations take place.

The St Bride Institute, [[Edinburgh College of Art]], [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]], [[The Arts University Bournemouth]], [[Plymouth University]], University for the Creative Arts Farnham, London College of Communication and Camberwell College of the Arts London run short courses in letterpress as well as offering these facilities as part of their Graphic Design Degree Courses.

The [[Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum]] in [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin]] houses one of the largest collections of wood type and wood cuts in the world inside one of the Hamilton Manufacturing Company's factory buildings. Also included are presses and vintage prints. The museum holds many workshops and conferences throughout the year and regularly welcomes groups of students from Universities from across the United States.

In 2011 John Bonadies and Jeff Adams created a virtual letterpress that runs on an iPad (and later the Mac) and replicates each step of the letterpress process. [[LetterMpress]] was funded from a [[Kickstarter]] campaign enabling the developers to collect and digitize wood type from around the world. The app's press is modeled after a Vandercook SP-15 (considered to be a top-of-the-line proof press in its time, and coveted by artists and designers today).

In 2015 a renaissance of letterpress printing by artists is widely acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/arts/design/artists-find-an-audience-for-painstaking-letterpress-printing.html | title=Artists Find an Audience for Painstaking Letterpress Printing | work=The New York Times | date=February 4, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | author=Hoinski, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louise Cochrane''' (22 December 1918&amp;nbsp;– 13 February 2012) was an American-born writer and television producer best known for creating the [[BBC]] Children's TV programme ''[[Rag, Tag and Bobtail]]'' in the early 1950s. She also wrote a series of career guidance books for young people and a biography of the 12th-century philosopher [[Adelard of Bath]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

==Early life==
Louise Cochrane (née Morley) was born in New York on 22 December 1918.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; Her father, [[Christopher Morley]],  was a writer. After attending [[Hunter College High School]] she enrolled at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania to study politics. After graduating in 1940&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt; she spent a short time working for [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], wife of American President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. Later that year she joined the [[International Student Service]],{{efn|name=ISS}} with responsibility for organising its conference programme. There in 1942 she met Scotsman [[Peter Cochrane (soldier)|Peter Cochrane]], a delegate visiting from Britain,&lt;ref name=Scotsman/&gt; within a year she had joined him in England,&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; and the couple were married a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

==Career==
Cochrane joined the BBC in 1948 as a producer of schools' news and current affairs programmes, and was appointed to the [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Commission]] two years later.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; In 1953 Cochrane wrote the first of her 26 episodes of ''[[Rag, Tag and Bobtail]]'',&lt;ref name=BFIScreenonline/&gt; a children's television series that "continues to be remembered with affection". She also wrote a series of four books giving career guidance for young people.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

In 1958 Cochrane moved with her husband and two daughters to Sussex, where she took up secondary school teaching. Ten years later the family moved to the area around  [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], which along with her keen interest in mathematics, and geometry in particular,&lt;ref name=Scotsman/&gt; triggered Cochrane's long-standing interest in the 12th-century philosopher [[Adelard of Bath]], of whom she published a biography in 1994.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

==Later life==
The Cochranes relocated to Edinburgh in 1979, where Louise remained active despite her failing eyesight. She died on 13 February 2012 aged 93, survived by her husband and daughters Alison and Janet.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

Publishing houses in the city range from industry giants such as [[Penguin Group (USA)]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Random House]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], and [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] to small niche houses like Melville House and [[Lee &amp; Low Books]].

In the earliest days of the American film industry, New York was the epicenter of filmmaking. However, the drier weather of Hollywood and tax incentives offered at the time by filming in Los Angeles made California a better choice for film production throughout much of the 20th century. The [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] film studio, built during the [[silent film]] era, was used by the [[Marx Brothers]] and [[W.C. Fields]], and has expanded its footprint in [[Queens]]. It has also been used for ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and the films of [[Woody Allen]]. The recently constructed [[Steiner Studios]] is a 15-acre (61,000 m²) modern movie studio complex in a former shipyard where ''The Producers'' and ''The Inside Man'', a [[Spike Lee]] movie, were filmed.

New York was, and to a certain extent still is, also important within the animation industry. Until 1938, it served as the home of Fleischer Studios (who produced the [[Popeye]], [[Betty Boop]], and [[Color Classics]] shorts for [[Paramount Pictures]]) as well as the Van Beuren Studios (who produced animated shorts for [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]) until 1937. It would later be the home for Famous Studios (who replaced Fleischer Studios and continued the production of Popeye shorts for Paramount) from 1943 to the 1960s. Its current position in the animation world is as an alternative to Los Angeles (where most U.S. animation is produced), and the city now houses several schools and school programs concerning animation, and stands as a source of work for animators working for any medium, from advertising to film.

[[Silvercup Studios]] has expanded in [[Long Island City, Queens]] with numerous soundstages, production and studio support space, offices for media and entertainment companies, stores, 1,000 apartments in [[high-rise]] towers, a catering hall and a cultural institution, built at the edge of the [[East River]] in Queens, overlooking [[Manhattan]], and maintaining its status as the largest production house on the [[East Coast of the United States| U.S. East Coast]]. Steiner Studios in [[Brooklyn]] still has the largest individual soundstage, however. [[Miramax Films]], a [[Big Ten (movie studios)|Big Ten]] film studio, was the largest motion picture distribution and production company headquartered in the city until it moved to [[Burbank, California]] in January 2010. Many smaller independent producers and distributors are located in New York.

===Magazines===
New York City has a long history in American magazine publishing. The 19th century was rife with popular titles: ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' launched in 1857, claiming to be "A Journal of Civilization" to readers; ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'', founded by Scribner's in 1873, was a pioneering children's publication; and ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', founded in 1888 by Peter Fenelon Collier, counted [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] as contributors. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, founded in 1968 by [[Milton Glaser]] and [[Clay Felker]], was one of the first [[Lifestyle magazine|"lifestyle" magazines]]. ''[[The New Yorker]]'', founded in 1925 by [[Harold Ross]], is a weekly magazine of arts, literature, and journalism.

At one point, more than 350 magazines have their editorial offices based in the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} New York is home to the corporate headquarters of such publishing giants as:{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Music===
{{Main|Music of New York City}}

In the 1930s, New York-based [[RCA]] was the nation's largest manufacturer of [[phonograph]]s. In the late 19th and early 20th century, most sheet music in the United States — especially the popular songs of the day, many now standards — was printed at [[Tin Pan Alley]], so called because the constant sound of new songs being tried out on pianos in the publishing houses was said to sound like a tin pan. By the early 1960s the radio and musical stars of the Golden Age of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] gave way to the [[Brill Building]]'s "Brill Sound".

[[Salsa music]], which got its start in New York City in the mid-1960s, was popularized by the New York record label [[Fania Records]], which developed a highly polished "Fania sound" that came to be synonymous with salsa.

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] labels including [[Def Jam]], [[Roc-A-Fella]] and [[Bad Boy Records]] were founded in New York, creating what is known as [[East Coast hip hop]]. These labels continue to be among the largest hip-hop labels in the world. Other influential New York-based hip hop labels, past and present, include [[Cold Chillin' Records]], [[Jive Records]], [[Loud Records]], [[Rawkus Records]] and [[Tommy Boy Records]].

Two of the [[music industry|"Big Four" music labels]] are headquartered in the city: [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Warner Music Group]]. The world headquarters of [[MTV]] is also in New York.

Many major music magazines are headquartered in the city as well, including ''[[Blender Magazine]]'', ''[[Punk Magazine]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref name="Gotham"&gt;{{cite web|title=Has the Music Scene Died in New York?|work=Gotham Gazette|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/20041217/1/1218|accessdate=September 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
New York City is home to 4 of the 10 largest papers in the United States. These include ''[[The New York Times]]'' (circulation 1.1 million), the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' (circulation 795,000), and ''[[New York Post]]'' (circulation 650,000).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (circulation 2.1 million), published in New York City, is a national-scope business newspaper and the first or second most-read newspaper in the nation, depending on measurement method.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[File:NYC subway riders with their newspapers.jpg|thumb|left|Straphangers use newspapers on New York's [[Mass transit in New York City|mass transit]] system.]]
''[[El Diario La Prensa]]'' (circulation 265,000) is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor &amp; Publisher International Year Book 2004". Found at infoplease.com.[http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0004420.html]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several borough-specific newspapers, such as ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'' and ''[[The Staten Island Advance]]''. [[Free daily newspaper]]s mainly distributed to commuters include ''[[amNewYork]]'', ''[[Hoy (U.S. newspaper)|Hoy]]'' and ''[[Metro New York]]''.  In addition to the print newspapers, ''[[BKLYNER]]'' is the leading daily digital news publication reporting on local news and events in Brooklyn.

The city's ethnic press is large and diverse. Major ethnic publications include the Roman Catholic diocesan paper for Brooklyn-Queens, ''[[The Tablet (Diocese of Brooklyn)|The Tablet]]'' and [[Jewish-American]] newspapers ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' (פֿאָרװערטס; ''Forverts'', published in [[Yiddish]] and [[English language|English]]) (founded in 1897), and [[African-American newspapers]], including the long-time newspaper ''[[The New York Amsterdam News]]'' (founded in 1909) and [[Brooklyn]]-based [[Our Time Press]]. ''[[The Epoch Times]]'', an international newspaper published by the [[Falun Gong]], has English and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] editions in New York. There are seven dailies published in the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and four in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Multiple daily papers are published in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Korean language|Korean]], and other weekly newspapers serve dozens of different ethnic communities, with ten separate newspapers focusing on the African-American community alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gothamgazette.com/commentary/80.scher.shtml "New York City's Ethnic Press"]. ''Gotham Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many nationally distributed ethnic newspapers are based in Astoria, Chinatown or Brooklyn. Over 60 ethnic groups, writing in 42 languages, publish some 300 non-English language magazines and newspapers in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indypressny.org Independent Press Association of New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic variation is not the only measure of the diversity of New York City's newspapers, with editorial opinions running from left-leaning at alternative papers like the ''[[Village Voice]]'', to conservative at the ''[[New York Post]]''. ''[[New York Observer]]'' covers politics and the city's rich and powerful with unusual depth. The tradition of a [[freedom of the press|free press]] owes much to [[John Peter Zenger]], a New York publisher who was acquitted in his 1735 landmark court case, setting the precedent that truth was a legitimate defense against accusations of [[Slander and libel|libel]].

Major newspapers emphasizing coverage of the New York metropolitan region outside the city include ''[[Newsday]]'', which covers primarily Long Island but also New York City, (especially [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]]), ''[[The Journal News]]'', which covers Westchester County, to the north along the [[Hudson River]] and ''[[The Bergen Record]]'' and ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] which cover northern [[New Jersey]] across the [[New York Bay]] and Hudson River to the west.

===Online media===

New York City's digital companies, sometimes described as "[[Silicon Alley]]", include both software companies and companies known primarily as content producers. Among the former are [[Tumblr]] (now owned by [[Yahoo!]]), [[FourSquare]] and [[AOL]]. Among the latter are [[Gawker Media]], [[BuzzFeed]], and some of AOL's holdings, including [[HuffPost]] and [[Weblogs, Inc.]] The satirical newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' (online-only since 2013) was based in New York from 2000 to 2012.

===Radio===
New York City has a tradition as an important place in radio broadcasting. [[Edward R. Murrow]] defined American broadcast journalism with his [[World War II]] reporting from Europe relayed back to [[CBS]] in New York and onward to the rest of the nation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[WNYC]], New York's flagship [[public radio]] station, is the most-listened to commercial or non-commercial radio station in Manhattan and has the largest audience of any public radio station in the United States. It produces several news and cultural programs for national syndication.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The current [[WQXR-FM]], a [[public radio]] station, is the New York City's only [[Classical music|classical]] radio station.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The former WQXR-FM (today [[WXNY-FM]]), is now a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] station as of November 1, 2009. The license was formerly owned by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and swapped with the former WCAA (today [[WQXR-FM]]) with ''[[Univision]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1331450&amp;Service=FM&amp;Form_id=314&amp;Facility_id=29022 Application for Consent to Assignment of Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License] - FCC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WQXR sale"&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/1176/classical-96-3-wqxr-new-york-sold-to-univision/ Classical 96.3 WQXR New York Sold To Univision/WNYC] - Radio Insight&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WQXR Sale 2"&gt;[http://www.wnyc.org/press/radio-purchases-wqxr-from-the-new-york-times-preserving-a-station-dedicated-to-classical/ WNYC Radio Purchases WQXR from The New York Times, Preserving a Station Dedicated to Classical Music on the NYC Airwaves] - New York Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' sold WCAA and the intellectual property of WQXR-FM (call letters and format) to the New York Public Radio.&lt;ref name="WQXR sale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WQXR Sale 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1321811&amp;Service=FM&amp;Form_id=314&amp;Facility_id=46978 Application for Consent to Assignment of Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License] - FCC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ao4vtybp2N50 New York Times to Get $45 Million for Radio Station] - Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WBAI]] in Manhattan, with news and information programming, is one of the few [[socialist]] radio stations operating in the United States.

Fordham University's [[WFUV]], New York University's [[WNYU]] and Columbia University's [[WKCR]] are also important non-commercial stations in the city.

The first New York City radio station to feature a phone-in talk format was [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in the late 1960s, (with [[Long John Nebel]] in the early morning hours) but the format began in earnest in New York in 1970, when [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] radio dropped its "Good Guys" top-40 radio format in favor of the "Dial-Log Radio" slate of call-in shows. In addition to mainstay [[Barry Gray (radio)|Barry Gray]], the format featured such prominent talkers as Nebel, [[Alex Bennett (broadcaster)|Alex Bennett]] and [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]].

Right-wing talk radio came to New York when [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] switched from an all music format to talk in 1982. Though it began with a moribund "Talkradio" format delivered via satellite from KABC Los Angeles, the station eventually became the home of nationally syndicated conservative powerhouse [[Rush Limbaugh]], who in the Reagan years railed against liberal figures like civil-rights advocate [[Jesse Jackson]] and former New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]]. Other high-profile conservative talk radio hosts with national profiles include [[Laura Ingraham]] and [[Sean Hannity]] at WABC.

Liberals responded, first with the short-lived (only nine years) [[WEVD]] format with [[Bill Mazer]]'s ''Mazer in the morning'' and [[Sam Greenfield]] in the afternoon followed by [[Alan Colmes]] from 11 PM to 2AM. In March 2004 the [[Air America Radio]] network started, based in New York City, with actor-comedians [[Al Franken]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]] as their front line stars. A personality who goes by one name, "Lionel", who was a host on WABC also joined the Air America's New York local lineup. Air American's flagship station was originally [[WLIB]], then [[WWRL]] at the time of its January 2010 demise. WWRL and listener supported [[WBAI]] continue broadcasting progressive talk.

New York is also home to several famous "[[shock jock]]" morning drive shows. They include the new current flavor [[Opie and Anthony]] as well as old timer [[Don Imus]], (famous for his controversial statements, interviews of politicos and morning satire) and [[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]] on [[WHTZ|Z100]]. The nation's first female shock jock, [[Wendy Williams (radio host)|Wendy Williams]], had a popular syndicated afternoon show on Urban AC [[WBLS]] from 2002-2009. [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]], formerly known as 92.3 "K-Rock", used to be the home of [[Howard Stern]] until his move from terrestrial radio to [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], though Stern still broadcasts from New York City.

[[WQHT (FM)|WQHT]], also known as "Hot 97", is an influential high-profile commercial radio station that is arguably the nation's premier [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] station. [[Doctor Dré]] and [[Ed Lover]] were morning hosts at the station in the 1990s. The highest-rated Spanish-language radio show in the United States is the morning radio program ''[[El Vacilón de la Mañana]]'', broadcast on [[WSKQ]] and formerly hosted by [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jimenez]].

New York became home to America's first 24-hour @ talk station, [[WFAN]], in 1987.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Television===
New York City is the home of the three traditional major American [[television network]]s, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], as well as Spanish-language network [[Univision]]. They each have local broadcast owned and operated stations which serve as the flagship stations of their networks.

It is also the headquarters of several large cable television channels, including [[MTV]], [[Fox News]], [[HBO]], and [[Comedy Central]]. [[Silvercup Studios]], located in [[Queens]] was the production facility for the popular television shows ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. MTV broadcasts programming from its sound stage overlooking [[Times Square]], several blocks away from The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], the theater housing the ''[[Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''. ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is broadcast from NBC's studios at 30 [[Rockefeller Center]], where ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' and ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' is also taped. [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] is headquartered on 57th Street. ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' is produced by [[Comedy Central]] on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]], and ''[[The Daily Show]]'', also produced by Comedy Central, is produced just a few blocks over on 11th avenue and West 53rd street. Glenn Beck's The Blaze TV has a studio in Manhattan. Over a thousand people are involved with producing the various ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' television series. In 2005 there were more than 100 new and returning television shows taped in New York City, according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.

[[WNET]], New York's largest public television station, is a primary national provider of [[PBS]] programming. The oldest [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] in the United States is the [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]], well known for its eclectic [[Public-access television|local origination]] programming that ranges from a jazz hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming. There are eight other Public-access television channels in New York, including Brooklyn Community Access Television (BCAT). As part of use of local rights-of-way, the cable operators in New York have granted [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) organizations channels for programming. They also carry the [[New York State]] legislative channel available on cable packages with sufficient bandwidth.

Another notable channel in the city is [[NY1]], established in 1992 as [[Time Warner Cable]]'s first local news channel and acquired with the rest of Time Warner Cable by [[Charter Communications]] in May 2016. NY1 is known for its beat coverage of city neighborhoods, and its coverage of [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] and state politics is closely watched by political insiders.

For years, several soap operas were filmed in the New York City area, including ''Another World'', ''As the World Turns'', ''Guiding Light'', ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live''. As of 2012, there are no New York soap operas left on the air.

==Portrayals of New York City in the media==
Because of its sheer size and cultural influence, New York City has been the subject of many different, and often contradictory, portrayals in mass media. From the sophisticated and worldly metropolis seen in many [[Woody Allen]] films, to the hellish and chaotic urban jungle depicted in such movies as [[Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese's]] ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), New York has served as the unwitting backdrop for virtually every conceivable viewpoint on big city life.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In the early years of film New York City was characterized as urbane and sophisticated. By the city's crisis period in the 1970s, however, films like ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' (1974) showed New York as full of chaos and violence. With the city's renaissance in the 1990s came new portrayals on television; ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', and ''[[Sex and the City]]'' showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' and the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' film series, continue to use the city as their setting despite New York's status as the safest large city in the United States after plummeting crime rates over many years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.safewise.com/blog/safest-metro-cities/&lt;/ref&gt;

An essay appearing in the Arts section of ''The New York Times'' in April 2006 quoted several filmmakers, including [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Paul Mazursky]], describing how modern cinema shows the city as far more "teeming, terrifying, exhilarating, unforgiving" than contemporary New York actually is, and the consequential challenge this poses for filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/movies/30clar.html "New York City as Film Set: From Mean Streets to Clean Streets"]. ''The New York Times'' April 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The article quotes Robert Greenhut, [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] producer, as saying that despite the increased sanitization of modern New York, "New Yorkers' personalities are different to Chicago. There's a certain kind of vibrancy and tone that you can't get elsewhere. The labor pool is more interesting than elsewhere — the salesgirl with one line, or the cop. That's who directors are looking for."

'''Ngongo ya Chintu''', known as the '''Master of Buli''', (19th Century) was a sculptor of [[Luba art]] in what is today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="Heroic"&gt;LaGamma, Alisa (2011). ''Heroic Africans: Legendary Leaders, Iconic Sculptures'', Metropolitan Museum of Art publications, New York. {{ISBN|1588394328}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of his life, but his work has been collected internationally and he was said to be well respected in his home village.&lt;ref name="Heroic" /&gt;

==Life and career==
[[File:Ngono ya Chintu caryatid stool.jpg|thumb|Caryatid figure by Ngongo ya Chintu]]
Ngongo ya Chintu (an honorific title meaning "the great leopard, the father of sculpted things"&lt;ref name="Heroic" /&gt;) worked in what was then the [[Kingdom of Luba]] somewhere in between 1810 and 1870.&lt;ref name="Heroic" /&gt; He carried on a long tradition of [[Hemba]] art. Hemba sculpture usually honored prominent male leaders of the tribe. Ngongo ya Chintu carved both ancestor figures and female figures such as vessel bearers and caryatids which served as stools for leaders.

==Style==

According to Alisa LaGamma in ''Heroic Africans: Legendary Leaders, Iconic Sculptures'':&lt;ref name="Heroic" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artist's signature expressionistic style features exaggeration of the face and hands through elongation, which allowed him to reinterpret and ingeniously exploit the formal possibilities of different genres of prestige sculpture: standing figures as [[caryatid]] supports for seats...seated ''mboko'' (bowl bearers)...and stately male figures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery and Collection==

In the 1930s, Belgian art historian Frans Olbrechts that ten figures being put together for an exhibition shared similar characteristics, and that two had been collected in the same town, Buli.&lt;ref name="Heroic" /&gt; As nothing was yet known of the sculptor in Western circles, Olbrechts gave him the title "Master of Buli." In the 1970s Ngonogo ya Chintu was identified by the owners of one of his figures as being an artist from the village of Kateba. [[Marilyn Stokstad]] notes that villagers in Kateba knew of the master's work, as he was well regarded there.&lt;ref name="Stokstad2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilyn Stokstad|title=Art History, Volume One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAdiPgAACAAJ|date=August 2009|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-205-74835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PhD Comics Open Access Week 2012.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=7:58|A PhD Comics special on the occasion of [[Open Access Week]] 2012.]]
'''''Piled Higher and Deeper''''' (also known as '''''PhD Comics'''''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24phd-t.html?_r=1|title=The Joke Is on the Ph.D.|last=CHOE|first=JAYWON|date=22 July 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a newspaper and [[webcomic]] strip written and drawn by [[Jorge Cham]] that follows the lives of several [[grad student]]s.  First published in the fall of 1997 when Cham was a grad student himself at [[Stanford University]], the strip deals with issues of life in [[graduate school]], including the difficulties of scientific research, the perils of [[procrastination]], the complex student–supervisor relationship and the perpetual search for free food. Cham continued the strip as an Instructor in [[mechanical engineering]] at [[Caltech]], and now draws and gives talks about the strip full-time. Originally, the strip was drawn in crude black-and-white, eventually became grayscale, and finally became color in June 2004.

==Characters==
''Piled Higher and Deeper'' introduced its main characters early in its run, and their personalities have remained fairly constant during the strip's several years of publication. In the strip's first few seasons, the characters were clearly [[Stanford University]] students, though the number of school-specific references and jokes has decreased since.

===Students===
&lt;!--Please arrange alphabetically by last name, or by first name if the last name is unknown.--&gt;

* '''The Nameless Grad Student (a.k.a., The Nameless Hero)''' – a graduate student in engineering, this bespectacled protagonist has procrastinated through the entire strip without receiving a name. He bears a striking resemblance to the comic strip author, [[Jorge Cham]] (at one point, his younger sister Dee remarks that her brother has dreams of quitting grad school and becoming a [[cartoonist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Lil' sister|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=253|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=September 21, 2001|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the hero's background, although early on Mike Slackenerny states that he knew the hero's older brother (who quit his PhD and went on to work for a "[[Silicon Valley]] Company").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Mike Slackenerny: A PhD student needs not such things|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=40|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=February 11, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he is seen playing with two children at home during his winter vacation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Taking the laptop with me|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=802|date=December 20, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Scooped!: The Third ''Piled Higher &amp; Deeper'' Comic Strip Collection|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|publisher=Piled Higher &amp; Deeper, LLC|year=2008|isbn=978-0-9721695-3-0|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; he probably has younger siblings, nieces and/or nephews, or cousins. He has been increasingly seen with a set group of friends (one is named '''Mikkel''')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Dead Week|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=21|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 22, 1997|accessdate=April 23, 2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; and seems, at least marginally, to be the most favored graduate student of his advisor, Prof. Smith. At the conclusion of the film, the character states for the first time that his name is '''Winston''', named after Jorge's father; in the films, Winston is a Biochemistry grad student.
* '''Cecilia''' – An engineering student born around May 1, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia turned 25 in 2005: {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Birthday 2005|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=583|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May |accessdate=October 28, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier strips have her born in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia went to her 10 year high school reunion in 2001: {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=High School Reunion|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=268|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 14, 2001|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Cecilia spent years refusing to admit that she was truly a [[geek]] at heart. However, in one strip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=25 |title=Geeks Anonymous |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; she finally with hesitation admitted she is indeed a geek. She is also a programmer as well. Addicted to chocolate and cookies, she has long since taken enough classes and conducted enough research to graduate, but a mysterious psychological force keeps her in school.

During class, she deliberately wears frumpy clothes to discourage male interest, since the vast majority of her classmates are men.

* '''Michael Slackenerny''' – endlessly devious, remarkably clever and phenomenally lazy, Mike did his undergraduate at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Go Cardinal!|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=151|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 11, 1999|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet had been in graduate school for longer than anyone can remember (during one of his interviews it was strongly implied that he started grad school in the 1980s), surviving on ''[[ramen]]'' and free food from various events on campus. He views grad school not as a place but as "a state of mind [...] preferably sleeping".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Coming back to grad school|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=394|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=December 8, 2003|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1998, he drove to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with a seemingly foolproof plan to beat the [[blackjack]] tables, thereby winning enough money to solve Stanford's housing crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Slackenerny – going to Vegas|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=72|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May 22, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he returned with a wife, '''Jen''', who remained an [[unseen character]] for some time. Jen became pregnant with their daughter '''Sophy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Paternity leave|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=676|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=January 23, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed that way for several years, constantly urging Michael to finish his thesis and graduate. Michael finally completed his doctoral defense in 2005 – Jen went into labor just before his presentation began – but did not finish writing his thesis until 2007. After submitting his dissertation, Mike was seen walking home and asking himself, "Now what?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Now what?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=844|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of job-hunting, he was finally hired by Prof. Smith as a [[postdoc]].
* '''Tajel''' – an [[anthropologist]] and the lone social scientist in the main cast. She was Cecilia's roommate before she got married. She is a dedicated [[activism|activist]] who frequently attends or organizes rallies. Her frustration with U.S. politics is exacerbated by her not being a United States citizen. She is conversant in Spanish. Her mother is Indian and her father is Caucasian. She married Dr. Khumalo in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1118 |title=Drama! |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1135 |title=Tajel got married |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gerard''' – the strip's newest "official" character, he is a major in Medieval [[Scandinavia]]n Cultural Philosophy, who was personally introduced to readers by Tajel, supposedly in response to numerous letters from Humanities majors requesting their own character, and was meant to provide jokes on "obscure manuscripts, dead languages, and being the lowest paid grads on campus. Also, political correctness!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=907 |title=Humanities |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Gerard has only been shown twice after his initial introduction, apart from a cameo as a guest at Tajel's wedding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1134 |title=Tajel getting married, pt. 5 |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a joke on the obscurity and uselessness of his field.  His first actual storyline within the comic occurs when he is informed that funding has been cut for humanities majors and to leave the strip or find a more useful major, subsequently forcing him to justify why the comic should retain a humanities character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1170 |title=Budget cuts |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dee''' – the hero's younger sister.  She is an [[undergraduate student]] who has been seen taking the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]. She also talks on her [[cellular telephone]], eats quite a bit, and naps during class when she isn't doing something even more inappropriate, such as chatting or eating a full meal during a test. Dee once phones her "sister dearest", so the main character may have more than one sibling. Dee has a good male friend who she often spends time with and at one point hints that he may have romantic feelings for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=371 |title=Choosing grad schools |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the main character, he has not yet been named.
* '''Mariko''' – a [[Japan]]ese student in the same research field as the hero, she visits Prof. Smith's lab in 1998. Smith assigns her to work with "whoever is lowest in the lab hierarchy", which turns out to be the hero. During her brief stay, she inspires in him a powerful [[unrequited love|unrequited affection]], which he maintains for at least three years. She eventually quits her [[Ph.D.]] and starts her own company, at which the hero works briefly. She is still occasionally seen talking with the main character as he works, so her current status is somewhat murky.  On a strip dated 28 April 2010, entitled "Lost no more..?", she was seen in an alternate timeline as possibly being the mother of the Nameless Hero's (supposed) baby, with the Nameless Hero asking "WHAT IF I HAD STAYED IN ACADEMIA?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=PHD Comics: Lost no more...?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1310|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Steve''' (''aka. Golden Boy'') – Remarkably clever, sincere and "good boy". Steve has been in graduate school for two years and has already completed his thesis. In the lab hierarchy he is given more consideration than any of the post docs or research associates by Prof. Smith. He is extremely good in getting positive results and is always consulted by Prof. Smith for his opinion. His "good boy" image in comparison to the nameless hero is a running joke in the series.
* '''Allison''' – The sole female PhD student in Professor Smith's lab, which Smith and the other PhDs often forget to Allison's frustration.  Unlike her labmates, she is not distracted by sporting events like the World Cup and proves to have some measure of athletic ability during the students vs. professors baseball match.

* '''Professor Jones''' – Cecilia's research advisor; a typical graduate school professor, although seemingly older and kinder than Prof. Smith. He is clueless in giving Cecilia advice on non-research related topics such as her lovelife and future career and will ask for her help with small tasks, such as changing the font size of footnotes, while claiming it is urgent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1104 |title=Tech support |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the only reason he has time to see his wife is because he married his administrative assistant;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Bridge|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=880|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before he received tenure, he had already been divorced three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=875 |title=Simpler |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a daughter in 1st grade named Shelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Cingradella|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=601|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=July 4, 2005|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who is intelligent enough to fix Mike's work for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Kids!

* '''Dr. Patrick Khumalo''' –  An adjunct professor&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1811  The Dictionary Definition of Adjunct]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Anthropology Department's faculty, who Tajel eventually marries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1124 |title=Permission |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1135 |title=Tajel got married |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajel mistakes him for a first-year grad student when they first meet, possibly because she is older than he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=460 |title=Social |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Professor Rivera''' – Tajel's advisor. He apparently takes a laid-back approach to being an advisor, being entirely clueless as to Tajel's research interests, progress, and sometimes even her name. Once he praised a draft of a paper that Tajel had written, three months after Tajel had already submitted the final paper on due date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=855 | work=Pile Higher and Deeper | last=Cham | first=Jorge | title=Terrific Job | date=27 April 2007 | accessdate=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he is extremely elusive when needed, such as when Cecilia needed to find him for documents to allow Tajel to renew her visa, appearing only when Cecilia tried imagining he was the last person she wanted to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1045 |title=Only when you don't need them |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Professor Stein, the chair of the anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1127 |title=A very serious matter |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being aware that he lacks any apparent interest in Tajel's work, she is still stunned when he leaves for a position at another university&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1706  It's Official]&lt;/ref&gt; with only an offer of advising her remotely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1708  Remote Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Professor Galvez''' &amp;ndash; The head of the anthropology department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1847  Adoption]&lt;/ref&gt; who becomes Tajel's new advisor after discussion with the rest of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1848 Close match]&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to Rivera, Galvez apparently has a surly personality&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1897  Gotta Catch Them All]&lt;/ref&gt; and finds Tajel's emails to be too lengthy to bother reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1876  TL;DR]&lt;/ref&gt;

But even then, it is clear that Prof. Smith never got over her. When she encounters him at a scientific conference, taunting his work, he has no wits to reply and can only stare longingly at her, until she finally snaps him out of his trance. It is unclear whether she still harbors a buried affection for him in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=The PhD Movie 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2y_a7hL5M|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Smith's current wife presumably hopes not.

==Parodies==
[[Image:Jorge Chum at UIUC by Ragib.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorge Cham]] after his "Power of Procrastination" talk at [[UIUC]], March 8, 2007]]

The title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], which explains that if one knows what "[[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]]" stands for (in this context, "bullshit"), then "[[Master of Science|M.S.]]" stands for "More of the Same" (or "More Shit"), and "Ph.D." stands for "Piled Higher and Deeper".

One of Cham's recurring themes is to re-cast an item of [[popular culture]] in the grad-school milieu. Upon several occasions, the strip has included spoofs of popular movies, like ''The Thesis'' (''[[The Matrix]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=138 |title=What is... The Thesis? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raiders of the Lost Dissertation'' (''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=158 |title=Raiders of the lost dissertation |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''I, Grad Student'' (a mixture of the [[I, Robot|book]] and [[I, Robot (movie)|movie]] ''I, Robot''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=440 |title=I, Grad Student |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Summer days'' ([[Summer Nights (Grease song)|"Summer Nights"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=887 |title=Summer Days |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, Cham has parodied [[television]] programs like ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]],'' among others.

Jorge Cham has also parodied [[Newton's laws of motion]] as ''Newton's 3 Laws of Graduation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=221 |title=Newton`s Three Laws of Graduation |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the strip these laws of graduation were superseded by Einstein's ''Special Theory of Research Inactivity'', much as Newton's actual laws were superseded by Einstein's [[Special Theory of Relativity]].

Another series of strips takes up the modern debate about the proper use of the term "[[irony]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=200 |title=Irony? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip has also included several adaptations of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] as well as several [[propaganda]] posters. Captions for the latter include "This man does research for ''you!''", "When you procrastinate... Someone is watching!" and "Women in grad school... Support your local female geek."

Cham has also released two song parodies, purportedly sung by Tajel, in [[MP3]] format: "Closer to fine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=191 |title=Closer to Fine (Academic Version) |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Indigo Girls#Singles|Indigo Girls]]) and "Who will grade your work"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=194 |title=Who will grade your work? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]'').

==Books==

Five PhD comic books have been published so far. The first book, ''Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Comic Strip Collection'' (2002), contains production sketches and an [[afterword]] by Prof. Smith in addition to the comic strips.

The second volume, ''Life is Tough and then You Graduate'', was published in April 2005. It contains six strips not published online that explain what happened in Mike's [[thesis defense]]. It also has a foreword by [[Karl Marx]], behind-the-scenes author notes and a [[graduate school]] [[board game]].

The third book, ''Scooped!'', which was released in May 2007, also contains "Tales from the Road", a series of comics that detail Cham's experiences whilst giving his Power of Procrastination tour.

The fourth book, ''Academic Stimulus Package'', was released March 2009. This volume is printed in full color.

The fifth book, ''Adventures in Thesisland'', was released April 2012. This volume is also printed in full color. The introduction is an excerpt from the screenplay of the PHD Movie.

==''Piled Higher and Deeper: the Movie''==
In March 2011, Jorge Cham started filming a movie based on the comic series.  The film production is a collaboration between Cham and a theater group at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. In fall 2011, the film was released on selected academic campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Comic-Strip-That-Skewers/126921/ |title=A Comic Strip That Skewers Academe Will Become a Live-Action Movie |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer of the movie is available on the Piled Higher and Deeper website as of June 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1433&lt;/ref&gt; After about a year of various campus screenings around the world, the movie became available for purchase on DVD or streaming on April 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phdmovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel to the movie was shot in the Caltech campus and was released later in 2015. For the first time in India, it was screened in [[IIT Madras]] on 8 April 2016 as part of their [[Research Scholars Day-2016]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsdiitm.com/?page_id=821{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australian cigarette pack with health warning December 2012.jpg|thumb|Plain cigarette packaging, as required in Australia since 2012: the pack has an [[olive drab]] colour, with the brand name printed in a standard font and size – no logo, other colour or branding allowed.]]

'''Plain tobacco packaging''', also known as '''generic''', '''neutral''', '''standardised''' or '''homogeneous packaging''', refers to packaging that requires the removal of all [[brand]]ing (colours, imagery, corporate logos and [[trademark]]s), permitting manufacturers to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font and place on the pack, in addition to the [[Tobacco packaging warning messages|health warnings]] and any other legally mandated information such as toxic constituents and tax-paid stamps. The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardised, including the colour of the pack.

The removal of branding on [[cigarette pack]]aging aims to deter smoking by removal of positive associations of brands (including design and symbol) with the consumption of tobacco. It also aims to remove an available avenue of [[tobacco advertising|brand advertising]] for cigarette companies.

[[Australia]] was the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, with all packets sold from 1 December 2012 being sold in logo-free, drab dark brown packaging.  There has been opposition from tobacco companies to plain packaging laws, some of which have sued the Australian government.  Since the Australian government won the court cases, several other countries have enacted plain packaging laws.

Plain packaging was included in guidelines to the WHO [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (WHO FCTC). On 31 May 2016, on [[World No Tobacco Day]], the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] called on governments to get ready for plain packaging of tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World No Tobacco Day 2016: Get Ready for Plain Packaging|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10255406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Plain packaging appears to have been first suggested in 1989 by the New Zealand Department of Health’s Toxic Substances Board which recommended that cigarettes be sold only in white packs with black text and no colours or logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The case for the plain packaging of tobacco products |url=http://www.acosh.org/resources/GenericPackaging.pdf |accessdate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320142534/http://www.acosh.org/resources/GenericPackaging.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health officials in [[Canada]] developed proposals for plain packaging of tobacco products in 1994. A parliamentary committee reviewed the evidence and concluded that plain packaging could be a “reasonable step in the overall strategy to reduce tobacco consumption”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_7XprHvrUrAC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22reasonable+step+in+the+overall+strategy+to+reduce+tobacco+consumption%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rQNofeKSEc&amp;sig=h8eiPHzIytP0Y08ie9dlKXID2Y8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis3eXa_cLaAhUVT48KHfjfALoQ6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22reasonable%20step%20in%20the%20overall%20strategy%20to%20reduce%20tobacco%20consumption%22&amp;f=false|title=Smoke &amp; Mirrors: The Canadian Tobacco War|last=Cunningham|first=Rob|date=1996|publisher=IDRC|isbn=9780889367555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort did not succeed due to trademark right concerns, specifically those related to Canada's commitments to the [[World Trade Organization]] and under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=D31VBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Canada_Standing_Committee_on_Health_Report_-_Toward_Zero_Consumption_Jun_94.pdf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rOs-hlgaaZ&amp;sig=kHjIAuCgwpNO5DsEryCPL9LcdWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGra7d-8LaAhXMsI8KHd2CCdcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Canada_Standing_Committee_on_Health_Report_-_Toward_Zero_Consumption_Jun_94.pdf&amp;f=false|title=Czech Yearbook of International Law - Regulatory Measures and Foreign Trade - 2013|last=Belohlávek|first=Alexander J.|last2=Cerný|first2=Filip|last3=Rozehnalova|first3=Prof JUDr Naděžda|date=2013-04-01|publisher=Juris Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781578233342|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]], with the enactment of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act on 12 December 2011,&lt;ref name=NYT5613 /&gt; became the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging. Products manufactured after 1 October 2012, and all on sale after 1 December 2012 must be in the plain packaging.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarette plain packaging laws pass Parliament |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-21/cig-plain-packaging-laws-pass/3684374 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2012C00687|title=Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Australia's lead (2012) a number of other countries also require standardized packaging including [[France]] (January 2017), [[United Kingdom]] (May 2017), [[New Zealand]] (June 2018), [[Norway]] (July 2018),  [[Ireland]] (September 2018), [[Hungary]] (May 2019) and [[Singapore]] (2020). [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Reuters|title=Slovenia passes law enforcing plain tobacco packaging from 2020|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-tobacco-idUKKBN15U2BI]|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uruguay]] have plain packaging cigarette laws, but are yet to go into effect.

==Evidence==
Only indirect evidence of plain packaging's effectiveness was available until its release in Australia. On 24 May 2011, [[Cancer Council Australia]] released a review of the [[evidence]] supporting the introduction of plain packaging to reduce [[Youth smoking|youth uptake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/Newsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2011/24May2011.htm|title=Media releases 2011|author=Cancer Council Australia|work=cancer.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review had been conducted by Quit Victoria and [[Cancer Council Victoria]]. The review includes 24 peer-reviewed studies conducted over two decades, suggesting that packaging plays an important role in encouraging young people to try cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org.au/content/pdf/CancerControlPolicy/PositionStatements/TCUCCVBkgrndResrchPlainPak270511ReEnd_FINAL_May27.pdf Cancer Council Australia Position Statement], May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; First impressions in Australia indicated that smokers feel that cigarettes taste worse in plain packaging – an unexpected side effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/plain-packaging-leaves-bad-taste-in-smokers-mouths/story-fndo317g-1226527002998 {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/plain-packs-put-off-smokers-20121129-2aitp.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Plain packs 'put off' smokers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, evidence from quantitative studies, qualitative research and the internal documents of the tobacco industry consistently identify packaging as an important part of tobacco promotion.

Plain packaging can change people's attitudes towards smoking and may help reduce the prevalence of smoking, including among minors, and increase attempts to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=A|last2=Gravely|first2=S|last3=Hitchman|first3=SC|last4=Bauld|first4=L|last5=Hammond|first5=D|last6=Hartmann-Boyce|first6=J|title=Tobacco packaging design for reducing tobacco use.|journal=[[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|date=27 April 2017|volume=4|pages=CD011244|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011244.pub2|pmid=28447363|laysummary=https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/apr/27/standardised-cigarette-packaging-is-on-its-way-but-will-it-reduce-smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diethelm|first1=P|last2=Farley|first2=TM|title=Refuting tobacco-industry funded research: empirical data shows decline in smoking prevalence following introduction of plain packaging in Australia|journal=Tobacco Prevention and Cessation|date=November 2015|volume=1|doi=10.18332/tpc/60650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diethelm|first1=P|last2=Farley|first2=TM|title=Re-analysing tobacco industry funded research on the effect of plain packaging on minors in Australia: Same data but different results|journal=Tobacco Prevention and Cessation|date=November 2017|volume=3|doi=10.18332/tpc/78508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies comparing existing branded cigarette packs with plain cardboard packs bearing the name and number of cigarettes in small standard font, found plain packs to be significantly less attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Plain packs also increased behaviours such as hiding or covering the pack, smoking less around others, going without cigarettes and increased thinking about quitting. Almost half of the participants reported that plain packs had either increased the above behaviours or reduced consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A 2013 review found that plain packaging increased the importance of health warnings to consumers.  Plain packaging in a darker colour was associated with more harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stead|first1=Martine|last2=Moodie|first2=Crawford|last3=Angus|first3=Kathryn|last4=Bauld|first4=Linda|last5=McNeill|first5=Ann|last6=Thomas|first6=James|last7=Hastings|first7=Gerard|last8=Hinds|first8=Kate|last9=O'Mara-Eves|first9=Alison|last10=Kwan|first10=Irene|last11=Purves|first11=Richard I.|last12=Bryce|first12=Stuart L.|last13=Middleton|first13=Philippa|title=Is Consumer Response to Plain/Standardised Tobacco Packaging Consistent with Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Guidelines?

Plain packaging with large, graphic, warnings, was considered to impact on [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mays|first1=Darren|last2=Smith|first2=Collin|last3=Kraemer|first3=John|last4=Johnson|first4=Andrea|title=Plain packaging of cigarettes: do we have sufficient evidence?|journal=Risk Management and Healthcare Policy|date=April 2015|pages=21|doi=10.2147/RMHP.S63042|pmid=25897269|pmc=4396458|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little evidence yet as to what effect plain packaging will have on smoking in lower-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Nicole|last2=Arora|first2=Monika|last3=Grills|first3=Nathan|title=Perceptions and impact of plain packaging of tobacco products in low and middle income countries, middle to upper income countries and low-income settings in high-income countries: a systematic review of the literature|journal=[[BMJ Open]]|pmc=4809104|date=21 March 2016|volume=6|issue=3|pages=e010391|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010391|pmid=27000787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertisement companies and consultants for the tobacco industry expressed concerns that plain cigarette packaging may establish a precedent for application in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://adage.com/article/news/australia-s-cigarette-brand-ban-prompt-domino-effect/236761/ | title = Will Australia’s Cigarette Brand Ban Spread Beyond Borders, Tobacco? | publisher = Advertising Age | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, correspondence between [[Mars, Incorporated]] and the UK Department of Health conveyed concerns that plain packaging could be extended to the food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.confectionerynews.com/Regulation-Safety/Mars-complaint-over-tobacco-plain-packaging-unearthed | title = Plain packaging pay out to Mars would ‘certainly not be trivial’ says Institute of Economic Affairs | publisher = Confectionery News | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cityam.com/1406214295/mars-lawyers-slam-tobacco-plain-packaging | title = Mars lawyers slam tobacco plain packaging | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, with other policies such as tobacco taxes, plain packaging is considered by some as a form of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wajsman|first1=Beryl|title=Ottawa's plain packaging cigarette proposal: Illogical, illiberal and illegal - The Métropolitain|url=http://www.themetropolitain.ca/articles/view/1621|accessdate=24 May 2017|work=www.themetropolitain.ca|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemieux|first1=Pierre|author-link=Pierre Lemieux (economist)|title=The War on Consumer Surplus|journal=[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]|date=2017|volume=40|issue=1|pages=10–13|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/2239e6a142ce187a2379824b37f3893f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=38212|accessdate=24 May 2017|subscription=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study commissioned by [[Philip Morris International]] indicated that plain packaging would shift consumer preferences away from premium towards cheaper brands.&lt;ref&gt;London Economics, [http://londoneconomics.co.uk/Publications/London-Economics-The%20role-of-packaging%20imagery-on-consumer-preferences-for-experience-goods-report%2009-03-2012.pdf "The Role of Packaging Imagery on Consumer Preferences for Experience Goods"], 2012  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212106/http://londoneconomics.co.uk/Publications/London-Economics-The%20role-of-packaging%20imagery-on-consumer-preferences-for-experience-goods-report%2009-03-2012.pdf |date=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco industry also expressed concern that plain packaging would increase the sales of counterfeit cigarettes. Roy Ramm, former commander of Specialist Operations at New Scotland Yard and founding member of The Common Sense Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/Roy_Ramm|title=Roy Ramm|work=tobaccotactics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a think tank supported by [[British American Tobacco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/The_Common_Sense_Alliance|title=The Common Sense Alliance|work=tobaccotactics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that it would be "disastrous if the government, by introducing plain-packaging legislation, [removed] the simplest mechanism for the ordinary consumer to tell whether their cigarettes are counterfeit or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/roy-ramm/plain-cigarette-packaging-government-plans-for-plai_b_1637528.html | title = Government Plans for Plain Packaging Will Boost Illicit Trade | publisher = Huffington Post UK | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against plain packaging include its effect on smuggling, its effect on shops and retailers, and its possible illegality. A study published in July 2014 by the [[British Medical Journal]] refuted those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Scollo|first= Michelle|last2= Zacher|first2= Meghan|last3= Durkin|first3= Sarah|last4= Wakefield|first4= Melanie|date= 18 July 2014|title= Early evidence about the predicted unintended consequences of standardised packaging of tobacco products in Australia: a cross-sectional study of the place of purchase, regular brands and use of illicit tobacco|url= http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/8/e005873.full|journal= [[British Medical Journal]]|doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005873 |accessdate=2 September 2014 |volume=4 |pages=e005873 |pmid=25168041 |pmc=4156805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reporting Philip Morris's legal action against the Australian project, ''[[The Times of India]]'' noted in 2011 that plain packaging legislation was being closely watched by other countries, and that tobacco firms were worried the Australian plain packaging legislation might set a global precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Tobacco-major-sues-Australia-over-plain-packaging-laws/articleshow/10824779.cms |title=Tobacco major sues Australia over 'plain packaging' laws |author=Reuters |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

In July 2012 it was reported that the American [[lobbying]] organisation [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) had launched a worldwide campaign against plain packaging of cigarettes. With the backing of tobacco companies and other corporate interests, it was targeting governments planning to introduce bans on cigarette branding, including the UK and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/15/cigarettes-plain-packets-alec-koch-brothers | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jamie | last=Doward | title=US free market group tries to halt sales of cigarettes in plain packets in UK | date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies were also reported to have provided legal advice and funding to Ukraine and Honduras governments to launch a complaint in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on the grounds that the Australian legislation is contrary to a WTO intellectual property agreement. WTO complaints must be made by Governments, not companies.&lt;ref name="AFTINET"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aftinet.org.au/cms/node/519 |title= Australian High Court rules against big tobacco on plain packaging |author=AFTINET Media Release&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= AFTINET Australian Fair Trade &amp; Investment Network Ltd |publisher= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British American Tobacco confirmed that they were helping Ukraine meet legal costs in their case against Australia.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Ukraine"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 1-Ukraine drops WTO action against Australian tobacco-packaging laws|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/wto-tobacco-idUSL5N0YP3S420150603|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2013 Cuba,&lt;ref name=WTO5313&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuba files dispute against Australia on tobacco plain packaging|url=http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news13_e/ds458rfc_03may13_e.htm|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=7 May 2013|date=3 May 2013|quote=Cuba notified the WTO Secretariat, on 3 May 2013, of a request for consultations with Australia on the Australian Tobacco Plain Packaging Act of 2011 that regulates the appearance and form of retail packaging used in connection with sales of cigars, cigarettes and other tobacco products.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic challenged Australia's rules through the WTO by filing requests for consultations, the first step in challenging Australia’s tobacco-labelling laws at the WTO&lt;ref name=NYT5613&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuba Challenges Australian Tobacco Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/business/global/07iht-smoke07.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 May 2013|author=David Jolly|quote=All four nations argue that provisions of a 2011 Australian law, the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act, have created “technical barriers” to trade and violate intellectual property rights.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A request for consultations opened a 60-day negotiation window after which a formal complaint could be filed which, if successful, might have led to increased tariffs on Australian exports. On 28 May 2015 Ukraine, which exports no tobacco to Australia, decided to suspend its WTO action initiated by the previous Ukrainian government.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Ukraine"/&gt; The packaging of Cuban cigars is considered to contribute significantly to sales.&lt;ref name=NYT5613 /&gt;

In June 2018, the WTO panel rejects the claims of the plaignants. Regarding the [[Agreement on technical barriers to trade]], the panel concludes that plain packaging restricts trade only insofar as it reduces consumption, which is the legitimate objective of the measure. As for the [[TRIPS Agreement]], it observes that "TRIPS does not provide for a right to use a trademark", but prevents other companies from using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= An initial overview of the WTO panel decision in Australia – Plain Packaging|url= http://untobaccocontrol.org/kh/legal-challenges/initial-overview-wto-panel-decision-australia-plain-packaging/|author= McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer|access-date= 5 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco industry response====
In August 2010, [[Philip Morris International]], [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Imperial Tobacco]] formed the Alliance of Australian Retailers, which commenced a multimillion-dollar campaign against the introduction of plain cigarette packaging. The campaign focused on [[grassroots]] advocacy ([[astroturfing]]), ostensibly on behalf of small business owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big tobacco bankrolls anti-Labor ad campaign |first=Jennifer |last=Macey |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/04/2972779.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the funding source of the campaign was made public, large retailers such as [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]] quickly withdrew support for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail group quits cigarette label campaign |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/11/2979583.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaks reveal $9m tobacco blitz |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/11/3009026.htm |work=[[Lateline]]|date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco companies subsequently hired a [[public relations]] firm to oversee the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Tobacco hired public relations firm to lobby government|first=Anne|last=Davies|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/big-tobacco-hired-public-relations-firm-to-lobby-government-20100910-154yg.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[British American Tobacco]] launched a media campaign suggesting that illicit trade and crime syndicates would benefit from plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plainpack.com/home.aspx Plain Packs Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520232024/http://www.plainpack.com/home.aspx |date=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BATA [[CEO]] David Crow threatened to lower cigarette prices in order to compete, which he claimed could result in higher levels of smoking amongst young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tobacco Companies Declare War |url=http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2011/s3223432.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Crow later commented he would tell his own children not to smoke cigarettes, because they are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British American Tobacco Australia boss David Crow tells his kids not to smoke |first=Stephen |last=Johnson |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/british-american-tobacco-australia-boss-david-crow-tells-his-children-not-to-smoke/story-e6frfm1i-1226059590411|publisher=news.com.au |date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BATA campaign is largely based on a report from [[Deloitte]]. Several of the claims contained in the report related to border protection, and have since been publicly refuted by customs officials, and the report itself indicated that it had relied extensively on unaudited figures supplied by the tobacco industry itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashaust.org.au/lv4/IllicitChapman1103.htm Professor Simon Chapman]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719094702/http://www.ashaust.org.au/lv4/IllicitChapman1103.htm |date=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's plain to see what's behind the smokescreen |first=Jessica |last=Irvine |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/its-plain-to-see-whats-behind-the-smokescreen-20110519-1eusy.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=20 May 2011 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Imperial Tobacco]] Australia launched a secondary media campaign, deriding plain packaging legislation as part of a [[Nanny state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Tobacco takes on the nanny state |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/business/9636433/big-tobacco-takes-on-nanny-state/ |publisher=Yahoo Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623083821/http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/business/9636433/big-tobacco-takes-on-nanny-state |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using the provisions in a Hong Kong/Australia treaty to demand compensation for Australia's plain packaging anti-smoking legislation. As a US-based company, Philip Morris could not sue under the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The company rearranged its assets to become a Hong Kong investor in order to use the [[investor-state dispute settlement]] provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT).&lt;ref name="AFTINET"/&gt; Immediately following the passage of legislation on 21 November 2011, Philip Morris announced it had served a notice of arbitration under Australia's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong, seeking the suspension on the plain packaging laws and compensation for the loss of trademarks.&lt;ref name="ABC News" /&gt; [[Allens (law firm)|Allens Arthur Robinson]] represented Philip Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philip Morris Begins Arbitration Proceedings With Australia Over Tobacco Packaging Law |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202533316269&amp;slreturn=1|author=Ben Lewis |publisher=LAW.COM|date=23 November 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Health Minister [[Nicola Roxon]] stated that she believed the government was "on very strong ground" legally, and that the government was willing to defend the measures.&lt;ref name=ABC6Jul2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mccabecentre.org/focus-areas/tobacco/philip-morris-asia-challenge|title = Philip Morris Asia Challenge under Australia – Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty|accessdate = 2014-12-05|publisher = McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuance of trade and investment proceedings on the issue has been described as an affront to the rule of law in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

In November 2011, British American Tobacco announced that it would challenge the laws in the High Court as soon as they gained royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plain cigarette packaging to start in 2012|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/plain-cigarette-packaging-to-start-in-2012-20111121-1nqbo.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the High Court ruled in favour of the Australian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=JT International SA v Commonwealth |court=HCA |num=43 |year=2012 |parallelcite=(2011) 250 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 [http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/projt-2012-08-15.pdf judgement summary] at High Court of Australia Website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British American Tobacco placed [[freedom of information]] requests on a Cancer Institute NSW research survey of school students aged between 12-17, which asked how they react to plain packaging, where they get cigarettes from and what age they started smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/tobacco-company-wants-schools-survey-for-insights-into-children-and-teens-20150819-gj2vto.html|title=Tobacco company wants schools survey for insights into children and teens|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-20/cancer-council-fights-tobacco-giant-foi-bid-for-info-on-smoking/6710884|title=Cancer Council to fight British American Tobacco's FOI bid for students' smoking attitudes research|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cancer Council Victoria]] fought the FOI request, saying that the tobacco company wanted to use the survey information to change their marketing to children to increase cigarette smoking among youth.

Phillip Morris was ordered to pay the Australian government's legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knaus |first1=Christopher |title=Philip Morris cigarettes charged millions after losing plain packaging case against Australia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/philip-morris-cigarettes-charged-millions-after-losing-plain-packaging-case-against-australia |accessdate=1 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=10 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A FOI request by [[Nick Xenophon]] and [[Rex Patrick]] revealed that Australia's legal fees amounted to $39 million with Patrick saying that this showed the dangers of investor-state dispute settlement clauses allowing companies to sue governments in the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutchens |first1=Gareth |last2=Knaus |first2=Christopher |title=Revealed: $39m cost of defending Australia's tobacco plain packaging laws |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/02/revealed-39m-cost-of-defending-australias-tobacco-plain-packaging-laws |accessdate=1 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=1 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other responses====
The [[World Health Organization]] applauded Australia’s law on plain packaging noting that “the legislation sets a new global standard for the control of a product that accounts for nearly 6 million deaths each year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20111123.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20111124102118/http%3A//www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20111123.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 November 2011 |title=WHO applauds Australia's new tobacco packaging legislation |author= |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cancer Council of Australia hailed the passing of the legislation, stating, "Documents obtained from the tobacco industry show how much the tobacco companies rely on pack design to attract new smokers....You only have to look at how desperate the tobacco companies are to stop plain packaging, for confirmation that pack design is seen as critical to sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org.au//Newsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2011/21November2011.htm |title=Great day in public health, as parliament signs off on tobacco packaging bills |author=Paul Grogan |date=21 November 2011|publisher=Cancer Council, Australia |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization's director for the Western Pacific also congratulated Australia and stated that all countries and areas in the Western Pacific should follow Australia's good example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=6670 |title=WHO Applauds Australia's New Tobacco Packaging Legislation |author=World Health Organization |date=23 November 2011|work=Solomon Times Online |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on Radio Australia, Don Rothwell, Professor of International Law at the [[Australian National University]], noted that Philip Morris was pursuing multiple legal avenues. The Notice of Arbitration under the bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia has a 90-day cooling off period after which the case would most likely be sent to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington. He stated that Philip Morris was most likely aiming for the Australian Government to back down, or failing that, to sue for compensation. He said the questions to decide are whether the legislation means that Australia would acquire property by the imposition of these rules and if this legislation is a legitimate public-health measure.

Professor Rothwell noted "...the growing recognition of the legitimacy of public health measures of this type." Professor Rothwell estimated that the legal cases, including any case before the High Court, would take up to a year to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/asiapac/stories/201111/s3373582.htm|title=Australia sued over cigarette plain packaging laws |date=22 November 2011|publisher=ABC International Radio Australia|accessdate= 26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in 2011 that graphic health warning labels "clearly display the government’s opinion on smoking" which he said "cannot constitutionally be required to appear on the merchandise of private companies." He ruled that these warnings would unfairly hurt their sales, that the warnings were crafted to provoke an emotional response calculated to quit smoking or never to start smoking. This, the judge ruled, was "an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information." This finding may be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2011/11/federal-judge-deems-fda’s-antismoking-warning-labels-unconstitutional/ |title=Federal Judge Deems FDA's Antismoking Warning Labels Unconstitutional |author=Mandy Honeychurch |date=8 November 2011 |work=Berkeley Political Review |accessdate=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710004624/http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2011/11/federal-judge-deems-fda%E2%80%99s-antismoking-warning-labels-unconstitutional/ |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57320454-10391704/fdas-graphic-cigarette-warning-labels-beyond-free-speech/ |title=FDA's graphic cigarette warning labels: Beyond free speech? |author=Ryan Jaslow |date=8 November 2011|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=June 2017}}

The Associated Press noted that Philip Morris took "less than an hour" to launch legal action against the Australian legislation. It also stated that Australian legislation followed the lead of Uruguay which requires that 80 per cent of cigarette packages is devoted to warnings and Brazil, where cigarette packages display "graphic images" of dead fetuses, haemorrhaging brains and gangrenous feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/tobacco-giant-philip-morris-suing-australian-government-over-plain-packaging-law/2011/11/21/gIQA0sE4gN_story.html |title=Australia passes no-logo cigarette package law; Philip Morris quickly takes legal action |author=Associated Press |date=21 November 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=23 November 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Allen of the ''Daily Mail'' newspaper reported that the Philip Morris lawsuit could cost the Australian government "billions". He also noted that the Australian law is being closely watched by other governments in Europe, Canada and New Zealand. In 2005, the World Health Organization urged countries to consider plain packaging, and noted that [[Bhutan]] had banned the sale of tobacco earlier in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2064314/Philip-Morris-challenges-Australian-law-plain-tobacco-packaging.html|title=Cigarette giant Philip Morris sues Australian government for billions over plain packaging law |author=Gavin Allen |date=22 November 2011|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=23 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Associate Health Minister [[Tariana Turia]] congratulated the Australian Health Minister, noted that tobacco labelling rules have long been harmonised between Australia and New Zealand, and looked forward to New Zealand following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/22/c_131262227.htm|title=New Zealand to follow Australia's controversial plain packaging law for cigarettes |date= 22 November 2011|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate= 26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation====
In April 2011, [[Nicola Roxon|Minister Roxon]] released an exposure draft of plain packaging legislation with an expected start date of 1 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exposure Draft, Plain Packaging Bill|first=Nicola|last=Roxon|authorlink=Nicola Roxon|url=http://yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/C550AA264BA53F7ACA25786B0001B34A/$File/Tobacco%20Plain%20Packaging%20Bill%202011%20-%20Exposure%20Draft%20-%2031%20March%202011.pdf|publisher=Australian Government|date=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603020321/http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/C550AA264BA53F7ACA25786B0001B34A/$File/Tobacco%20Plain%20Packaging%20Bill%202011%20-%20Exposure%20Draft%20-%2031%20March%202011.pdf|archivedate=3 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian newspapers reported that the legislation was likely to pass despite concerns from the [[Coalition (Australia)|Opposition]]. It was suggested the Opposition resistance to the legislation was due to their continuing acceptance of funding donations from tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarettes Likely to get plain packages |first=Andrea |last=Hayward |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/cigarettes-likely-to-get-plain-packages-20110524-1f193.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2011, [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[Tony Abbott]] announced that his party would support the legislation, and would work with the government to ensure the legislation is effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abbott out of puff on plain packet laws |first=Ben |last=Packham |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/abbott-out-of-puff-on-plain-cigarette-packet-laws/story-fn59niix-1226066784420|work=[[The Australian]]|date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
In March 2015, an early day motion forwarded by deputy [[Catherine Fonck]] to consider plain packaging in Belgium. However, it was opposed and stuck down by the federal Public Health select committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les partis de la majorité rejettent le paquet de cigarettes neutre|trans-title=The majority parties reject neutral packaging of cigarettes|language=French|url = http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/les-partis-de-la-majorite-rejettent-le-paquet-de-cigarettes-neutre/article-normal-373219.html|website=[[Le Vif]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in November 2016, the health minister [[Maggie De Block]] said she is open to idea of plain packaging, once the introduction of plain packaging in France and the UK has been reviewed. This was done on top of a list of new tobacco laws such as increasing taxes and raising the purchasing age to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delepeleire|first1=Yves|title='Anti-rookplan De Block wordt mager beestje'|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20161106_02559048|work=[[De Standaard]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2011, Health Canada introduced changes to the tobacco products labelling regulations that included sixteen new graphic health warnings covering 75% of the principal faces of cigarette and cigarillo packages. As of September 2015, Health Canada is not planning regulatory action that would require plain or standardised packaging of tobacco products. The department considers its commitment to introduce health-related labelling requirements on cigarettes and cigarillos fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada Controlled Substances and Tobacco Directorate (personal communication, 9 September 2015) {{original research inline|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-October 2015, the Liberal Political Party leader, [[Justin Trudeau]], announced that he would include the introduction of plain tobacco packaging as part of his platform, under the heading of Healthier Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.ca/realchange/healthier-kids/|title= Healthier kids|publisher=|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received positive feedback from cancer advocacy groups, including the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.ca/en/about-us/for-media/media-releases/national/2015/plain-packaging-proposal/?region=on|title=Society welcomes commitment to tobacco plain packaging|work=www.cancer.ca|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since become the Prime Minister and has told his then-Health Minister, [[Jane Philpott]], that he expects her to "Introduce plain packaging requirements for tobacco products, similar to those in Australia and the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-health-mandate-letter|title= Minister of Health Mandate Letter|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
In March 2015, a bill similar to the Australian one was established before the Congress of the Republic, since it was intended to regulate the packaging and labeling of tobacco products. The ultimate goal of this Bill was to achieve a total ban on its advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Although the Bill was filed a few months after the passage of the legislature, the one that has come to be debated in the first presentation in the House of Representatives allows concluding that Colombia is not far from adopting a regulation on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The arrival of Plain Packaging to Colombia |url=https://www.asuntoslegales.com.co/consultorio/la-llegada-del-plain-packaging-a-colombia-2611247 |publisher=[[Asuntos Legales]]|date=16 March 2016|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In 2010, the European Commission launched a public consultation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public consultation on the possible revision of the Tobacco Products Directive 2001/37/EC |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/consultations/tobacco_cons_01_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=24 September 2010| accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a proposal to revise Directive 2001/37/EC which covers health warnings, limits on toxic constituents, etc., for tobacco products. The consultation included a proposal to require plain packaging. Although [[John Dalli|Commissioner Dalli]] has rejected plain packaging as an option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plain packaging proposals for tobacco will 'damage business'|publisher=Talking retail|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/news/industry-news/plain-packaging-proposals-for-tobacco-will-%E2%80%98damage-business%E2%80%99|date=26 April 2012|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Union included in its proposal for a new [[Tobacco Products Directive]], which became applicable in EU countries in May 2016,&lt;ref name=EU2014&gt;{{cite web|title=European Union: Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU)|url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/products_en|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the option for the Member States to introduce plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/com_2012_788_en.pdf|title= Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products|date= 19 December 2012 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholars consider plain packaging to be consistent with primary European law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henning|first=Peter K.|author2=Shmatenko, Leonid|title=Plain Packaging on Its Way to Europe: Competence Issues and Compatibility with European Fundamental Rights|journal=Transnational Dispute Management|date=November 2012|volume=9|issue=5|pages=1–17|ssrn=2171205|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shmatenko|first=Leonid|title=Verfassungsmäßigkeit von Einheitsverpackungen (Plain Packaging) bei Zigaretten|journal=Juristische Ausbildung (JURA)|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=2|pages=74–81|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jura-2013-35-issue-2/jura-2013-0016/jura-2013-0016.xml?format=INT|accessdate=5 March 2013|doi=10.1515/jura-2012-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive adopted April 3, 2014 explicitly states that 28 EU countries have the option of implementing plain packaging, a provision upheld on May 4, 2016 by the [[European Court of Justice]] as valid when dismissing a tobacco industry legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddfe90e0aea11f458dbae3c7bf29452f35.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuSahr0?text=&amp;docid=173256&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=493911|title=Case C‑547/14: Philip Morris Brands SARL and Others}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In December 2010, a [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] member of the French Parliament tabled a Member's Bill aimed at creating plain cigarette packaging. However, the bill did not pass despite ongoing support from health associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tabac: la Ligue contre le cancer veut des paquets de cigarettes "neutres" |trans-title=Tobacco: the league against cancer wants "neutral" packets of cigarettes |language=French |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/filnews/science/tabac-la-ligue-contre-le-cancer-veut-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-6968916.html |publisher=LCI, TF1 |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212130556/http://lci.tf1.fr/filnews/science/tabac-la-ligue-contre-le-cancer-veut-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-6968916.html |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other countries, there was fierce protest from the tobacco industry and tobacco retailers associations. The Health Minister also seemed lukewarm in his support, preferring to see the effect of newly-introduced health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plain cigarette packets considered |url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/plain-cigarette-packets-smoking-draft-law-logos-colours-banned-shock-images-view-article.html |publisher=The Connection|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next legislature however, the new [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] Health Minister, [[Marisol Touraine]], said she would fight especially at the European level for "neutral packaging". As in Australia, the tobacco industry countered that generic packaging would be easy to counterfeit, which would increase illegal cigarette sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le gouvernement favorable à des "cigarettes neutres" |trans-title= The government is favourable towards "neutral cigarettes" |language=French |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2012/07/31/le-gouvernement-favorable-a-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-neutres_1740749_1651302.html |work=[[Le Monde]]|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU directive eventually contained no explicit measures regarding plain packaging. In reaction, the French government announced the introduction of a bill containing provisions for generic cigarette packaging on 25 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Encadrement du vapotage, mise en place du paquet " neutre " : les annonces du plan anti-tabac |trans-title=Supervision of vaping, implementation of the "neutral" packet: announcements of the plan against tobacco |language=French|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2014/09/25/encadrement-du-vapotage-mise-en-place-du-paquet-neutre-les-annonces-du-plan-anti-tabac_4494262_1651302.html|work=Le Monde|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed on 17 December 2015. The tobacco industry promptly attacked it in court, but lost its case.
This legislation was upheld on 21 January 2016 as constitutional by France’s [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2016/2015-727-dc/decision-n-2015-727-dc-du-21-janvier-2016.146887.html|title=Décision n° 2015-727 DC du 21 janvier 2016 sur la loi de modernisation du système de santé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 1 January 2017 must be put in plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La France adopte le paquet de cigarettes neutre|trans-title=France adopts neutral cigarette packaging|language=French|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1072520/article/actualite/fil-info/fil-info-monde/2015-12-17/france-adopte-paquet-cigarettes-neutre|date=17 December 2015}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
The Decree of 16 August 2016 requires that new cigarette and tobacco brands that will be introduced on the Hungarian market after 20 August 2016 has to be in a uniform plain packaging, void of brand logos. Eventually, all cigarette and tobacco products are to be sold in uniform packs from 20 May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungary: Larger pictorial warnings and plain packaging required by the new Government Decree|url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/implementation/database/groups/hungary-larger-pictorial-warnings-and-plain-packaging-required-new-government-decree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, the first cigarettes with unified plain packaging hit the Hungarian market. From 20 August 2016 onwards, new brands have to be sold in plain packaging, one new cigarette brand of Von Eicken GmbH was forced to be launched with such unified package. This makes Hungary the fourth country in the world, where plain packaging is enforced; after Australia, France and the UK.

===India===
As of August 2012, India is believed to be considering plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/business/tobacco-fight-not-over-phillip-morris-says-20120815-2488s.html "Tobacco fight not over, Phillip Morris says"], by Chris Zappone, ''[[The Age]]'', 15 August 2012.

Accessed 10 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there has been no progress on this matter and tobacco continues to be sold in branded packaging.

===Ireland===
In May 2013, Ireland announced plans to become the second country in the world to introduce plain cigarette packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2013/20130528.html "Ireland set to become second country in the world to introduce plain pack cigarettes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055922/http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2013/20130528.html |date=22 February 2014 }}, by Ireland's DoHC, 28 May 2013. Accessed 28 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the Irish government said it would legislate to implement plain packaging. Details of the bill known as the ''Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014'' were published on 10 June 2014. "There is a wealth of international evidence on the effects of tobacco packaging in general and on perceptions and reactions to standardised packaging which support the introduction of this measure," Ireland's [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Health Minister]] [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]] said when releasing details of the bill.&lt;ref name="IrishPackagingBan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ireland to become first country in Europe to restrict tobacco companies on packaging|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/222782481/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Ireland-to-become-first-country-in-Europe-to-restrict-tobacco-companies-on-packaging|accessdate=10 June 2014|publisher=''Irish Sun.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed by [[President of Ireland|President]] [[Michael D.

In the Netherlands, [[Paul Blokhuis]], serving as [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sports]] in the [[Third Rutte cabinet]] plans to have plain packaging law by 2020&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/2499077/plan-staatssecretaris-blokhuis-sigarettenpakjes-krijgen-neutrale-kleur De Telegraaf: Sigarettenpakjes krijgen neutrale kleur]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand requires tobacco products to be standardised in a similar manner to Australian requirements. Legislation and associated regulations to enable standardised packaging of tobacco products came into force on 14 March 2018.&lt;ref name= "NZ Parliament"&gt;New Zealand Parliament.

Discussion of the need for standardised packaging (formerly called plain packaging), the passage of the legislation through Parliament, and its subsequent coming into force took six years. In April 2012, following an inquiry by the Māori Affairs Select Committee, Government (on recommendation of the then Associate Minister of Health, Dame [[Tariana Turia]]) approved plain packaging in principle, a move that tobacco companies said they would strenuously oppose.&lt;ref&gt;Otago Daily Times.

===Norway===
In August 2012, it was believed that Norway began considering plain packaging.&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|last = Zappone|first = Chris|title = Tobacco fight not over, Phillip Morris says|url = http://www.theage.com.au/business/tobacco-fight-not-over-phillip-morris-says-20120815-2488s.html#poll|accessdate = 2012-08-15|newspaper = The Age|date = 2012-08-15|location = Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 31 May 2016 on [[World No Tobacco Day]], the Health Minister [[Bent Høie]] announced the introduction of plain packaging to Norway by 2017. The plain packaging rule applies to [[snus]] as well as cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Deshaye|first =Pierre-Henry|title = Norway backs plain packets for cigarettes|url = http://www.thelocal.no/20160531/norway-backs-plain-packets-for-cigarettes|accessdate = 2017-01-02|newspaper = The Local Norway|date = 2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards a tobacco-free generation|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/towards-a-tobacco-free-generation/id2502147/|website=Government.no|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2016, the [[Norwegian Parliament]] voted overwhelmingly in favour of implementing standardised packaging for tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway adopts standardised packaging|url=http://www.uicc.org/norway-adopts-standardised-packaging-save-lives-and-prevent-suffering-tobacco-use}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was introduced at the same time as the EU Tobacco Products Directive measures on packaging and labelling, taking effect on 1 July 2017. Retailers were given one year (until 1 July 2018) to transition to the new standardised cigarette packages and smokeless tobacco boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Norway'' Tobacco labelling Resource Centre|url=http://www.tobaccolabels.ca/countries/norway/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama===
Since 2017, the National Assembly has discussed draft Law 136 on plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama advocates neutral packaging of cigarettes |url=https://www.prensa.com/salud_y_ciencia/Panama-aboga-empaquetado-neutro-cigarrillo_0_4502549836.html |publisher=[[La Prensa (Panama City)|La Prensa]]|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes that the color of the packs be dark matt gray and that the mark be presented in white Arial font, size 20, highlighted in bold. Panama ranks second in having the lowest prevalence in the world of consumption, since only 6.4% of adults in the isthmus smoke.

===Philippines===
Anti-smoking group New Vois Association of the Philippines favored the introduction of plain cigarette packaging in the Philippines as part of their campaign on the 2016 [[World No Tobacco Day]] and urged then-presumptive president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to implement a law to standardize cigarette packs. The [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] (DOH), however, is not ready to implement plain cigarette packaging, and rather focus on enforcing [[Tobacco packaging warning message|graphic health warnings]] on cigarette packs under the Graphic Health Warning Act of 2014 that took effect in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-smoking group urges Duterte to adopt plain-packed cigarettes|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2016/05/30/anti-smoking-group-urges-duterte-adopt-plain-packed-cigarettes-476525|newspaper=[[Sun.Star]]|date=30 May 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
On the 15 February 2017, the [[Parliament of Slovenia]] passed a law for the introduction of plain packaging from 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia passes law enforcing plain tobacco packaging from 2020|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-tobacco-idUSKBN15U2BI|website=Reuters|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland === 
On 5 December 2014, [[National Council (Switzerland)|Swiss parliamentarian]] Pierre-Alain Fridez tabled a motion for plain packaging in Switzerland. A few days later, [[Federal Council of Switzerland|the Federal Council]] said it was opposed to this, saying such a measure "goes too far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/Le-Conseil-federal-s-oppose-aux-paquets-de-cigarettes-neutres/story/31905395|title=Le Conseil fédéral s'oppose aux paquets de cigarettes neutres|trans-title=The Federal Council opposes neutral packets of cigarettes|language=French|work= [[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In September 2011, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' reported that the Turkish government was working on plain packaging regulations. An Istanbul-based newspaper, ''[[Milliyet]]'', reported that under the proposal all branding elements would disappear and cigarettes would come in "numbered black boxes" excluding any imagery other than health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey Working on Cigarette Branding Ban Law, Milliyet Says |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-07/turkey-working-on-cigarette-branding-ban-law-milliyet-says.html |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=7 September 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Health Minister [[Recep Akdağ]] stated that Turkey will "introduce plain packaging where the brand of cigarettes will almost be invisible and sellers will be obliged to store the cigarettes in closed cases instead of transparent displays" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New restrictions on cigarette sales in the works|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2016/11/15/new-restrictions-on-cigarette-sales-in-the-works|website=The Daily Sabah|accessdate=21 April 2017|location=Ankara, Turkey|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In November 2013, the UK Government announced an independent review of cigarette packaging in the UK, amid calls for action to discourage young smokers.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarette packaging: Ministers launch fresh review |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25126673|accessdate=28 November 2013 | work=BBC News |date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Health Minister Jane Ellison rejected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] calls for immediate regulation rather than a review, saying: "It's a year this weekend since the legislation was introduced in Australia. It's the right time to ask people to look at this."

The "Plain Packs Protect" campaign by an alliance of health organisations set out the case for tobacco plain packaging in the UK, as did Cancer Research UK's "The Answer Is Plain" campaign, which was launched soon after the government consultation was announced. Opposing this was the smokers' rights group [[FOREST]], which launched a counter-campaign titled "Hands Off Our Packs".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In March 2015, the House of Commons voted 367–113 in favour of introducing plain cigarette packaging. Plain packaging is required for cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 21 May 2017.&lt;ref name="UK-vote"&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs pass legislation to introduce standardised cigarette packaging|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/11/mps-pass-legislation-introduce-standardised-cigarette-packaging|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Legislation: The Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/829/contents/made|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK regulations forbid "logos or promotional images … inserts … discounts … offers … information about nicotine, tar or carbon monoxide … lifestyle or environmental benefits [and] mentions or depictions of taste, smell or the absence thereof", while mandating "drab dark brown coloured packaging", specific package shapes and a specific font (Helvetica 14-point) for brand names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government: Guidance: Packaging of tobacco products|accessdate=29 October 2018|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/packaging-of-tobacco-products}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is also bound by the EU's Tobacco Products Directive (2014) which included a requirement for combined health warnings (picture, text and information on how to stop) covering 65 per cent of both the front and back of packaging.&lt;ref name=EU2014 /&gt;

'''The Royal Strand Theatre''' was located in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in the [[City of Westminster]]. The theatre was built on the site of a [[panorama]] in 1832, and in 1882 was rebuilt by the prolific theatre [[architect]] [[Charles J. Phipps]]. It was demolished in 1905 to make way for [[Aldwych tube station]].

==History==
From 1801, Thomas Edward Barker set up a rival [[panorama]] to his father's in [[Leicester Square]], at 168/169 Strand. On the death of Robert Barker, in 1806, his younger brother, [[Henry Aston Barker]] took over management of the Leicester Square rotunda. In 1816, Henry bought the panorama in the Strand, which was then known as Reinagle and Barker's Panorama,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sherson, Erroll, ‘Lost London Playhouses’, ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21. One of a series of articles later published in a book of same name in 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two panoramas were then run jointly until 1831. Their building was then used as a [[English Dissenters|dissenting]] chapel and was purchased by Benjamin Lionel Rayner, a noted actor, in 1832.&lt;ref name=Stage&gt;''From Stage to Platform: The Metamorphosis of the Strand Theatre 1830&amp;ndash;1905'', Paul Hadley (London Passenger Transport 1984 No. 12 April, pp. 588-593)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subscription theatre ===
Rayner engaged Charles Broad to convert and extend the original building as a theatre. This was built in 1832 in seven weeks, at a cost of £3,000. The theatre opened on 15 January 1832, as ''Rayner's New Subscription Theatre'', with a production of ''Struggles at Starting''. Within weeks, the venture failed and was sold to the actress [[Harriet Waylett]], re-opening as ''The New Strand (Subscription) Theatre''. Again, the theatre lacked support and closed in November 1832. The theatre was re-opened in early 1833 as the '' New Strand Theatre'', by [[Frances Maria Kelly]] &amp;ndash; who also based a [[drama school]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berwick|first1=Frederick|title=British Drama of the Industrial Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer, [[Rebecca Isaacs]] was the Directress of Operas at the theatre from 1852 to 1853, and again in 1855. The theatre failed because it was unlicensed, and this put it into competition with London's [[patent theatre]]s. Presenting plays by subscription was one method of evading the Acts, but tickets could not be sold at the theatre. This was circumvented by selling them at neighbouring shops; and at one point the public were admitted free on purchase of an ounce of rose lozenges for four shillings (stalls), or half an ounce of peppermint drops for two shillings (the pit) from the neighbouring confectioners.&lt;ref name=Stage/&gt;

The theatre was again closed under the Patent Acts in March 1835, and the owners brought before the magistrates. It reopened on 25 April 1836, with the necessary licence, under the management of [[Douglas William Jerrold]] and William John Hammond. The theatre was enlarged in 1836 and a gallery added in 1839. In 1849 the manager was [[William Farren]]. For a while in 1851 it was owned by [[William Robert Copeland]], and known as ''Punch's' Playhouse and Marionette Theatre''. In 1856, the manager was T. Payne.

Frank Talford wrote the earliest [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] for the Strand, full of excruciating puns and enlivened by bright songs. Mythological subjects were popular. In one such piece in 1850 the afterwards famous Mrs. Stirling played Minerva, Mrs Leigh Murray was Apollo, and [[Rebecca Isaacs]] was Venus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Swanborough years ===
{{See also|Victorian burlesque}}
In 1858, the theatre was taken over by the Swanborough family (originally Smith). Henry V. Swanborough rebuilt it at a cost of £7,000and opened it on 5 April 1858 as the ''Royal Strand Theatre''.&lt;ref name="Stage" /&gt; His daughter, Louisa, was acting manager for a couple of years until her marriage to Major Lyon. Henry's eldest son William was also an active manager. Following Henry's depression and suicide in 1863, ownership passed to Henry's widow Mary Ann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensationpress.com/swanboroughfamilystrandtheatre.htm|title=swanborough family strand theatre|website=www.sensationpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1868 and 1871, [[Eleanor Bufton]] (married to Arthur Swanborough) managed the [[Greenwich Theatre]], and resources were shared between the two theatres.

According to Erroll Sherson, writing in 1923, the Strand was burlesque's first real nursery and its permanent home. Here graduated [[Marie Wilton]] (later Lady Bancroft), Patty Oliver and Edward Terry; each would later maintain the burlesque tradition at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre|Prince of Wales's]], [[Royalty Theatre|The Royalty]], and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|The Gaiety]], respectively. For some years, the Strand's programme  began with a short drama, many written by [[H. T. Craven]], including, ''The Postboy'', ''Milky White'', and ''Meg's Diversion''. Then followed a burlesque by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron,]] [[William Brough (writer)|W. Brough]], or [[F. C. Burnand]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under the Swanboroughs, the theatre enjoyed success, with Ada Swanborough performing in H. J. Byron's [[burletta]]s and featuring a cast that included James Thorne, [[Edward O'Connor Terry]], Miss Raynham, Mrs. Raymond, H. J. Turner and  Marie Wilton,.  These began with ''The Lady of Lyons, or Twopenny Pride and Pennytence;'' ''Fra Diavolo Travestie, or The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl;'' ''The Maid and the Magpie, or The Fatal Spoon'' (an early play to include a dance at the end of a song); and ''The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds''.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Amy Wai Sum. [http://whaleyween.com/Holly/DLB344_19thC_BritishDramatists/Byron.pdf "Henry J. Byron"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hong Kong Baptist University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RoyalStrand.htm |title=Royal Strand Theatre, Aldwych (Arthur Lloyd Theatre history|website=www.arthurlloyd.co.uk|accessdate= 9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrated  burlesque on ''Kenilworth'',&lt;ref&gt;A parody of Walter Scott's novel [[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]].&lt;/ref&gt; first performed in 1859 and played over many years, brought the Strand great prosperity. It had a strong cast including Louisa Swanborough as the Earl of Leicester, H. J. Turner as Mike Lambourne, Mrs. Charles Selby as Queen Elizabeth, Marie Wilton as Sir Walter Raleigh, Patty Oliver as Amy Robsart, Charlotte Saunders as Tressillian, John Clarke as Varney and James Bland as Wayland Smith; Bland was reputed to be the king of the burlesque actors. Leicester was later played by Maria Ternan.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''London and Provincial Entr'acte'', 7 January 1899, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merry-go-Round, ''London and Provincial Entr'acte'', 24 October 1891, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The burlesque that lived longest in the memories of old playgoers, according to Sherson, was Brough's, ''The Field of the Cloth of Gold''.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, ''The Era'', 12 July 1874  p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Jameson Turner was by far the longest serving actor at the Strand. His first appearances pre-dated the Swanboroughs. He moved from the Lyceum to the Strand in 1849, his first wife, Eleanor, and eldest daughter, Ellen, also appearing with him.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, ''The Era'',  23 September 1849&lt;/ref&gt; He served under both Farren and Payne, and was in the Swanborough's first production. Turner also ran a theatrical agency. His final appearance was at a benefit for the Strand General Theatrical Fund (of which he had been treasurer) in April 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Matinee at The Strand, ''The Era'', 22 April 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appearance of the popular [[pantomime]] character, [[Widow Twankey]], played by James Rogers in Byron's version of ''Aladdin,'' took place at The Strand in 1861. Other successful works in the 1870s, included the hit operettas ''[[Madame Favart]]'' and ''[[Olivette (operetta)|Olivette]]''.  It also hosted [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Frederic Clay]]'s comic opera ''[[Princess Toto]]'' in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was rebuilt in 1865, re-opening 18 November 1865, destroyed by fire on 21 October 1866 and again rebuilt.&lt;ref name="Stage" /&gt; In 1882, the theatre was condemned as having inadequate fire precautions and closed on 29 July. It was rebuilt by [[Charles J. Phipps]], re-opening on 18 November 1882 with improved access. The cost to Mrs. Swanborough was heavy. Attempts were made to recoup the expenditure through a sale, but this was unsuccessful.  Mrs Swanborough had to go through the Bankruptcy Court in 1885.

Sherson said that, after this, the house ceased to be the old Strand. It came under the direction of Alexander Henderson, who produced adaptations of French light opera with the best results. Though it regained a portion of its vogue under the direction of a very clever American actor, John S. Clarke, it was no longer one of the attractions of the London theatrical world.  The musical comedy ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' opened in October 1901 and ran at the theatre for a record breaking 1,075 performances, until closing in 1904.&lt;ref name="Stage" /&gt;

==Demolition==
[[File:1901 WychStreet.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A 1901 postcard of [[Wych Street]], shortly before its demolition. It lay north of the theatre, but was typical of the area.]]
In the 16th century, Strand had hosted many grand houses by the [[River Thames]] and the area began to be built up. By the end the 18th, it had become a notorious [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] - an overcrowded slum. The area had been unaffected by the [[Great Fire of London]] and survived with narrow streets, unsuited to the new traffic. A scheme was instituted to build a new road, [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] between [[Holborn]] and Strand, culminating in a grand crescent, [[Aldwych]]. After many false starts, the scheme was begun in 1901 by the [[London County Council]]. To go with this a link was built to the tube station at [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]], and in 1905 the theatre was acquired by Act of Parliament and demolished to enable [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych underground station]] to be constructed on the site. The many actors who were attached to the theatre protested against its deconstruction. The station is now closed but is said to be haunted by an angry actress who still scares people today.&lt;ref name=Stage/&gt;

Apart from this theatre, the [[Olympic Theatre|Olympic]], [[Opera Comique]], [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe]], Old Gaiety and many others were swept away by the scheme, they were replaced by the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]], [[Aldwych Theatre|Aldwych]] and [[Novello Theatre|New Theatre]]s, and a realignment of the [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum]].

'''Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe''' is a firm of [[bookbinding|bookbinders]] established in [[London]] in 1901.   It is considered to be one of the most important bookbinding companies of the 20th century, famous for its luxurious [[jewelled bookbinding|jeweled bindings]] that used real gold and precious stones in their book covers.

Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe was established by Francis Sangorski (1875-1912) and George Sutcliffe (1878-1943).  They had met in 1896 at a bookbinding [[evening class]]es taught by [[Douglas Bennett Cockerell|Douglas Cockerell]] at the [[London County Council]]'s [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]].  In 1898, Sangorski and Sutcliffe each won one of the ten annual craft scholarship awards, giving them £20 a year for three years to continue their training as [[apprentice]] bookbinders. They were employed at Cockerell's own bindery, and began to teach bookbinding at [[Camberwell College of Art]].  They were laid off in 1901 after a [[coal strike]] caused an economic slump, and they decided to set up on their own in a rented attic in [[Bloomsbury]], starting on 1 October 1901.  They soon moved to [[Vernon Place]], and then, in 1905, to [[Southampton Row]].

Sangorski's elder brother, [[Alberto Sangorski]], worked for the firm.  He became an accomplished [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator]], working for [[Robert Riviere|Rivière]] from 1910.

They quickly revived the art of [[jewelled bookbinding]]s, decorating their sumptuous multi-colour leather book bindings with gold inlay and precious and semi-precious jewels.  They were commissioned to create a most luxurious binding of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', the front cover of which was adorned with three golden peacocks with jewelled tails and surrounded by heavily tooled and gilded vines, that was sent on the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912.  The book, known as the [[Great Omar]], sank with the ship and has not been recovered.  Shortly afterwards, Sangorski drowned.

Sutcliffe continued the firm, which became recognised as one of the leading bookbinders in London.  The bindery moved to [[Poland Street]], and managed to survive through the [[First World War]], the [[Great Depression]], the [[Second World War]], and post-war austerity.  In this period, it undertook work for the [[Ashendene Press]], [[Golden Cockerel Press]] and the [[J. &amp; E. Bumpus]] bookshop. It also created miniature books for [[Queen Mary's Dolls' House]].

After Sutcliffe suffered a [[stroke]] in 1936, he entrusted the business to his nephew, [[Stanley Bray]] (1907-1995), who had worked for his uncle since 1926.  The company merged with [[HT Woods]] in 1939, bringing Kenneth Hobson to the firm.  He introduced a more modern style of binding.  Bray inherited the company on Sutcliffe's death.  The firm merged again in 1988, joining with [[Zaehnsdorf]]'s bindery in [[Bermondsey]] (established by [[Joseph Zaehnsdorf]] in 1842).  The combined business was bought by [[Asprey]] in 1985 and renamed SSZ Limited.  Shepherds, a bookbinding company, bought the company from Asprey in 1998, and revived the Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe name.  The bindery recently moved from its premises in Bermondsey to [[Rochester Row]].

A second copy of the Omar Khayyam was bound as World War II broke out and this was placed in a bank safe vault for safe keeping, but enemy bombing destroyed the vault and the second copy. Stanley Bray after his retirement made a Third version of the binding using the original design, this is now in the British Library.

==Archaeology==
[[Image:Mosaique MN Carthage femme.jpg| Sidi Ghrib: Rosegarden mosaic|thumb|right|Image:Mosaique MN Carthage femme.jpg| Sidi Ghrib Rosegarden mosaic]]The site was searched in 1975.  The study by Abdelmajid Ennabli&lt;ref&gt;Abdelmajid Ennabli , "The thiase baths of Sidi Ghrib (Tunisia)", Monuments and memories of the Eugene Piot Foundation , vol.  68, No. 68, 1986, p.  1-59 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdelmajid Ennabli and Lucinda Neuru, "Excavations at Sidi Ghrib", Echoes of the Classical World / Classical Views , vol.

The thermal baths at the site formed part of the villa and were therefore private.  With a total area of 780 m 2 , they measure 28 by 29 meters, around a [[frigidarium]] of about 8.5 meters by 9.5 meters. 

===Description of the mosaics=== 
# Matron at his toilet , displayed at the National Museum of Bardo , is a mosaic representing the domina , the mistress of house, occupied with her toilet and surrounded by two maidservants of which one holds a mirror and the other carries a basket containing various jewels .  At the end of the mosaic, the artist presented the necessary accessories for the bath: a pair of sandals, a basket of linen, a pitcher, etc.;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, Splendours of the mosaics of Tunisia , ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18266">'''Sigmund Freud's views on religion''' are described in several of his books and essays. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''A History of God'' (New York: Ballantine Books 1993) p. 357 {{ISBN|0-345-38456-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's religious background==
In ''An Autobiographical Study'', originally published in 1925,  Freud recounts that "My parents were Jews, and I have remained a Jew myself." Familiarity with Bible stories, from an age even before he learned to read, had "an enduring effect on the direction of my interest." In 1873, upon attending the University at Vienna, he first encountered [[antisemitism]]: "I found that I was expected to feel myself inferior and an alien because I was a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''An Autobiographical Study'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-393-00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a prefatory note to the Hebrew translation of ''Totem and Taboo'' (1930) Freud describes himself as "an author who is ignorant of the language of holy writ, who is completely estranged from the religion of his fathers—as well as from every other religion" but who remains "in his essential nature a Jew and who has no desire to alter that nature".&lt;ref&gt;"Freud, Sigmind ''Totem and Taboo'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1950) p. xi {{ISBN|0-393-00143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices''==
In ''Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices'' (1907), his earliest writing about religion, Freud suggests that religion and neurosis are similar products of the human mind:  neurosis, with its compulsive behavior, is "an individual religiosity", and religion, with its repetitive rituals, is a "universal obsessional neurosis."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter, editor, ''The Freud Reader'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1995) p. 435 {{ISBN|0-393-31403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Totem and Taboo''==
In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', published in 1913, Freud analyzes the tendency of primitive tribes to promulgate rules against [[incest]] within groups named for [[totem]] animal and objects, and to create [[taboos]] regarding actions, people and things. He notes that taboos (such as that regarding incest) still play a significant role in modern society but that totemism "has long been abandoned as an actuality and replaced by newer forms". Freud believes that an original act of [[patricide]]—the killing and devouring of "the violent primal father" was remembered and re-enacted as a "totem meal...mankind's earliest festival" which was "the beginning of so many things—of social organization, of moral restrictions and of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmind ''Totem and Taboo'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1950) pp. x, 142 {{ISBN|0-393-00143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud develops this idea further in ''Moses and Monotheism'', his last book, discussed below. He further goes to attribute creation of gods to humans: "...we know that, like gods, [demons] are only the product of the psychic powers of man; they have been created from and out of something."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund "Totem and Taboo" (chapter 2, kindle edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Autobiographical Study'' Freud elaborated on the core idea of ''Totem and Taboo'': "This view of religion throws a particularly clear light upon the psychological basis of Christianity, in which, it may be added, the ceremony of the totem-feast still survives with but little distortion in the form of Communion."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''An Autobiographical Study'' (New York:W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 130–131 {{ISBN|0-393-00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Future of an Illusion''==
In ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud refers to religion as an illusion which is "perhaps the most important item in the psychical inventory of a civilization". In his estimation, religion provides for defense against "the crushingly superior force of nature" and "the urge to rectify the shortcomings of civilization which made themselves painfully felt".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that all religious beliefs are "illusions and insusceptible of proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud then examines the issue of whether, without religion, people will feel "exempt from all obligation to obey the precepts of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "civilization has little to fear from educated people and brain-workers" in whom secular motives for morality replace religious ones; but he acknowledges the existence of "the great mass of the uneducated and oppressed" who may commit murder if not told that God forbids it, and who must be "held down most severely" unless "the relationship between civilization and religion" undergoes "a fundamental revision".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud asserts that dogmatic religious training contributes to a weakness of intellect by foreclosing lines of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "[I]n the long run nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction which religion offers to both is all too palpable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter. ''Freud: A life for our time'' (New York: Norton, 1998) p. 535 {{ISBN|0-393-31826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed Freud's "hope that in the future science will go beyond religion, and reason will replace faith in God."&lt;ref&gt;Mary K. O'Neill and Salman Aktar, eds, ''On Freud's 'The Future of an Illusion' '' (London: Karnac Books, 2009) p. x {{ISBN|978-1-85575-627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an afterword to ''An Autobiographical Study'' (1925, revised 1935), Freud states that his "essentially negative" view of religion changed somewhat after ''The Future of an Illusion'';  while religion's  "power lies in the truth which it contains, I showed that that truth was not a material but a historical truth."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''An Autobiographical Study'' (New York:W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 130–131, 138 {{ISBN|0-393-00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] calls ''The Future of an Illusion'', "one of the great failures of religious criticism." Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion, and that as a result his criticisms of it were no more convincing than [[T. S. Eliot]]'s criticisms of psychoanalysis. Bloom suggests that psychoanalysis and [[Christianity]] are both interpretations of the world and of human nature, and that while Freud believed that religious beliefs are illusions and delusions, the same may be said of psychoanalytic theory. In his view nothing is accomplished with regard to either Christianity or psychoanalysis by listing their illusions and delusions.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Civilization and its Discontents''==
In ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'', published in 1930, Freud says that man's need for religion could be explained by "a sensation of 'eternity', a feeling as of something limitless, unbounded—as it were, 'oceanic'", and adds, "I cannot discover this 'oceanic' feeling in myself".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 11–12 {{ISBN|0-393-09623-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Freud suggests that the "oceanic feeling", which his friend [[Romain Rolland]] had described to him in a letter, is a wish fulfillment, related to the child's egoistic need for protection.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, David, ''Cultural Theory and Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers Rutgers University 2009) p. 117 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Strachey]], editor and translator of this and other works of Freud, describes the main theme of the work as "the irremediable antagonism between the demands of instinct and the restrictions of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;James Strachey, "Editors' Introduction", in Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 11–12 {{ISBN|0-393-09623-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also treats two other themes, the development of civilization recapitulating individual development, and the personal and social struggle between "Eros" and "Thanatos", life and death urges.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Siegel, "Freud and His Discontents", in ''The New York Times'' for May 8, 2005 https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/books/review/08SIEGELL.html?pagewanted=print
Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud expresses deep pessimism about the odds of humanity's reason triumphing over its destructive forces. He added a final sentence to the book in a 1931 edition, when the threat of Hitler was already becoming apparent: "But who can foresee with what success and with what result?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 92 and editor's footnote {{ISBN|0-393-09623-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist political philosopher [[Christopher Hitchens]] cited this book as a reason behind Freud being one of his most influential figures. Hitchens described the book as a "pessimistic unillusioned tale of realism," noting that Freud "wasted little time in identifying [the need for religion] as infantile" and pointing out a summary by Freud's biographer [[Ernest Jones]] that "Human happiness, therefore, does not seem to be the purpose of the universe." &lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York/London W.W. Norton 2010), pp. 9-20 introduction {{ISBN|0-393-30451-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Moses and Monotheism''==
[[File:'Moses' by Michelangelo JBU140.jpg|thumb|right|Moses by Michelangelo]]
''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' was Freud's last book, published in 1939, the year of his death. In it, Freud makes certain guesses and assumptions about [[Moses]] as a historical figure, particularly that he was not born Jewish but was adopted by Jews (the opposite of the Biblical story) and that he was murdered by his followers, who then via [[reaction formation]] revered him and became irrevocably committed to the monotheistic idea he represented.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (New York: Vintage Books 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edmundson, "Defender of the Faith?" ''The New York Times'' September 9, 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09wwln-lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Edmundson comments that in writing ''Moses and Monotheism'', Freud, while not abandoning his atheism, perceived for the first time a value in the abstract form of monotheism—the worship of an invisible God, without Jesus or saints—practiced by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edmundson, "Defender of the Faith?" ''The New York Times'' September 9, 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09wwln-lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|So the mental labor of monotheism prepared the Jews&amp;nbsp;— as it would eventually prepare others in the West&amp;nbsp;— to achieve distinction in law, in mathematics, in science and in literary art. It gave them an advantage in all activities that involved making an abstract model of experience, in words or numbers or lines, and working with the abstraction to achieve control over nature or to bring humane order to life. Freud calls this internalizing process an “advance in intellectuality,” and he credits it directly to religion.}}

In ''Moses and Monotheism'', Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of [[Akhenaten]] who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume XXIII (1937-1939)'', "Moses and monotheism". London: [[Hogarth Press]], 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jay Geller, ''Moses and Monotheism'' is full of "false starts, deferred conclusions, repetitions, rationalizations, defensive self-justifications, questionable methods, and weak arguments that are readily acknowledged as such by Freud."&lt;ref&gt;Jay Geller, "A PALEONTOLOGICAL VIEW OF FREUD'S STUDY OF RELIGION: UNEARTHING THE LEITFOSSIL CIRCUMCISION" Modern Judaism 13 (1993): 49–70 http://mj.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/49.full.pdf Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Question of a Weltanschauung''==
The later developments in Freud’s views on religion are summarized in his lecture on the Question of a Weltanschauung, Vienna, 1932.  There he describes the struggles of science in its relations with three other powers: art, philosophy and religion.
  
Art is an illusion of some sort and a long story.  Philosophy goes astray in its method.  Religion constructed a consistent and self-contained ''Weltanschauung'' to an unparalleled degree.  By comparison science is marked by certain negative characteristics.  Among them it asserts that there are no sources of knowledge of the universe other than the intellectual working over of carefully scrutinized observations, and none that is derived from revelation, intuition or divination.
  
&lt;small&gt;''In this Freudian summary there is nothing that is heard about the dialects of leaders, nor of multitudes, nor disciplines that are rarely heard of outside of Ivy League institutions, which always seem to think that science is supposed to have Aristotle in it.  Nothing is said about High Schools, where it is well known that it must have started up at some time around the seventeenth century, or around there somewhere anyway.  No discussion is heard about the understandings of any scientists, whatever they are, or artists, no philosophers come up, no Ayatollahs nor Bishops are heard of.''&lt;/small&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
  
On relations between science and philosophy and science and religion Freud has this much to say in one sentence: “It is not permissible to declare that science is one field of human mental activity and that religion and philosophy are others, at least equal in value, and that science has no business to interfere with the other two: that they all have an equal claim to be true and that everyone is at liberty to choose from which he will draw his convictions and in which he will place his belief.”  Then he goes on to say that such an impermissible view is regarded as superior and tolerant, but that it is not tenable, that it shares all the pernicious features of an entirely unscientific Weltanschauung and that it is equivalent to one in practice.

With respect to religion in particular he explains that a religious person had once been feeble and helpless.  A parent had protected him.  Later such a person gets more insight into the perils of life and he rightly concludes that fundamentally he still remains just as helpless as he was in his childhood.

Then he harks back to the mnemic image.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'', New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1965, pages 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses and criticisms==
In a 1949 essay in [[Commentary (magazine)|''Commentary'' magazine]], [[Irving Kristol]] says that Freud exposed what he believed to be the irrationality of religion without evidence, but has not substituted anything beyond "a mythology of rational despair".&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kristol, "God and the Psychoanalysts: Can Freud and Religion Be Reconciled?" ''Commentary Magazine'' November 1949 http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/god-and-the-psychoanalysts-br-em-can-freud-and-religion-be-reconciled-em--906 Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1950 book entitled ''Christianity and Freud'', Benjamin Gilbert Sanders draws parallels between the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Christian religion]], referring to [[Jesus Christ]] as "the Great Psychiatrist" and Christians' love for Christ as "a more positive form of the Transference."&lt;ref&gt;"Freudian Christianity", Time Magazine, February 6, 1950 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811843,00.html Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karen Armstrong]] notes in ''[[A History of God]]'' that "not all psychoanalysts agreed with Freud's view of God," citing [[Alfred Adler]], who believed God was a projection which had been "helpful to humanity", and [[C.G. Jung]], who, when asked whether he believed in God, said "Difficult to answer, I know. I don't need to believe. I know."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''A History of God'' (New York: Ballantine Books 1993) p. 357 {{ISBN|0-345-38456-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Campolo]], founder of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education, observes that "With Freud, God, and the need for God-dictated restraints, had been abolished,"&lt;ref&gt;Tony Campolo, "Religion After Freud", Huffington Post January 31, 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-campolo/religion-after-freud_b_40071.html Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an increase in social chaos and unhappiness which could have been avoided by adherence to religion.

A number of critics draw the parallel between religious beliefs and Freud's theories, that neither can be scientifically proven, but only experienced subjectively. Lee Siegel writes that "you either grasp the reality of Freud's dynamic notion of the subconscious intuitively&amp;nbsp;– the way, in fact, you do or do not grasp the truthfulness of [[Ecclesiastes]]&amp;nbsp;– or you cannot accept that it exists."&lt;ref&gt;Lee Siegel, "Freud and His Discontents", in ''The New York Times'' for May 8, 2005 https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/books/review/08SIEGELL.html?pagewanted=print Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Société des Artistes Indépendants''' (''Society of Independent Artists''), '''Salon des Indépendants''' was formed in [[Paris]] on 29 July 1884. The association began with the organization of massive exhibitions in Paris, choosing the slogan "''sans jury ni récompense''" ("without jury nor reward"). [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] were among its founders. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century, along with the [[Salon d'Automne]]. This is where artworks were often first displayed and widely discussed. [[World War I]] brought a closure to the salon, though the ''Artistes Indépendants'' remained active. Since 1920, the headquarters is located in the vast basements of the [[Grand Palais]] (next door to the ''[[Société des Artistes Français]]'', the ''[[Société Nationale des Beaux Arts|Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]'', the [[Salon d'Automne|Société du Salon d'Automne]], and others).

The '''Salon des Indépendants''' (Salon des Artistes Indépendants) is an annual independent art exhibition aimed at a large audience that takes place in Paris. It was established in response to the rigid traditionalism of the official government-sponsored Salon. Since the first exhibition of 1884, at the Pavilion de la ville de Paris ([[Champs-Élysées]]), the organizing Société des Artistes Indépendants has vowed to bring together the works of artists claiming a certain independence in their art. The event is characterized by the absence of both awards and a selection jury. There are however placement or hanging committees. In contrast to the [[Salon d'Automne]], which takes place in Paris during autumn months, the Indépendants is held during the springtime, inspiring artistic production during winter months, as artists prepare for the show. Several important dates have marked the history of the salon.

During the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], artists not backed by the official ''[[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]]'' in charge of the exhibits at the annual ''Salon'' or without support supplied by actual political constellations had little chance to advance. From year to year the number of artists working in Paris, the number of artists submitting works to the official ''[[Paris Salon|Salon]]'' and the number of works refused by the jury increased, but neither the Second Empire nor the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] found an answer to this situation.

For years, the artists had counted on official support. In 1884, finally, the artists began to organise themselves, and a "''Group of independent artists''" was authorised by the Ministry of Fine Arts to arrange an exhibition, while the City of Paris agreed to supply rooms for the presentation. So, from May 15 through July 15, the first "free" exhibition of contemporary art showed more than 5000 works by more than 400 artists.

Although sustained by Mesureur, deputy chairman of the Council of Paris and [[Grandmaster (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Grand Lodge]] of France, by Frédéric Hattat, chairman of the Fine Art commission in the same council, by Albert Dubois-Pillet, commanding the [[French Republican Guard|Republican Guard]], member of the [[Grand Orient de France]], the beginning of the Company, considered as a nest of [[revolutionaries]], were difficult.

===Establishment===
June 11, 1884, Maître Coursault, notary at [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]], officially confirmed the establishment of the ''Société''

Article 1 of the organization's statutes reads,
:...the purpose of ''Société des Artistes Indépendants'' – based on the principle of abolishing admission jury – is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom.

===Groupe vs. Société===
Members of the ''Groupe'' challenged this foundation and succeeded to have an exhibition arranged "for the victims of the recent [[cholera]] epidemic", inaugurated December 1, 1884, by Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council. But financially the result was a catastrophe. Nevertheless, in spring 1885, the "Groupe" organised its next exhibition, this time with some success.

==Early exhibitions==

The Salon des Indépendants arose through the need by artists to present their works to the general public independently, rather than through the official selective method of the "Salon" (created by [[Louis XIV]]).&lt;ref name="Indépendants"&gt;[http://www.artistes-independants.fr/index.php?page=historique&amp;chlangue=us Société des Artistes Indépendants, History]&lt;/ref&gt; A small collective of innovative artists—[[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Camille Pissarro]] along with [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]]—created the Salon des Indépendants. The right to present their works to the public with no restrictions was their only condition. Article no. 1 of the By-laws of the organization: "The purpose of Société des Artistes Indépendants—based on the principle of abolishing admission jury—is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom".&lt;ref name="Indépendants" /&gt;

On 1 December 1884, Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council, opened the first Salon des Artistes Indépendants at the Palais Polychrome (near the Palais de l'Industrie). The Salon became the refuge for artworks deemed unacceptable by the traditional Salon. Among the works exhibited were Seurat's "[[Bathers at Asnières|La baignade à Asnières]]" Signac's "Le Pont d'Austerlitz", and works of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Armand Guillaumin]], [[Charles Angrand]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Indépendants" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/salon%20des%20Indépendants Salon des Indépendants, Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proceeds of the first show were earmarked for the victims of [[cholera]]. The second exhibition was held in 1886 in a temporary building in the [[Tuileries Garden]] with 200 paintings exhibited. By 1905 [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Henri Matisse]] had exhibited there.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; During the period between 1890 and 1914 known as ''La [[Belle Époque]]'' practically all of the artists associated with [[modernism]] and the [[avant-garde]] exhibited at the Indépendants. The works exhibited ranged in style from [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] to [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]], [[Les Nabis|Nabis]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-impressionist]]/[[Divisionism|Divisionist]], [[Fauvism|Fauve]], [[Expressionism|Expressionist]], [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[Abstract art]].

The submission payment was 10 francs for four works. In 1906 ten works could be submitted for 25 francs and from 1909 only two. In 1901 more than thousand paintings were shown. 2,395 works were exhibited in 1904, and 1905, 4,269 works by 669 artists. By 1908 six thousand works were displayed at the Indépendants. In 1910 the number of artists increased to 1,182, rising progressively to 2,175 by 1930. In 1926 the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] estimated that only 100 of the 3,726 artworks were of any value.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 and 1897 the Salon des Indépendants was held at the [[:fr:Palais des Beaux-Arts et des Arts libéraux|Palais des Beaux-Arts et des Arts libéraux]] ([[Champ de Mars]]). Between 1901 and 1907, the exhibition was held in the Grandes Serres de la Ville de Paris (Cours-la-Reine, Paris), also called ''Grande Serre de l'Alma'', built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900. From 1920 the exhibitions were held at the [[Grand Palais|Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

In 1902 the Indépendants featured a retrospective of works by Toulouse-Lautrec. [[Jean Metzinger]] sent three paintings to the Salon des Indépendants in 1903, and subsequently moved to Paris with the proceeds from their sale. He again exhibiting several paintings, this time along with [[Robert Delaunay]], at the Indépendants of 1904, where Cross presented his Venice series. In 1905 the salon featured retrospectives of works by Seurat and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1905 Fauvism==
From 24 March to 30 April, the burgeoning of Fauvism was visible at the Indépendants, prior to the infamous Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905 which historically marks the birth of the term Fauvism, after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

At the 1905 Indépendants [[Henri Matisse]] exhibited with [[Albert Marquet]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Charles Camoin]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="21ème catalogue"&gt;[http://cdm16028.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16028coll4/id/4116/rec/100 Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 21ème exposition, 1905, Digital collection: Rare Books in the Thomas J. Watson Library, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)]&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition was reviewed by Vauxcelles in [[Gil Blas]] on 4, 18 and 23 March 1905.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T. Clement, ''Les Fauves: A Sourcebook'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994] {{ISBN|0-313-28333-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matisse exhibited the proto-Fauve painting ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]''. In the [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique and brightly colored, it was painted in 1904, after a summer spent working in [[St. Tropez]] on the [[French Riviera]] alongside the [[neo-Impressionism|neo-Impressionist]] painters [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Art Council et al. 1966, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had first adopted after reading Signac's essay, "D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme" in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, "Henri Matisse"&lt;/ref&gt; Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Indépendants.

Matisse is in charge of the hanging committee, assisted by Metzinger, Bonnard, Camoin, Laprade Luce, Manguin, Marquet, Puy and Vallotton.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

==1906, all the Fauves==
[[File:Bonheur Matisse.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], 1905-06, ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', oil on canvas, 175 x 241 cm (69 × 95 in), [[Barnes Foundation]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]
At the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 the elected members of the hanging committee included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.

According to Metzinger's memoirs, it was at the 1906 Salon des Indépendants that he met [[Albert Gleizes]] and visited his studio in Courbevoie several days later. In 1907, at Max Jacob's place, Metzinger met Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Metzinger had acquired enough prestige to be elected to the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants, in addition to his entry of eight works.&lt;ref name="21ème catalogue" /&gt; He formed a close friendship at this time with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by one critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907, the wholesale transformation==
In the spring of 1906 [[Georges Braque]] exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1907, held from 20 March to 30 April, six paintings by Braque were exhibited. Five were purchased directly at the Salon des Indépendants by the art dealer Wilhelm Uhde for a total price of 505 FF. The sixth work was presumably bought by the art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; It was around this time that Braque first met Kahnweiler and was introduced to [[Picasso]] by Guillaume Apollinaire. Braque's works were still Fauve in nature. It wasn't until the autumn of 1907 at L’Estaque that Braque began his transition away from bright hues to more subdued colors, possibly as a result of the memorial exhibition of Cézanne’s work at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415082615/http://www.moma.org/m/explore/collection/art_terms/744/0/1.iphone_ajax?klass=artist Lewis Kachur, ''Georges Braque'', MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[André Derain]] exhibited his ''Dancer at Le Rat Mort'', painted during the winter of 1906, and his large ''Bathers'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], New York) of early 1907. No longer truly Fauve, this work is close to Cézanne in its angular form and tonal modeling.

[[File:Matisse Souvenir de Biskra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], 1907, ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'', oil on canvas. 92 x 140 cm, [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]]]
Matisse's ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'' also appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled ''Tableau no. III''. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of ''Nu bleu'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass of an opaque blue under the palm trees... This is an artistic effect tending toward the abstract that escapes me completely. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Blue Nude'' would later create a sensation at the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Matisse, Henri." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, already a certain distance from Fauvism, was deemed so ugly students burned it in effigy at the 1913 Armory Show in Chicago, where it had toured from New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/11/the-response-to-matisses-blue-nude/ Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes, ''The Response to Matisse's Blue Nude'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, and Valtat, and three by Marquet.

Vaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1907, Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatique, oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1907, ''[[Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques]]'', oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm, [[Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.

Many of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.

==1908, barbarous schematizers==
[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, Holland]]

Signac becomes president of the 24th Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1908, held 20 March through 2 May, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; In his review published in ''La Revue des lettres et des arts'' (1 May 1908) Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original effort presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'... who want to create an 'abstract art'.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

This exhibition was reviewed in the ''New York Herald'' 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in ''Gil Blas'' 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in ''Le Courrier du Soir'', 22 March 1908; and by [[Maurice Denis]], in ''La Grande revue'', 10 April 1908.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

In excess of 1,314 artists exhibit 6,701 works. Matisse does not submit any works.

After this salon, the writer [[Gelett Burgess]] begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding [[banlieue]]s. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record'', May 1910, at the heart of the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the "Harmony and volume" and "architectural values," and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color."&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1909, simplified forms==
According to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that one of the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: ''Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)'', no. 215, entitled ''Paysage'', by Georges Braque ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]). On 25 March 1909, Louis Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque (Bracke, sic) exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] as "bizarreries cubiques" (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The evolution towards a more linear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910, ignorant geometers==
[[File:Henri Rousseau - Le Rêve - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Rousseau]] (Le Douanier), 1910, ''[[The Dream (Rousseau painting)|The Dream]]'', [[MoMA]]. Exhibited at the 1910 Indépendants a few months before his death]]
Gleizes exhibits in the Salon des Indépendants for the first time: ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the 'first Cubist portrait'. Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913), that Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900-1930, International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gleizes's memoirs, [[Alexandre Mercereau]] introduces him to Metzinger, but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

[[File:Boronali Impression.jpg|right|thumb|[[:fr:Joachim-Raphaël Boronali|Joachim-Raphaël Boronali]], 1910, ''Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique'', oil on canvas, 54 x 80 cm, painted by the donkey Lolo. Exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants, 1910]]
Apollinaire wrote in the daily newspaper ''L'Intransigeant'', which had a circulation of about 50,000, about the exhibition that consisted of close to 6000 paintings.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

===1910, Lolo the donkey===
Remarkably, even the presence of a painting made by a donkey named Lolo passed by practically unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; The painting was entitled ''[[:fr:Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique|Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique]]'' presented by the artist [[:fr:Joachim-Raphaël Boronali|Joachim-Raphaël Boronali]], the 'excessivist' from Genoa was exhibited at the 1910 Salon des Indépendants. Boronali was in fact the Parisian donkey (Lolo), who made the painting with his tail. (Cf.

[[Roland Dorgelès]] and two friends, [[:fr:André Warnod|André Warnod]] et [[Jules Depaquit]], attached a paint brush to the tail of the animal. The donkey did the rest. The painting sold for 400FF (equal to 1,257 Euros today&lt;ref&gt;[http://smariano.club.fr/pages/divers/conver-franc.htm Conversion table]&lt;/ref&gt;) and was donated by Dorgelès to the ''Orphelinat des Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Groinowski, ''Aux commencements du rire moderne. L'esprit fumiste'', [[José Corti]], Paris, 1997, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting forms part of the permanent collection at ''l'Espace culturel Paul Bédu'' ([[Milly-la-Forêt]]).

==1911, the major scandal of Cubism==

[[File:Delaunay ChampDeMars.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1911, ''Champs de Mars. La Tour rouge'', [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. Exhibited at Salon des Indépendants, 1911]]
The newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasise a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants ensuring that the works of painters now dubbed 'Cubists' would be shown together. Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown together in Room 41.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The result of the group show is a major scandal. Even though the pictures shown are still conventional representations that generally observe the rules of classical perspective (according to Gleizes), the public is outraged by the representation of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity of the subject matter. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), this is the first time the use of the term becomes widespread.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The term 'Cubism' is employed in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, and Le Fauconnier. During the summer, Gleizes is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Both are discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. They have long conversations about the nature of form and perception. They agree that traditional painting gives a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Another Cubist scandal is produced several months later at the Salon d'Automne, where the Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]). [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter interested in [[Abstract art|non-representational]] painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In the spring of 1911 the cubists made sure they were shown together, infiltrating the placement committee. That Le Fauconnier was the secretary of the salon facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works in alphabetical order of the artists names. In room 41 hung works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

This exhibition involved more than 6,400 paintings. In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, and Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1912, the scandal continues==

The Salon des Indépendants transpired in Paris from 20 March to 16 May 1912. This massive exhibition occurred exactly one year after Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, which provoked the scandal out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris. Its wide-ranging repercussions were felt in Germany, Holland, Italy, Russia, Spain and elsewhere (influencing [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and so on). Just five months prior to this show another polemic developed at the Salon d'Automne of 1912. Originating in ''Salle XI'' where the Cubists exhibited their works, this quarrel involved both the French and non-French avant-garde artists. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the [[Chambre des députés]] and was debated at the ''Assemblée Nationale''. At stake was more than just the future of public funding for exhibitions that included Cubist art.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no. XXII -1 (2007), Guerre et statistiques, ''L'art de la mesure, Le Salon d'Automne (1903-1914), l'avant-garde, ses étranger et la nation française''] (The Art of Measure: The Salon d'Automne Exhibition (1903-1914), the Avant-Garde, its Foreigners and the French Nation), electronic distribution Caim for Éditions de l'EHESS (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Le Fauconnier, Gleizes, Léger, Metzinger and Archipenko formed the core of the hanging committee at the 1912 Indépendants. The common hall, room 20, in which the Cubists placed themselves became the nucleus of the exhibition.c&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

At the 1912 Salon des Indépendants Albert Gleizes exhibited ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' (no. 1347) — [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulivrebleu.unblog.fr/page/2/ Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, ''Nu descendant l’escalier'']&lt;/ref&gt; but was withdrawn prior to the exhibition — [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] exhibited ''Artillerie'' (no. 1235) — [[Robert Delaunay]] showed his monumental ''Ville de Paris'' (no. 868) — [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' and ''Le Port'' — [[Fernand Léger]] showed ''La Noce'' — [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)'' — and the newcomer [[Juan Gris]] exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso''.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his ''Port'', Delaunay with ''Paris'', Gleizes with his ''Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;

[[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]]'s reviewed the 1912 Salon des Indépendants in the March–April 1912 issue of La Revue de France et des Pays, noting Metzinger's 'refined choice of colors' and the 'precious rarity' of the painting's 'matière'. [[André Salmon]] too, in his review, noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in ''La Femme au Cheval'' and praised its 'French grace', while noting Metzinger 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Jean+Metzinger,+1910,+1911,+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm0CrcbXtN&amp;sig=a9Kf-dUKbXYjZbmLDg16tto5U0o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=horse&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories''], Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes, on the other hand, would write in 1913 of the Cubist movements continual evolution:
{{quote|The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P."&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, 1925, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in German, 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', the French version was published as ''L'Epopée (The Epic)'', in the journal ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And regarding the reception received by the Cubists at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne Gleizes writes:

{{quote|Never had a crowd been seen thrown into such a turmoil by works of the spirit, and especially over esemplastic works, paintings, whose nature it is to be silent", writes Albert Gleizes, "Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;}}

==1913, the peak of Cubism==
[[File:Juan Gris - Man in a Café.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Gris]], 1912, ''Man in a Café'', oil on canvas, 127.6 x 88.3 cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Exhibited at the 1913 Salon des Indépendants.]]
The Salon des Indépendants was held March 9 through 18 May, the Cubist works were shown in room 46. [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited his large ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' — [[Albert Gleizes]], Albert Gleizes. ''Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)'' 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — [[Robert Delaunay]] ''The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )'' 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — [[Fernand Léger]], ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)'' 1912-13, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York — [[Juan Gris]], ''L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)'' 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.

In room 45 hung the works of [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[František Kupka]], [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Macdonald-Wright]]. This was the first exhibition where [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] and [[Synchromism]] were emphatically present. Apollinaire in ''L'Intransigeant'' mentioned la Salle hollandaise (room 43), which included Jacoba van Heemskerck, [[Piet Mondrian]], Otto van Rees, [[Jan Sluyters]] en [[Leo Gestel]] and Lodewijk Schelfhout.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1914, Orphism==
The 1914 exhibition, held from 1 March to 30 April, was composed of many Orphist works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor: Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]] were largely represented.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1915-1919==
During the First World War there were no exhibitions. After the war, however, there was a revival of Cubism, led by Gleizes and others, which included exhibitions at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s ''Galerie l'Effort Moderne'' and a revival of the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1920, the emergence of Dada==
In an attempt to regain their pre-war status at the forefront of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by [[Dada]], the cubists regrouped.&lt;ref name="Witham"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6xkkSVZz_OYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=picasso+Salon+des+Indépendants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nD60pJBckp&amp;sig=V_8efFBPfjIOb4oX5_BM_ATg_WA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UesTUeGrHIWq0QX004CYBA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=picasso%20Salon%20des%20Indépendants&amp;f=false Larry Witham, ''Picasso and the Chess Player: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and the Battle for the Soul of Modern Art'', University Press of New England (ebook) 2013], {{ISBN|978-1-61168-349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the [[Grand Palais]] des [[Champs-Elysées]]. Picasso was nowhere to be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The most outrageous Dada eruption to date transpired at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. The Dadaist saw the Indépendants as decisive in the push to the top of the avant-garde food chain of the Parisian art scene. The plan was as cunning as it was devious: [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[André Breton]] rented an auditorium at the Grand Palais. A group guided by Tzara distributed flyers and posters saying that [[Charlie Chaplin]] would appear "in the flesh" on February 5. The crowd heckled when Chaplin (not even aware of the event) never showed up, and Tzara was ready: his group hurled insults back at the crowd from the stage.

The renown literary figure [[André Gide]] present in the audience, fooled as the others, described the happening: "Some young people, solemn, stilted, tied up in knots, got up on the platform and as a chorus declaimed insincere inanities".&lt;ref name="Witham" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gide quoted in Wayne Andrews, ''The Surrealist Parade'', New York: New Directions, 1990, p. 40, in Larry Witham, ''Picasso and the Chess Player: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and the Battle for the Soul of Modern Art'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The offensive event witnessed by the more respectable Cubists solicited a vehement denunciation, declaring Dada an abomination.

==1921, a new epoch==
The Salon des Indépendants of 1921, which opened in January, had less Cubist paintings than the previous year. Braque and Metzinger were not represented. The artists that did exhibit included Gleizes, Ferat, Hayden, Marcoussis, Hellesen and Survage. With the Cubists were also [[Hélène Pordriat]], [[Marthe Laurens]], [[Irène Lagut]], [[Alice Halicka]] and [[Sonia Lewitska]]. At the exhibition were also the works of Bissière, Blanchard, [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[André Lhote|Lhote]], [[Henriette Tirman|Tirman]], Zadkine and Lipchitz.

The hanging commission was conducted in opposition to Signac, who was in favor of the alphabetical order system. Léger left the placement committee in 1923. In 1924 placement was classified by nationality and alphabetically. Lhote left the placement committee, which consisted of 20 people, along with eight other members in 1925. Lhote was of the opinion that the change was mainly intended for the "Sunday painters". Signac and his supporters defended the alphabetical order stressing 'equal attention to all participants' and that there was no place for 'les petites chapelles' (the little chapels). The latter was especially directed against the neo-cubists, who after the First World wished to be associated with well-known artists.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

From 1920 the ''Société des Artistes Indépendants'' obtained the Grand Palais for its salon exhibitions. After World War II, the ''Salon des Indépendants'' was renewed with the artist group ''[[:fr:Jeune création|Jeune création]]'', with the assistance of Dunoyer de Segonzac, [[Bernard Buffet]], [[Jean Carzou]], [[Maurice Boitel]], Yves Brayer, Aristide Caillaud, [[Daniel du Janerand]], amongst others.

The [[CIE 1931 color space#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]].

The spectrum colours are the colours on the horseshoe-shaped curve on the outside of the diagram. All other colours are not spectral: the bottom straight line is ''the [[line of purples]]'', whilst within the interior of the diagram are unsaturated colors that are various mixtures of a spectral color or a purple color with [[white]], a grayscale color. White is in the central part of the interior of the diagram, since [[Additive colors|when all colors of light are mixed together, they produce white]].]]

A '''spectral color''' is a [[color]] that is evoked in a normal human by a single [[wavelength]] of [[light]] in the [[visible spectrum]], or by a relatively narrow band of wavelengths, also known as '''monochromatic light'''.  Every wavelength of visible light is perceived as a spectral color, in a continuous spectrum; the colors of sufficiently close wavelengths are indistinguishable.

The spectrum is often divided into named colors, though any division is somewhat arbitrary; the spectrum is continuous. Traditional colors in English include: [[red]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[violet (color)|violet]]. In some other languages the ranges corresponding to color names do not necessarily agree with those in English.

The division used by [[Isaac Newton]], in his [[Color theory#The color wheel|color wheel]], was: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet; a [[mnemonic]] for this order is "[[Roy G. Biv]]". Less commonly, "VIBGYOR" is also used for the reverse order. In modern divisions of the spectrum, [[indigo#Classification as a spectral color|indigo is often omitted]].

One needs at least [[trichromacy|trichromatic]] [[color vision]] for there to be a distinction between spectral and non-spectral colours: trichromacy gives a possibility to perceive both [[hue]] and [[colorfulness|saturation]] in the [[chromaticity|chroma]]. In [[color model]]s capable of representing spectral colors,&lt;ref&gt;[[HSL and HSV]] do not qualify because many spectral colors lie rather far from its [[gamut]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/psy333/lecture_pdfs/chapter7_Color.pdf#page=72|title=Perceiving Color|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[CIELUV]], a spectral color has the maximal saturation.

== In color spaces==
[[File:CIE 1976 UCS.png|thumb|right|This [[metric (mathematics)|metrically]] accurate diagram shows that the spectral locus is almost flat on the red – bright green segment, is strongly curved around green, and becomes less curved between green/cyan and blue]]
In [[color space]]s which include all, or most spectral colors, they form a part of boundary of the set of all real colors. If [[luminance]] is counted, then spectral colors form a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]], otherwise their locus is a [[curve]] in a two-[[dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensional]] [[chromaticity]] space.

Theoretically, only [[RGB color model|RGB]]-implemented colors which might be really spectral are its primaries: red, green, and blue, whereas any other (mixed) color is inherently non-spectral. But due to different chromaticity properties of different spectral segments, and also due to practical limitations of light sources, the actual [[color distance|distance]] between RGB pure [[color wheel]] colors and spectral colors shows a complicated dependence on the [[hue]]. Due to location of R and G primaries near the almost "flat" spectral segment, [[RGB color space]] is reasonably good with approximating spectral orange, yellow, and [[bright green|bright (yellowish) green]], {{anchor|×}}but is especially poor in reaching a visual appearance of spectral colors between green and blue, as well as extreme spectral colors. The [[sRGB]] standard has an additional problem with its "red" primary which is shifted to orange due to a trade-off between purity of red and its reasonable luminance, so that the red spectral became unreachable. Some samples in the table below provide only rough approximations of spectral and near-spectral colors.

[[CMYK color model|CMYK]] is usually even poorer than RGB in its reach of spectral colors, with notable exception of process yellow, which is rather close to spectral colors due to aforementioned flatness of the spectral locus in the red–green segment.

Note that spectral color are universally included to [[color science|scientific]] color models such as CIE 1931, but industrial and consumer color spaces such as sRGB, CMYK, and [[Pantone Matching System|Pantone]], do not include any of spectral colors.

== Table of spectral or near-spectral colors ==
[[File:Laser Pointer.jpg|thumb|Red, green, and blue laser beams]]
Most of the colors listed do not reach the maximal (spectral) [[colorfulness]], or are not usually seen with it, but they can be saturated enough to be perceived closely to their [[dominant wavelength]] spectral colors. Ranges of wavelengths and frequencies are only approximate.

Wavelengths and frequencies &lt;span style="color:gray"&gt;in gray&lt;/span&gt; indicate dominant wavelengths and frequencies, not actual range of spectrum composing a specified color, which extends farther to both sides and is averaged by receptors to give a near-spectral appearance.

==Non-spectral colors==

Among some of the colors that are {{em|not}} spectral colors are:

* [[Grayscale]] (achromatic) colors, such as [[white]], [[Gray (color)|gray]], and [[black]].
* Any color obtained by mixing a gray-scale color and another color (either spectral or not), such as [[pink]] (a mixture of a [[red]]dish color and white), or [[brown]] (a mixture of [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and black or gray).
* [[Violet (color)|Violet]]-[[red]] colors, which in [[color theory]] include [[line of purples]] colors (such as, approximately, [[magenta]] and [[Rose (color)|rose]]), and other variations of purple and red.
*[[Impossible color]]s, which cannot be seen under normal viewing of light, such as over-saturated colors or colors that are seemingly brighter than white.
*[[Metallic color]]s which reflect light by effect.

'''Swedish Game Awards''' is [[Sweden]]'s largest [[video game]] development competition. It has been held annually since 2002 and is organized by the student-driven, non-profit entrepreneurship association at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Excitera]]. The competition's audience is students at Swedish universities and high schools, particularly those studying [[game development]] and [[software engineering]]. Funding is handled through partnerships with various software and game development companies, e.g. [[Digital Illusions CE]] and [[Sun Microsystems]].

== History ==
Swedish Game Awards started in 2002 as a PC-only game competition under the name KTH Game Awards, and was targeted mainly at students in the [[Stockholm]] area. In 2004, KTH Game Awards was merged with another competition organized by Excitera, called the Excitera Mobile Award. This led to the creation of special class for [[mobile phone]] games. After its first iteration, the name was changed to Swedish Game Awards to reflect the increase in scope from local to national competition, as well as the fact that the competition had grown to be the largest of its kind in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameawards.se/history Swedish Game Awards 2011 – History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811115526/http://gameawards.se/history |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the competitions hosts changed from students of [[Royal Institute of Technology]] to students of [[Södertörn University]] (while still maintaining its cooperation with [[Excitera]]).

In 2015 the competition added the category Best Diversity Effort as a result of their cooperataion with [[Diversi]] to reflect the games industry's increasing interest in variation of its developers and consumers. The final day of the competition also had [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umQO2r7g7Q its first livestream] on YouTube by cooperating with students of [[Medieinstitutet]] to make the announcement of the winners available directly to the public. It also broke the previous record of submitted games in 2014 (which was 98) with 104 games.

The competition has gradually gained recognition from Swedish game development companies and universities as a way for students to show their game development capabilities and thus increase their chances of getting employment within the [[video game industry]].

== Current Competition ==

The 2014-2015 competition is organized by a team of Stockholm-based university students in various fields related to game design. &lt;br /&gt;
In its 13th year, the Swedish Game Awards continues annually to draw greater numbers of entries from student-development teams across Sweden.

=== Rules ===

The parameters to the competition have remained relatively stable over the years, aimed toward providing a launching pad for talented, independent, student game developers to develop new and marketable games. &lt;br /&gt;
The official rules are available at http://gameawards.se/competition/rules.

=== Event Timeline ===

The process of the Swedish Game Awards spans the majority of each academic year. Beginning in October with the SGA Kickoff, previous winners, current jury members, and corporate sponsors are invited to present their perspectives of the game industry and the Swedish Game Awards in particular to the upcoming year's participants. Also at this time, the various award categories are announced. The competition submissions are developed by independent teams during the year, culminating in a Jury Weekend and Grand Finale party in late May.

In the early months of the competition, the SGA Tour also occurs. During the tour, representatives from the Swedish Game Awards visit universities and technical schools across the country to engage with competition participants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61419">'''[[Molecular symmetry]]''' in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry. Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in the application of [[Quantum Mechanics]] in physics and chemistry, for example it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's properties, such as its [[molecular dipole moment|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[dipole]] moment and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]] (based on [[selection rules]]), without doing the exact rigorous calculations (which, in some cases, may not even be possible). [[Group theory]] is the predominant framework for analyzing molecular symmetry.

Among all the molecular symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features and they are relatively easier to analyze.

== Symmetry and group theory ==
The physical laws governing a system is generally written as a relation (equations, differential equations, integral equations etc.). An operation on the ingredients of this relation, which keeps the form of the relations invariant is called a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system.
* These [[symmetry]] operations can involve external or internal co-ordinates; giving rise to geometrical or internal symmetries. 
* These symmetry operations can be global or local; giving rise to global or gauge symmetries.
* These symmetry operations can be discrete or continuous.
Symmetry is a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanics. It can predict conserved quantities and provide quantum numbers. It can predict degeneracies of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]]s and gives insights about the matrix elements of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] without calculating them. Rather than looking into individual symmetries, it is sometimes more convenient to look into the general relations between the symmetries. It turns out that [[Group theory]] is the most efficient way of doing this.

=== Groups ===
{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}
A&amp;nbsp;''group''&amp;nbsp;is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form (''G'',*)) consisting of a set&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;and a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;'*'&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes loosely called 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:
# '''&lt;u&gt;closure&lt;/u&gt;''': For every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;
x,y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;''product''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;

x*y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;''.''
# '''&lt;u&gt;associativity&lt;/u&gt;''': For every&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''x''*(''y''*''z'') result with the same element in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\forall x,y,z\in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of identity&lt;/u&gt;''': There must be an element ( say&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product any element of&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;make no change to the element ( in symbols,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
x*e=e*x=x;\forall x\in G&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of inverse&lt;/u&gt;''': For each element (&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G'', there must be an element&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product of&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;is the identity element&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, for each &lt;math&gt;
x\in G
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\text{ }\exists \text{ }y\in G
&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x=e
&lt;/math&gt;).
* In addition to the above four, if it so happens that &lt;math&gt;
\forall x,y\in G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x
&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the operation in '''commutative,''' then the group is called an [[Abelian Group]]. Otherwise it is called a [[Non-abelian group|Non-Abelian Group]].

=== Groups, symmetry and conservation  ===
{{Main|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}The set of all symmetry transformations of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] has the structure of a group, with group multiplication equivalent to applying the transformations one after the other. The group elements can be represented as matrices, so that the group operation becomes the ordinary matrix multiplication. In quantum mechanics, the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of states are given by unitary operators, so each of the elements of the symmetry groups are unitary operators. Now any unitary operator can be expressed as the exponential of some [[Hermitian operator]] . So, the corresponding Hermitian operators are the '[[Generating set of a group|generators]]' of the [[symmetry group]]. These unitary transformations act on the Hamiltonian operator in some [[Hilbert space]] in a way that the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the transformations. In other words, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian. If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Unitary operator|unitary symmetry operator]] and acts on the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then;

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;[H,U]=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {H}'={{U}^{\dagger }}HU=H \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow HU=UH \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow [H,U]=0;\forall U\in G \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These operators have the above-mentioned properties of a group: 
* The symmetry operations are closed under multiplication. 
* Application of symmetry transformations are associative.
* There is always a trivial transformation, where nothing is done to the original co-ordinates. This is the identity element of the group. 
* And as long as an inverse transformation exists, it is a symmetry transformation, i.e. it leaves the Hamiltonian invariant. Thus the inverse is part of this set. 
So, by the symmetry of a system, we mean a set of operators, each of which [[commutator|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian, and they form a [[symmetry group]]. This group may be Abelian or Non-Abelian. Depending upon which one it is, the properties of the system changes (for example, if the group is Abelian, there would be no [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]]). Corresponding to every different kind of symmetry in a system, we can find a symmetry group associated with it.

It follows that the generator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the symmetry group also commutes with the Hamiltonian. Now, it follows that:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! The observable corresponding to the generator Hermitian matrix, is conserved.
|-
| The derivative of the expectation value of the operator T can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{d\left\langle \Psi |T|\Psi  \right\rangle }{dt}=\left\langle \frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}|T|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |T|\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Now,

&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \left| \Psi  \right\rangle }{\partial t}=H\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=-\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |HT|\Psi  \right\rangle +\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |TH|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

as H is also Hermitian. So we have,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle [H,T] \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;[H,T]=0 &lt;/math&gt; as stated above, and if the operator T does not have any explicit time-dependence;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \left\langle T \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is a constant, independent of what the state &lt;math&gt;\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may be.

So the observable corresponding to the operator T, is conserved.
|}
Some specific examples can be systems having [[Rotational symmetry|rotational]], [[translational invariance]] etc.. For a rotationally invariant system, The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the general rotation group. Now, if (say) the system is invariant about any rotation about Z-axis (i.e., the system has [[axial symmetry]]), then the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the group of rotation about the symmetry axis. Now, this group is generated by the Z-component of the orbital angular momentum, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; (general group element &lt;math&gt;R(\alpha )={{e}^{\frac{-i\alpha {{L}_{z}}}{\hbar }}}
&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; for this system and Z-component of the angular momentum is conserved. Similarly, translation symmetry gives rise to conservation of linear momentum, inversion symmetry gives rise to parity conservation and so on.

== Geometrical symmetries ==

=== Symmetry operations, point groups and permutation-inversion groups ===
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
A molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually has some geometrical symmetry.This symmetry is described by a certain [[point group]] which consists of operations (called symmetry operations) that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that is indistinguishable from the starting configuration. There are five types of point group symmetry operation: identity, rotation, reflection, inversion and [[improper rotation]] or rotation-reflection. Common to all symmetry operations is that the geometrical center-point of the molecule does not change its position; hence the name [[point group]]. One  can determine the elements of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one uses a point group, the elements are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the elements rotate and/or reflect the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these elements commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. See the Section "Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry" below, and [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] 
.  The elements of permutation-inversion groups commute with the full molecular Hamiltonian. In addition to point groups, there exists another kind of group important in [[crystallography]], where translation in 3-D also needs to be taken care of. They are known as [[space group]]s.

=== Basic point group symmetry operations ===
The five basic symmetry operations mentioned above are:&lt;ref&gt;http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/script/redirect.cgi?filename=http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/symmetry/index1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Identity Operation&amp;nbsp;E '''(from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity)''':'' '''''The identity operation leaves the molecule unchanged. It forms the identity element in the symmetry group. Though its inclusion seems to be trivial, it is important also because even for the most asymmetric molecule, this symmetry is present. The corresponding symmetry element is the entire molecule itself. 
# '''Inversion, ''i '': '''This operation inverts the molecule about its center of inversion (if it has any). The center of inversion is the symmetry element in this case. There may or may not be an atom at this center. A molecule may or may not have a center of inversion. For example: the benzene molecule, a cube, and spheres do have a center of inversion, whereas a tetrahedron does not.
# '''Reflection σ: '''The&amp;nbsp;reflection&amp;nbsp;operation produces a mirror image geometry of the molecule about a certain plane. The&amp;nbsp;mirror plane&amp;nbsp;bisects the molecule and must include its center of geometry. The plane of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A symmetry plane&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;with the principal axis (defined below)  is dubbed&amp;nbsp;vertical&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it horizontal&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed&amp;nbsp;dihedral&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;).
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;''''': '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold rotation&amp;nbsp;operation about a&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of symmetry&amp;nbsp; produces molecular orientations indistinguishable from the initial for each rotation of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; (clockwise and counter-clockwise).It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The axis of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;is called the&amp;nbsp;'''principal axis''', and by convention is assigned the z-axis in a&amp;nbsp;Cartesian coordinate system.
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation-Reflection&amp;nbsp;or improper rotation ''S&lt;sub&gt;n &lt;/sub&gt;: '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold improper rotation operation about an&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of improper rotation is composed of two successive geometry transformations: first, a rotation through &lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;about the axis of that rotation, and second, reflection through a plane perpendicular (and through the molecular center of geometry) to that axis. This axis is the symmetry element in this case. It is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.
It is to be noted that all other symmetry present in a specific molecule are a combination of these 5 operations.

=== Schoenflies notation ===
{{Main|Schoenflies notation}}
The&amp;nbsp;'''Schoenflies'''&amp;nbsp;(or&amp;nbsp;'''Schönflies''')&amp;nbsp;'''notation''', named after the&amp;nbsp;German&amp;nbsp;mathematician&amp;nbsp;[[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe&amp;nbsp;point groups. This notation is used in&amp;nbsp;spectroscopy and is used here to specify a molecular point group.

== Point groups for diatomic molecules ==
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
There are two point groups for diatomic molecules: &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; for heteronuclear diatomics, and &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}
&lt;/math&gt; for homonuclear diatomics.
* &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:
The group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;, contains rotations &lt;math&gt;
C(\phi )
&lt;/math&gt; through any angle &lt;math&gt;
\phi 
&lt;/math&gt; about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; through the planes containing the inter-nuclear axis (or the vertical axis, that is reason of the subscript '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''v''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').In the group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; all planes of symmetry are equivalent, so that all reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; form a single class with a continuous series of elements; the axis of symmetry is bilateral, so that there is a continuous series of classes, each containing two elements &lt;math&gt;
C(\pm \phi )
&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this group is '''''Non-abelian''''' and there exists an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group. The character table of the group is as follows:

In addition to axial reflection symmetry, [[Homonuclear molecule|homonuclear diatomic molecules]] are symmetric with respect to inversion or reflection through any axis in the plane passing through the point of symmetry and perpendicular to the inter-nuclear axis.[[File:Inversion2.png|thumb|350x300px|Inversion symmetry in homonuclear diatomic molecules, giving rise to symmetry group &lt;math&gt;

{{D}_{\infty h}}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from those of the group &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt; using the relation between the two groups: &lt;math&gt;

== Complete set of commuting operators ==
{{Main|Complete set of commuting observables}}
Unlike a single atom, the Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule doesn't commute with &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. So the quantum number &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is no longer a [[good quantum number]]. The internuclear axis chooses a specific direction in space and the potential is no longer spherically symmetric. Instead, &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{J}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (taking the arbitrary internuclear axis as the ''Z'' axis). But &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{x}},{{L}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; do not commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; due to the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule is invariant under rotations about the internuclear line (the ''Z'' axis), but not under rotations about the ''X'' or ''Y'' axes. Again, &lt;math&gt;{{S}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{S}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; act on a different Hilbert space, so they commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in this case also. The electronic Hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule is also invariant under reflections in all planes containing the internuclear line. The (''X-Z'') plane is such a plane, and reflection of the coordinates of the electrons in this plane corresponds to the operation &lt;math&gt;{{y}_{i}}\to -{{y}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; is the operator that performs this reflection, then &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;. So the [[Complete set of commuting observables|Complete Set of Commuting Operators]] (CSCO) for a general [[Heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear diatomic molecule]] is &lt;math&gt;\{H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A\}&lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an operator that inverts only one of the two spatial co-ordinates (''x or y). ''

In the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule, there is an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provided by the internuclear axis, there is a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei (the symmetry discussed in this paragraph only depends on the two nuclear charges being the same. The two nuclei can therefore have different mass, that is they can be two isotopes of the same species such as the proton and the deuteron, or &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{16}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{18}}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on). Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an inversion of the coordinates of all electrons with respect to that origin, namely in the operation &lt;math&gt;{{\vec{r}}_{i}}\to -{{\vec{r}}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the parity operator &lt;math&gt;\Pi &lt;/math&gt;. Thus the CSCO for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is &lt;math&gt;\left\{ H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A,\text{ }\Pi  \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==&lt;nowiki/&gt;Molecular term symbol, Λ-doubling ==
{{main|Molecular term symbol}}
'''[[Molecular term symbol]]'''&amp;nbsp;is a shorthand expression of the&amp;nbsp;group representation&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;angular momenta&amp;nbsp;that characterize the state of a&amp;nbsp;molecule. It is the equivalent of the&amp;nbsp;[[term symbol]]&amp;nbsp;for the atomic case. We already know the CSCO of the most general diatomic molecule. So, the [[good quantum number]]s can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule. Here, the symmetry is explicitly stated in the nomenclature.

=== Angular momentum ===

Here, the system is not spherically symmetric. So, &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}^{2}}]\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the state cannot be depicted in terms of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; as an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt; anymore (in contrast to the atomic term symbol, where the states were written as &lt;math&gt;^{2S+1}{{L}_{J}}&lt;/math&gt;). But, as &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}_{z}}]= 0&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenvalues corresponding to &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; can still be used. If,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle ={{M}_{L}}\hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;{{M}_{L}}=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,.......... \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle =\pm \Lambda \hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;\Lambda =0,1,2,........... \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =\left| {{M}_{L}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value (in a.u.) of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis; &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a term symbol. By analogy with the spectroscopic notation S, P, D, F, ... used for atoms, it is customary to associate code letters with the values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; according to the correspondence:
[[File:term1.gif|center|300x300px]]

For the individual electrons, the notation and the correspondence used are:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\left| {{m}_{l}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and
[[File:term2.gif|center|300x300px]]

=== Axial symmetry ===

Again, &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;, and in addition: &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}{{L}_{z}}=-{{L}_{z}}{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; [as &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}=-i\hbar (x\frac{\partial }{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial }{\partial x})&lt;/math&gt;]. It follows immediately that if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; the action of the operator &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; on an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; converts this state into another one corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;-\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, and that both eigenstates have the same energy. The electronic terms such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the terms &lt;math&gt;\Pi ,\Delta ,\Phi ,................&lt;/math&gt;) are thus doubly degenerate, each value of the energy corresponding to two states which differ by the direction of the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the molecular axis. This twofold degeneracy is actually only approximate and it is possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motions leads to a splitting of the terms with &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; into two nearby levels, which is called &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;'''''-doubling'''''.&lt;ref name="Bransden"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states. These states are non-degenerate, so that the states of a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; term can only be multiplied by a constant in a reflection through a plane containing the molecular axis. When &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;, simultaneous eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed. Since &lt;math&gt;A_{y}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; have eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. So to completely specify &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states of diatomic molecules, &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; states, which  is left unchanged upon reflection in a plane containing the nuclei, needs to be distinguished from &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}&lt;/math&gt; states, for which it changes sign in performing that operation.

=== Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry ===

Homonuclear diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry at their midpoint. Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the electronic Hamiltonian is invariant under the point group operation '''''i''''' of inversion of the coordinates of all electrons at that origin. This operation is not the parity operation P (or E*); the parity operation involves the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass. Electronic states are either even, i.e. remain unchanged by the operation '''''i''''', or they are odd, i.e. changed in sign by '''''i'''''. The former are denoted by the subscript '''''g''''' and are called '''''gerade, '''''while the latter are denoted by the subscript '''''u''''' and are called '''''ungerade.''''' The subscripts '''''g''''' or '''''u''''' are therefore added to the term symbol, so that for homonuclear diatomic molecules we have &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }_{g}},{{\Sigma }_{u}},{{\Pi }_{g}},{{\Pi }_{u}},......&lt;/math&gt; electronic states. A homonuclear diatomic molecule has four non-degenerate &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; electronic states: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _{g}^{+},\Sigma _{g}^{-},\Sigma _{u}^{+},\Sigma _{u}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;. Vibronic states are classified according to the irreducible representations of the appropriate point group.

The complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic energy levels (usually called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label '''''+''''' or '''''-'''''. The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commutes with the operation
of permuting (or exchanging) the coordinates of the two (identical) nuclei and rotational levels 
gain the additional label '''''s''''' or '''''a''''' depending on whether the total wavefunction is
unchanged (symmetric) or changed in sign (antisymmetric) by the permutation operation. Thus, the rotational levels of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are labelled '''''+''''' or '''''-''''', whereas those of homonuclear diatomic
molecules are labelled '''''+s''''', '''''+a''''', '''''-s''''' or '''''-a'''''. The rovibronic nuclear spin states are classified using the appropriate permutation-inversion group.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}} Section 8.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (as for all centro-symmetric molecules)
does not commute with the point group inversion operation '''''i''''' because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states (called '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' mixing) and give
rise to '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' transitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pique | first = J.

=== [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] and [[total angular momentum]] ===

If '''''S '''''denotes the resultant of the individual electron spins, &lt;math&gt;s(s+1){{\hbar }^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of '''''S '''''and as in the case of atoms, each electronic term of the molecule is also characterised by the value of '''''S'''''. If spin-orbit coupling is neglected, there is a degeneracy of order &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; associated with each &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;. Just as for atoms, the quantity &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the multiplicity of the term and.is written as a (left) superscript, so that the term symbol is written as &lt;math&gt;{}^{2s+1}\Lambda &lt;/math&gt;. For example, the symbol &lt;math&gt;{}^{3}\Pi &lt;/math&gt;denotes a term such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =2
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=1
&lt;/math&gt;. It is worth noting that the ground state (often labelled by the symbol &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt;) of most diatomic molecules is such that &lt;math&gt;s=0
&lt;/math&gt; and exhibits maximum symmetry. Thus, in most cases it is a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt;, excited states are written with &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,...&lt;/math&gt; in front) for a heteronuclear molecule and a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt;) for a homonuclear molecule.

Spin–orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the ''z''-component of spin interacts with the ''z''-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. This is characterized by the quantum number &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}={{M}_{S}}+{{M}_{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;. Again, positive and negative values of &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt; are degenerate, so the pairs (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (−''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', −''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') are degenerate. These pairs are grouped together with the quantum number &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the sum of the pair of values (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') for which ''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is positive: &lt;math&gt;\Omega =\Lambda +{{M}_{S}}

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Molecular term symbol ===

So, the overall molecular term symbol for the most general diatomic molecule is given by:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{2S+1}\!\Lambda^{(+/-)}_{\Omega,(g/u)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* '''''S '''''is the total spin quantum number
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* '''''u'''''/'''''g''''' is the effect of the point group operation '''''i'''''
* '''''+/&amp;#x2212;''''' is the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis

{{main|Avoided crossing}}

=== Effect of symmetry on the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian ===
The electronic terms or potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{S}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of a diatomic molecule depend only on the internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, and it is important to investigate the behaviour of these potential curves as R varies.It is of considerable interest to examine the intersection of the curves representing the different terms.
[[File:wigner2014.png|thumb|258x258px|The non-crossing rule of von Neumann and Wigner. Two potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; cannot cross if the states 1 and 2 have the same point group symmetry]]
Let &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; two different electronic potential curves. If they intersect at some point, then the functions &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; will have neighbouring values near this point. To decide whether such an intersection can occur, it is convenient to put the problem as follows. Suppose at some internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;{{R}}_{{c}}
&lt;/math&gt; the values &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are close, but distinct (as shown in the figure). Then it is to be examined whether or &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; can be made to intersect by the modification &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}\to {{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt;. The energies &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}={{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}^{(0)}={{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{0}}=H({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and are assumed to be real.
The Hamiltonian now becomes &lt;math&gt;H\equiv H({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)={{H}_{0}}+H'
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H'=\frac{\partial {{H}_{0}}}{\partial {{R}_{C}}}\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; is the small perturbation operator (though it is a degenerate case, so ordinary method of perturbation won't work). setting &lt;math&gt;H_{ij}^{'}=\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|H'|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ;i,j=1,2
&lt;/math&gt;, it can be deduced that in order for &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; to be equal at the point &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; the following two conditions are required to be fulfilled:

! &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|As an initial zero-order approximation, instead of &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; themselves, linear combinations of them of the form &lt;math&gt;\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle ={{c}_{1}}\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, can be taken as the [[eigenstate]] of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are, in general, complex). Substituting this expression in the perturbed  [[Schroedinger's equation|Schrödinger'''&amp;nbsp;''' equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;({{H}_{0}}+H')\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle =E\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking inner product with the respective bra's:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{2}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{2}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to different [[eigenvalues]] and as &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; is itself Hermitian, They are [[orthonormal]]: &lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ={{\delta }_{ij}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E)+{{c}_{2}}H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}H_{21}^{'}+{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E)=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the operator &lt;math&gt;
H'
&lt;/math&gt; is Hermitian, the matrix elements &lt;math&gt;
H_{11}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
H_{22}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; are real, while &lt;math&gt;
H_{12}^{'}=H_{21}^{'*}
&lt;/math&gt;. The compatibility condition for these equations is (such that both &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are not simultaneously zero):

&lt;math&gt;
\left| \begin{matrix}
   E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E &amp; H_{12}^{'}  \\
   H_{21}^{'} &amp; E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E  \\
\end{matrix} \right|=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This gives: &lt;math&gt;
E=\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}^{(0)}+E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}+H_{22}^{'})\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}{{(E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'})}^{2}}+{{\left| H_{12}^{'} \right|}^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula gives the required eigenvalues of the energy in the first approximation.

If the energy values of the two terms become equal at the point &lt;math&gt;({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the terms intersect), this means that the two values of &lt;math&gt;E
&lt;/math&gt; given by formula, are the same. For this to happen, the expression under the radical must vanish. Since it is the sum of two squares, both are simultaneously zero. So, it gives the conditions:

&lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

'''''and '''''

&lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

However, we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; giving the perturbation &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the

two conditions involving more than one parameter cannot in general be simultaneously satisfied (the initial assumption that &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; real, implies that &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; is also real). So, two case can arise:&amp;nbsp;
# The matrix element &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically. It is then possible to satisfy the first condition independently. Therefore, it is possible for the crossing to occur if, for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;) the first equation is satisfied. As the perturbation operator &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;H
&lt;/math&gt;) commutes with the symmetry operators of the molecule, this case will happen if the two electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  have different point group symmetries (for example if they correspond to two electronic terms having different values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;, different electronic parities '''''g''''' and '''''u''''', different multiplicities, or for example are the two terms &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}
&lt;/math&gt; ) as it can be shown that, for a scalar quantity whose operator commutes with the angular momentum and inversion operators, only the matrix elements for transitions between states of the same angular momentum and parity are non-zero and the proof remains valid, in essentially the same form, for the general case of an arbitrary symmetry operator. &amp;nbsp;
# If  the electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; have the same point group symmetry, then &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; can be, and will in general be, non-zero. Except for accidental crossing which would occur if, by coincidence, the two equations were satisfied at the same value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, it is in general impossible to find a single value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a single value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;)  for which the two conditions are satisfied simultaneously. &amp;nbsp;
Thus, in a diatomic molecule, only terms of different symmetry can intersect, while the intersection of terms of like symmetry is forbidden. This is, in general, true for any case in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian contains some parameter and its eigenvalues are consequently functions of that parameter. This general rule is known as '''[[von Neumann]] - [[Wigner]] non-crossing rule. '''
{{#tag:ref| This follows from a more general rule of group theory.

This general symmetry principle has important consequences is molecular spectra.
In fact, in the applications of [[Valence bond theory|valence bond method]] in case of diatomic molecules, three main correspondence between the [[Atomic orbital|atomic]] and the [[molecular orbitals]] are taken care of:
# Molecular orbitals having a given value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (the component of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis) must connect with atomic orbitals having the same value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the same value of &lt;math&gt;\left| m \right|&lt;/math&gt;).
# The electronic parity of the wave function (''g'' or ''u'') must be preserved as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
# The von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule must be obeyed, so that energy curves corresponding to orbitals having the same symmetry do not cross as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule also acts as a starting point for valence bond theory.

== Observable consequences==
Symmetry in diatomic molecules manifests itself directly by influencing the molecular [[Spectral line|spectra]] of the molecule. The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are:

=== [[Rotational spectrum]] ===
In the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the [[electric dipole]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; along the molecular axis. This is the permanent electric dipole moment.
In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there is no pure rotation spectrum.
Heteronuclear diatomic molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra corresponding to rotational transitions, without change in the vibronic state. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules for a rotational transition are: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules become: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =0,\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;.This is due to the fact that although the photon absorbed or emitted carries one unit of angular momentum, the nuclear rotation can change, with no change in &lt;math&gt;\Im  &lt;/math&gt;, if the electronic angular momentum makes an equal and opposite change. Symmetry considerations require that the electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is directed along the internuclear line, and this leads to the additional selection rule &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;.The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infra-red or the microwave region, the frequencies of these lines given by:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }_{\Im +1,\Im }}={{E}_{r}}(\Im +1)-{{E}_{r}}(\Im )=2B(\Im +1) &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;B=\frac{{{\hbar }^{2}}}{2\mu R_{0}^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Im \ge \Lambda  &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;N.B.&lt;/u&gt;''' In exceptional circumstances the hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states of homonuclear diatomic molecules giving rise to pure rotational ('''''ortho''''' - '''''para''''') transitions in a homonuclear diatomic molecule.&lt;ref name=Critchley2001/&gt;

=== [[Vibrational spectrum]] ===
The transition matrix elements for pure vibrational transition are &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu 
 &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment of the diatomic molecule in the electronic state &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;. Because the dipole moment depends on the bond length &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt;, its variation with displacement of the nuclei from equilibrium can be expressed as: &lt;math&gt;\mu ={{\mu }_{0}}+{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}x+\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}{{x}^{2}}+....... &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{0}} &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment when the displacement is zero. The transition matrix elements are, therefore: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{\mu }_{0}}\left\langle v'|v \right\rangle +{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +.......={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +....... &lt;/math&gt;using orthogonality of the states. So, the transition matrix is non-zero only if the molecular dipole moment varies with displacement, for otherwise the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; would be zero. The gross selection rule for the vibrational transitions of diatomic molecules is then: ''To show a vibrational spectrum, a diatomic molecule must have a dipole moment that varies with extension. So, ''homonuclear diatomic molecules do not undergo electric-dipole vibrational transitions. So, a homonuclear diatomic molecule doesn't show purely vibrational spectra.

For small displacements, the electric dipole moment of a molecule can be expected to vary linearly with the extension of the bond. This would be the case for a heteronuclear molecule in which the partial charges on the two atoms were independent of the internuclear distance. In such cases (known as harmonic approximation), the quadratic and higher terms in the expansion can be ignored and &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. Now, the matrix elements can be expressed in position basis in terms of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions: Hermite polynomials. Using the property of Hermite polynomials: &lt;math&gt;2(\alpha x){{H}_{v}}(\alpha x)=2v{{H}_{v-1}}(\alpha x)+{{H}_{v+1}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, it is evident that &lt;math&gt;x\left| v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;x{{H}_{v}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, produces two terms, one proportional to &lt;math&gt;\left| v+1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; and the other to &lt;math&gt;\left| v-1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. So, the only non-zero contributions to &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}} &lt;/math&gt; comes from &lt;math&gt;v'=v\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;. So, the selection rule for heteronuclear diatomic molecules is: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Homonuclear diatomic molecules show no pure vibrational spectral lines, and the vibrational spectral lines of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are governed by the above-mentioned selection rule.

=== [[Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy|Rovibrational spectrum]] ===
{{main|Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy}}
Homonuclear diatomic molecules show neither pure vibrational nor pure rotational spectra. However, as the absorption of a [[photon]] requires the molecule to take up one unit of [[angular momentum]], vibrational transitions are accompanied by a change in rotational state, which is subject to the same selection rules as for the pure rotational spectrum. For a molecule in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, the transitions between two vibration-rotation (or ''rovibrational'') levels &lt;math&gt;(v,\Im )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v',\Im' )&lt;/math&gt;, with vibrational quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v' = v + 1&lt;/math&gt;, fall into two sets according to whether &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt;. The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''R branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{R}}=E(v+1,\Im +1)-E(v,\Im )=2B(\Im +1)+\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =0,1,2,......&lt;/math&gt;

The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''P branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by:  &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{P}}=E(v+1,\Im -1)-E(v,\Im )=-2B\Im +\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =1,2,3,......&lt;/math&gt;

Both branches make up what is called a ''rotational-vibrational band or a rovibrational band''. These bands are in the [[infra-red]] part of the spectrum.

If the molecule is not in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, so that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, transitions with &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =0&lt;/math&gt; are allowed. This gives rise to a further branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum, called the '''''Q branch'''''. The frequencies &lt;math&gt;{{\omega }^{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the lines in this branch are given by a quadratic function of &lt;math&gt;\Im 
&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unequal, and reduce to the single frequency: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{Q}}=E(v+1,\Im )-E(v,\Im )=\hbar {{\omega }_{0}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}={{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, this selection rule has two consequences:  
# Both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers must change. The Q-branch is therefore forbidden.
# The energy change of rotation can be either subtracted from or added to the energy change of vibration, giving the P- and R- branches of the spectrum, respectively.
Homonuclear diatomic molecules also show this kind of spectra. The selection rules, however, are a bit different.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Both homo- and hetero-nuclear diatomic molecules show rovibrational spectra. A Q-branch is absent in the spectra of heteronuclear diatomic molecules.

== A special example: Hydrogen molecule ion  ==
{{Main|Dihydrogen cation}}An explicit implication of symmetry on the molecular structure can be shown in case of the simplest bi-nuclear system: a hydrogen molecule ion or a di-hydrogen cation, &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. A natural trial wave function for the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by first considering the lowest-energy state of the system when the two protons are widely separated. Then there are clearly two possible states: the electron is attached either to one of the protons, forming a hydrogen atom in the [[ground state]], or the electron is attached to the other proton, again in the ground state of a hydrogen atom (as depicted in the picture). 
[[File:Two possible initial states of the system.png|thumb|484x484px|Two possible initial states of the system]]
The trial states in the position basis (or the '[[wave functions]]') are then:

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{1} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}-\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{2} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}+\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The analysis of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; using variational method starts assuming these forms. Again, this is only one possible combination of states. There can be other combination of states also, for example, the electron is in an excited state of the hydrogen atom. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system is:

&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, using the states &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; as basis will introduce off-diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian. Here, because of the relative simplicity of the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ion, the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix elements]] can actually be calculated. The electronic Hamiltonian of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the  point group inversion symmetry operation '''''i'''''. Using its symmetry properties, we can relate the [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal]] and off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian as:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| The diagonal terms:
&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}} &lt;/math&gt;is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom.

Again,&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{22}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{22}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}={{H}_{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last step follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}={{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}&lt;/math&gt; and from the symmetry of the system, the value of the integrals are same.

Now the off-diagonal terms:

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{12}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

by inserting a complete set of states &lt;math&gt;\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|&lt;/math&gt; in the last term. &lt;math&gt;\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle =\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is called the 'overlap integral'

And,

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{21}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{21}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 2\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|1 \right\rangle ={{H}_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; (as the wave functions are real)

So, &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;, the linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; that [[Diagonalized|diagonalizes]] the Hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pm 2\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }}(\left| 1 \right\rangle \pm \left| 2 \right\rangle )&lt;/math&gt; (after normalization). Now as &lt;math&gt;[H,&lt;/math&gt;'''''i'''''&lt;math&gt;]=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;, the states &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are also eigenstates of '''''i'''''. It turns out that &lt;math&gt;\left| +  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| -  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenstates of '''''i''''' with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in other words, the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|+ \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|- \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are gerade (symmetric) and ungerade (unsymmetric), respectively). The corresponding expectation value of the energies are &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{\pm }}=\frac{1}{1\pm \left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }({{H}_{11}}\pm {{H}_{12}})&lt;/math&gt;. [[File:H2plus figure 2.png|center|thumb|600x484px|The energy vs separation graphs of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. The two lowest curves denote the &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{-}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; states respectively. Higher ones are the excited states. The minimum of &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an energy &lt;math&gt;-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;]]

From the graph, we see that only &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum corresponding to a separation of 1.3 &amp;Aring; and a total energy &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}=-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;, which is less than the initial energy of the system, &lt;math&gt;-13.6 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, only the gerade state stabilizes the ion with a [[binding energy]] of &lt;math&gt;1.8 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the ground state of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{{X}^{2}}\Sigma _{g}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and this state &lt;math&gt;\left( \left| +  \right\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a bonding molecular orbital.&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{Cite book

Thus, symmetry plays an explicit role in the formation of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Municipal de caracas.jpg|thumb|Teatro Municipal of Caracas]]
The '''Teatro Municipal''' of Caracas is an opera house in Venezuela. It was inaugurated by President [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco|Guzmán Blanco]] in 1881.
It was begun by a French architect and finished by a Venezuelan architect [[Jesús Muñoz Tébar]].

It is one of the oldest opera houses in South America and continues to mount operatic productions.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eluniversal.com/arte-y-entretenimiento/cultura/150505/operas-y-zarzuelas-regresan-al-teatro-municipal | title=Operas y zarzuelas | work=[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]] | date=2015 | accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is no longer the city's main opera house since
the [[Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex]] opened in the 1980s. The Teatro Municipal is the home of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra of Caracas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30397">'''Territory bands''' were dance bands that crisscrossed specific regions of the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Schuller 770-805"/&gt;  Beginning in the 1920s, the bands typically had 8 to 12 musicians.  These bands typically played one-nighters, 6 or 7 nights a week at venues like [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] halls, [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]]s, [[Lions Club]]s, hotel ballrooms, and the like.  [[Francis Davis]], jazz critic for [[The Village Voice]], likened territory bands to "the [[Top 40]] [[cover bands]] (of the 1970s and 1980s) of their day, typically relying on stock arrangements of other ensembles' hits."  He said, "many historians give much credit to territory bands for popularizing modern [[ballroom dancing]] that began during the [[World War I]] era with the influence of [[Vernon Castle|Vernon and Irene Castle]]."&lt;ref name="Village Voice 2006"/&gt;

Territory bands helped disseminate popular music &amp;mdash; which included swing, jazz, sweet dance music, or any combination thereof &amp;mdash; bringing it to remote gin mills and dance halls that were otherwise ignored by national booking agents representing genuine recording stars like [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]] and [[Louie Armstrong|Armstrong]]. Many developed original repertoires and signature sounds, none more storied than [[Walter Page]]'s [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]], the Oklahoma City-based outfit that [[Count Basie]] joined in 1926.&lt;ref name="Village Voice 2006"/&gt;

== Ethnicities of the bands ==
There were black bands and white bands, and bands of various immigrant ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Greene 1992"/&gt; There were also all-female bands, such as the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

Musician, composer, and scholar [[Gunther Schuller]] asserted in one of his books, ''The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930–1945 (The History of Jazz, Vol. 2)'' that, "territory bands, by definition, were black.  There were, of course, many white bands in the 'territories' but they tended to have the more lucrative and permanent jobs and therefore not required to travel as much as the black bands."&lt;ref name="Schuller 770-805" /&gt; Another musician (former territory band musician and historian), [[Jack Behrens]], expressed in a book that Schuller's depiction of divergent work conditions was narrow.  "During my playing days in the 1940s and 50s in several white territory bands, we didn't have "lucrative and permanent jobs" unless you count day labor in a dairy bar or clerking at a military surplus store.  Worse, there were times we didn't get paid at all and we had little recourse given the cost of legal advice."&lt;ref name="Behrens"/&gt;

For most territory bands &amp;mdash; whether black, white, integrated, male, female &amp;mdash; the musicians were nearly always paid. Neither the booking agencies nor the musicians got rich, but regular salaries helped maintain pretty decent musicianship.&lt;ref name="Dirk Fischer"/&gt;

Most musicians witnessed and experienced a wide variety of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices, from city to city and region to region.  One common present-day misconception is that Jim Crow practices were more prevalent in the South.  The practices were prevalent everywhere, especially in New York City&lt;ref name="Fronc"/&gt; and the Midwest.  The bands that were racially integrated commonly experienced problems, mostly from having to dodge different applications and degrees of Jim Crow among cities and regions.  Many bands, especially The [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]], handled some of the absurdities with a degree of inward, sarcastic humor.  When musicians grew wary or even felt vulnerable to injustices of Jim Crow, the band bus, for those who had one, served as a safe haven.

==History==
The published history of territory bands is thin.  Most of what we know comes from fading memories and second-hand anecdotes.  With a lack of discography and the passing of a generation, our knowledge is slipping. While many territory bands were of high quality, they rarely recorded and were often unfairly considered minor league to the national touring bands.  Moreover, they were confined to specific regions or states … even parts of a state.&lt;ref name="Behrens" /&gt;  Ambitious and hopeful young musicians saw territory bands as a training ground for, or rite of passage to, the major big bands.  The alumni of territory band musicians who matriculated to fame within the industry reads like list of "who's who" in music.

Territory bands typically played more sweet music, though, some in the mid 1950s, particularly those with talented musicians, managed to entertain dancers with a jazzier sound.  But dancing audiences are what kept the bands employed.  In the 1920s, territory bands commonly traveled by car ([[station wagon]]), followed by an equipment truck for the [[PA system]], [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[drum kit]].  Later, beginning in the mid-1930s, territory bands commonly traveled in sleeper trailers.

== Established territories ==
Home territories were loosely defined, but some classifications emerged. Generally, the areas were defined as Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest and Northwest. In addition, some state-groupings became common.

; MINK
MINK was a particularly distinguished state group. It was composed of [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]].

; VSA 
VSA was composed of [[Virginia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="TB DB"/&gt;

; Southwest
The [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] proved especially fertile for territory bands.  [[Texas]], with its spread-out geography and relatively large population, offered the greatest opportunity with developed markets for dance music in [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[Houston, TX|Houston]], [[San Antonio]], [[Austin, TX|Austin]], [[Amarillo]], and other cities.  The homegrown audiences of Texas bands were so plentiful that the bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences.&lt;ref name="Gioia"/&gt;  One such band was that of [[Alphonso Trent]].

; West Coast
Bands out of Los Angeles and Seattle performed not only in California, Oregon, and Washington, but also Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.  The Glenn Henry Orchestra, which got its first big break playing summers at Yellowstone Park from 1935 to 1940, became a popular West Coast territory band.

; Military circuits
There were military territories, too — [[Non-commissioned officer#United States|NCO]] Clubs, Officers' Clubs.  These clubs took bands to [[Greenland]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Bermuda]], [[Puerto Rico]], as well as the US.

==Styles==
The musicians in the territory dance bands were primarily jazz musicians. Despite the overwhelming view that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of jazz, the itinerant musicians were the ones who first disseminated it.

The dancing public could actually dance and they knew which bands swung and which simply just played well.  Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to the black bands in the Midwest. The East Coast black bands were popular in the 1920s; but "Swing" came to that region in the form of [[Louis Armstrong]] joining the [[Fletcher Henderson]] band when he went to the [[New York City|Big Apple]].

Territory bands were not all swing bands. The Midwest settlements of Europeans of various ethnicities brought their community dancing and revelry with them in the form of very popular polka bands (and also old time [[waltzes]], leandlers, and [[schottische]]s).&lt;ref name="Greene 1992"/&gt;  They played at all the ballrooms, Elk Clubs, and the like as well.  Here's a short exemplary list:

:[http://www.internationalpolka.com/fritsche.htm Fezz Fritsche] &amp; His Goose-town Band
:The [[Six Fat Dutchmen]]
:The Babe Wagner Band (Babe later played jazz trombone with the [[Gene Krupa|Krupa]] band)
:[http://www.whoopeejohn.com/ Whoopie John] &amp;mdash; a very successful and famous polka band from Minneapolis

==Pre 1920s==
There were traveling bands well before the 1920s &amp; 30s.  One of many examples were musicians who did their booking from [[Redfield, South Dakota]]. Redfield was a railroad hub in the [[Northern Plains]]. All their booking was up and down the rail line.

==1920s &amp;mdash; swing and ballroom dancing==
In 1924, according to [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], there were more than 900 dance bands, representing steady work for 7,200 musicians.  There were 68 [[Paul Whiteman|Whiteman]] orchestras across the country, playing music from the Whiteman library, eleven in New York alone.  In the mid-20s, bands typically had ten musicians: two [[alto saxophone|altos]], one [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] (who often doubled on other [[woodwinds]] and sometimes [[violin]]), two [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]], [[banjo]] or [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[string bass]] or [[tuba|brass bass]], and drums.  Sometimes there were two trombones.  If the band had only two saxophones, they would be alto and tenor.

==1933 &amp;mdash; Great Depression==
The [[Great Depression]], which hit bottom in 1933, was hard on territory bands.  The public strained to afford entertainment.  It was not uncommon for bands to be stranded for lack of funds.  Many broke up during this period.

==1940s &amp;mdash; decline ==
There are many theories on why swing music and territory bands declined.  Here are a few:
#Unions restricted the fees of booking agents and managers.
#Unions required visiting bands to pay local musicians for displaced work (in small towns, unions were nonexistent; but in large cities, unions often looked askance upon territory bands).
#Popularity of small combos
#Commercial Radio (introduced in 1922), better-quality gramophone discs, and TV (giving greater access to entertainment in the home and access to different types of music).  Changing technology (radio, TV, mobility, amplified music) shocked the music industry in a similar way that the [[internet]] has shocked the recording industry today.
#In the 1950s, most ballrooms in smaller towns of the Midwest closed because people could drive to the city for everything.
#Record companies discovered &amp;mdash; during the AFM recording bans of 1942-43 and 1948 — that they could profit from record sales, churning out [[Hit Parade]] music with just singers, who were exempt from the recording bans.  This marked a period when singers became more popular than bandleaders.  The introduction and technological advancement of amplification and gramophone recording led to the development of [[crooning]], an intimate vocal style perfected by singers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and, later, [[Frank Sinatra]].  The record companies gained control over what got recorded; therefore music that was slated for a new market of teenagers was born.  This destroyed several booking agencies. [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], who broke up as many bands as it booked, moved to [[Hollywood]]. Frederic Bros. ([[Chicago]]) had a fallout with several of its bands.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1948"/&gt;  The Vic Schroeder Agency (Omaha), was one of the more responsible bookers before [[World War II]] but, little is known after &amp;mdash; same with the White Agency.&lt;ref name="Dirk Fischer"/&gt;
#Amplification also led to the introduction of the [[electric guitar]], which enabled a very small band to project adequately in large-room settings.  Bear in mind that, in the 1920s, an unamplified orchestra had to be large enough and play loud enough to entertain a dance hall of 3,000. Prior to the recording bans, the industry was bent on capturing the intent of composers as interpreted by musicians.  Before the ban, gramophone consumers were primarily interested in authenticity of symphonies and famous orchestras (dance bands).  Vocals, with no microphones, were only an incidental part of an arrangement. Vocals &amp;mdash; like Bing Crosby's with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in the studio — could not be replicated live, on stage.  [[Rudy Vallée]] used a cheerleader's [[megaphone]]. Amplification and the record industry helped spur technical improvements, at the expense of performing musicians.

==All-girl territory bands==
In the history of traveling dance bands, all female bands are often excluded, or only given minor inclusion. Popular culture seemed to regard the musical performances dance bands provided as an area meant to be dominated by men. In the scenarios where women were allowed to join in, they were often denoted as separate. This is seen in the way many female singers were nicknamed “canaries,” denoting them not as musicians, but as pretty objects meant to be on display.  One example that shows just how foreign women could be considered appears in the name of a band [[Mary Lou Williams]] headed that was called "Six Men and a Girl."&lt;ref name="Antoinette"/&gt; Oftentimes these stereotypes surrounding performing women extended to instrumentalists.

All female performers were not a new idea in the dawn of traveling jazz bands though. All women groups performing American genres of music dates back to minstrel groups like Madame Rentz’s Female Minstrels. Because women could not easily enter prestigious music bands that were essentially all male, all women groups continuously popped up as groups that allowed skilled female musicians to perform. Sometimes they were put together with help from outside sources. It was not uncommon for a group to be put together by a man or a talent agency, but to consist of all female performers. Sometimes performers received aide from family or friends involved in the business to help get their foot in the door. For instance, [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] had an all woman dance band in the early 1930s.  This group went by such names as "Lil Armstrong and Her Swing Band."&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt;  Other bands popular in the 1930s include [[The Harlem Playgirls]], The Dixie Sweethearts, the [[Darlings of Rhythm]], and Gertrude Long and Her Rambling Night Hawks.&lt;ref name="Antoinette"/&gt;

Even banding together with other women though, public perception would sometimes view all female bands as “all-girl gimmicks.” Some talented musicians avoided joining all female bands in the fear that their talent would be disregarded in such a context.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt;  Yet all female bands were also forced into the feminine appearances they were also demeaned for. In many ways, this made being in a traveling dance band more difficult for women than it had been for men. After a night spent traveling women were expected to be visions of beauty with perfect make up, hair, and personalities. Often the ultra feminine clothes they had to wear, such as strapless dress and high heels, also affected their ability to play and perform. As had been shown in previous attempts women had made to broach men’s groups, attempting to break away from this dainty female image could call the sexuality and morality of a performer into question. Yet women’s performances were also often debased to their visual looks and sexual attractiveness, even though many reviewers criticized them for these elements.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

A certain need to prove themselves seemed to exist among many of the female musicians who worked in dance bands. These performers inherited a lot of the stereotypes that surrounded their previous female performer counterparts: chorus line girls and girl singers. The sexual objectification of women that haunted those two careers was also a part of being in an all female band. Furthermore, chorus line girls had an association with loose morals and even prostitution, and loss of face for an instrumentalist could mean the end of a career.  These kinds of associations also made many people assume that female instrumentalists were not talented players. Upon interviewing later in life, many women insisted that they were talented musicians who knew how to play. This insistence seems to be in direct reaction to the claims that circulated that female musicians were not meant to play well but simply to look pretty. While it’s true that many agencies required photos in their applications to join female bands, the musicians in them still tended to be quite talented.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

While many people view the end of the Swing era as the opening of World War II, this was not the case for all woman dance bands. Instead, they flourished during the 1940s. Swing music became a form of patriotism to a country at war. The all-girl bands that did the best at this time tended to be groups formed before American involvement in the war. Once it was realized that women could fill a major hole in the entertainment industry and that they could not be drafted, agencies and managers everywhere began trying to put together all female bands. In many ways, these musicians were very prepared to take over for the men because they had more advanced experience in playing instruments, either from hobbies or school bands. They were certainly more prepared for musical performance than many women were prepared for welding and factory work. Some groups connected to academic organizations, such as the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]] or the [[Prairie View Co-eds]] did very well at this time. These groups of industrious young women could come to represent an image of what the United States was at war for. Some of these groups even did USO tours. Soldiers shipped off to foreign lands, under the pressure war and deprived of any female presence were more than welcoming to these all woman groups. The armed audiences were known to have shown extreme appreciation for these female performers&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;  [[V-discs]], recorded for broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network, often featured all-girl groups.

==Plot==

Two sorcerers, Finn and Shernomore, have an intense magical duel in favor of saving Finn's wife, Meena. Finn gains the upperhand at first, but is defeated by Shernomore who deceives him by stepping on a "force field", and losing all of his powers and youthfullness, which then transfers to Shernomore and transforms Meena into a stone statue in exchange for her power of love as a source of his magic.

In the present day, Ruslan, a wandering artist dreaming to become a knight, is having a small play which he plays the role of Finn and Shernomore, and is written by an eccentric and an aspiring playwright, Lester. In the castle lived a adventurous and kind princess named Meelah. She considers the castle as a hindrance for his father and the King, is forcing her to get married despite she doesn't love whoever he suggests. One night, she sneaks out and she was almost harrased by two men, until Ruslan arrives. He saves Meelah from the two and escape. When the two are alone, Ruslan, afraid of being  judged by his status, disguises himself as a knight.

The next day, they share romantic moments as they develop their feelings for each other. Unfortunately, much to Ruslan's surprise and horror, Meelah was kidnapped via a tornado by Shernomore, He tries to pursue Meelah, but fails to do so and knocks himself unconscious. When he gained consciousness, he is confronted by the King, who mistakenly accuses him of harming the princess. He tries to tell the truth, but none of them belived him. Realizing Shernomore is real, he consults Lester and they set off to the cave where a wise cat lives. 

The two asks for help on where to find Meelah and reveals to them a magic vortex where they discover a magical place and gives them a pea pod as a "gift". When they reached the cliff, a hamster suddenly steals the pod and they pursue it. But they realized that they are supposed to give it to him and unlocks a dinosaur-like bridge.

Meanwhile, at Shernomore's castle, Meelah awakens at a bed and she tries to escape using a hat that makes the user invisible. Despite Shernomore casting a spell that makes all of the desserts there alive, she manages to defeat these and discovers the other ladies who are victims of Shernomore's evil sorcery.

When the two arrive at the cave, they meet a strange old man who holds a staff similar to a wizard, and asks help on where to find Finn. However, the old man reveals himself to be Finn. But due to him having no contact on the outside world for too long, he is too paranoid to communicate with. With the help of Ruslan's plan, they pretend to be "wizards" who are casting a "spell" to lure him down. Finn, beliving that his powers are restored, tries to stop them. Ruslan and the gang pretend to be dead, only for them to contain Finn. When they got him, Ruslan asks where to find Shernomore and how to stop him, Finn tells them that his castle is made of spiky rocks and the source of his power is in his beard, asking him to cut it off, but no one was able to do that. And he tells Ruslan that he needs a magic sword in order to do that. After asking for the directions on where to find the sword, they locate and it is guarded by a giant knight. The giant challenges Ruslan in exchange for the armor and sword, but Ruslan manages to defeat all of them and they went to Shernomore's castle. 

When they got to the castle, they splitted to find Meelah. Ruslan finds Meelah in a different outfit and appearance and tells him that she does not need to rescue her, for she is happy at this place. This breaks Ruslan's heart. Feeling down, he slowly leaves the place. Suddenly, a giant monster attacks them.  Lester tries to convince Ruslan to fight, but he's too lonely to do so. The bird gets Meelah's pendant and makes Ruslan realize that he is being deceived by Shernomore and gains courage to fight the monster. 

After defeating the monster, they went to the place where Meelah is kept and  he and Shernomore engages at a n intense duel. Ruslan is defeated at first, but manages to incapacitate Shernomore by cutting his beard, losing his powers and transforms the stone staues and Finn back to normal. Ruslan tries to escape with Meelah, but they are trapped in the force field the same way as Finn did before. Ruslan sacrifices himself by pushing Meelah out of the trap, leaving him incapacitated. Meelah tries to pull Ruslan out, but is interrupted by the three nights, resulting in Ruslan's soul being zapped from him and leaving him lifeless. Enraged, Meelah fights the three knights and defeats them all (including Shernomore who is tied up). 

Meelah mourns for the apparent death of Ruslan and says that she loves him so much. A now-rejuvenated Finn appears and brings back Ruslan to life. The two reunite including Lester and Finn and Meena reunites as well. Ruslan confesses that he is not a real knight, but Meelah accepts this, and tells she still loves him no matter what. Finn conjures up a fireworks display, and they lived happily ever after.

During the credits, Ruslan and Meelah shows being married and living a happy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/story|title=History|work=The Stolen Princess|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==

The film is co-financed by Ukrainian State Film Agency: its share is 19.5 million UAH (total production cost of the film is 95.2 million UAH).

==Production==

On January 30, 2013 producer Egor Olesov informed about the development of [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]] project based on a [[fairy tale]] poem with the same title by Aleksandr Pushkin. In September 2013, press service of FILM.UA Group announced the start of film production, and later the protagonists and synopsis for [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]] were presented with the film itself announced as 2D animation; later, however, the concept changed, and a decision was made to create a 3D animated film.  

Hollywood consultants helped with developing the characters. According to the authors of the film, [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]] was made in English and then dubbed in Ukrainian. As Olesov says, Hollywood celebrities will be involved in English dubbing, and in [[Ukraine]], popular local actors will lend their voices to the film. For the international market, the film was given another title, ''The Stolen Princess''.

In December 2015, the script and characters’ stories were finalized; animation of approved scenes was completed.

==Release==

=== International Distribution===

''The Stolen Princess'' became the first project in the line of theatrically animated premieres from Animagrad, which also includes Mavka. The Forest Song (2018), Snow Republic (2019), and Roksolana and Suleiman (2021). According to the company director, Animagrad plans to release one animated feature per year, both for local Ukrainian and international distribution.

In February 2015 at the European film market during [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the rights to film distribution were sold to [[Israel]] and [[South Korea]]; in May 2016 at Marché du Film of [[Cannes International Film Festival]], to France, French-speaking territories, [[Bulgaria]], [[Iran]], and [[Poland]]. On December 10, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter informed that the film after its presentation a month before at the American film market was sold to China, (Germany), [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], North Africa, and the Middle East. It was also announced that sales to some other territories were pending.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afm-stolen-princess-sells-china-954618|title=AFM: Ukranian Animated Film 'The Stolen Princess' Sells to China|author=Nick Holdsworth|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13–16, 2017 in Hong Kong, FILMART took place, which is an annual film and TV content market. The FILM.UA Group stand presented projects of Animagrad studio, including ''The Stolen Princess''. On the penultimate day of the market, the scenes from the animated film were screened in Asia for the first time; the invitation to the premiere appeared on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter, and the screening itself was successful and gathered positive feedback from market participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/20-in-asia-the-first-screening-of-the-stolen-princess-takes-place|title=In Asia, The First Screening of The Stolen Princess Takes Place|accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April, Cannes hosted MIPTV (Marché International des Programmes de Télévision), a major European market of audiovisual content. The stand of Ukrainian delegation presented, among others, ''The Stolen Princess'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/21-filmua-group-presented-the-stolen-princess-animation-project-at-miptv-in-cannes|title=FILM.UA Group Presented The Stolen Princess Animation Project at MIPTV in Cannes|language=|work=The Stolen Princess|publisher=Official site of the project|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19 and 23, 2017 the biggest film market Marche du Film under the aegis of the 70th [[Cannes International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/25-ukrainian-animation-features-in-cannes-the-stolen-princess-and-mavka-the-forest-song-at-marche-du-film|title=Ukrainian Animation Features in Cannes: The Stolen Princess and Mavka.

Immediately after Ukrainian release, the theatrical release took place in [[Romania]] (March 16) and Turkey (March 23). During the first Romanian weekend, Ukrainian animated feature film collected $165,066 in the box office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/54-in-the-first-weekend-of-international-release-the-stolen-princess-collects-an-impressive-box-office-in-romania|title=In the First Weekend of International Release, The Stolen Princess Collects an Impressive Box Office in Romania|publisher=The official site of the film "The Stolen Princess"|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed second after American blockbuster [[Lara Croft]]: [[Tomb Raider]] (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). It is interesting to compare the film with the main animated releases of 2017–2018 from Hollywood majors such as [[Disney Pixar]], [[DreamWorks Animation]], and [[Blue Sky Studios]], which also took place in Romania: the box office of Ukrainian Princess during the first weekend exceeded those of [[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]], [[Ferdinand the Bull]], and Baby Boss, ceding only to the third movie of Cars franchise. The premiere box office of the Ukrainian film places it third among animated releases in Turkey in 2018.

As of April 13, ''The Stolen Princess'' is now shown in the cinemas of [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Egypt]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]] and [[Bahrain]]. In total, the rights to the animated film screening have been sold to more than 50 countries, including France, Germany, countries of the Middle East, Southern Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/65-ukradena-princeza-and-otkradnatata-printsesa-ukrainian-cartoon-just-released-in-croatia-bosnia-and-hertzegovina-and-bulgaria|title="Ukradena princeza" and "Откраднатата принцеса": Ukrainian animated feature film just released in Croatia, Bosnia and Hertzegovina, and Bulgaria|publisher=The official site of the film "The Stolen Princess"|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018 Ukrainian media reported that the film had been shown in more than 40 countries with more than half a million viewers.&lt;ref name="234385princess"/&gt; In January 2019 the film will become the first Ukrainian film to be commercially released to cinemas in China.&lt;ref name="234385princess"&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://life.pravda.com.ua/culture/2018/11/29/234385/ "The kidnapped princess" will become the first Ukrainian film to be shown in cinemas of China], [[Ukrayinska Pravda|''Life'']] (29 November 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

The film got mixed reviews. The audience noted the lack of Ukrainian flavor and blind copying of Hollywood standards, inappropriate references to current realia, and lack of charisma among certain characters. However, the reviewers have also praised high animation standards, clever jokes, and the animated feature film appealing to topics of interest to both adults and children.&lt;ref name = "ufd"/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Timeline of fictional stories about the ''Mona Lisa''}}

&lt;!--- Don't mess with this line! ---&gt;&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

Here below is a '''[[chronology]]''' of [[fiction]]al and [[Fiction#Semi-fiction|semi-fictional]] stories (including films, episodes in TV series, as well as literary works)  that revolve, either wholly or partially, around the famous ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', a portrait of [[Lisa del Giocondo]] painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] during the [[Renaissance]] in [[Florence]]. The years listed on the left refer to the year of release of these works of fiction.

== 1970s ==
*1975 - ''[[The Second Mrs. Giaconda]]'', a novel by [[E. L. Konigsburg]] exploring how the portrait came to be painted.
*1979 - The episode "[[City of Death]]", from the long running TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', centres around a scheme of stealing the ''Mona Lisa'' from the [[Louvre]]. The ''Mona Lisa'' featured again several times in subsequent ''Doctor Who'' stories that were released from year 2001 onwards.

== 1980s ==
*1985 - The adaptation of Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Final Problem]]'' in the television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' by [[Granada Television]], also centres around a scheme involving the theft of the ''Mona Lisa'' from the Louvre. The scheme, however, is the creation of the screenwriters who dramatised the episode for TV, and is not in actual fact part of the original Conan Doyle story written in 1893.

== 2000s ==
* 2003 - ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', a novel by [[Dan Brown]]. The ''Mona Lisa'' is an integral part of the plot, and this is underlined by the fact that the ''Mona Lisa'' itself has been used to grace the cover of this best-selling novel.
* 2006 - ''[[I, Mona Lisa]]'', a historical novel by [[Jeanne Kalogridis]] about Lisa del Giocondo
* 2008 - ''[[The Smile (book)|The Smile]]'', a historical novel by [[Donna Jo Napoli]] about Lisa del Giocondo

==Village area==
The Village of the Arts is a residential and business community contained between 14th Street West, Route 41/9th Street West and 16th Avenue West in Bradenton, Florida, approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of Tampa and 14 miles north of Sarasota. This area of Bradenton originally consisted of 1920's style architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villageofthearts.com/about.php|title=About Village of the Arts|work=VillageOfTheArts.com|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From May 31, 1937 until  the site was home to the [[Bradenton General Hospital]].

==Live-work space==
The Village is a diverse collection of artists, galleries and fine food. Artisians from the Village of the Arts received regulatory relief from the city of [[Bradenton]] allowing [[artist-in-residence]]s to live and work out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://villageofthearts.com/UserFiles/File/Village%20History%20and%20Info(1).pdf|title=Village of the Arts History and Info|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, the houses in this area of [[Bradenton]] were considered dilapidated and an eyesore. Most have been restored, painted in colorful [[hue]]s and [[pastels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AtlK1ddfPk|title=House Tour in the Village|work=YouTube|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into workshops, studios, medical facilities, family activities, galleries and cafes.

==Artistic Media==
Village Artists practice their craft in the following areas:

[[Goldsmith]]ing, [[Silversmith]]ing, [[stained glass]], [[altered books]], [[copper]]-pigment work, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[collage]], [[oil-painting]], [[quilting]], [[acrylic paint]]ing, [[fiber art]], [[mixed media]], [[encaustic painting]], fashion and custom clothing, [[antiques]] and their restoration, [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], book-selling, [[basket-weaving]], [[re-cycled]] and up-cycled art, botanical objects, [[mosaic]], [[clay]], [[pottery]], [[music]] instruction and performance, [[art]] instruction, [[watercolors]], [[dichroic glass]], [[woodcarving]], jewelery, cut and polished stone work, [[Metalworking|metal working]] and many more.

Many artisans accept [[Commission (art)|commissions]], i.e., work as ordered and designed by a patron/customer. Patrons are then able to become involved in the production of a piece that meets the needs of a specific space in their home or office.
