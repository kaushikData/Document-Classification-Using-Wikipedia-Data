The '''A657''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] that begins in [[Bramley, West Yorkshire|Bramley]] and ends in [[Saltaire]] near [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]]. The road is approximately {{Convert|8|mi|km}} long.

The road starts from the Bramley Town End ([[A647 road|Stanningley By-Pass]] junction) and ends at the junction with the [[A650 road|A650]] at [[Saltaire]].

==History==

Much of the A657 was originally the Shipley and Bramley Turnpike, with [[toll gate]]s at Windhill Bar, Greengates Bar and Rodley Lane Bar.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''A78''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[Scotland]].  It connects [[Greenock]] and [[Prestwick]] on a route which follows the northern section of the [[Ayrshire]] coast.

==Route==

The A78 begins in [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire]] as a continuation of the [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8 road]] at the Bull Ring roundabout, and runs in a southerly direction through the [[Spango Valley]], [[Inverkip]], [[Wemyss Bay]], [[Largs]], [[Seamill]] and then bypasses the major towns of [[Ardrossan]], [[Irvine, Ayrshire|Irvine]] and [[Troon]] amongst others before terminating near Prestwick, [[Ayrshire]], where it forms a junction with the [[A77 road|A77]].

==Infrastructure==

Much of the road is single carriageway - both for a short distance through Greenock and a 21-mile stretch between Inverkip and Ardrossan. 

The rest is [[dual carriageway]] - between the Eglinton and Warrix interchanges there are in fact 3 lanes in each direction, and the road is constructed to motorway  standard (with full [[grade separation]] at junctions) save for a lack of hard shoulders. The road very rarely appears busy on this stretch - the adjacent [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] development area of [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]] (which includes [[Kilwinning]], [[Dreghorn]] and [[Girdle Toll]]) had a population of just over 50,000 in the 2001 census;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&amp;mainArea=Irvine&amp;mainLevel=Locality http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&amp;mainArea=Irvine&amp;mainLevel=Locality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212847/http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&amp;mainArea=Irvine&amp;mainLevel=Locality |date=27 September 2007 }} ''scrol.gov.uk'' &lt;/ref&gt; the town planners designed the infrastructure for a population more in the region of 120,000.

==Recent improvements==

Until December 2004, the route of the A78 went through the "three towns" - namely [[Ardrossan]], [[Saltcoats]] and [[Stevenston]]. The result was a highly congested section with numerous traffic lights making progress slow. To counter this a bypass was constructed with two additional entrance/exit points other than the ends in the form of [[roundabouts]]. 

The section at the Ardrossan end is a single carriageway road with a [[climbing lane]]. The other two sections are dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction.

The existence of the bypass meant that the section through the towns previously labelled A78 became a continuation of the A738 which previously formed a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with the A78 through Stevenston before diverging to form Boglemart Street and subsequently many other streets in Saltcoats and Ardrossan. Many sources available today still don't acknowledge these changes, for example "[http://maps.google.co.uk/ Google Maps]".

The new road can easily take 10 minutes off any journey which would otherwise involve travelling through the three towns and as a result has proven very popular amongst people who make such journeys - for example people from Largs and [[West Kilbride]] to the north who now have swifter access to the shopping facilities of Irvine and Ayr and the [[Morrisons]] supermarket at [[Stevenston]], as well as any football fans who may be travelling to watch [[Kilmarnock FC]].

==Flooding==

Flooding is common during periods of high winds combined with a high tide on the coastal stretch between [[Largs]] and [[Skelmorlie]]. For this reason, closure gates are located at both the north end of Largs and the south end of Skelmorlie. 

When the road is closed traffic between Largs and [[Greenock]] is often diverted along narrow country lanes with little room to pass any oncoming traffic. This has been known to cause widespread delays.

The '''alcohol belts of Europe''' are regions in [[Europe]] which are considered to be divided by association with either [[beer]], [[wine]], or [[distilled beverage|spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Grigg|title=Wine, Spirits and Beer: World Patterns of Consumption|journal=Geography|jstor=40573955|volume=89|issue=2|pages=99-110|year=2004|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alcohol belts refer to the traditional beverages of countries rather than what is most commonly drunk by the populace today, as in terms of drinking habits beer has become the most popular alcoholic drink in the whole world, including various parts of the wine and vodka belts.

==Vodka belt==
Being an informal term, the "vodka belt" has no established definition. However, the general definition tends to include the following states as significant producers and consumers of [[vodka]]:
*Most of the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Iceland]])&lt;ref name=stubb&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|last=Stubb|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Stubb|url=http://www.alexstubb.com/artikkelit/bw_vodka.pdf|title=The European Vodka Wars|publisher=[[Blue Wings (magazine)|Blue Wings]]|date=December 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215005220/http://www.alexstubb.com/artikkelit/bw_vodka.pdf|archivedate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Poland]]&lt;ref name="Krakow Beverages"&gt;[http://www.krakow-info.com/drinks.htm "Krakow Beverages"] at krakow-info.com&lt;/ref&gt; (also part of the beer belt)
*[[Belarus]]
*[[Ukraine]]
*[[Slovakia]]

The EU countries of the vodka belt produce over 70% of the EU's vodka.&lt;ref name=stubb/&gt;

The southern boundary of the "vodka belt" roughly corresponds to the −2&amp;nbsp;°C January [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]. With the exception of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], and some regions of southern Russia, cultivation of [[grape]]s is impossible or very difficult in the vodka belt.

Sometimes the term "vodka belt" is used while referring exclusively to the [[Slavs|Slavic countries]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], as they are the historical homeland of vodka (Poland and Russia being the nations most often associated with the invention of the drink). Before the 19th century, vodka was considered very much a "people's drink" that was common among the [[peasantry]] who made up the majority of the population in most countries of the time, while the political and aristocratic minority preferred imported wines or other alcoholic beverages that were considered less plebeian.&lt;ref name="Krakow Beverages"/&gt; There are exceptions, such as [[Żubrówka]], a type of Polish vodka that dates back to the 16th century, which became popular among the [[szlachta]] (nobility) as well as the peasantry as early as the 18th century.

In his book about the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=jonge&gt;[[Alex de Jonge]], "Stalin and the Shaping of the Soviet Union", Collins, (1986), {{ISBN|0-688-04730-0}}, ''[http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/vcta/VCTA_May06.pdf the relevant excerpt online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151043/http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/vcta/VCTA_May06.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Alex de Jonge elaborates on his concept of "geoalcoholics". In particular, he explains Russian peculiarities by their belonging to the vodka belt and the absence of the beer belt in the Soviet Union. Other than the prevalent hard liquor the vodka belt is also characterised by a higher occurrence of [[binge drinking]] compared to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/publications/alcoholalert/alert199701/al199701_p20.html "Alcohol Alert Digest"], [[Institute of Alcohol Studies]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in his ''Russia and the Russians'', historian Geoffrey Hoskins notes the distinct effect vodka culture has had on the countries of the former [[Russian Empire]], creating drinking as a social problem on a different level from other European countries.&lt;ref name="Hosking2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey A.|authorlink=Geoffrey Hosking|title=Russia and the Russians: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh-5AAmboMUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=28 October 2017|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00473-3|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries historically belonging to the vodka belt, vodka has been supplanted by beer as the alcoholic drink of choice since the early 21st century. Residents of Finland and Sweden consume twice as much beer as vodka (in terms of pure alcohol).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/1998/monitoring/fp_monitoring_1998_frep_01_a_en.pdf "Alcohol in Postwar Europe: A Discussion of Indicators on Consumption and Alcohol-Related Harm"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] (which won 16 seats in the [[Sejm]] in 1991) was founded on the notion of fighting alcoholism by a cultural abandonment of vodka for beer. And indeed in 1998, beer surpassed vodka as the most popular alcoholic drink in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpau.media.pl/volume7/issue2/economics/art-06.html|title=EJPAU 2004.

The term has received much attention since 2006 in the context of the "[[vodka war]]"&lt;ref name=vodkawar&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/063-2627-030-01-05-911-20070131STO02626-2007-30-01-2007/default_en.htm Vodka war: "MEPs serve up a compromise cocktail"], a [[Europarliament]] news article&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Union]] about the standardisation of vodka: the vodka belt countries insist that only spirits produced from grains and potato must be allowed to be branded as "vodka", according to the long established traditions of its production, a brand protection similar to the "[[protected designation of origin]]".&lt;ref name=stubb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flexnews.com/pages/5412/European_Union/Spirits/eu_farm_chief_warns_legal_action_vodka_row.html|title=EU Farm Chief Warns of Legal Action in Vodka Row|website=Flexnews.com|agency=Reuters|date=25 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310191503/http://www.flexnews.com/pages/5412/European_Union/Spirits/eu_farm_chief_warns_legal_action_vodka_row.html|archivedate=10 March 2007}}, a 25 October 2006 [[Reuters]] article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/23/news/vodka.php "A spirited war: The search for the real vodka"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 23 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The "Schnellhardt compromise", proposed by [[Horst Schnellhardt]], suggests that vodkas from other than cereals, potatoes and molasses, should be labeled to say "Vodka produced from".&lt;ref name=vodkawar/&gt;

==Beer belt==
The "beer belt" is the territory covered by countries in Europe where [[beer]] is historically the most popular alcoholic beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Leon de Stadler|editor2=Christoph Eyrich|title=Issues in cognitive linguistics: 1993 proceedings of the International Cognitive Linguistics Conference |last=Geeraerts |first=Dirk |chapter=Beer and semantics |year=1999 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=3-11-015219-3 |page=35 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHXyiIbucW4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Beer+belt%22+%2B%22wine+belt%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer belt is located to the southwest of the [[vodka belt]] and to the northeast of the [[wine belt]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6767193.stm|title= Euro MPs spurn 'pure vodka' bid|work= BBC News|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6766023.stm|title=Brussels braced for vodka battle|work= BBC News |accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geography of the beer belt is closely tied to the historical growing range of its two main ingredients: [[barley]], and more especially [[hops]]. Barley was first domesticated during the [[late stone age]] in the [[ancient near east]], has been brewed into beer-like beverages for thousands of years, and has been grown in most of Europe since ancient times. Hops are more narrowly distributed, preferring [[humid temperate climates]], similar to [[potatoes]]. Originally, European "ale" (not yet called beer) was produced without hops, which were introduced to Europe from the east.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The first evidence of hops in Europe dates from 736, in the [[Hallertau]] region of present-day [[Germany]], although the first  mention of the use of hops ''in brewing'' in that country was not until 1079.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward spread of hops was slow, not reaching England until 1524.  Ireland was still importing hops in the eighteenth century; more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015011436469;view=1up;seq=368 The London magazine, 1752]", page 332&lt;/ref&gt; In 1516, the ''[[Reinheitsgebot]]'' or "Bavarian Beer Purity Law" established that barley, hops, and water were the only allowable ingredients in beer (yeast, while necessary for beer production, was unknown at the time). This became the template for beers across Europe. While non-barley beers (e.g., [[wheat beer]]), and non hopped-beers (e.g., flavoured with [[gruit]]) are still produced, across most of Europe "beer" is synonymous with barley and hops. Since the northern range of hops does not include most of Scandinavia or Russia (or much of Scotland), these areas, for the most part, are outside of the beer belt and lie in the vodka/whisky belt (see "vodka belt" above).

Beer has also been promoted by authorities in many spirit-loving countries as a means of [[social control]]. Beer is less intoxicating per volume than spirits. The [[Gin Craze]] in eighteenth century Britain led to a campaign to promote beer as an alternative. The famous prints [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751) by [[William Hogarth]], helped to lobby for what became [[Gin Act 1751|the "Gin Act" of 1751]] which taxed and regulated gin. During the 18th century the Parliament of Ireland used taxation to encourage brewing at the expense of distilling, reasoning that beer was less harmful than whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/stream/irelandindustri01coyngoog#page/n578/mode/2up Ireland Industrial and Agricultural]", 1902, page 455&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012}} the beer belt includes [[Belgium]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]],  [[Germany]], some parts of [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Central Federal District]] of [[Russia]], the northern and eastern (German-speaking) cantons of [[Switzerland]] and the [[France|French]] regions of [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] and the départment  of [[Ardennes]].&lt;ref name="Belgium, country of beer!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bierebel.com/en/index.php?page=paysdelabiere|title=Erreur 404|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is quite a bit of overlap in these French regions, as well as in southwestern Germany and parts of Austria, due to the considerable consumption and cultivation of wine there, and Poland is also a part of the vodka belt.

Overseas, countries settled by peoples from the European beer belt also may have beer as the dominant drink, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].

==Wine belt==
The "wine belt" is the territory covered by countries in Europe where [[wine]] is historically the most popular alcoholic beverage. The wine belt is located to the south of the [[beer belt]] and the [[vodka belt]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9334906|title=Charlemagne: In vino veritas|date=14 June 2007|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2006/09/go_north_young_grapes.html|title=Global warming and vineyards|first=Joel|last=Waldfogel|date=22 September 2006|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wine belt has been variously defined as approximately between 41° - 44°N,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.canadianvintners.com/woc/ontario.html |title=Wines of Canada |access-date=15 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705175629/http://www.canadianvintners.com/woc/ontario.html |archive-date=5 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 30° - 50°N,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.barlowschoice.com/terroir.html |title=Introduction To NZ Wines |access-date=15 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406061839/http://barlowschoice.com/terroir.html |archive-date=6 April 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 35° - 50/51°N.&lt;ref name="Philp1867"&gt;{{cite book|last=Philp|first=Robert Kemp|authorlink=Robert Kemp Philp|title=A Journey of Discovery All Around Our House: Or, The Interview : a Companion Volume to "Enquire Within Upon Everything."|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_ZOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=28 October 2017|year=1867|publisher=Houlston &amp; Wright|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries in the wine belt include [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Albania]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], most of [[Austria]], [[San Marino]], [[Switzerland]], [[Romania]], [[France]], and [[Southern Federal District]] of [[Russia]]. [[Hungary]] and [[Slovenia]] are considered as part of the wine belt, but they overlap largely and are in line more with the Beer Belt instead. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Additionally, Southwest England (if one classes [[cider]] as a wine analogue), parts of the Low Countries, southwestern [[Germany]] and parts of [[Austria]] could be considered to lie either within the belt or within an overlap region.&lt;ref name="Belgium, country of beer!"/&gt;

Overseas, countries settled by immigrants from the European wine belt also may have wine as the dominant drink, such as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. Wine is also important in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]], which while settled by European beer-belt peoples, also have warmer Mediterranean climates better suited for wine production.

The '''Brouwer Route''' was a 17th-century route that was discovered and used by ships sailing from the African [[Cape of Good Hope]] to the [[Dutch East Indies]] base of [[Java]], as the eastern leg of the [[Cape Route]]. The route took ships south from the Cape (which is at [[34th parallel south|34° latitude south]]) into the [[Roaring Forties]] (at 40-50° latitude south), then east across the [[Indian Ocean]], before turning northeast for Java.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam Island is at S37.8267°/E77.5547° and St. Paul Island is at S38.7300°/E77.5222°; Java lies at S7.4917°/E110.0044°.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it took advantage of the strong westerly winds for which the Roaring Forties are named, greatly increasing travel speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/southland/Trade-Seynbrief.html ''The Seynbrief, Sailing Toward Destiny''], National Library of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with the route, however, was that there was no accurate way at the time to determine longitude.&lt;ref name="dsitw"/&gt; The sighting of either [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]] or [[Île Saint-Paul|Saint Paul Island]] was the cue for ships to change direction and head north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unfortunate Dutchman|last=De Witt|first=Dennis|year=2013|publisher=Nutmeg Publishing|isbn=1301681180|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qX1CAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was reliant on the captain's expertise.

The route was devised by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] sea explorer [[Hendrik Brouwer]] in 1611, and found to halve the duration of the journey from Europe to Java, compared to the previous Arab and Portuguese [[Winds in the Age of Sail#Europeans_Eastbound|monsoon route]], which involved following the coast of [[East Africa]] northwards, sailing through the [[Mozambique Channel]] and then across the [[Indian Ocean]], sometimes via [[India]]. By 1616 the Brouwer Route was compulsory for sailors of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).&lt;ref name="dsitw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Ships in Tropical Waters: The Development of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) Shipping Network in Asia 1595-1660|last=Parthesius|first=Robert|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9053565175|page=114|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=n8Hn4yAfztUC|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[British East India Company]], Captain Humphrey Fitzherbert on ''Royal Exchange'' trialled the route in 1620, which they called the '''Southern route''', and initially thought it a great success, but the second English ship to use the route, ''[[Tryall]]'', incorrectly judged the [[longitude]], sailed too far east before turning north, and was wrecked on [[Tryal Rocks]] off the [[Pilbara]] coast of [[Australia]] in May 1622. The English then avoided the route for the next two decades.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ida Lee |first=Ida |last=Lee |title=The First Sighting of Australia by the English |journal=[[The Geographical Journal]] |publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]] |date=April 1934 |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0609031h.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brouwer Route played a major role in the [[History of Western Australia|discovery of the west coast of Australia]]. [[Shipwrecks of Western Australia|Many ships were wrecked along that coast]], including ''[[Tryall]]'' (1622), ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' (1629), ''[[Vergulde Draeck]]'' (1656), ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' (1712) and ''[[Zeewijk]]'' (1727). In 1696, [[Willem de Vlamingh]] explored the Australian coast while looking for survivors of the ''[[Ridderschap van Holland (1682)|Ridderschap van Holland]]'', which disappeared in 1694 with 300 crew and two passengers.

'''Château de la Motte''' is a [[château|chateau]] located in the commune of [[Joué-du-Plain]] ([[Orne]]) in [[Normandy]], France. The chateau began as a Viking [[Motte-and-bailey castle]] and evolved into the 18th and 19th century Château seen today. The two most noted families who owned the site were the Gabriel Montgommerys and the Nicolas Angos, but its role as Resistance center in [[World War II]] may be its most notable episode.

Long established [[Normans|Norman]] chateaus, like Château de la Motte, usually originate from [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s constructed during the earliest Norman period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The bourgeois Ango family built much of Château de la Motte in the late 16th and early 18th century. They bought the original chateau from one of the most noted names in Normandy: the descendants of [[Gabriel de Montgomery|Gabriel de Montgomery I]] (''Montgommery''). In 1559, Montgomery had accidentally killed King [[Henry II of France]] in a joust.

Château de la Motte sits at the end of a long [[chestnut]] [[Tree Avenue or tree alley (allée)|tree alley]] or [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] linking to the commune of [[Joué-du-Plain]] and the village of [[Écouché]]. The ''château's'' former farm, with an arched entry and [[coat-of-arms]] may have been the original chateau built in the 1660s. Today's chateau and a number of buildings have dates from the early 1820s, after restorations from the Deschamps family following the [[French Revolution]].

In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the chateau operated as a dairy and holiday home for Paris prostitutes. However, at the same time it functioned as headquarters for the [[French Resistance|Resistance]]. Escaping Allied pilots and an important arms depot were hidden here. The discovery of the depot by the Germans caused the assassination of the local mayor, and an unresolved crime, the subject of two criminal investigations and one book.

==Name, water sources and first historic mention==
[[File:Motte.png|thumb|19th-century rendition of a motte-and-bailey castle]]
Château de la Motte takes its name from the small-forested rise next to the current house, called a motte ("clod of earth" in Old French). The small mound is the remains of a [[Viking]]/Norman [[motte-and-bailey castle]] (''motte castrale, motte féodale'' in Old French). Mottes were made throughout France and Europe from the 10th century until the early 13th century, with many sites carrying the title of La Motte, Les Mottes, Forêt de la Motte, or Château de la Motte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepelley|first=René|title=Noms de lieux de Normandie|year=1999|publisher=Bonneton|location=Paris|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site and water sources===
Mottes often sat on [[Roman villa]] sites because water sources and strategic location needs were the same in both eras. Although numerous villa ruins were found nearby with the recent [[A88 autoroute]] construction, it is unknown whether this site was occupied before the Vikings, absent [[archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Clairfontaine|first=François Fichet|title=ArchéOrne: 250 ans d'archéologié|year=2008|publisher=Cahiers du Temp|location=Cabourg|isbn=978-2-911855-99-3|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The Château's site, including [[orchard]] and farm, has seven sources of water. Like most chateaus and mottes, this was likely the main consideration for the location. Wells and water management were important from earlier times as most drinking sources were contaminated, and sufficient water for animals was critical, even in rain-soaked Normandy. Water pollution was a known source of sickness from antiquity onward, although poorly understood.&lt;ref name=sirot/&gt;{{rp|74, 90}}

In the 15th century, when chateaus lost their defensive function, moats fulfilled prestige and aesthetic roles as well as providing fishponds, an important source of protein for peasants.&lt;ref name=sirot/&gt;{{rp|76}}

===First historic mention===
The first mention of Château de la Motte is a letter from Guillame Lesor in 1217, asking to be a vassal of the French King. This letter followed the loss by [[King John of England]] (1199–1216) at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, forcing an English withdrawal from 
Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rousseau|first=Xavier|title=Joue-du-Plain|journal=Le Pays d'Argentan|date= December 1958|volume=4|series=Dictionnaire du Pays d'Argentan.|issue=110|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The first motte and bailey forts were built to defend Viking/Norman power in Normandy, as the lords of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] in the south, and [[Brittany (French region)|Brittany]], to the west, occasionally intruded in force. The river [[Orne (river)|Orne]] was the southernmost Norman boundary for much of the 10th century, and was defended by a series of mottes, usually in groups.&lt;ref name=prier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delacampagne|first=Florence|title=Seigneurs, fiefs et mottes du Cotentin|journal=Archéologié Médiévale|year=1982|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prier|first=Annie|title=Sur les Chemins de l'Orne Romane|year=2001|publisher=Europe Media Duplication|location=Lassay les Chateaux|isbn=2-9516406-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

Motte and bailey castles usually had two main parts, both surrounded by wet or dry moats, then a wooden [[palisade]]. First constructed was the motte, or earthmound topped by a wooden tower. The tower was a last defense in an attack, and sometimes the lord's residence. The bailey contained barns, barracks, blacksmithy, chapel and other support structures. A removable wooden bridge linked the tower to the courtyard and a single fortified gate welcomed the visitor crossing the moat.

The motte may have been similar to one excavated nearby at Land de Goult, near [[Carrouges]]. Archeologists uncovered a lower court {{convert|50|–|80|m|yds|sp=us}} across. The motte was {{convert|40|–|60|m|ft}} across at the base, with a flattened top for the tower {{convert|10|–|20|m|ft}} high and {{convert|15|–|20|m|ft}} wide at the top.&lt;ref name=prier/&gt;{{rp|29}}

After [[William the Conqueror]]'s death, his sons revived motte making in the area to consolidate power from nearby [[Château de Falaise|Château of Falaise]] and [[Argentan]]. Lords continued building motte and bailey castles in the region throughout the ongoing feudal anarchy, until the mid 12th century. Thus, Château de la Motte may have originated close the letter's date of 1217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neveux|first=François|title=The Normans|year=2006|publisher=Running Press Book Publishers|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7624-3371-1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower and circle walls===
In the 11th century a large stone tower (fr.''grosses tour, grande tour'', or ''tour maîtresse'') was sometimes built over a water source, and the support buildings lined inside were attached to its circular wall. Stone for these structures would have been [[fieldstone]] and not cut; however, much of the structures may have been wood, or [[wattle and dab]], not stone. Like mottes, most exterior wooden walls would have been coated in plaster to reduce fire worries, and making them resemble stone buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panouillé|first=Jean-Pierre|title=Les Châteaux forts en France|year=2011|publisher=Ouest-France|location=Rennes|isbn=978-2-7373-5291-1|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortified farm===
Château de la Motte, like most small chateaus, was most probably little more than a farm, possibly fortified during the [[Middle Ages]]. The king, or the [[duke of Normandy]], had to give permission for building fortifications; [[tower]]s, [[moats]], and [[crenellation]]s required licenses. Instead, rural architecture evolved a defensive function with buildings in compounds, built around a courtyard with water. The exterior walls had few windows, with an easy-to-defend entrance.&lt;ref name=sirot&gt;{{cite book|last=Sirot|first=Elisabeth|title=Noble et Forte Maison|year=2007|publisher=A&amp;J Picard|location=Paris}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Careful orientation toward the south, like most country architecture in France, was moderated on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]], in order to block the storms from the southwest. Today's gatehouse or dependence protects the château from the weather as well. The walls surrounding the grounds created [[microclimates]], as well as defense, as intended. The rooftops deflect the winds upward, away from the residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Letenoux|first=Guy|title=Architecture et vie traditionelle en Normandie|year=1980|publisher=Berger-Levrault|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7013-0394-9|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald|first=Elsie Burch|title=A la Découverte des Fermes de France|year=1995|publisher=Abbeville|location=Paris|isbn=2-87946-060-3|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The lord's dwelling would have been a modest structure from the 11th to 16th centuries, even if the home were referred to as a [[Great Hall]] (''la grande salle''). The home would have at least two levels with storage on the ground floor and a large public room (''l'aula'') on the first floor, which was the actual great hall. This hall would have been a judicial, political, and economic center for the community, or [[parish]] (now ''[[commune]]''), and located near the entrance to the Château grounds. A lord's private chamber (''la camera'') would have been at one end, with true privacy only in the large curtained bed. The chapel (''la capella'') was typically near, or in, the home, but no site is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chueder|first=Lucile|title=Les Châteaux Fortes|year=2005|publisher=Editions Atlas|location=Évreux|isbn=2-7312-3212-9|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
During the Middle Ages, a lord's family usually moved between their various lands and residences, leaving the maintenance and farm production to a permanent staff. It was sort of a mandatory, perpetual picnic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=R.Allen|title=The Normans and the Norman Conquest|year=1969|publisher=Constable &amp; Co.|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-456260-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noble household consisted of an extended family including many illegitimate half brothers and sisters, along with descendants from previous mixed offspring. A mother's status determined the roles in the family, with many positions as administrators and servants. Strategic marriages with other families were sought to defend the family's power and prestige, but a lord's daughter by other than his wife could marry a high servant. Sons were expected to leave the family for service in other lords’ homes.&lt;ref name=kf&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedden|first=Katherine|title=Manor Life in Old France; From the Journal of Sire de Gouberville|year=1933|publisher=Columbia Un.Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–29}}

A modest château had between 10 and 20 servants: farm and household staff such as shepherds, ditchers, cow herders, milkmaids, and cooks. Most pay was in-kind, such as food and clothes.&lt;ref name=kf/&gt;{{rp|14–21}}

Regardless of the construction, probably no comfortable home existed at Château de la Motte until the 17th century. [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] visited the region in 1579, and stayed in an inn five kilometers away in Écouché, because there was no place suitable for him nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Caix|first=Alfred|title=Histoire du bourg d'Écouché|year=1989|publisher=Res Universis|location=Paris|isbn=2-87760-116-1|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the inspiration of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], ''châteaux de chasse'' (hunting chateaus/lodges) became popular as country retreats, with the hunt as the theme. These chateaus featured grand architecture, beautiful gardens, select majestic and exotic trees, greenhouses ''([[orangeries]])'' for luxuriant smells and spices, and grand entrances. A Google Earth view of the Château reveals an ancient hedge-line, or tree alley, leading from the current Château's gates to the Forest of la Motte (''bois de la motte'').

The existing majestic [[lime tree]]s (''tilleul'') near the house and ponds may have been originals or descendants of those planted by previous lords as limes gave prestige and the grandeur of shade. Traditionally they were often planted in the courtyards center as symbols of high justice.&lt;ref name=sirot/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==Lords, owners and major events==
Norman nobility originated as loyal friends and family of William the Conqueror. In turn, their knights and retainers became the petite nobility (''petite noblesse''), usually barons, which filled out the need for local authority and management. Early Château la Motte lords probably were among these nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=R.Allen|title=The Normans and the Norman Conquest|year=1969|publisher=Constable|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-456260-8|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The known owners are taken from the original charter, which existed at the time of the writing of the book, ''Histoire du bourg d'Écouché'' By Alfred Caix in 1867.

* 1217 - domain of Guillaume Lesor, first known use of the Château's name in a letter requesting vassalage to King Phillipe Auguste of France, after the English King [[John Lackland]] (1199–1216) lost the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214 and withdrew from Normandy.
* 1357 – Nearby Argentan burned and pillaged by the English during the [[Hundred Years' War]].
* 1417 - September 21 letter from Fralin de la Motte asking for the protection of the French king. This was probably the result of [[King Henry V]]'s second invasion of Normandy in July 1417, and the fall of nearby Caen on September 8. The region remained under English control until 1449. Note: in [[Old French]], ''Fralin'' is a term meaning a farmer of a large parcel of land.
* 1553 – Catherine Lelievre left Château de la Motte to her daughter Françoise, who married Balthazar de Villers and they had a daughter Louise.
* 1554, 1586 and 1588 – [[The Black Death]] and several [[Protestant]] armies ravaged the region during the [[Wars of Religion]].
* 1570 – Louise Balthazar marries Jean de Bouquetot du Breuil-sur-Touque (1541–1611) They had a daughter Suzanne de Bouquetot.
* 1589 – Argentan supported the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic "Ligue"]], but the bourgeois opened the city gates to [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] of France, a moderate and occasional Protestant.
* 1593 - Suzanne married Gabriel de Montgommery II (1565–1637) in [[Caen]]. Montgommery was Lord of Lorges and [[Courteilles]] ([[Eure]]), and with the wedding he became the Baron of Écouché. Gabriel II, like his more famous father, had been a commander of [[Huguenot]](Protestant) armies operating throughout Normandy. His primary family chateau was at [[Ducey]], near [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. A treaty in 1576 forgave Montgommery, and he stopped all military activity before his marriage.
* 1638 – The second Black Death struck down half the population of Argentan.
* 1641 – Jaques de Montgommery, son of Gabriel III, inherited Château de la Motte.
* 1654 – Catherine Cochon, from Château d'Almeneches, and the widow of Nicolas Ango, bought Château de la Motte from Jaques de Montgommery.
* 1655 – Jean (or Jacques), one of the seven Ango children married Marie Le Fèver de Lézeau and bought four partial fiefs in Joué-du-Plain. The Château was then called La Motte – Lézeau, the name found on the [[French cartography#Cassini maps|Cassini Map]].
* 1700s - Golden Age of Argentan. The town boasted 66 noble families and 3 royal lace manufacturers.
* 1790 [[The French Revolution]] – Population stagnated at 6000 people and no industry. Only 40 noble families remained. Normandy took neither side strongly during the upheaval.
* 1791, April 15 - Jean-Baptiste IV Ango sold the domains to Louis-Omer-Félicité Marquis d'Estampes for 620,000 francs. In 1793, d'Estampes was on the list of lords who left the country to escape the Revolution and the [[Reign of Terror]] (1789–1793).
* 1819 – Louis-Charles-David Deschamps (1802–1865) bought Château de la Motte and his family resided there. His daughter married Eugene Gabriel de Champrepus (1828–1892). Their son Andre inherited the Château, never married and died at the start of World War II.
* 1939 - Honaré Noel, owner of a ''café clos'', or house of prostitution, in Paris bought the Château from Andre Champrepus's nephew. The château was used as country holiday home for Noel's employees, the farm was rented out to a local animal dealer, the buildings were rented to a Paris suburb for a school, and the dependences were leased to a dairy, which became the center for the Resistance in the area. The Château was also the distribution center for food and gas coupons both during and after the War, until 1950. Germans occupied the Château‘s farm in the final months before the Liberation in August 1944.
[[File:Sherman tank.png|thumb|left|Free French troops used a Sherman tank in street combat in Écouché]]
* 1944 June 6 – August 14– Bombing and street combat destroyed 15% of Écouché and 85% of Argentan.

===Gabriel de Montgommery II===
The most famous owner of the Château de la Motte was Gabriel de Montgommery II, who acquired the Château by marriage. [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery|His father]], of the same name, was the commander of the [[Scottish Guard]]; he accidentally killed King [[Henry II of France]] in a jousting tournament.
  
The tragedy occurred during a [[joust]] celebrating the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] treaty with the [[Habsburgs]], which ended the [[Italian War of 1551-1559]], and a marriage of the king's daughter. Gabriel de Montgommery I (1530–1574) killed the King Henry II of France when Montgommery's splintered lance sheared through the King's helmet visor and thrust into his face.
 
The King took 10 days to die, and although Montgommery was pardoned twice from the King's deathbed, he fled the country.

The young King's death shook Europe, and made the reputation of the prognosticator [[Nostradamus]], whose recent words seemed to foretell the event.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:CI, Q 35 The young lion shall overcome the older one,
:on the field of combat in single battle.
:He shall pierce his eyes in a golden cage,
:Two forces one, then he shall die a cruel death."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The top sentence was actually added much later, but the last two lines attracted the popular attention.

Montgommery converted to Protestantism in England. Ironically, his job as commander of the [[Scottish Guard]] in France was to search out [[Huguenots]] (French Protestants), as well as protect the King's life. He returned to France to lead numerous military campaigns in the [[Wars of Religion]] for the Protestants. His son, Gabriel de Montgommery II, and eventual owner of Chateau de la Motte, also became a Protestant commander, before and after his father's capture at a siege at [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]] and subsequent beheading.

Gabriel de Montgommery I, became a romantic figure linked to a book attributed to [[Alexander Dumas]]'', [[The Two Dianas]]''; a French movie; and the Tour Montgommery at Paris’ [[Conciergerie]], where Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] was imprisoned before being guillotined.
 
The son, Gabriel II was forgiven in the treaty of 1576, before his marriage to Suzanne de Bouquetot in 1593, daughter of the Baron of Écouché. He thus became the Lord of Château de la Motte.

The Montgommerys probably did not build at La Motte, but visited the area often, and possibly had a home in Écouché, which still exists.

===Nicolas Ango===
A year after Nicolas Ango's death (1654) his widow bought Chateau de la Motte and began building the farmhouse. Numerous other properties in Joué-du-Plain were also purchased, such as the nearby 16th-century manor Haut Mesnil, in order to fulfill the requirements of the acquiring the title of [[Marquis]]. Nicolas couldn’t attain the title himself, it went to his son, Jean-Baptist after the requisite amount of land was purchased. The title stayed with whoever owned the land afterward.

These titles were referred to as ''Lords of the Robe'', as opposed to the old aristocracy, like Montgommery, who were called ''Lords of the Sword'', who often had titles dating back to William the Conqueror.

Nicolas Ango was a wealthy [[bourgeois]], and a Counselor to the King. The family had already built the private mansion ''hotel particulier'', across from St. Germain Church in Argentan.

Purchase of the title [[marquisat]] brought income to the depleted royal treasury of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], but Jean-Baptist Ango earned the King's favor by buying and closing the Huguenot temple property in Joué-du-Plain. Louis XIV had begun the unpopular process of enforcing the law of making every Christian become a Catholic. Ango's action saved the King an unpleasant job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Caix|first=Alfred|title=Histoire du bourg d'Écouché|year=1989|publisher=Res Universis|location=Paris|isbn=2-87760-116-1|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Baptist Ango married Marie LeFevre of Lezeau, daughter of Nicolas Le Fevre, advisor to the Parliament of Rouen. On the 18th century Casini map, Marquis de la Motte- Ango was the Chateau's title.

The Ango source of wealth was unclear; he may have been a lawyer. Many new-rich rose rapidly as merchants, financiers, lawyers, and doctors during the Hundred Years' War and Wars of Religion, because many male aristocrats had died. Louis XIV chose his most trusted servants from among the rising bourgeois and small nobles; two examples were Vauban for fortifications and Colbert for finances.  [[Bourgeois]] were usually defined as professionals who did not work with their hands.

New lords, like the Angos, revived the ideals of country life. Jean-Baptist Ango built what would be the main residence around 1700, and probably the remainder of La Motte's buildings and walls.

The son, René-Phillipe de la Motte-Ango, married Antoinette de Dame Pellevé Flers. He became the Lord of Château de Flers after the premature deaths of her two uncles; the first uncle from a duel and the second from a horse-fall. The imposing granite [[Château de Flers]] is near the town center, and open to the public. Through skillful management, the Fler branch of the family became one of the wealthiest in France.

Jean Baptiste Ango IV sold the Château just before the beginning of the French Revolution. A letter from [[Voltaire]]  declined the ownership of the Chateau in place of payment of a debt of only a 1000 écu in 1758. The letter said the lands had been poorly managed and systematically pillaged by the local peasants.&lt;ref name="Rousseau"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rousseau|first=Xavier|title=Joué-du-Plain|journal=Le Pays d'Argentan|date=December 1958|volume=4|series=Dictionnaire de Pays d'Argentan|issue=110|pages=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution and the 19th century==
During the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], like most chateaus, it was probably pillaged but not burned, as portrayed in popular imagination. No useful records survive from the time. Normandy was not strongly partisan during the period. An interim manager sold off stone from the main house to nearby farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdin|first=Gérald|title=La Révolution dans L'Orne|year=1988|publisher=Horvath|location=Le Coteau|isbn=2-7171-0612-X|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820 the prominent Deschamps family bought the Château and built the existing home, dated at 1821-22. The barn and the orchard house have similar dates chiseled over the entrances, indicating substantial reconstruction by the family.&lt;ref name="Rousseau"/&gt;
 
André Champrepus, the grandson of the original Deschamps, remembered as poor, portly and single, was the last Marquis. He died at the outbreak of the Second World War. Locals recall visiting the body presented in the Château's tower, and the nephew paying all the communes taxes that year, a custom among the nobility from the Middle Ages.

==Second World War==
Honoré Jean Noel bought the Château as a retreat for his employees. He owned a ‘’café clos’’, or house of prostitution, in Paris. The enterprising Noel with his wife and family live at the Château, and they rented out the farmland with most of the buildings. Locals recall his bringing his young women there for short breaks "to get a tan". He provided ponies and carts for the employee to explore the Château's grounds. He also owned two ''café clos'' in Argentan. Locals referred to him as Père Noel, and they recall his Provençal accent along with a Mdm. Julos, a loud, tattooed woman that was a permanent member of the family.

Emile Buffon, a well liked local man who soon became mayor of Joué-du-Plain rented the Chateau's farm. Mayors had the delicate jobs of negotiating between German demands and local resentments. This mayor's job made the position more difficult as he worked as an animal dealer. Buffon had to gather the farm animals of local farmers for the German army, as agreed to in the treaty of the French defeat. No farmer wanted to give up his best animals for Nazi diners.

* Buffon sublet the farmhouse to a boarding school for Coulombs, Seine-et-Marne, as 20 or so young girls age 8 to 14, attended school. The girls avoided the much-anticipated bombings and ate much better as well.
* Farmland was rented to local farmers
* Noel leased the two dependences to a dairy to Jacques and Yvonne Bachelier. The couple occupied the winter quarters of the Château owners, the apartments closest to the Château home itself. The dairy employees lived above the dairy's stables.
* Honoré Noel with his family and women stayed in the main château. He accepted the job of secretary to the mayor, which involved the distribution of coupons for food and fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miniac|first=Jean-François|title=Les Grandes Affaires Criminelles de l'Orne|year=2008|publisher=De Borée|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-84494-814-4|pages=153–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:France zonelibre blank.PNG|thumb|left|France zonelibre blank]]

The Normans in the countryside ate much better than the city dwellers throughout the War. Forward thinking Parisians made agreements with the farmers for food supplies to be sent on the train weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viven|first=Richard|title=The Unfree French: Life under the Occupation|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-029684-6|pages=227–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local people knew things were about to change. Before 1944, Germany stationed most of its troops in towns and cities, and ignored the countryside. The dreaded [[Gestapo]], or [[Nazi]] internal police, only came to Normandy in force after January 1944. Until then, most troops stationed in France were older or ill-suited for combat. As the soldiers left, they warned the local French that their replacements would not be like them. Instead, the replacements would be young, intensely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology, and brutally battle hardened by combat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian Front]]. These were the [[Waffen SS]].

In the days leading up to [[D-Day]] Europe, air battles in the Norman clouds became more common. The Allies needed experienced pilots. Airmen that survived shooting down made every effort to make contact with Résistance forces. With French help, the pilots were to cross France to neutral Spain in order to return to Great Britain to fly and fight again.
  
On April 30, 1944, Charles Moore was flying his [[P-51 Mustang]] back from escorting bombers over Germany when four [[Messerschmitt 109]] fighters attacked. He thought he had escaped, but realized he was losing altitude. He leapt from his plunging plane over Écouché. Madame Cavelot, a schoolgirl at the time, remembers seeing his parachute float above the countryside and a truck loading up with German soldiers to bring him in. Two young French boys found him moments before the soldiers did and led him to the Resistance.
[[File:375th Fighter Squadron North American P-51D-5-NA Mustang 44-13926.jpg|thumb|A P-51 Mustang of the type flown by Moore]]

Moore recalled later that he did not know all the places he hid with the Resistance, but postwar memoires indicated he stayed in Château de la Motte. Others probably did as well, but no records survive saying whom. He recalled being smuggled to a new hideout by Denise Bachelier (sister to dairy owner and Resistant Jacques Bachelier). She returned home to find Germans waiting for her. It was May 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa39-45.fr/mooreenglish.htm Charles Moore later recalls his escape on this webpage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Bachelier had entered one of the enduring mysteries and tragedies of Joué-du-Plain during World War II, and the subject of a book and two investigations. It was a tragedy for her as well; the Germans sent her and her 18-year-old younger brother to [[concentration camp]]s, her brother did not survive: he died shortly after being freed.

===Resistance===
{{Main|Résistance Joué-du-Plain and the Assassination of Emile Buffon|French Resistance}}
Chateau de la Motte was an arms depot for the Résistance, but its discovery by the Nazis brought an accusation of collaboration to the mayor of Joué-du-Plain. His assassination followed, possibly ordered by his brother. The events took place in and around the Chateau de la Motte.

On the day of the mayor's assassination, 16 July, just before dawn, a German [[Messerschmitt 109]] fighter smashed into the large pond at Château de la Motte. The pilot, Haibt Oswald, died immediately.
 
The crash illustrated the desperate situation the occupying army faced. Corporal Oswald was based near [[Chartres]]. He died along with two others shot down that day from his outnumbered and out-fueled group. Not only did he die on his first combat mission, but he probably had only four hours of total flying experience. German fuel shortages meant no fuel to practice; it was a costly on-the-job training.

In that same dogfight, Canadian Michael O'Kelly was a casualty from Britain's [[Royal Air Force]]. He is the only Allied soldier in the graveyard at Écouché.

The Allies under [[General George Patton]] approached from the south, but the German occupiers continued local oppression, by managing a withdrawal across the [[Rhine]] to mount a final defense.

After finding the arms depot, the Germans occupied the Château with soldiers living in the farmhouse and officers in the main house. The Germans installed a bakery on the Château farm grounds.

M. Noel continued distributing rationing coupons for several years after the war, as shortages continued. Noel's son and some of the female employees followed the Allied armies into Germany. The girls' school closed and the schoolmistress left, to rejoin her German boyfriend in Germany.

==After the Second World War==
In 1974, Fauvre, a [[Peugeot]] engineer bought La Motte along with his wife and their son.

In 1986, after Fauvre's death, Rhoisin Beresford, an Irish film director and the former wife of [[Bruce Beresford]] bought the Château from the son. Beresford was a noted director of ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''. Because of her media links, numerous British notables passed through la Motte, including the heroine in the movie ''[[The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc]]'' starring [[Milla Jovovich]], filmed in nearby [[Sées]].

On December 26, 1999, the chateau suffered major tree damage from the [[Lothar]] Storm. The majority of the remaining heritage trees (with the notable exception of the lime trees) from the 18th century Chateau planting were lost.

In 2014, the current owner bought La Motte.&lt;ref name="chateaudelamottefrance.com"/&gt;

==History==

In September 2005, ''Community Impact Newspaper'' published by JG Media, Inc. launched its first edition in Round Rock | Pflugerville, Texas. There were six employees including the founder and publisher, John P. Garrett, and the company met in the game room in John’s house. Garrett was a former Advertising Director of the ''[https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/ Austin Business Journal]'' before he started ''Community Impact Newspaper.''

In its first five years, ''Community Impact Newspaper'' added about 60 employees and launched 10 community newspapers, including its first in the Houston Metro area in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://archive.impactnews.com/pdfs/NWH/issues/NWH-2009-09.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130221122905/http://archive.impactnews.com/pdfs/NWH/issues/NWH-2009-09.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = February 21, 2013|title = Community Impact Newspaper archives|last = |first = |date = September 18, 2009|work = |access-date = September 16, 2015|via = http://communityimpact.com/print-archives/cy-fair-print-archives/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, in a period of heavy layoffs at newspapers and throughout the [[Old media|legacy media]] industry, ''Community Impact Newspaper'' experienced growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Community Newspapers Alive and Well|url = http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=82:community-newspapers&amp;catid=3:main-articles|website = www.theaustinbulldog.org|accessdate = 2015-09-16|first = Editor Ken|last = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fastest-Growing Media Companies in America|url = http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/the_fastestgrowing_media_compa.php|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Check Out 10 Of The Fastest Growing Private Media Companies In The U.S.|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/check-out-10-of-the-fastest-growing-private-media-companies-in-the-us-2010-8?op=1|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pushed the idea that "Print Ain't Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Print ain’t dead: How an ad-man-turned publisher is building a local news empire profitably in Texas|url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/04/print-aint-dead-how-an-ad-man-turned-publisher-is-building-a-local-news-empire-profitably-in-texas/|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;" After expanding into the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area in March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Editor and Publisher ® - Community-Impact-Newspaper-Launches-10th-Paper-in-Texas|url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Departments/Business/Article//community-impact-newspaper-launches-10th-paper-in-texas|website = www.editorandpublisher.com|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the media company was featured by [[Editor &amp; Publisher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Editor &amp; Publisher ®|url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/ASection/Article/Community-Impact-Newspaper-Thrives-In-Texas|website = www.editorandpublisher.com|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; CISION&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Community Impact Newspaper: success in print {{!}} Vuelio|url = http://www.vuelio.com/uk/blog/community-impact-newspaper-success-in-print/|website = www.vuelio.com|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CultureMap Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Making local news relevant: Community Impact brings the local paper back from the dead|url = http://austin.culturemap.com/news/innovation/02-25-12-14-49-making-local-news-relevant-bringing-the-local-paper-back-from-the-dead/|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Wildlife''' is a [[Pan-European identity|Pan-European]] [[non-profit organization]]. Its main goal is [[nature conservation]]. The European Wildlife key objective is to conserve [[biological diversity]] and to reduce the impact of [[climatic changes]] on nature and humankind.
The main objective of European Wildlife is creating of non-state reserves and [[bio-corridors]] which would connect places with the most valuable [[biodiversity]] in [[Europe]].

== History ==
The non-profit organization European Wildlife was established in 2008. It was founded by Dalibor Dostal, a journalist and a former editor in chief of one of the most popular serious newspaper in the [[Czech Republic]].

In 2010 the European Wildlife starts its main project – the European Centre of Biodiversity, which should act as a “[[Noah’s Ark]]” of endangered species of plants and animals in Europe.

== Main goals ==
The main objective of the European Wildlife is creating of non-state reserves and bio-corridors which would connect places with the most valuable biodiversity in Europe. However, its most significant project is to establish a [[European Centre of Biodiversity]], a big non-state nature reserve in [[Central Europe]].

Among other priorities of the European Wildlife is the climate change. As well as contributing to the deceleration of climate changes, its projects also engage in reforestation. Planting of new trees means better absorption of carbon dioxide which is a by-product of European factories, transport and households. Interconnecting the places with the abundance of  wildlife diversityhelps Europe adapt to the impacts of climete changes. While new forests help retaining the water in the landscape, biocorridors help the microorganisms endangered by rise in temperatures and climate fluctuations.

== The European Bison Symbol ==

The well-known symbol of the European Wildlife conservation organization contains a silhouette of the [[European Bison]]. The European Bison is a symbol of a successful effort that was invested towards the rescue of animal species in situations where it seemed hopeless. All protectionist projects draw inspiration from that rescue of  animals which were among the minority of the last ones to survive the [[First World War]]. Moreover, it is the largest land animal in Europe. The European Bison also has a positive influence on European ecosystems. A number of species such as rare butterflies are becoming extinct only because there are no big [[herbivores]] living in Europe. Since 2009 the orange and black and white logo with the silhouette of the animal in an orange square has been a trademark of the European Wildlife organisation in all countries of [[European Union]] registered by [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]] (OHIM).

== European Centre of Biodiversity ==
The  most significant project of the European Wildlife is to establish the European Centre of Biodiversity, a big non-state nature reserve in Central Europe. Its placement is important in terms of maintaining biodiversity of the whole continent. That is because Central Europe now separates populations of wild animals which live in [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]]. The establishment of European centre of biodiversity should be an important step towards their mutual interconnection and thus maintaining wildlife diversity in Europe long-term.

The European Wildlife aim is to create a reserve which would be ten times ten kilometres large. The objective is to create an area big enough, a forest with a natural variety of woody species which, in future, would enable endangered species – especially large European mammals –  to return. Some species such as European bison will be brought back again.

'''GeoBase''' is a [[Government of Canada|federal]], [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial]] government initiative that is overseen by the [[Canadian Council on Geomatics]] (CCOG). It is undertaken to ensure the provision of, and access to, a common, up-to-date and maintained base of quality [[geospatial]] data for Canada. Through the GeoBase, users with an interest in [[geomatics]] have access to quality geospatial information at no cost and with unrestricted use.&lt;ref&gt;''For more information, see the [http://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada Open Government Licence - Canada.]'')&lt;/ref&gt; 

==GeoBase Principles==
These are the fundamental principles that GeoBase operates under and that direct the decision making process on a regular basis:
# Source, regional and—where practical—national data all share the same geometry.
# GeoBase provides national data coverages.
# Source data is collected once and used by many.
# Source data is collected and maintained closest to source.
# The cost of maintenance and update is shared among the levels of government.
# All GeoBase data is available at no charge.
# GeoBase data has no restrictions on its subsequent use.
# GeoBase data uses a common license.

==Data Layers==
Provincial, territorial, and municipal stakeholders agreed to work together to ensure the availability of high-quality geospatial data covering the entire Canadian landmass. This data is collected once and maintained closest to the source, and provided freely through the GeoBase with no restrictions for users.

GeoBase has partnerships with federal, provincial, territorial, municipal government, and private companies, with the dual goals of eliminating data duplication and optimizing collectively available resources. GeoBase partners are involved in different levels of the data production process such as project funding, sharing of source data or by working on data collection and data processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geobase/pdf/About.pdf GeoBase - About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125163309/http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geobase/pdf/About.pdf |date=2015-11-25 }}. Accessed May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeoBase - Partners List"&gt;[http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geobase/pdf/Partners.pdf GeoBase - Partners List]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

All GeoBase data must conform to the following technical characteristics:
# GeoBase data elements carry a unique and singular ID.
# GeoBase data comply with a standard data model and meet or exceed a minimum standard for accuracy, resolution and currency.
# [[Metadata]] is defined and [[standardized]] at the [[entity]] level.
# GeoBase data and all associated tools adhere to [[international standards]].
# GeoBase data is seamless across Canada.
# GeoBase data is consistent across layers.

===Geographical Names Data Base===
The purpose of this layer is to store names and their attributes that have been approved by the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]] (GNBC) and to make these authoritative records available for government and public use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geobase.ca/geobase/en/data/cgn/index.html GeoBase - Canadian Geographical Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508234604/http://www.geobase.ca/geobase/en/data/cgn/index.html |date=2008-05-08 }}. Accessed May 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These records include the names of over 70,000 populated places and administrative areas; 300,000 water features; and 115,000 terrain features (e.g., mountains and peninsulas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/info/cgndb_e.php The Canadian Geographical Names Data Base (CGNDB) 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611052057/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/info/cgndb_e.php |date=2008-06-11 }}.

===National Road Network===
Since 2003, GeoBase has provided a consistent, accurate, and current NRN. The first edition of the NRN depicted the centerline of over 1.1 million kilometers of non-restricted use roads in Canada. In the fall of 2007 the second edition of the NRN was launched. NRN 2.0 includes place names, street names, and address ranges between intersections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/-/(urn:iso:series)geobase-national-road-network?sort-field=relevance GeoBase - National Road Network]. Accessed May 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Road network data provides the framework for many geomatics applications such as mapping, geo-coding, geographic searching, and area delineations. NRN data can be used in a wide variety of activities, including: managing road operations, business development and marketing, transportation, and government services delivery (e.g. census and elections).&lt;ref&gt;"National Road Network", GeoBase informational insert sheet. {{ISBN|978-0-662-48833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Digital Elevation Data===
Canadian [[Digital elevation model|Digital Elevation]] Data (CDED) consists of an ordered [[Array data structure|array]] of ground elevations at regularly spaced intervals. The source digital data for CDED is extracted from the [[hypsographic]] and [[hydrography|hydrographic]] elements of the [[National Topographic Data Base]] (NTDB) or various scaled [[positional]] data acquired from the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/-/(urn:iso:series)geobase-canadian-digital-elevation-data?sort-field=relevance GeoBase - Canadian Digital Elevation Data].

===New Data Layers===
A process is required for the acceptance of a new data theme into GeoBase.  The objectives of having such a process are:
# Ensure that any theme added to GeoBase will meet the requirements of most Canadian geomatics data clients.
# Ensure that the data for the theme to be added is or will be available with some long term certainty.
# Ensure that data custodians and coordinators will adhere to the GeoBase principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">The '''geology of [[Antigua and Barbuda]]''' is part of the Lesser Antilles volcanic island arc. Both islands are the above water [[limestone]] "caps" of now inactive volcanoes. The two islands are the surface features of the undersea Barbuda Bank and have [[karst]] limestone landscapes.&lt;ref name="antiguahistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiguahistory.net/uploads/3/4/3/5/34350800/antigua_and_barbuda._a_critical_bibliogr.pdf|author=Riva Berleant|date=2016-01-12|title=Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barbuda is primarily flat and formed from coral reefs. The [[Middle Miocene]] Highlands Formation has limestones which are the oldest rocks on the island, rising 120 feet above sea level. The Beazer Formation and the Codrington Formation are both from the [[Pleistocene]] and comprise reef and lagoon related rocks.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The stratigraphy of Barbuda, West Indies &amp;#124; Geological Magazine &amp;#124; Cambridge Core|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=112|issue=3|pages=271|doi=10.1017/S0016756800047026|year=1975|last1=Brasier|first1=M. D.|last2=Mather|first2=J. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Antigua, the south of the island is mainly calc-alkaline volcanic rock such as [[dacite]] and quartz [[basalt]] or [[andesite]], along with limestone lenses, agglomerate and [[tuff]] formed during the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1H6wyKKtIlgC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;dq=geology+of+antigua+and+barbuda#v=onepage&amp;q=geology%20of%20antigua%20and%20barbuda&amp;f=false | title=Studies in Earth and Space Sciences: A Memoir in Honor of Harry Hammond Hess| isbn=9780813711324| last1=Hess| first1=Harry Hammond| last2=Shagam| first2=Reginald| date=1973-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally andesite dominated volcanism across the island gave way to limestone and [[chert]] formation.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Upper Oligocene of Antigua: the volcanic to limestone transition in a limestone Caribbee - Donovan - 2014 - Geology Today|journal=Geology Today|volume=30|issue=4|pages=151–158|doi=10.1111/gto.12061|year = 2014|last1 = Donovan|first1 = Stephen K.|last2=Jackson|first2=Trevor A.|last3=Harper|first3=David A.T.|last4=Portell|first4=Roger W.|last5=Renema|first5=Willem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth (Hades)}}
In [[Greek mythology|mythology]], the '''Greek underworld''' is an [[otherworld]] where [[soul]]s go after death. The original Greek idea of [[afterlife]] is that, at the moment of death, the soul is separated from the corpse, taking on the shape of the former person, and is transported to the entrance of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=J. Bruce|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=Detroit|page=9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underworld itself—sometimes known as [[Hades]], after its patron god—is described as being either at the outer bounds of the ocean or beneath the depths or ends of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Robert|title=The Greek Way of Death|year=1985|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the dark counterpart to the brightness of [[Mount Olympus]] with the [[Underworld|kingdom of the dead]] corresponding to the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|kingdom of the gods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fairbanks|first=Arthur|title=The Chthonic Gods of Greek Religion|journal=The American Journal of Philology|date=1 January 1900|volume=21|issue=3|page=242|jstor=287716|doi=10.2307/287716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hades is a realm [[Invisibility|invisible]] to the living, made solely for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albinus|first=Lars|title=The House of Hades: studies in ancient Greek eschatology|year=2000|publisher=Aarhus|location=Aarhus University Press|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Rivers===
There are six main rivers that are visible both in the living world and the underworld. Their names were meant to reflect the emotions associated with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirto|first=Maria Serena|title=Death in the Greek World: From Homer to the Classical Age|year=2012|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Normal|page=16|author2=A. M Osborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Styx]] is generally considered to be one of the most prominent and central rivers of the underworld and is also the most widely known out of all the rivers. It's known as the river of hatred and is named after the goddess Styx. This river circles the underworld seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leeming|first=David|title=Styx|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-1497?rskey=rTReql&amp;result=1320&amp;q=|work=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Acheron]] is the river of pain. It's the one that [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the Ferryman, rows the dead over according to many mythological accounts, though sometimes it is the river Styx or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buxton|first=R.G.A|title=The Complete World of Greek Mythology|year=2004|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Lethe]] is the river of forgetfulness. It is associated with the goddess Lethe, the goddess of forgetfulness and oblivion. In later accounts, a poplar branch dripping with water of the Lethe became the symbol of [[Hypnos]], the god of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoi Project: Lethe|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/PotamosLethe.html|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Phlegethon]] is the river of fire. According to [[Plato]], this river leads to the depths of [[Tartarus]].
* The [[Cocytus]] is the river of wailing.
* [[Oceanus]] is the river that encircles the world,&lt;ref&gt;The Iliad&lt;/ref&gt; and it marks the east edge of the underworld,&lt;ref&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/ref&gt; as Erebos is west of the mortal world.

===Entrance of the underworld===
In front of the entrance to the underworld live Grief, Anxiety, Diseases, and Old Age. Fear, Hunger, Death, Agony, and Sleep also live in front of the entrance, together with Guilty Joys. On the opposite threshold is War, the [[Erinyes]], and [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]. Close to the doors are many beasts, including [[Centaur]]s, [[Gorgon]]s, the [[Lernaean Hydra]], the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], and [[Harpy|Harpies]]. In the midst of all this, an Elm can be seen where false dreams cling under every leaf.

The souls that enter the underworld carry a coin under their tongue to pay Charon to take them across the river. Charon may make exceptions or allowances for those visitors carrying a certain Golden Bough.
Charon is appallingly filthy, with eyes like jets of fire, a bush of unkempt beard upon his chin, and a dirty cloak hanging from his shoulders. Although Charon embarks now one group now another, some souls he grimly turns away. These are the unburied which can't be taken across from bank to bank until they receive a proper burial.

Across the river, guarding the gates of the underworld is [[Cerberus]]. There is also an area where the Judges of the underworld decide where to send the souls of the person — to Elysium, the Fields of Asphodel, or Tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maicar.com/GML/Underworld.html |title=Underworld and Afterlife - Greek Mythology Link |publisher=Maicar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tartarus===
While [[Tartarus]] is not considered to be directly a part of the underworld, it is described as being as far beneath the underworld as the earth is beneath the sky.&lt;ref name=bux&gt;Buxton pg.213&lt;/ref&gt; It is so dark that the "night is poured around it in three rows like a collar round the neck, while above it grows the roots of the earth and of the unharvested sea."&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; Tartarus is the place that [[Zeus]] cast the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] along with his father [[Cronus]] after defeating them.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] wrote that Cronus then became the king of Tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;Albinus pg.87&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Odysseus]] does not see them himself, he mentions some of the people within the underworld who are experiencing punishment for their sins.

===Asphodel Meadows===
The [[Asphodel Meadows]] was a place for ordinary or indifferent souls who did not commit any significant crimes, but who also did not achieve any greatness or recognition that would warrant them being admitted to the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]. It was where mortals who did not belong anywhere else in the underworld were sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/theatre/The+Greek+Underworld |title=The Greek Underworld |publisher=Wiki.uiowa.edu |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mourning Fields===
In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''Mourning Fields'' (''Lugentes Campi'') was a section of the underworld reserved for souls who wasted their lives on unrequited love. Those mentioned as residents of this place are [[Dido]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Eriphyle]], [[Pasiphaë]], [[Evadne]], [[Laodamia]], and [[Caeneus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth, William. Knight, William (edit.). ''The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, Volume 6''. MacMillan &amp; Co. 1896; pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. Fairclough, H. Rushton (trans.). ''Virgil: Eclogues. Georgics. Aeneid I-VI''. Vol. 1. William Heinemann. G.P. Putnam's Sons. 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elysium===
[[Elysium]] was a place for the especially distinguished. It was ruled over by [[Rhadamanthus]], and the souls that dwelled there had an easy afterlife and had no labors.&lt;ref&gt;Albinus pg.86&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, those who had proximity to the gods were granted admission, rather than those who were especially righteous or had ethical merit. Most accepted to Elysium were demigods or heroes.&lt;ref name=bux /&gt; Heroes such as [[Cadmus]], [[Peleus]], and [[Achilles]] also were transported here after their deaths. Normal people who lived righteous and virtuous lives could also gain entrance such as [[Socrates]] who proved his worth sufficiently through philosophy.&lt;ref name=bux /&gt;

===Isles of the Blessed===
The [[Fortunate Isles]] or ''Isles of the Blessed'' were islands in the realm of Elysium. When a soul achieved Elysium, they had a choice to either stay in Elysium or to be reborn. If a soul was reborn three times and achieved Elysium all three times, then they were sent to the Isles of the Blessed to live in eternal paradise.

==Deities==

===Hades===
[[Hades]] (Aides, Aidoneus, or Haidês), the eldest son of the Titans [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]; brother of Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia, is the Greek god of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoi Project: Haides|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Haides.html|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the three brothers divided the world between themselves, Zeus received the heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld; the earth itself was divided between the three. Therefore, while Hades' responsibility was in the underworld, he was allowed to have power on earth as well.&lt;ref name="cle"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Cleirigh|first=Padraig|title=An Introduction to Greek mythology : story, symbols, and culture|year=2000|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, N.Y.|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hades himself is rarely seen outside his domain, and to those on earth his intentions and personality are a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Mirto pg.21&lt;/ref&gt; In art and literature Hades is depicted as stern and dignified, but not as a fierce torturer or devil-like.&lt;ref name=cle /&gt; However, Hades was considered the enemy to all life and was hated by both the gods and men; sacrifices and prayers did not appease him so mortals rarely tried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peck|first=Harry Thurston|title=Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities|year=1897|publisher=Harper|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also not a tormenter of the dead, and sometimes considered the "Zeus of the dead" because he was hospitable to them.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.52&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his role as lord of the underworld and ruler of the dead, he was also known as Zeus Khthonios ("the infernal Zeus" or "Zeus of the lower world"). Those who received punishment in Tartarus were assigned by the other gods seeking vengeance. In Greek society, many viewed Hades as the least liked god and many gods even had an aversion towards him, and when people would sacrifice to Hades, it would be if they wanted revenge on an enemy or something terrible to happen to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/greeks/religion/hades.htm Hades]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hades was sometimes referred to as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] and was represented in a lighter way &amp;ndash; here, he was considered the giver of wealth, since the crops and the blessing of the harvest come from below the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Peck pg.761&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persephone===
[[File:Persephone krater Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.40.jpg|thumb|The [[Rape of Persephone]]: Persephone is abducted by Hades in his chariot. Persephone krater Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.40]]

[[Persephone]] (also known as Kore) was the daughter of [[Demeter]], the goddess of the harvest, and Zeus. Persephone was abducted by Hades, who desired a wife. When Persephone was gathering flowers, she was entranced by a narcissus flower planted by Gaia (to lure her to the underworld as a favor to Hades), and when she picked it the earth suddenly opened up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leeming|first=David|title=Demeter and Persephone|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-407#|work=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hades, appearing in a golden chariot, seduced and carried Persephone into the underworld. When Demeter found out that Zeus had given Hades permission to abduct Persephone and take her as a wife, Demeter became enraged at Zeus and stopped growing harvests for the earth. To soothe her, Zeus sent Hermes to the underworld to return Persephone to her mother. However, she had eaten six pomegranate seeds in the underworld and was thus eternally tied to the underworld, since the pomegranate seed was sacred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfister|first=F|title=Greek Gods and Heroes|year=1961|publisher=Macgibbon &amp; Kee|location=London|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persephone could then only leave the underworld when the earth was blooming, or every season except the winter. The [[Homeric Hymns]] describes the abduction of Persephone by Hades:

{{quote | align=right|&lt;poem&gt;I sing now of the great Demeter
Of the beautiful hair,
And of her daughter Persephone
Of the lovely feet,
Whom Zeus let Hades tear away
From her mother's harvests
And friends and flowers—
Especially the Narcissus,
Grown by Gaia to entice the girl
As a favor to Hades, the gloomy one.
This was the flower that
Left all amazed,
Whose hundred buds made
The sky itself smile.
When the maiden reached out
To pluck such beauty,
The earth opened up
And out burst Hades ...
The son of Kronos,
Who took her by force
On his chariot of gold,
To the place where so many
Long not to go.
Persephone screamed,
She called to her father,
All-powerful and high, ...
But Zeus had allowed this.
He sat in a temple
Hearing nothing at all,
Receiving the sacrifices of
Supplicating men.&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, Demeter and Persephone&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/poem&gt;}}

Persephone herself is considered a fitting other half to Hades because of the meaning of her name which bears the Greek root for "killing" and the -''phone'' in her name means "putting to death".&lt;ref name=cle /&gt;

===Hecate===
[[File:Hekate Kharites Glyptothek Munich 60.jpg|thumb|Triple Hecate and the [[Charites]], Attic, 3rd century BCE ([[Glyptothek]], Munich)]]
[[Hecate]] was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, dogs, light, the [[Moon]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[witchcraft]], knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, necromancy, and sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html |title=HECATE : Greek goddess of witchcraft, ghosts &amp; magic ; mythology ; pictures : HEKATE |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;d'Este, Sorita &amp; Rankine, David, Hekate Liminal Rites, Avalonia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Erinyes===
[[File:Orestes Delphi BM GR1917.12-10.1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Orestes at [[Delphi]] flanked by [[Athena]] and [[Pylades]] among the Erinyes and [[priest]]esses of the [[oracle]], perhaps including [[Pythia]] behind the tripod – Paestan [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured]] bell-krater, c. 330 BC]]

The [[Erinyes]] (also known as the Furies) were the three goddesses associated with the souls of the dead and the avenged crimes against the natural order of the world. They consist of [[Alecto]], [[Megaera]], and [[Tisiphone]].

They were particularly concerned with crimes done by children against their parents such as matricide, patricide, and unfilial conduct. They would inflict madness upon the living murderer, or if a nation was harboring such a criminal, the Erinyes would cause starvation and disease to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoi Project: Erinyes|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Erinyes.html|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Erinyes]] were dreaded by the living since they embodied the vengeance of the person who was wronged against the wrongdoer.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks pg.251&lt;/ref&gt; Often the Greeks made "soothing [[libation]]s" to the Erinyes to appease them so as to not invoke the wrath of [[Erinyes]], and overall the Erinyes received many more libations and sacrifices than other gods of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks pg.255&lt;/ref&gt; The Erinyes were depicted as ugly and winged women with their bodies intertwined with serpents.&lt;ref&gt;Theoi Project: Erinyes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NAMA Hermès &amp; Myrrhinè.jpg|thumb|200px|Relief from a carved funerary ''[[lekythos]]'' at Athens: [[Hermes]] as psychopomp conducts the deceased, ''Myrrhine'', to Hades, ca 430-420 BCE ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]).]]

While [[Hermes]] did not primarily reside in the underworld and is not usually associated with the underworld, he was the one who led the souls of the dead to the underworld. In this sense, he was known as Hermes [[Psychopomp]]os and with his fair golden wand he was able to lead the dead to their new home. He was also called upon by the dying to assist in their passing – some called upon him to have painless deaths or be able to die when and where they believed they were meant to die.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pgs.54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judges of the underworld===
[[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]], and [[Aeacus]] are the judges of the dead. They judged the deeds of the deceased and created the laws that governed the underworld. However, none of the laws provided a true justice to the souls of the dead, and the dead did not receive rewards for following them or punishment for wicked actions.&lt;ref name=long&gt;Long pg.9453&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeacus was the guardian of the Keys of the underworld and the judge of the men of Europe. Rhadamanthys was Lord of Elysium and judge of the men of Asia. Minos was the judge of the final vote.

===Charon===
[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] is the ferryman who, after receiving a soul from Hermes, would guide them across the rivers [[Styx]] and/or [[Acheron]] to the underworld. At funerals, the deceased traditionally had an [[Charon's obol|obol]] placed over their eye or under their tongue, so they could pay Charon to take them across. To the Etruscans, Charon was considered a fearsome being – he wielded a hammer and was hook-nosed, bearded, and had animalistic ears with teeth.&lt;ref name=bux /&gt; In other early Greek depictions, Charon was considered merely an ugly bearded man with a conical hat and tunic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoi Project: Kharon|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Kharon.html|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, in more modern Greek folklore, he was considered more angelic, like the [[Archangel Michael]]. Nevertheless, Charon was considered a terrifying being since his duty was to bring these souls to the underworld and no one would persuade him to do otherwise.

===Cerberus===
[[File:Hades with cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hades with Cerberus.]]
[[Cerberus]] (Kerberos), or the "Hell-Hound", is Hades' massive [[polycephaly|multi-headed]] (usually three-headed)&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cerberus|title= Cerberus|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Cerberus|title=Yahoo!

Born from [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] and [[Typhon]], Cerberus guards the gate that serves as the entrance of the underworld.&lt;ref name=cle /&gt; Cerberus' duty is to prevent dead people from leaving the underworld.

[[Heracles]] once borrowed Cerberus as the final part of the [[Labours of Heracles]]. [[Orpheus]] once soothed it to sleep with his music.

===Thanatos===
[[Thanatos]] is the personification of death. He guards the Doors of Death.

===Melinoë===
[[Melinoe]] is a [[chthonic]] [[nymph]], daughter of Persephone, invoked in one of the [[Orphic Hymns]] and propitiated as a bringer of nightmares and madness.&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 70 or 71 (numbering varies), as given by [[:de:Richard Wünsch|Richard Wünsch]], ''Antikes Zaubergerät aus Pergamon'' (Berlin, 1905), p. 26:&lt;br&gt;Μηλινόην καλέω, νύμφην [[Chthonia|χθονίαν]], κροκόπεπλον,&lt;br&gt;ἣν παρὰ Κωκυτοῦ προχοαῖς ἐλοχεύσατο σεμνὴ&lt;br&gt;Φερσεφόνη λέκτροις ἱεροῖς Ζηνὸς Κρονίοιο&lt;br&gt;ᾗ ψευσθεὶς Πλούτων᾽ἐμίγη δολίαις ἀπάταισι,&lt;br&gt;θυμῷ Φερσεφόνης δὲ διδώματον ἔσπασε χροιήν,&lt;br&gt;ἣ θνητοὺς μαίνει φαντάσμασιν ἠερίοισιν,&lt;br&gt;ἀλλοκότοις ἰδέαις μορφῆς τὐπον έκκπροφανοῦσα,&lt;br&gt;ἀλλοτε μὲν προφανής, ποτὲ δὲ σκοτόεσσα, νυχαυγής,&lt;br&gt;ἀνταίαις ἐφόδοισι κατὰ ζοφοειδέα νύκτα.&lt;br&gt;ἀλλἀ, θεά, λίτομαί σε, καταχθονίων Βασίλεια,&lt;br&gt;ψυχῆς ἐκπέμπειν οἶστρον ἐπὶ τέρματα γαίης,&lt;br&gt;εὐμενὲς εὐίερον μύσταις φαίνουσα πρόσωπον.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She may also be the figure named in a few inscriptions from [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lynn Larson, ''Greek Nymphs: Myth, Cult, Lore'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; and she appears on a bronze tablet in association with [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe G. Edmonds III, "Orphic Mythology," in ''A Companion to Greek Mythology'' (Blackwell, 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_XsN0O_BQ0cC&amp;pg=PA100 note 58, p. 100]; [[Apostolos Athanassakis|Apostolos N. Athanassakis]], ''The Orphic Hymns: Text, Translation, and Notes'' (Scholars Press, 1977), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The hymns, of uncertain date but probably composed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, are [[liturgy|liturgical]] texts for the [[mystery religion]] known as [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]]. In the [[hymn]], Melinoë has characteristics that seem similar to [[Hecate]] and the [[Erinyes]],&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, "Orphic Mythology," pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; and the name is sometimes thought to be an [[epithet]] of Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;Ivana Petrovic, ''Von den Toren des Hades zu den Hallen des Olymp'' (Brill, 2007), p. 94; W. Schmid and O. Stählin, ''Geschichte der griechischen Literatur'' (C.H. Beck, 1924, 1981), vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 982; [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms in which Melinoë is described are typical of moon goddesses in Greek poetry.

===Nyx===
[[Nyx]] is the goddess of the Night.

===Tartarus===
A deep abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s,&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Georg Autenrieth|title=Τάρταρος|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*ta%2Frtaros |encyclopedia=A Homeric Dictionary |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tartarus]] was also considered to be a primordial deity.

===Achlys===
[[Achlys]] is the personification of misery and sadness, sometimes represented as a daughter of Nyx, sometimes as an ancient being even older than [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] himself.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Styx===
Styx is the goddess of the [[River Styx|river with the same name]]. Not much is known about her, but she is an ally of [[Zeus]] and lives in the underworld.

===Eurynomos===
[[Eurynomos]] is one of the [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]s of the underworld, who eats off all the flesh of the corpses, leaving only their bones.

==The dead==
In the Greek underworld, the souls of the dead still existed but they are insubstantial and they flitted around the underworld with no sense of purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikalson|first=Jon D|title=Ancient Greek Religion|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dead within the Homeric underworld lack ''menos'', or strength, and therefore they cannot influence those on earth. They also lack ''phrenes'', or wit, and are heedless of what goes on around them and on the earth above them.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.1&lt;/ref&gt; Their lives in the underworld were very neutral, so all social statuses and political positions were eliminated and no one was able to use their previous lives to their advantage in the underworld.&lt;ref name=long /&gt;

The idea of progress did not exist in the Greek underworld &amp;ndash; at the moment of death, the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] was frozen, in experience and appearance. The souls in the underworld did not age or really change in any sense. They did not lead any sort of active life in the underworld &amp;ndash; they were exactly the same as they were in life.&lt;ref name=alb&gt;Albinus pg.27&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, those who had died in battle were eternally blood-spattered in the underworld and those who had died peacefully were able to remain that way.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.74&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall the Greek dead were considered to be irritable and unpleasant, but not dangerous or malevolent. They grew angry if they felt a hostile presence near their graves and drink offerings were given in order to appease them so as not to anger the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pgs.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly blood offerings were given due to the fact that they needed the essence of life to become communicative and conscious again.&lt;ref name=long /&gt; This is shown in Homer's [[Odyssey]], where [[Odysseus]] had to give blood in order for the souls to interact with him. While in the underworld, the dead passed the time through simple pastimes such as playing games, as shown from objects found in tombs such as dice and game-boards.&lt;ref name=gar&gt;Garland pg.70&lt;/ref&gt; Grave gifts such as clothing, jewelry, and food were left by the living for use in the underworld as well since many viewed these gifts to carry over into the underworld.&lt;ref name=alb /&gt; There was not a general consensus as to whether the dead were able to consume food or not. Homer depicted the dead as unable to eat or drink unless they had been summoned; however, some reliefs portray the underworld as having many elaborate feasts.&lt;ref name=gar /&gt; While not completely clear, it is implied that the dead could still have sexual intimacy with another, although no children were produced. The Greeks also showed belief in the possibility of marriage in the underworld, which in a sense describes the Greek underworld having no difference than from their current life.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucian]] described the people of the underworld as simple skeletons. They are indistinguishable from each other, and it is impossible to tell who was wealthy or important in the living world.&lt;ref&gt;O’Cleirigh pg.191&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view of the underworld was not universal &amp;ndash; Homer depicts the dead keeping their familiar faces.

Hades itself was free from the concept of time. The dead are aware of both the past and the future, and in poems describing Greek heroes, the dead helped move the plot of the story by prophesying and telling truths unknown to the hero.&lt;ref name=alb /&gt; The only way for humans to communicate with the dead was to suspend time and their normal life to reach Hades, the place beyond immediate perception and human time.&lt;ref name=alb /&gt;

==Greek attitudes==
The Greeks had a definite belief that there was a journey to the afterlife or another world. They believed that death was not a complete end to life or human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mystakidou|first=Kyriaki|author2=Eleni Tsilika |author3=Efi Parpa |author4=Emmanuel Katsouda |author5=Lambros Vlahos |title=Death and Grief in the Greek Culture|journal=Omega: the Journal of Death and Dying|date=1 December 2004|volume=50|issue=1|page=24|url=http://baywood.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,5;journal,64,260;linkingpublicationresults,1:300329,1|accessdate=4 December 2012|doi=10.2190/YYAU-R4MN-AKKM-T496}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks accepted the existence of the soul after death, but saw this afterlife as meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Mikalson pg.178&lt;/ref&gt; In the underworld, the identity of a dead person still existed, but it had no strength or true influence. Rather, the continuation of the existence of the soul in the underworld was considered a remembrance of the fact that the dead person had existed, yet while the soul still existed, it was inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Mystakidou pg.25&lt;/ref&gt; However, the price of death was considered a great one. Homer believed that the best possible existence for humans was to never be born at all, or die soon after birth, because the greatness of life could never balance the price of death.&lt;ref&gt;Mystakidou pg.24&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek gods only rewarded heroes who were still living; heroes that died were ignored in the afterlife. However, it was considered very important to the Greeks to honor the dead and was seen as a type of piety. Those who did not respect the dead opened themselves to the punishment of the gods &amp;ndash; for example, Odysseus ensured Ajax's burial, or the gods would be angered.&lt;ref&gt;Garland pg.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths and stories==

===Orpheus===
[[Orpheus]], a poet and musician that had almost supernatural abilities to move anyone to his music, descended to the underworld as a living mortal to retrieve his dead wife [[Eurydice]] after she was bitten by a poisonous snake on their wedding day. With his lyre-playing skills, he was able to put a spell on the guardians of the underworld and move them with his music.&lt;ref&gt;Albinus pg.105&lt;/ref&gt; With his beautiful voice he was able to convince Hades and Persephone to allow him and his wife to return to the living. The rulers of the underworld agreed, but under one condition &amp;ndash; Eurydice would have to follow behind Orpheus and he could not turn around to look at her. Once Orpheus reached the entrance, he turned around, longing to look at his beautiful wife, only to watch as his wife faded back into the underworld. He was forbidden to return to the underworld a second time and he spent his life playing his music to the birds and the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Edith|title=The Story of Orpheus and Eurydice|url=http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/webtexts/eurydice/eurydicemyth.html|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hesperia Planum''' is a broad [[lava plain]] in the southern highlands of the planet [[Mars]]. The plain is notable for its moderate number of [[impact crater]]s and abundant [[wrinkle ridge]]s. It is also the location of the ancient [[volcano]] Tyrrhena Mons ([[Tyrrhena Patera]]). The [[Hesperian]] time period on Mars is named after Hesperia Planum.&lt;ref name=ScottCarr78&gt;Scott, D.H.; Carr, M.H. (1978). Geologic Map of Mars.

Hesperia is the intermediate-toned (dusky) region (left of center) lying between the darker regions Mare Tyrrhenum (left) and Mare Cimmerium (right).]]
Most place names on Mars are derived from sources in the [[Bible]] or [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:Hesperia|Hesperia]]'' is a Greco-Latin poetic term for "lands to the west," which to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] meant [[Italy]], while [[Spain]] was referred as ''Hesperia Ultima'' .&lt;ref name=GPN1&gt;{{gpn|2486|Hesperia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, D.P. (1968). ''Cassell's New Latin Dictionary;'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls: New York, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planum'' (pl. ''plana'') is [[Latin]] for plateau or high plain. It is a [[Planetary nomenclature#Descriptor terms (feature types)|descriptor term]] used in [[planetary geology]] for a relatively smooth, elevated terrain on another [[planet]] or [[Natural satellite|moon]].&lt;ref name=GPN2&gt;USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hesperia region of Mars was named by Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] in 1877 for an intermediate-toned [[classical albedo features on Mars|albedo feature]] centered at lat. 20°S, long. 240°W between two darker regions.&lt;ref name=GPN1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 2003, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing the dark areas were bodies of water, Schiaparelli interpreted Hesperia to be a [[floodplain]] or [[marsh]] bridging two adjacent seas, the Mare Tyrrhenum and Mare Cimmerium.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, 1996, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the existence of seas on Mars had been discounted by the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, P. (1954). The Planet Mars in ''Realities of Space Travel: Selected Papers of the British Interplanetary Society,'' L.J. Carter, Ed.; McGraw-Hill: New York, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; the true nature of the region remained obscure until the [[space age]]. In 1972, the [[Mariner 9]] spacecraft showed that Hesperia was a cratered, wind-streaked plain.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C. ''et al.'' (1972). Variable Features on Mars: Preliminary Mariner 9 Television Results. ''Icarus,'' '''17,''' 346–372.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally named the area Hesperia Planum in 1973.&lt;ref name=GPN3&gt;{{gpn|2488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dark areas flanking Hesperia Planum were found to be heavily cratered uplands. In 1979, the IAU designated the upland area to the west as [[Tyrrhena Terra]] and to the east as [[Terra Cimmeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=MARS&amp;featureType=Terra,%20terrae|title=Terra, terrae}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Terra'' is a Latin descriptor term meaning land or continent.)

==Location and physical description==

Geophys. Res.,'' '''110,''' E12S21, {{doi|10.1029/2005JE002420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is centered at lat. 22.3°S, long. 110°E in the [[Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle]] (MC-22). A small part of this region in the south is found in the [[Hellas quadrangle]].  It has a maximum width of 1700&amp;nbsp;km (1056&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;ref name=GPN3 /&gt; and covers an area of about 2 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (772000 sq. mi).&lt;ref name=GreggCrown05&gt;Gregg, T.

An Examination of Multiple Working Hypotheses. 36th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1962. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1962.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

At large scales (&gt;100 m), Hesperia Planum appears smooth and level,&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, R. (1994). ''Planetary Landscapes,'' 2nd ed.; Chapman &amp; Hall: New York, p. 162. {{ISBN|0-412-05181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; having a relatively uniform surface elevation of 1.2&amp;nbsp;km above [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|Mars datum]].&lt;ref&gt;Kostama, V.-P.; Ivanov, M.

Major Episodes of the Hydrologic History of Hesperia Planum, Mars. 36th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1659. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1659.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The plain's surface is 200–800 m lower in elevation than the surrounding uplands of Tyrrhena Terra and Terra Cimmeria and is slightly tilted to the south, with a mean regional slope of about 0.03°.&lt;ref name=Ivanovetal05 /&gt; In high-resolution images (&lt;19 m/pixel), the surface of Hesperia Planum is dominated by dust and fine-grained deposits. Few boulders or bedrock outcrops are visible. Abundant, shallow craters filled with smooth, flat-lying deposits are common. No vents or volcanic constructs are identifiable, although small (&lt;10s meters wide) channels are present.&lt;ref name=GreggdeSilva09 /&gt;

==Geology==
Hesperia Planum is generally interpreted to be composed of [[Flood basalt|flood lavas]],&lt;ref name= GreeleySpudis81/&gt; although layered [[volcaniclastic]] or [[Lake|lacustrine]] (lake-bed) sediments cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name=GreggdeSilva09&gt;Gregg, T. K. P.; de Silva, S. (2009). Tyrrhena Patera and Hesperia Planum, Mars: New Insights (and Old Interpretations) from High-Resolution Imagery. 40th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1700. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2009/pdf/1700.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The lavas appear to partly fill a large, irregular topographic depression that existed in [[Noachian]] times. The rims of pre-existing impact craters are still visible in places, indicating that the lava deposits are 250–500 m in thickness. The volume of lavas within Hesperia Planum is comparable to that found in [[large igneous province]]s on Earth, such as the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]].&lt;ref name=Ivanovetal05/&gt;

===Impact cratering and age===
[[File:Viking 418S39 Hesperia.jpg|left|thumb|280px|[[Viking program|Viking orbiter]] view of [[wrinkle ridge]]s in Hesperia Planum. North is at upper left. Image is about 107&amp;nbsp;km (64&amp;nbsp;mi) across.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, 2008, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The moderate amount of cratering on Hesperia Planum indicates that the plain has an intermediate age in Martian history. In [[planetary geology]], the number density of impact craters is a measure of the [[relative dating|relative age]] of a planetary surface. Heavily cratered surfaces are old, and sparsely cratered surfaces are young. Hesperia Planum is the [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] for the [[Hesperian]] System and time period. The lavas making up Hesperia Planum define the base of the Hesperian [[System (stratigraphy)|System]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. (1986). The Stratigraphy of Mars. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' Seventeenth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Part 1, '''91'''(B13), E139–E158.&lt;/ref&gt; They erupted at the beginning of the Hesperian Period around 3700 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, S.C. (2009). The Global Martian Volcanic Evolutionary History. ''Icarus,'' '''201,''' 44–68.&lt;/ref&gt; (Mars itself, along with the other planets, formed about 4500 million years ago.) Hesperian lavas are younger than the rocks in the heavily cratered [[Noachian]] terrains but older than rocks formed during the more recent Amazonian Period. (See [[Geology of Mars#Crater density timescale|Geology of Mars]].)

===Wrinkle ridges===
Wrinkle ridges are long, linear [[topography|topographic]] highs with a distinctive morphology that consists of a low, broad arch topped by a narrow crenulated ridge (pictured left). They are common features on the Moon where they occur exclusively within lava flow plains (the lunar [[Lunar mare|maria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 2006, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Their occurrence on Mars is thought to reflect a similar volcanic association. Thus, areas on Mars with abundant wrinkle ridges are interpreted as plains formed by very fluid basaltic lava ([[flood basalt]]s). The ridges themselves are believed to be the surface expression of [[thrust fault]]s formed after the lava flows were emplaced.&lt;ref&gt;Golombek, M.P.; Anderson, F.S.; Zuber, M.T. (2001). Martian Wrinkle Ridge Topography: Evidence for Subsurface Faults from MOLA. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''106'''(El0), 23,811–23,821.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montési, L. G. J.; Zuber, M.T. (2003). Clues to the Lithospheric Structure of Mars from Wrinkle Ridge Sets and Localization Instability. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''108'''(E6), 5048, {{doi|10.1029/2002JE001974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not volcanic features, but secondary, [[tectonics|tectonic]] structures that form in dense, competent rocks (such as layered basalts) that have undergone compressional stress. Hesperian-aged "ridged plains" like Hesperia Planum cover about 30% of the Martian surface.&lt;ref name=GreeleySpudis81&gt;Greeley, R.; Spudis, P. (1981). Volcanism on Mars. ''Rev. Geophys. Space Phys.,''''' 19'''(1), 13–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyrrhenus Mons===
[[File:Tyrrhena Mons.jpg|right|thumb|320px|[[Thermal Emission Imaging System|THEMIS]] daytime IR mosaic image of Tyrrhenus Mons. This ancient, eroded volcano was nicknamed the Dandelion when first seen in [[Mariner 9]] images.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, 2002, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tyrrhenus Mons ([[Tyrrhena Patera]]) is an eroded, low-lying volcano in the western part of Hesperia Planum. It is one of the oldest large central-vent volcanoes on the planet&lt;ref name=GreeleyCrown90&gt;Greeley, R.; Crown, D.A. (1990). Volcanic Geology of Tyrrhena Patera, Mars. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''95'''(B5), 7133–7149.&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of a class of volcanoes called [[Volcanism on Mars#Highland Paterae|highland paterae]], which erupted mainly in the Late [[Noachian]] and Early [[Hesperian]].&lt;ref name=Crownetal07&gt;Crown, D. A.; Berman, D. C.; Gregg, T. K. P. (2007). Geologic Diversity and Chronology of Hesperia Planum, Mars. 38th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1169. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2007/pdf/1169.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrrhenus Mons stands only 1.5&amp;nbsp;km above the surrounding plains. At its center lies a 40&amp;nbsp;km diameter depression, or [[caldera]], from which radiate numerous flat-floored valleys and ridges that suggest the volcano has been highly eroded. The low relief of Tyrrhenus Mons combined with its degraded state indicate the volcano consists largely of [[friable]] and easily eroded material such as [[volcanic ash]]. The ash was likely derived from the interaction of [[magma]] with [[groundwater]] or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 2006, pp. 69, 74, Fig. 3.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development''' ('''HLPF''') is a subsidiary body of both the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] responsible for the entire organization's policy on [[Sustainable development|sustainable development]]. It adopts negotiated declarations, reviews commitment and the progress of the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The Forum replaced the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] on the 24 September 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1556 |title=High-level Political Forum |date=n.d. |website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=14 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings of the Forum are open to all Member States of the United Nations. 

== History ==

The HLPF has its origin in the '''Commission on Sustainable Development''' ('''CSD'''), which was created in 1992 to ensure follow-up of the [[Earth Summit|Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/intergovernmental/csd |title=Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) |date=n.d. |website= sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=November 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Commission met a total of 20 times, with its last session on 20 September 2013.

At the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Conference on Sustainable Development]], or Rio+20, it was decided that the Commission would be replaced by the '''High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.''' This new Forum would meet under the auspices of both the Economic and Social Council, as well as the General Assembly. The Forum was formally created by Resolution 67/290 on 9 July 2013. &lt;ref name="67-290"&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-67-290 |body=A |session=67 |type=R |resolution_number=290 |title= Format and Organizational Aspects of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Forum is held under the authority of both the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, the body hosts two different types of meetings:
* While under the auspices of the General Assembly: Once every four years at the level of Heads of State and Government for a period of two days.
* While under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council: Yearly, for a period of eight days, including a three-day ministerial segment.
Its meetings are held in July.

== Mandate ==

The HLPF was created with the aim to strengthen sustainable development governance at the United Nations. It works to achieve this through its mandate, which states the following in respect to sustainable development: &lt;ref name="67-290"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="66-288"&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-66-288 |body=A |session=66 |type=R |resolution_number=288 |title= The Future We Want |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate= 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:OM''' is the entry for [[Oman]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Oman, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Governorates of Oman|11 governorates]]. In 2011, the following subdivision changes took place:
*[[Al Batinah Region]] ''(Al Bāţinah)'' split into [[Al Batinah North Governorate]] and [[Al Batinah South Governorate]].
*[[Ash Sharqiyah Region (Oman)|Ash Sharqiyah Region]] ''(Ash Sharqīyah)'' split into [[Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate]] and [[Ash Sharqiyah South Governorate]].
*[[Ad Dakhiliyah Region]] ''(Ad Dākhilīyah)'', [[Ad Dhahirah North Region]] ''(Az̧ Z̧āhirah)'', and [[Al Wusta Region (Oman)|Al Wusta Region]] ''(Al Wusţá)'' all became governorates.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|OM}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Oman. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Ibiza''' ({{lang-ca|Eivissa}}) is a Spanish island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off the eastern coast of Spain. It is {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city of [[Valencia]]. It is the third largest of the [[Balearic Islands]], an [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community of Spain]]. Its largest settlements are [[Ibiza Town]] ({{lang-ca|Vila d'Eivissa}}, or simply {{lang|ca|Vila}}), [[Santa Eulària des Riu]], and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]]. Its highest point, called [[Sa Talaiassa]] (or Sa Talaia), is {{convert|475|m|0|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Ibiza has become well known for its association with [[nightlife]], [[electronic dance music]] that originated on the island, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/27/ibiza-party-spirit Ibiza renews its party spirit], Luke Bainbridge, June 27, 2010 (The Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2015 it was resumed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/inside-the-police-crackdown-on-ibizas-endless-party-culture Inside the police crackdown on Ibizas endless party culture] Michelle Lhooqe, November 13, 2015 (Vice TV website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibiza, Biodiversity and Culture|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/417|website=UNESCO|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibiza and the nearby island of [[Formentera]] to its south are called the Pine Islands, or "[[Pityusic Islands|Pityuses]]".

{{anchor|Etymology|Toponymy|Name}}
==Names==
The official [[Catalan language|Catalan]] name is ''Eivissa'' ({{IPA-ca|əjˈβisə|pron}}). Its name in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is ''Ibiza'' ({{IPA-es|iˈβiθa|pron}}). In [[British English]], the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|b|iː|θ|ə}},&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Ibiza}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in [[American English]] the pronunciation is closer to [[Spanish language#Latin America|Latin American Spanish]] ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|b|iː|z|ə}},&lt;ref&gt;''Random House dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|b|iː|s|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jones | first=Daniel | authorlink= Daniel Jones (phonetician) |author2=Peter Roach| title= English Pronouncing Dictionary| edition=16th | year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John C. | authorlink= John C. Wells | title=Longman Pronunuciation Dictionary | edition=2nd | year=2000 | publisher=Pearson Education Limited |location=Harlow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenician colonists called the island '''Ibossim''' or '''Iboshim''' ({{lang-phn|𐤀𐤁𐤔𐤌}}, {{sc|ʾbšm}},{{sfnp|Head &amp; al.|1911|p=3}} "Dedicated to [[Bes]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveibiza.com/ibiza_literature/god_bes_ibiza.htm |title=Ibiza Literature, Literature in Ibiza |publisher=Liveibiza.com |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhbier"&gt;{{Cite book|editor1=Kuhbier, Heinrich |editor2=Alcover, Josep Antoni |editor3=Guerau d'Arellano Tur, Cristòfol |year=1984 |title=Biogeography and Ecology of the Pityusic Islands |series=Monographiae Biologicae, Volume 52 |location=The Hague, The Netherlands |publisher=Dr. W. Junk (Kluwer) |page=1 |isbn=978-90-6193-105-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later known to Romans as '''Ebusus'''. The [[Greeks]] called the two islands of Ibiza and [[Formentera]] the ''Pityoûssai'' ({{lang|grc|Πιτυοῦσσαι}}, "Pine-Covered Islands").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383365 Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the [[Royal Navy]] as '''Ivica'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=1845 |title=Ivica |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, Or, Universal Dictionary of Knowledge |volume=21 |location=London |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ijhOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 167]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Anforas griegas ibiza.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ancient Greek [[Aryballos|aryballoi]] found in the necropolis of Puig des Molins. Museu de Puig des Molins, Ibiza]]
In 654 BC, [[Phoenicia]]n settlers [[Sa Caleta Phoenician Settlement|founded a port on Ibiza]]. With the decline of Phoenicia after the [[Assyria]]n invasions, Ibiza came under the control of [[Carthage]], also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce ([[garum]]), and wool.

A shrine with offerings to the goddess [[Tanit]] was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of [[Majorca]], such as ''Na Guardis'', and "Na Galera" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers,{{efn|"The Rhodians, like the Baleares, were celebrated slingers." ({{lang-la|Iam cui Tlepolemus sator, et cui Lindus origo, Funda bella ferens Balearis et alite plumbo.}})&lt;ref&gt;Strab. xiv. p. 654; Plin. l. c. ''Sil. Ital.'' iii. 364, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;}} to fight for Carthage.

[[File:ForbysIbizaTown 03.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the old town from the port]]During the [[Second Punic War]], the island was assaulted by the two [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipio]] brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to [[Menorca]] and then to [[Liguria]]. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first [[Vandal]] and then [[Byzantine]] rule, the island was conquered by the [[Moors]] in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of [[Dénia]]—the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the [[Valencian Community]]—and the two areas were administered jointly by the [[Taifa of Dénia]] during some time (11th century).

Ibiza together with the islands of [[Formentera]] and [[Menorca]] were invaded by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[King of Norway|King]] [[Sigurd I of Norway]] in the spring of 1110 on his [[crusade]] to [[Jerusalem]]. The king had previously conquered the cities of [[Sintra]], [[Lisbon]], and [[Alcácer do Sal]] and given them over to [[Christianity|Christian]] rulers, in an effort to weaken the [[Islam|Muslim]] grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to [[Sicily]] where he visited King [[Roger II of Sicily]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The island was [[Reconquista|conquered by]] [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] King [[James I of Aragon|James I]] in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King [[Philip V of Spain]] abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands]]. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with [[Majorca]], [[Menorca]], and [[Formentera]].

Ibiza is a rock island covering an area of {{convert|572.56|km2|sqmi|2}}, almost six times smaller than [[Majorca]], but over five times larger than [[Mykonos]] (in the [[Greek Isles]]) or 10 times larger than [[Manhattan]] in New York City.

Ibiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the "Pityuses" or "Pine Islands" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is [[Sa Talaiassa]], at {{convert|475|m|ft|0}}.

==People==
Demographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2017 had reached 143,856. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears – IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are [[Germany|German]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Latin America]]n, [[France|French]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]], in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the [[expatriate]] population (Rozenberg 1990).

The Spanish composer and music theorist [[Miguel Roig-Francolí]] was born in Ibiza,&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopèdia d'Eivissa i Formentera''. [http://www.eeif.es/significados/r-volum%20X/RoigFrancoliCostaMiquelA.html "Roig-Francoli Costa, Miguel Angel"]&lt;/ref&gt; as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Abel Matutes]].&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who at [[NATO]].

==Language==
[[Eivissenc]] is the native dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby [[Formentera]]. Catalan shares co-official status with [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and [[expatriate]]s living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages like English, French, German and Italian are widely spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.petitfute.com/d371-ibiza/guide-touristique/c116604-population-et-langues.html | date = 13 August 2017|title=Le guide touristique IBIZA du Petit Futé : Population et langues (français)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nightlife===
[[File:West End Sant Antoni.jpg|275px|thumb|left|Sant Antoni, West End]]
[[File:Sunset at Cafe del Mar, Sant Antoni de Portmany (Ibiza) (190294471).jpg|275px|thumb|Sunset at Café del Mar, Sant Antoni de Portmany]]

Ibiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous [[nightclub]]-based nightlife centred on two areas: [[Ibiza Town]], the island's capital on the southern shore and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany|Sant Antoni]] to the West.

Night life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diariodeibiza.es/pitiuses-balears/2016/04/17/bares-cafes-marina/836033.html#|title=Bares y cafés de la Marina|last=|first=|date=23 December 2016|website=Diario de Ibiza|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: [[Pacha Group|Pacha]], [[Privilege Ibiza|Privilege (formerly Ku)]], [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia]] and [[Es Paradis|Es Paradís]]. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.

During the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as [[Balearic beat]], a precursor of the British [[acid house]] scene. As [[rave]] parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that [[Space (Ibiza nightclub)|Space]] opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.

At the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the [[Circoloco]] parties made their debut at [[DC10 (nightclub)|DC10]], with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.

In recent years, during the summer, top producers and [[Disc jockey|DJs]] in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the [[House music|house]], [[Trance music|trance]] and [[techno]] genres of [[electronic dance]] music.  The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for [[Balearic beat|house]] and [[Balearic trance|trance]] in particular, with its name often being used as a partial [[metonym]] for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like [[Goa]] in India.

Since 2005, the live music event [[Ibiza Rocks Hotel|Ibiza Rocks]] has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Bands such as [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Kasabian]], [[The Prodigy]], and the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.

The season traditionally begins at the start of June with [[Space (Ibiza nightclub)|Space]] and [[DC10 (nightclub)|DC10]]'s opening parties and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties. A typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and "disco sunrises." Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehaviour from young adult tourists, it has acquired the [[sobriquet]] "[[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]] of the Med." Also well-known is [[Café del Mar]], a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by [[José Padilla (musician)|José Padilla]], who has released more than a dozen [[eponym]]ous album compilations of [[ambient music]] played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular [[Disc jockey|DJ]] performers.

The island's government is trying to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene, passing rules including the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/18/escape.balearicislands|title=Is the party over in Ibiza?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2007-11-18 | location=London | first=Tom | last=Robbins | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bbs.clubplanet.com/chicago/27508-ibiza-changing.html |title=Is Ibiza changing?? |publisher=Bbs.clubplanet.com |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105011317/http://bbs.clubplanet.com/chicago/27508-ibiza-changing.html |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

A number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including "The White Island" by Stephen Armstrong, ''[[Joshua Then and Now]]'' by [[Mordecai Richler]], ''Soma Blues'' by [[Robert Sheckley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Soma Blues|last= Sheckley|first= Robert|authorlink=Robert_Sheckley |year= 1997|publisher= Forge/Tom Doherty Associates|location= New York|isbn= 0-312-86273-3|page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vacation in Ibiza'' by [[Lawrence Schimel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Vacation in Ibiza|last=Schimel|first = Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence_Schimel|year=2003|publisher=Eurotica|isbn=1-56163-377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery'' by [[Hannah Blank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery|last= Blank|first= Hannah|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher= Hightrees/Prism Corporation|location= New York|isbn= 0-9652778-4-4|page= 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''They Are Ruining Ibiza'' by A. C. Greene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= They Are Ruining Ibiza|last= Greene|first= A. C. |year= 1998|publisher= University of North Texas Press|location= Denton, TX|isbn= 1-57441-042-3|page= 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Python Project'' by [[Victor Canning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Python Project|last= Canning|first= Victor|authorlink= |year= 1967|publisher= Heinemann|location= London, UK|page= 284}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Memes Eivissencs'' also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.

In popular music, American singer-songwriter [[Mike Posner]] released ''[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]'' (alternatively known as ''In Ibiza'', or its clean title ''I Took a Plane to Ibiza'') in April 2015, as single on his [[Vevo]] account and in the exclusive ''The Truth'' EP; it was later released on ''[[At Night, Alone.]]'' in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based [[folk pop]] song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo [[SeeB]] as a [[tropical house]] [[dance pop]] song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on July 24, 2015. ''I Took a Pill in Ibiza'' peaked at #4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Mike Posner Chart History (Hot 100)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Posner Chart History (Hot 100)|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/Mike-Posner/chart-history/hot-100|website=Billboard|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly "annoyed" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party "typecast." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/06/tourism-chiefs-angry-at-michael-posners-i-took-a-pill-in-ibiza|title=Tourism chiefs invite singer of hit drugs song to see other side of Ibiza|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Heritage Site===
Though primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/417UNESCO|title=Ibiza, Biodiversity and Culture|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities. A notable example includes "God's Finger" in the Benirràs Bay as well as some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at [[Sa Caleta Phoenician Settlement|Sa Caleta]]. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as [[Ses Feixes Wetlands]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healingibiza.com/ibiza-preservation-fund.html Ibiza Preservation Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514060152/http://www.healingibiza.com/ibiza-preservation-fund.html |date=14 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.

Because of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots.  A monument ([[Sant Antoni de Portmany#The Egg|"The Egg"]]) erected in honour of [[Christopher Columbus]] can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.

===Development===
Since the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at [[Space (Ibiza nightclub)|Space]] and [[Privilege Ibiza|Privilege]], to failed development projects, such as [[Josep Lluís Sert]]'s abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibizaphoto.blogspot.com/2011/02/josep-lluis-serts-abandoned-hotel-at.html|title=Josep Lluís Sert's abandoned hotel at Cala D'en Serra.|first=Thomas G.|last=Clark|date=7 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the half-completed and now demolished "Idea" nightclub in [[Sant Antoni de Portmany|Sant Antoni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibizaphoto.blogspot.com/2011/05/discoteca-idea-san-antonio-ibiza.html|title=An abandoned Idea|first=Thomas G.|last=Clark|date=29 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near [[Sant Josep de sa Talaia|Sant Josep]] called "Festival Club" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelntourism.org/europe/ibiza-party-events.html |title=Ibiza Party |publisher=TravelnTourism |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andrès has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called "Donde nada ocurre" (Where nothing happens).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://irenedeandres.com/|title=Irene de Andrès website|last=|first=|date=24 December 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through [[Ibiza Airport]] in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the "clubbing calendar"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vakantie Ibiza 2017 » De beste tips voor op vakantie! |url=https://www.europa-vakanties.nl/spanje/ibiza/ |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=Europa Vakanties |date=4 January 2015 |language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibiza – a hedonist's paradise whatever your poison|url=http://www.ibizatraveller.com/lifestyle/hedonist-paradise/|publisher=Ibiza Traveller|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to imposition of a "Sustainable Tourism Tax" which went into effect in July 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="pulse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shortlidge|first1=Chadler|title=Ibiza "Cannot Support Much More Increase in Tourism" Says Govt|url=http://pulseradio.net/articles/2016/07/ibiza-government-the-island-can-t-handle-more-tourists|website=Pulse|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's {{convert|572|km2}} not much more tourism can be supported.&lt;ref name="pulse"/&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Location map Ibiza.png|thumb|upright=1.14|Map of roads and [[Ibiza Airport]] (on southern point) and water routes (''click map to enlarge'').]]

Ibiza is served by [[Ibiza Airport]], which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.

There are also [[ferry|ferries]] from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to [[Barcelona]], [[Majorca]], [[Dénia]], and [[Valencia]]. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eulària, and Figueretes–Platja d'en Bossa.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town—every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eulària.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Cuisine==
Ibiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as ''[[flaons]]''. Other savory dishes include ''sofrit pagès'', ''bullit de peix'' (fish stew), ''arròs de matança'' (rice with pork) and ''arròs a la marinera''.

The '''Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center''' (IMMRAC) is an [[Israel]]i [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the [[research|study]] and [[Wildlife management|conservation]] of [[cetacean]] populations that inhabit the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and the Gulf of [[Aqaba]]/[[Eilat]].

IMMRAC’s activities include:

* Updating the list of Mediterranean cetacean [[species]] that range into the inadequately studied Eastern Basin.
* Conducting near-shore surveys with the goal of studying the [[habitat]] use, site fidelity, home-range extent, trends in population size and genetic profiles of coastal [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, the most common local species.
* Manning a nationwide, 24-hour alert net which responds to real-time reports of distressed-at-sea, floating, [[beached whale|beached]] and stranded [[dolphin]]s, as well as a modest [[Wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitation facility]] for sick/injured animals.
* Conducting [[post mortem]] examinations to determine age, feeding habits through [[stomach]] contents, possible cause of death, general state of health and level of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[contaminant]]s. Tissue samples are also sent to Israeli and international laboratories for analyses.
* Pursuing a multi-year longitudinal study of dolphin-human relations expressed by a solitary sociable female bottlenose dolphin in the [[gulf of Aqaba]]/Eilat.
* Devising means of reducing [[by-catch]], specifically of bottlenose dolphins, which have a close and costly association with the local [[fishing trawler|trawl-boat]] fleet.
* Launching public awareness campaigns to draw attention to important [[ecology|ecological]] issues affecting dolphins in the [[Middle East]], as well as the [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] bio-diversity of our whole [[Earth|planet]]. This is done by means of media interviews, [[press release]]s, public lectures, information stands and activity centers at various “green” exhibitions, as well as by offering educational programs at all age levels, from [[kindergarten]] to [[university]].
* [[Lobbying]] for [[legislation]] aimed at conservation of the marine environment at large, and specifically [[marine mammals]].

After [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s death in the [[Philippines]], Elcano took command of the [[carrack]] ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'' from the [[Moluccas]] to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] in Spain.

== Early life ==

Elcano was born in around 1486 to Domingo Sebastián Elcano and Catalina del Puerto. He had three brothers: Domingo Elcano, a Catholic [[Priest#Roman Catholic and Orthodox|priest]], Martín Pérez Elcano, and Antón Martín Elcano.

==Military life==
Elcano fought in the [[Italian Wars]] under the command of [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]] in [[Italy]], and in 1509 he joined the Spanish expedition organized by Cardinal [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] against [[Algiers]].

==Merchant shipping==
Elcano settled in [[Seville]] and became a merchant ship captain. After breaking Spanish laws by surrendering a ship to [[Genoa]]n bankers in repayment of a debt, he sought a pardon from the Spanish king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], by signing on as a subordinate officer for the Magellan expedition to the [[Indies|East Indies]].

== Voyage of circumnavigation ==

[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|left|The Magellan expedition.]]
[[File:NaoVictoria.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Victoria (ship)|Nao ''Victoria'']], Elcano ship Replica in [[Punta Arenas]]]]
Elcano served as a naval commander of Charles V of Spain and took part in the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|expedition]] to the [[Philippines]]. In 1519, this 241-man expedition set sail with five ships, ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'', ''[[Concepción (carrack)|Concepción]]'', ''San Antonio'', ''Santiago'', and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''. Elcano participated in a fierce mutiny against Magellan before the convoy discovered the passage through South America, the [[Strait of Magellan]]. He was spared by Magellan and after five months of hard labour in chains was made captain of the [[galleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Patrick J. |last1=Murphy |first2=Ray W. |last2=Coye |title=Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery |url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300170283/mutiny-and-its-bounty |date=2013|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|ISBN=9780300170283 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Santiago'' was later destroyed in a storm. The fleet sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern coast of [[Brazil]] and into [[Puerto San Julián]] in [[Argentina]]. Several days later they discovered a passage now known as the [[Strait of Magellan]] located in the southern tip of [[South America]] and sailed through the strait. The crew of ''San Antonio'' mutinied and returned to Spain. On 28 November 1520, three ships set sail for the [[Pacific Ocean]] and about 19 men died before they reached [[Guam]] on 6 March 1521. Conflicts with the nearby island of Rota prevented Magellan and Elcano from resupplying their ships with food and water. They eventually gathered enough supplies and continued their journey to the Philippines and remained there for several weeks. Close relationships developed between the Spaniards and the islanders. They took part in converting the Cebuano tribes to Christianity and became involved in tribal warfare between rival Filipino groups in [[Mactan Island]]. [[File:Elkano Spice Islands.jpg|thumb|left|Route of the Spanish expedition through the Spice Islands. The red cross shows the location of Mactan Island in the Philippines where Magellan was killed in 1521.]]

On 27 April 1521, Magellan was killed and the Spaniards defeated by natives in the [[Battle of Mactan]] in the Philippines. The surviving members of the expedition could not decide who should succeed Magellan. The men finally voted on a joint command with the leadership divided between [[Duarte Barbosa]] and [[João Serrão]]. Within four days these two were also dead. They were killed after being betrayed at a feast at the hands of Rajah Humabon. The mission was now teetering on disaster and João Lopes de Carvalho took command of the fleet and led it on a meandering journey through the Philippine archipelago.

During the six-month listless journey after Magellan died, and before reaching the [[Moluccas]], Elcano's stature grew as the men became disillusioned with the weak leadership of Carvalho. The two ships, ''Victoria'' and ''Trinidad'' finally reached their destination, the [[Moluccas]], on 6 November. They rested and re-supplied in this haven, and filled their holds with the precious cargo of [[clove]]s and [[nutmeg]]. On 18 December, the ships were ready to leave. ''Trinidad'' sprang a leak, and was unable to be repaired. Carvalho stayed with the ship along with 52 others hoping to return later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Seafarers—The Explorers| first= Richard |last=Humble| publisher= Time-Life Books| location= Alexandria, Virginia| year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Victoria'', commanded by Elcano along with 17 other European survivors of the 240 man expedition and 4 (survivors out of 13) Timorese Asians continued its westward voyage to Spain crossing the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s. They eventually reached [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] on 6 September 1522.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Perspectivas Culturales de España| first= Juan |last= Kattan-Ibarra| year= 1995| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Pigafetta]], an Italian scholar, was a crew member of the Magellan and Elcano expedition. He wrote several documents about the events of the expedition. According to Pigafetta the voyage covered 14,460 leagues—about {{convert|81,449|km|mi}}.

===Honours===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Juan Sebastián Elcano A-71.svg|thumb|right|150px|Elcano's coat of arms]]
Elcano was awarded a [[coat of arms]] by Charles I of Spain, featuring a globe with the motto: ''Primus circumdedisti me'' (in [[Latin language|Latin]], "You went around me first"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nobiliario de conquistadores de Indias|date=1892|publisher=Sociedad de Bibliófilos Españoles|location=Madrid|page=57|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/nobiliario-de-conquistadores-de-indias/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annual pension.

== Loaísa expedition ==
In 1525, Elcano returned to sea, and became a member of the [[Loaísa expedition]]. He was appointed leader along with [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] as captains, who commanded seven ships and sent to claim the East Indies for King Charles I of Spain. Both Elcano and Loaísa and many other sailors died of [[malnutrition]] in the Pacific Ocean, but the survivors reached their destination and a few of them managed to return to Spain.

==Family life==
Elcano never married but he had a son by María Hernández Dernialde named Domingo Elcano, whom he legitimized in his last will and testament.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The '''Alcarria''' ({{lang-es|La Alcarria}}) is a [[natural region]] in [[Castile (historical region)|Castille]] ([[Spain]]). It  is located mainly in [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara Province]] but also overlaps those of [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]] and [[Madrid (autonomous community)|Madrid]].  Its principal attractions are its fauna and flora and it is noted for its [[honey]] and a special breed of [[domestic sheep|lamb]].

The most notable towns in the region are: [[Almonacid de Zorita]], [[Brihuega]], [[Cifuentes, Guadalajara|Cifuentes]], [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], [[Illana]], [[Priego]], [[Jadraque]],  [[Mondéjar]], [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]], [[Sacedón]],  [[Trillo (Guadalajara)|Trillo]] and [[Villalba del Rey]]. {{cn|date=April 2015}}

The region figures prominently in the travel book ''[[Viaje a la Alcarria]]'' (Journey to the Alcarria) by [[Camilo José Cela]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inside.fdu.edu/fdupress/06020107review.html Old Spain and New Spain: The Travel Narratives of Camilo José Cela (Book Review)]. [[Farleigh Dickinson University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
La Alcarria is a kind of plateau brought out by the rising of the [[Sistema Ibérico]]. The strata that form this plateau are smoothly undulating. Limestones and gypsum are common because of its origins below the sea surface (from the [[Mesozoic Era]]; the red sandstone and the earth-originated conglomerated stones were more recently formed. Over this strata of sedimentary stones, the rivers have originated deep and quite often, broad valleys, gorges and many other [[karst]] phenomena, as those that can be seen in the north of the [[Province of Cuenca]] (Las Majadas, El Hosquillo, La [[Ciudad Encantada]], Ravines of the rivers [[Beteta]] and [[Júcar]] and in almost the whole [[Guadalajara (province)|Province of Guadalajara]] (Canyon of River Dulce, high course of [[River Tagus]], Ravine of River Corduentes and below the waters of the reservoir of Entrepeñas, also in the River Tagus). Is precisely, the name of Entrepeñas (among rocks) the one that represents the character of all the area, since River Tagus forms there a beautiful canyon close to Sacedón, where that dam is. {{cn|date=April 2015}}

The upper level of the plateau of La Alcarria is quite uniform as can be seen in the photo, although it descends softly from north to south. In this image you can also see the sudden valley to the right (to the South of Escamilla) made by the valley of the River Guadiela.

'''''Landscape''''' was a magazine of human geography founded by [[J.B. Jackson]] in 1951 and published three times a year in [[Berkeley, California]] until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University Library [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/000113983/catalog  catalog entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's original subtitle was "Human Geography of the Southwest"; this was later dropped.

The first five issues consisted largely of Jackson's own essays. Jackson was the magazine's publisher and editor until 1968. Publication was suspended from 1971–1974.

Its ISSN was 0023-8023.

'''Las Villas''' is a [[natural region]] and [[Comarcas of Spain|''comarca'']] in [[Andalusia]], southern [[Spain]]. It is located in the [[mountainous]] area at the eastern end of [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén Province]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvillas.net Comarca de Las Villas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526133303/http://www.lasvillas.net/ |date=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main town is [[Villacarrillo]]. 

Together with the [[Sierra de Cazorla]] and [[Sierra de Segura]] mountain ranges Las Villas gave its name to the [[Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park]] that was established in 1986. 8.3 percent of the surface of the [[protected area]] falls within the Las Villas ''comarca''.&lt;ref name="Segura official site"&gt;[http://www.ayuntamiento-seguradelasierra.com/seccion.php?s=parque/parquenatural El Parque Natural - Municipality of Segura de la Sierra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526150948/http://www.ayuntamiento-seguradelasierra.com/seccion.php?s=parque%2Fparquenatural |date=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the Las Villas ''comarca'' had been merged with [[La Loma (Jaén)|La Loma]] as ''La Loma y las Villas'', an administrative division of Andalusia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechodeportivo.org/legislacion/orden%20comarcas.pdf Mapa de comarcas de Andalucía] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230071759/http://www.derechodeportivo.org/legislacion/orden%20comarcas.pdf |date=2008-12-30 }}. Listado comarcal definido por la Consejería de Turismo y Deporte de la [[Junta de Andalucía]]&lt;/ref&gt; The present-day official ''comarca'' was established in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Orden de 14 de marzo de 2003, por la que se aprueba el mapa de comarcas de Andalucía a efectos de la planificación de la oferta turística y deportiva, Boletín Oficial de la Junta de Andalucía'' Bulletin of the Government of Andalusia, No 59; 27 March 2003, p. 6248&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the 2014 [[census]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE)]]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''comarca'' has a population of 22,023 inhabitants.

'''Little George Coc&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;nuts''' is a valley on the southwestern end of [[Pitcairn Island]]. It got its name from a [[coconut]] grove which was once maintained there by George Young, son of Pitcairn settler and [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] mutineer [[Ned Young]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20964">'''Material flow analysis''' ('''MFA''') (also referred to as '''substance flow analysis''' ('''SFA''')) is an analytical method to quantify flows and stocks of materials or substances in a well-defined [[system]]. MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of [[industrial ecology]] or [[anthropogenic metabolism|anthropogenic]], [[urban metabolism|urban]], [[social metabolism|social]] and [[industrial metabolism]]. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within [[ecosystem]]s. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking [[nutrient]] flows through a [[waste water treatment plant]]. When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called [[material flow cost accounting]]. MFA is an important tool to study the [[circular economy]] and to devise [[material flow management]]. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the ''[[Journal of Industrial Ecology]]'', ''[[Ecological Economics]]'', ''[[Environmental Science and Technology]]'', and ''Resources, Conservation, and Recycling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/resources-conservation-and-recycling/|title=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Motivation===
[[Human need]]s such as shelter, food, transport, or communication require materials like wood, starch, sugar, iron and steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity [[Economic growth|expands]], material production, use, and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be [[externality|neglected]] anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from [[landfill]]s or [[oil spill]]s. Rising concern about [[global warming]] puts a previously unimportant waste flow, [[carbon dioxide]], on top of the political and scientific agenda. 
The gradual shift from primary material production to [[recycling|urban mining]] in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society.
Scientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the [[anthroposphere]]. Material flow analysis is such a method.

===Basic principles===
MFA is based on two fundamental and well-established scientific principles, the [[system]]s approach and [[mass balance]].&lt;ref&gt;Marina Fischer-Kowalski, The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part I, 1860-1970, Journal of Industrial Ecology 2(1), 1998, pp 61-78, {{doi|10.1162/jiec.1998.2.1.61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marina Fischer-Kowalski, The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part II, 1970-1998, Journal of Industrial Ecology 2(4), 1998, pp 107-136, {{doi|10.1162/jiec.1998.2.4.107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The system definition is the starting point of every MFA study.

====System definition====
[[File:MFASystem 1.png|thumb|Basic MFA system without quantification.]]
[[File:MFASystem 2.png|thumb|A more general MFA system without quantification.]]
An MFA system is a model of an industrial plant, an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary, one or more [[unit process|processes]], material flows between processes, and stocks of materials within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to the preconceived notion that a system represents a specific industrial installation, systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are well-defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system, either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes.

Next to specifying the arrangement of processes, stocks, and flows in the system definition, the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied.
The spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA, China, certain world regions, or the world as a whole. 
The temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. 
The indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says, an indicator element is a certain [[chemical element]] such as cadmium or a substance such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars, materials like steel, or other physical quantities such as [[energy]].

MFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms 'material', 'substance', or 'good', as laid out, for example, in chapter 2.1 of Brunner and Rechberger,&lt;ref name="BR2004"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Brunner | first = P.H. | last2 = Rechberger | first2 = H. | title = Practical Handbook of Material Flow Analysis | publisher = Lewis Publishers, New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56670-604-1 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main references for the MFA method.

* A [[chemical element]] is "a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom distinguished by its atomic number".&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC, Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book") (1997). Online corrected version:  (2006–) "chemical element".&lt;/ref&gt;
* A substance is "any (chemical) element or compound composed of uniform units. All substances are characterised by a unique and identical constitution and are thus homogeneous." From chapter 2.1.1 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* A good is defined as "economic entity of matter with a positive or negative economic value. Goods are made up of one or several substances". From chapter 2.1.2 in Brunner and Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* The term material in MFA "serves as an umbrella term for both substances and goods". From chapter 2.1.3 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
[[File:MFASystem 3.png|thumb|A typical MFA system with quantification.]]

====Process balance====

One of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the [[social metabolism|metabolism]] of the elements of the system. Unlike economic accounting, MFA also covers non-economic waste flows, emissions to the environment, and non-market natural resources. 
[[File:MFAProcess1.png|thumb|Model of an industrial process in economic accounting (top) and in physical accounting (bottom).]]
The process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool. The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply. For a process '[[oil refinery]]', for example, one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element, while this is not possible for a nuclear power station. A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel, but a steel mill does not.

When quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data, mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process. Conflicting information can be reconciled using [[data validation and reconciliation]], and the STAN-software offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stan2web.net/|title=Home|website=www.stan2web.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of MFA applications on different spatial and temporal scales==

MFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements, substances, and goods. They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles. Several examples:

* ''MFA on a national or regional scale'' (also referred to as [[material flow accounting]]): In this type of study, the material exchanges between an economy and the natural environment are analyzed. Several indicators are calculated in order to assess the level of [[resource intensity]] of the system. &lt;ref name="ES2013"&gt;{{Cite report | last = Eurostat | title =  Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts (EW-MFA) | publisher = Eurostat | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KR2015"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krausmann | first = Fridolin | last2 = Weisz | first2 = Helga | last3 = Eisenmenger| first3 = Nina | last4 = Schütz | first4 = Helmut | last5 = Haas | first5 = Willi | last6 = Schaffartzik | first6 = Anke | title = Economy-wide Material Flow Accounting - Introduction and Guide. Social Ecology Working paper 151 | publisher = Institute of Social Ecology, Alpen-Adria University, Klagenfurt/Graz/Vienna | year = 2015 | issn = 1726-3808 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Corporate material flow analysis'', or MFA along an ''industrial supply chain'' involves a number of companies: The goal of material flow analysis within a company is to quantify and then optimize the production processes so that materials and energy are used more efficiently manner, e.g., by [[recycling]] and [[waste]] reduction. Companies can use the results obtained by [[Material Flow Cost Accounting]] to reduce their operational costs and improve environmental performance.
* In the ''life cycle of a product'': The life cycle inventory, whose compilation is at the core of [[life cycle assessment]], follows the MFA methodology as it is based on an explicit system definition and process balances.

== Historical development ==

* Mass balance or the conservation of matter has been postulated already in ancient Greece, and it was introduced into modern chemistry by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (cf. chapter 2.1.3 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger,&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;), from where it found its way to chemical engineering and finally to environmental science.
* Other seminal contributions were made by [[Sanctorius]] and [[Theodor Weyl]].
* Dennis Meadows made a wide audience aware of the physical foundation of the economy when he co-authored the bestseller ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' in 1971. Meadows et al. based their predictions on an analysis of resource stocks; see in the [[Glossary of environmental science#R|glossary of environmental science]].
* The methodology of MFA was developed during the 1980s and 1990s. Development happened simultaneously in different research groups. Central publications on the MFA methodology include Baccini and Bader (1996),&lt;ref&gt;Baccini and Bader 1996, 'Regionaler Stoffhaushalt' (Regional metabolism), Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg (Germany), {{ISBN|3-86025-235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunner and Rechberger (2004),&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt; Baccini and Brunner (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Baccini P. &amp; Brunner P.H. (2012). Metabolism of the Anthroposphere, Analysis, Evaluation, Design. 2nd Edition, The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. {{ISBN|9780262016650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van der Voet et al. (2002).&lt;ref&gt;'Predicting future emissions based on characteristics of stocks', Ecological Economics, 2002, 41(2), 223-234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, who worked at the Wuppertal Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wupperinst.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Wuppertal Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the MFA-related concept of Material Input Per Service unit (MIPS).&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Bleek {{citation |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-0348-5650-8_4 |date=1994 |title= MIPS: Ein neues ökologisches Maß}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[UNEP]] Resource Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=UNEP}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2007 by the United Nations Environment Program. In analogy to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[IPCC]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; it brings together experts from many disciplines and institutions to review the current state of research on societal metabolism and to communicate the latest findings to policymakers and stakeholders.

===Recent development===
* MFA concepts have been or are being incorporated in national accounts in several countries and regions such as the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Material_flow_accounts |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Accounting in the EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/eco_business/pdf/mfca%20guide20070822.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Accounting in Japan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927070822/http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/eco_business/pdf/mfca%20guide20070822.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MFA is also used in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].
* Several international conferences or other meetings provide a platform for researchers and policymakers to meet and exchange results and ideas, including the [[World Resources Forum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldresourcesforum.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=World Resources Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bi-annual international conference on material flow analysis and sustainable development.
* MFA-IO is an approach to establish an MFA system of the whole economy using monetary and physical Input-Output tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nakamura | first = S. | last2 = Kondo | first2 = Y. | title = Waste Input-Output Analysis. Concepts and Application to Industrial Ecology | publisher = Springer | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4020-9901-4 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Sustainable Europe Research Institute (SERI) in Vienna, Austria, has developed a database called materialflows.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.materialflows.net/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=materialflows.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic MFA aims for long-term quantification of MFA systems and uses historic development patterns of physical stocks and flows to create robust scenarios for the years and decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Müller, Stock dynamics for forecasting material flows--Case study for housing in The Netherlands, Ecological Economics 59(1), 2006, pp 142-156, {{doi|10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.09.025}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Japan has developed into a hotspot for MFA research. The country has scarce mineral resources and therefore depends on imports of energy carriers, ores, and other raw materials. The Japanese government fosters research on material cycles and also inaugurated the 3-R concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/3r/en/index.html |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=3R in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting a state-of-the-art MFA==
A state-of-the-art MFA consists of the following steps:&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* Establish an explicit system definition: Specify the system boundary with geographical and temporal scope, processes (can contain stocks), and flows. Specify the material for which the system is to be quantified (product, substance, or indicator element). Make sure that each stock is associated with a process and that each flow connects one process to another. Flows can also begin or end outside the system boundary.
* Define and name the system variables. The system variables include: All stocks within the processes, all flows between processes, and all flows coming from outside or going to outside the system boundaries. Sometimes, stocks are not considered and only the net stock changes are of interest. For each variable, it must be clear whether it is a stock or a flow, and this distinction needs to be reflected in the names and in the mathematical symbols chosen.
* Quantify the system variables by linking them to literature, measurement, or modelled data.
* Performe a mass balance check for all processes and the system as a whole.
* Optional: Visualise your system by using the box-and-arrow scheme shown above or by using [[Sankey diagram|Sankey diagrams]].
* Document the MFA by reporting the explicit system definition along with the list of quantified system variables and the mass balance checks.

===The difference between material and substance flow analysis===
While the term 'substance' in 'substance flow analysis (SFA) always refers to chemical substances, the term 'material' in 'material flow analysis (MFA)' has a much wider scope. According to Brunner and Rechberger&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt; the term 'material' comprises substances AND goods, and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel, timber, or products like cars or buildings. It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase.

==Relation to other methods==

MFA is complementary to the other core [[industrial ecology]] methods [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) and [[input-output model|input-output (I/O) models]]. Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle. The methods mainly differ in purpose, scope, and data requirements.

MFA studies often cover the entire cycle (mining, production, manufacturing, use, waste handling) of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame. Material stocks are explicit in MFA, which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap. The common use of time series (dynamic modelling) and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing long-term trends in material use.

* Compared to I/O analyses, the number of processes considered in MFA systems is usually much lower. On the other hand, mass balance ensures that flows of by-products or waste are not overlooked in MFA studies, whereas in I/O tables these flows are often not included due to their lack of economic value. Physical I/O models are much less common than economic tables. Material stocks are not covered by IO analysis, only the addition to stock can be included in form of capital accumulation.
* Life cycle inventories record the demand for many different materials associated with individual products, whereas MFA studies typically focus on a single material used in many different products.

The '''Netherlands Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Association (NOGEPA)''' was established in 1974 to promote the common interests of all companies holding licences to explore for, develop and produce [[hydrocarbons]] on- and offshore in [[The Netherlands]]. 

== Organization ==
NOGEPA's Ordinary Members are the companies operating in the Netherlands, often in association with other companies, the Associate Members. Ordinary Members keep their Associates informed of NOGEPA's activities. 

The main activities are carried out in committees and workgroups, formed by expert representatives from the member companies. The committees are managed under Executive Sponsorship.

An Executive Committee, whose members are selected in a General Meeting, manages NOGEPA. The Executive Committee meets regularly to establish NOGEPA's policies, which are implemented by NOGEPA's permanent Secretariat.

== Permit To Work ==
NOGEPA created a [[Permit to Work]] paper based system. It is an old and proven method to ensure hazardous work is not carried out without safeguards in place.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Germany:

'''[[Germany]]''' &amp;ndash; federal parliamentary republic in western-central Europe consisting of 16 constituent states, which retain limited sovereignty. Its capital and largest city is Berlin. With more than 80 million inhabitants, it is the most populous member state in the European Union. Germany is a major economic and political power of the European continent and a historic leader in many cultural, theoretical and technical fields. After losing World War I, Germany fell under the control of Adolf Hitler, who started World War II. After losing World War II, Germany was divided into East Germany and West Germany, each on opposite sides in the Cold War. In October 1990, after the Cold War ended, the country was reunified.  Germany has since grown to become the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1191">A '''periphery''', (''Fr: couronne'') is an INSEE (French demographic statistics institution) statistical area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/en/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/couronne-periurbaine.htm Definitions and methods: Periphery]&lt;/ref&gt; designating a commuter belt around an [[urban unit]] (''Fr: unité urbaine''). Together these complete the INSEE [[urban area (France)|urban area]] statistical area.

Based on France's ''[[commune in France|commune]]'' system (interlocking administrative subdivisions often comparable to [[civil parish]]es, [[town]]s or [[city|cities]]), a commune is considered part of a '''couronne''' when
# it is not densely constructed enough or is too isolated to be part of any ''[[unité urbaine]]'' (or "''[[pôle urbain]]''" if it is the core of the agglomeration), and
# at least 40% of its population commutes to workplaces in a ''[[unité urbaine]]'' or ''[[pôle urbain]]'', or to another commune connected to a ''[[unité urbaine]]'' through the same criteria.

==History==
=== Ancient history ===
[[Megalith]]ic remains have been found in modern-day [[Bhosari]] which suggests that the town was inhabited as early as 1100-200 BCE in the early [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/protoandearlyhis024606mbp|title=The Proto and Early Historical Cultures of A.P.|last=Krishna Sastry|first=V.

The epic [[Mahabharata]] mentions that [[Rukmi|King Rukmi]] of the [[Vidarbha Kingdom]] created a new capital '[[Bhojakata]]' which lay to the west of the old capital of [[Kundinapuri]].

=== Medieval Ages ===
[[File:Mourya_gosavi,_chinchwad_(2).JPG|thumb|left|[[Morya Gosavi]] temple, Chinchwad]]
[[Chinchwad]] is noted for the shrine of [[Morya Gosavi]], a prominent saint of the [[Ganapatya]] denomination of [[Hinduism]] that worships Lord [[Ganesha]] as the Supreme Being or its metaphysical concept of [[Brahman]]. Various sources place Moraya Gosavi between the 13th and 17th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://rcdhere.com/Prachin_Marathichya_Navdhara/Prachin_Marathichya_Navdhara_3.html|title=प्राचीन मराठीच्या नवधारा|last=Dhere|first=R.C.|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41532519|title=Gaṇeśa : unravelling an enigma|last=1922-|first=Krishan, Y.,|date=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|isbn=8120814134|edition= 1st|location=Delhi|oclc=41532519|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11398513|title=Ganeśa : lord of obstacles, lord of beginnings|last=B.|first=Courtright, Paul|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195035720|location=New York|oclc=11398513|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the temple records that its construction began in 1658 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Poona-III/places_c.html|title=Gazatteer of the Bombay Presidency - Poona|last=|first=|date=1885|website=Government of Maharashtra - The Gazetteers Department|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614011820/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Poona-III/places_c.html#.|archive-date=2011-06-14|dead-url=|access-date=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[partition of India]], the [[Government of India]] constructed 1,609 residences and laid out around 300 plots on 203 acres of land in the [[Pimpri]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/pdf/DP_report_TP/New%20Villeges%20DP%20Report/DP.pdf|title=Development Plan - 2021|last=|first=|date=May 2000|website=Official Website of the PCMC|page=18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area came to be known as Pimpri Camp is one of the 31 refugee camps in [[Bombay State]] (present day [[Maharashtra]]) set up during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-300-sindhi-families-get-free-hand-on-land-use/articleshow/63917159.cms|title=Over 300 Sindhi families get free hand on land use - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-nearly-40000-sindhi-settlers-in-pimpri-camp-area-to-benefit/|title=Pune: Nearly 40,000 Sindhi settlers in Pimpri camp area to benefit|date=2015-10-30|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrialization ===
Starting in the mid-1950s, the green village fields on the sides of the highway and railways linking [[Pune]] to [[Mumbai]] were subject to large industrial development. In the 1960s, the newly founded [[Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation]] (MIDC) purchased vast tracts of land, developing roads and water supply infrastructure.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Menon|first=Sudha|title=Pimpri-Chinchwad industrial belt: Placing Pune at the front|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2002/03/30/stories/2002033000801300.htm|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=The Hindu Business Line|date=March 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It developed the area for a cluster of pharmaceutical, mechanical, and automotive industries, and, more recently, information technology, of national and international importance. Hundreds of thousands of people have migrated to the new hub to fill the jobs and benefit from rapid economic development.

On 4 March 1970, the villages of [[Pimpri]], [[Chinchwad]], [[Bhosari]] and Akurdi merged into a single municipal authority, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Council.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/18669/12/12_chapter%204.pdf|title=Application of GIS in urban land use changes in the PCMC (Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation): Ph.D. Thesis submitted to the S.N.D.T.

Its chief objective was to create a planned environment for the working population in the vicinity of their work place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; On 11 October 1982, the Municipal Council was merged with seven surrounding villages and the PCNTDA area to form the a new Municipal Corporation ([[Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation|PCMC]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The size the city more than doubled in 1997 (from 84.51&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 170.51&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.) with the addition (in part or in full) of 18 villages located at the periphery of the PCMC as it existed in 1982. [[Tathawade]] was added to the city in 2008, bringing the total area of the city to 176.41&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation]] (PCMC) is the local civic body. It comprises two branches: the executive branch headed by the [[Municipal Commissioner (India)|Municipal Commissioner]], an [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] officer appointed by the [[Government of Maharashtra]], and an elected deliberative branch, the general body, headed by the [[Mayor of Pune|Mayor]]. Municipal elections are held every five years to elect councilors, popularly known as 'corporators', who form the general body of the PCMC. The corporators, in turn, elect the mayor and the deputy mayor. In the Municipal Elections held in February 2017, 128 corporators were elected to represent the 32 electoral wards (4 corporators per ward).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/pdf/election2017/PCMC%20Final%20Ward%20Rachana%20gazeete.pdf|title=Final Ward Organization, Election 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Website of PCMC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the position of the mayor is mostly ceremonial, the chief executive of the city is the [[Municipal Commissioner (India)|Municipal Commissioner]], appointed by the [[Government of Maharashtra|state government]].&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;Mukhopadhyay, A., 1999.

[[File:Road block.jpg|thumb|Concrete barrier]]
A '''roadblock''' is a temporary installation set up to control or block [[traffic]] along a [[road]]. The reasons for one could be:
*[[Roadworks]]
*Temporary road closure during special events
*[[Police chase]]
*[[Robbery]]
*[[Sobriety checkpoint]]

In peaceful circumstances, they are usually installed by the [[police]] or road transport authorities; they are also commonly employed during [[war]]s and are usually staffed by heavily armed soldiers in that case. During [[protest]]s and [[riot]]s, both police and demonstrators sometimes use roadblocks.&lt;ref&gt;Who Approves of Those Who Block Roads to

[[File:Scottish Highlands and Lowlands.png|thumb|A map showing the Scottish Lowlands (in light green) and the [[Scottish Highlands]] (darker green).]]

The '''Lowlands''' ({{lang-sco|the Lallans}} or ''the Lawlands''; {{lang-gd|a' Ghalldachd}}, "the place of the foreigner") are a cultural and historic region of [[Scotland]].

The Lowlands is not an official geographical or administrative area of the country. There are two main topographic regions: the  Lowlands and the [[Southern Uplands]]. The term "Lowlands" mainly refers to the  [[Central Lowlands]]. However, in normal usage it refers to those parts of [[Scotland]] not in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] (or [[Gàidhealtachd]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The boundary is usually considered to be a line between [[Stonehaven]] and [[Helensburgh]] (on the [[Firth of Clyde]]). The Lowlands lie south and east of the line. Note that some parts of the Lowlands (such as the [[Southern Uplands]]) are not physically "low," [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]] for example reaching 2,766 feet, while some areas indisputably in the Highlands (such as [[Islay]]) are low-lying.

In geological terms, the dividing line between Lowlands and Highlands is the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. There was also a legally defined [[Highland Line]] in the post-Culloden years, part of the measures taken to suppress [[Gaelic culture]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

For other purposes, the boundary varies; but if the Boundary Fault is used, then the traditional Scottish counties entirely in the Lowlands are: [[Ayrshire]], [[Berwickshire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Dumfriesshire]],  [[East Lothian]],&lt;ref&gt;East Lothian was known as Haddingtonshire until 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fife]], [[Kinross-shire]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], [[Lanarkshire]], [[Midlothian]],&lt;ref&gt;Midlothian was known as Edinburghshire until 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peeblesshire]], [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]], [[Roxburghshire]], [[Selkirkshire]], [[West Lothian]]&lt;ref&gt;West Lothian was known as Linlithgowshire until 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wigtownshire]].

Traditional Scottish counties which straddle the Boundary fault include [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Dunbartonshire]], [[Stirlingshire]], [[Perthshire]], [[Kincardineshire]], [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], [[Banffshire]] and [[Moray]].

Geographically, Scotland is divided into three distinct areas: the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], the Central plain ([[Central Belt]]), and the [[Southern Uplands]]. The Lowlands cover roughly the latter two. The northeast plain is also "low-land," both geographically and culturally, but in some contexts may be grouped together with the Highlands.

The term Lowlands is sometimes used in a more restricted sense to refer specifically to the Midland Valley. Much of this area, which has a characteristic structure of sedimentary rocks with coal deposits, lies within the basins of the Rivers Forth and Clyde. Historically, this valley has been the most agriculturally productive region of Scotland.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} During the 19th and early 20th centuries, coal deposits promoted concentrated industrial activity and urbanization in the Midland Valley, where 80 percent of the population of Scotland now live. While coal mining and other heavy industry have declined in the region, it remains at the centre of the Scottish economy, with electronics and computer manufacture and service sectors such as telecommunications, computer software, and finance.

The southernmost counties of Scotland, nearest the border with [[England]], are also known as the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]]. They are sometimes considered separately from the rest of the Lowlands. Many ancestors of the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]], as they are known in the United States, or [[Ulster-Scots]], originated from the lowlands and borders region before migrating to the [[Ulster Plantation]] in the 17th century and later the American frontier, many prior to the [[American Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The term Scottish Lowlands is used with reference to the [[Scots language]] in contrast to the [[Scottish Gaelic]] spoken in the Highlands, although historically also in parts of the lowlands, [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]] and the [[Scottish clan]] system, as well as in family history and [[genealogy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Despite Scotland often being regarded as a [[Celtic nations|Celtic nation]], the Scottish Lowlands and its inhabitants have long been noted as having a predominantly  [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] population. The areas of modern-day [[Edinburgh]], Midlothian, East Lothian, and the Scottish Borders were heavily settled in the 6th century by Germanic groups like the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and were also subject to the kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]]. Other Germanic groups like the [[Flemish]], [[Frisians]], and [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavians]] are known to have migrated in large numbers to the Scottish Lowlands and its major towns and cities, as did many English settlers in the post-Conquest period. From here the English language of these Lowland 'Scots' eventually spread throughout the rest of Scotland, replacing the use of Scottish Gaelic in many areas.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7271">The '''Sensor Observation Service''' (SOS) is a web service to query real-time sensor data and sensor data time series and is part of the [[Sensor Web]]. The offered sensor data comprises descriptions of sensors themselves, which are encoded in the Sensor Model Language ([[SensorML]]), and the measured values in the [[Observations and Measurements]] (O &amp; M) encoding format. The web service as well as both file formats are open standards and specifications of the same name defined by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC).

If the SOS supports the transactional profile (SOS-T), new sensors can be registered on the service interface and measuring values be inserted. A SOS implementation can be used both for data from in-situ as well as remote sensing sensors. Furthermore, the sensors can be either mobile or stationary.

Since 2007,&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=26667&lt;/ref&gt; the SOS is an official [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] standard. The advantage of the SOS is that sensor data - of any kind - is available in a standardized format using standardized operations. Thus the web-based access to sensor data is simplified. It also allows easy integration into existing [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]]s or [[Geographic Information Systems]].

In 2016 [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] approved the [[SensorThings API]] standard specification, a new RESTful and JSON-based standard provide functions similar to SOS. As both [[SensorThings API]] and SOS are based on the [[Observations and Measurements|OGC/ISO 19156:2011]], the two specifications have been demonstrated in an OGC IoT pilot that they can interoperate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/imisiot&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

The SOS has three so-called ''core operations'' that must be provided by each implementation. The ''GetCapabilities'' operation allows you to query a service for a description of the service interface and the available sensor data. For using the SOS, the ''GetObservation'' function is probably the most important. It can be utilized to retrieve data for specific sensors. The ''DescribeSensor'' function returns detailed information about a sensor or a sensor system and the producing processes.

=== Core operations (core profile) ===

* '''GetCapabilities''' returns an [[XML]] service description with information about the interface (offered operations and endpoints) as well as the available sensor data, such as the period for which sensor data is available, sensors that produce the measured values, or phenomena that are observed (for example air temperature).
* '''GetObservation''' allows pull-based querying of observed values, including their metadata. The measured values and their metadata is returned in the [[Observations and Measurements]] format (O &amp; M).
* '''DescribeSensor''' - provides sensor metadata in [[SensorML]]. The sensor description can contain information about the sensor in general, the identifier and classification, position and observed phenomena, but also details such as calibration data.

=== Transactional operations (transactional profile) ===

* '''RegisterSensor''' allows to register a new sensor in an deployed SOS.
* '''InsertObservation''' can be used to insert data for already registered sensors in the SOS.

=== Extended operations (enhanced profile) ===

* '''GetResult''' provides the ability to query for sensor readings without the metadata given consistent metadata (e.g. sensor, observed object).
* '''GetFeatureOfInterest''' returns the geoobject whose properties are monitored by sensors in [[Geography Markup Language]] encoding.
* '''GetFeatureOfInterestTime''' provides time periods in which measurements of an observed object in the SOS are available.
* '''DescribeFeatureType''' returns the type of the observed geoobjects ([[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]])
* '''DescribeObservationType''' returns the type of observation ([[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]), such as om: Measurement).
* '''GetObservationById''' allows to query a specific observation using an identifier returned by the service as response to an ''InsertObservation'' operation.
* '''DescribeResultModel''' provides the [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] of the measured value, which is particularly important for complex measurements, such as multi-spectral data.

== Terminology ==

The OGC has - not only for the SOS - its own well-defined terminology. For better understanding, here are some important terms:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Term !! Description
|-
| Feature of interest (FOI) || The ~ represents the geoobject who is subject to the measured values and is measured by sensors. The FOI is usually the means of locating (geocoding) the measuring points, i.e. the geoobject has coordinates (for example latitude, longitude and altitude). It depends very much on the project and must be chosen depending on the task at hand.
|-
| Observation || An ~ gives a measurement (result) for the property (Phenomenon) of an object under observation (FOI). The value itself is generated by a sensor or by procedures (procedure). Furthermore, the phenomenon was detected at a particular time (sampling time) and generated the value at a particular time (Result Time). Often these two time values are consistent, so in practice the sampling time is used as the time of observation.
|-
| Offering || An ~ is a logical grouping of observations that are related to each other, which are jointly offered by a service.
|-
| Phenomenon|| A ~ is a property (physical quantity) of a geoobject. Examples are air temperature, wind velocity, pollutant concentration of the atmosphere, reflected radiation in certain frequency band, et cetera.
|-
| Procedure || A ~ produces the measured value of an observation. This can be done by reading a sensor, or a numerical simulation process.
|-
| [[In situ]] || ~ is the [[Latin]] term for "on the spot."
|}

== Software ==

The SOS is a standard of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] and ultimately only defines a service interface, but not an implementation. There are currently several [[Open Source]] implementations of the service:

* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] SOS implementation by 52°North&lt;ref&gt;http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/sos/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] SOS implementation within the [[deegree]] framework by the company lat/lon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deegree.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[C (programming language)|C]] implementation of SOS in [[MapServer]]
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] implementations by the project OOSTethys&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oostethys.org/downloads&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Python (programming language)|Python]] implementation as istSOS&lt;ref&gt;http://istsos.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, proprietary implementations exist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/byspec&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soochipara Falls''' also known as '''Sentinel Rock Waterfalls''' is a three-tiered waterfall in Vellarimala, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], India. It is surrounded by [[deciduous]], [[evergreen]] and [[montane]] forests. Locally referred to as Soochipara ("Soochi" meaning "Needle" and "Para" meaning "Rock"), the 15-20 minute drive from Meppadi to Sentinel Rock Waterfalls has views of a number of Wayanad's tea estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Waterfalls|url=http://www.keralatourism.org/wayanad/waterfalls-wayanad.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is 200 metres (656&amp;nbsp;feet) and offers a cliff face that is used for rock climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Once people reach the parking area, they have to pass through a security check at the entrance where they make sure you don't carry any plastic. It takes 10-15 minutes walk to the waterfalls and water flow is less during summer, which makes it easy to reach the rocks where water falls.

The '''State Plane Coordinate System''' ('''SPS''' or '''SPCS''') is a set of 124 geographic zones or [[coordinate system]]s designed for specific regions of the United States.  Each state contains one or more state plane zones, the boundaries of which usually follow county lines.  There are 110 zones in the contiguous US, with 10 more in Alaska, 5 in Hawaii, and one for Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands. The system is widely used for [[geographic data]] by state and local governments.  Its popularity is due to at least two factors.  First, it uses a simple [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to specify locations rather than a more complex [[spherical coordinate system]] (the [[geographic coordinate system]] of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]).  By using the Cartesian coordinate system's simple XY coordinates, "plane surveying" methods can be used, speeding up and simplifying calculations.  Second, the system is highly accurate within each zone (error less than 1:10,000).  Outside a specific state plane zone accuracy rapidly declines, thus the system is not useful for regional or national mapping.

Most state plane zones are based on either a [[transverse Mercator projection]] or a [[Lambert conformal conic projection]].  The choice between the two [[map projection]]s is based on the shape of the state and its zones.  States that are long in the east–west direction are typically divided into zones that are also long east–west.  These zones use the [[Lambert conformal conic projection]], because it is good at maintaining accuracy along an east–west axis, due to the projection cone intersecting the earth's surface along two lines of latitude.  Zones that are long in the north–south direction use the [[Transverse Mercator projection]] because it is better at maintaining accuracy along a north–south axis, due to the circumference of the projection cylinder being oriented along a meridian of longitude.  The panhandle of Alaska, whose maximum dimension is on a diagonal, uses an Oblique Mercator projection, which minimizes the combined error in the X and Y directions.

==History==
In 1933, the [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] asked the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] to assist in creating a comprehensive method for converting curvilinear coordinates (latitude and longitude) to a user-friendly, 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This request developed into the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), which is now the most widely used expression of coordinate information in local and regional surveying and mapping applications in the United States and its territories (Doyle, ''Professional Surveyor Magazine'', January 2004 [https://archives.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1180 link]).  It has been revised several times since then.  When computers began to be used for mapping and [[Geographic information system|GIS]], the state plane system's cartesian grid system and simplified calculations made spatial processing faster and spatial data easier to work with.

Even though computer processing power has improved radically since the early days of GIS, the size of spatial datasets and the complexity of geoprocessing tasks being demanded of computers have also increased.  Thus the state plane coordinate system is still useful.  

Originally, the state plane coordinate systems were based on the [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD27).  Later, the more accurate North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) became the standard (a [[geodetic datum]] is the way a coordinate system is linked to the physical Earth).  More recently there has been an effort to increase the accuracy of the NAD83 datum using technology that was not available in 1983.  These efforts are known as "High Accuracy Reference Network" (HARN) or "High Precision GPS Network" (HPGN).  In addition, the basic unit of distance used is sometimes feet and sometimes meters.  Thus a fully described coordinate system often looks something like: "Washington State Plane North, NAD83 HARN, US Survey feet".  This information is needed in order to accurately transform data from one coordinate system to another.

==Problems==
The main problem with the state plane coordinate system is that each zone uses a different coordinate system.  This is not a major problem as long as one's needs are within the boundaries of a given state plane zone, as is the case with most county and city governments.  However, the need to transform spatial data from one coordinate system to another can be burdensome.  Sometimes a regional area of interest — such as a metropolitan area covering several counties — crosses a state plane zone boundary.  The [[Seattle metropolitan area]] is an example of this.  [[King County, Washington|King County]], which includes the [[Seattle, Washington|City of Seattle]], uses the "Washington State Plane North" coordinate system, while [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]], which includes the [[Tacoma, Washington|City of Tacoma]], uses "Washington State Plane South".  Thus any regional agency that wants to combine regional data from local governments has to transform at least some data into a common coordinate system.

The [[Republic of the Congo]] is divided into 12 [[Departments of the Republic of the Congo|''départements'']] (départements). Departments are divided into communes and/or districts.&lt;ref&gt;With inconsistent figures: 
* The [http://www.presidence.cg/congo/administration.php site of the Presidency of the Republic of Congo] lists 11 departments, 7 communes, and 76 districts.
* The 2004 [http://www.cnsee.org/Publication/Annuaire_04.pdf Statistical directory of Congo] lists 12 departments, 6 communes, and 85 districts
* A list of subprefects (higher representatives of State in a district) nominated in December 2008 lists 86 districts.

* Finally, the good figures seem to come from [http://www.congo-siteportail.info/Les-donnees-generales-sur-le-Congo_a18.html this site]: 12 departments, 7 communes, and 86 districts&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telephone numbers in the [[State of Palestine]]''' The [[Country calling code|Country Code]] +970 is reserved for [[Palestinian territory |Palestine]].

This code is mainly used when calling from Arab countries to places under the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian Authority]] (including the [[Gaza Strip]]). The telecommunication system in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] is considerably dependent on the Israeli infrastructure, therefore, from most countries, dialing [[Telephone numbers in Israel|+972]] would often be the better option to access phone numbers in the Palestinian territories. In some cases, when the number was allocated directly by an Israeli company, this would be the only option. However, from many Arab or Muslim countries that block the Israeli access code, dialing 970 is the only option to access the Palestinian telecommunication system. [[Syria]] is currently the only country that blocks both 972 and 970 access codes. [[Lebanon]] lifted the ban on the 970 code in July 2008 but still blocks the 972 code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/4331-operator-please-dear-get-me-palestine-and-hurry-please 'Operator? Please dear, get me Palestine, and hurry up please!']&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinians use the [[Telephone numbers in Israel|Israeli telecommunication infrastructure]] either directly or through the Palestinian [[Paltel]] company, which allocates numbers reserved for it by the Israeli Ministry of Communications.
The 059 prefix is reserved exclusively for the Palestinian [[Jawwal]] cellular communication company (a subsidiary of Paltel), and the 056 prefix is similarly reserved for the [[Wataniya Telecom]] company. Note that these prefixes had been used in the past as Israeli internal dialing prefixes, but were replaced or merged with other dialing codes, and reintroduced for the exclusive use of the Palestinian telecommunication system.

The activities of UNEP-WCMC include biodiversity assessment, support to international conventions such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), capacity building and management of both aspatial and spatial data on species and habitats of conservation concern.  UNEP-WCMC has a mandate to facilitate the delivery of the global indicators under the CBD's [[2010 Biodiversity Target]] on the rate of loss of biological diversity, and works alongside the CITES Secretariat  producing a range of reports and databases. It also manages the World Database of Protected Areas in collaboration with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[World Commission on Protected Areas]].  A series of world atlases on biodiversity topics have been published by UNEP-WCMC through [[University of California Press]]. UNEP-WCMC has expertise across six thematic areas: Mainstreaming biodiversity into sustainable development; Strengthening natural capital in private sector decision-making; Planning for places; Securing a sustainable future for wildlife; Supporting the transition to a healthy ocean and; Supporting intergovernmental agreements on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 

These thematic areas are supported by cross-cutting expertise in science, economics, knowledge management and digital innovation. &lt;ref&gt;UNEP-WCMC (2018) Annual Review 2017-18. UNEP-WCMC, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
