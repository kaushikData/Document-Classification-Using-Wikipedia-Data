'''''A Summer in the Cage''''' is a 2007 documentary film about a man's experiences with [[bipolar disorder]]. The film follows the filmmaker's friend Sam and features an interview with mental health scholar [[Kay Redfield Jamison]]. It was directed by Benjamin Selkow. The documentary debuted on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] in 2007.

== Synopsis ==
''A Summer in the Cage'' is filmmaker Ben Selkow's feature-length documentary chronicling his friend Sam's battle with manic-depressive illness. The film follows Sam for seven years as he suffers delusional manic episodes, battles paralyzing depressions, and tries to escape the legacy of his bipolar father who committed suicide when Sam was eight years old. By showing the difficult emotional impact of being bipolar on Sam, his family, and the filmmaker, ''A Summer in the Cage'' puts a human face on an illness that affects millions of American families. But as this dramatic story unfolds and finally reaches an explosive standoff, it also becomes a unique tale about friendship and the ethical responsibilities of a documentary filmmaker.

'''Abortion in Afghanistan''' is affected by the religious constraints from the national religion, [[Islam in Afghanistan|Islam]], and by the extremely high birthrates in Afghanistan. [[Afghanistan]] has one of the highest fertility rates, but its levels are decreasing since the fall of the Taliban, as aid workers can now enter the country to help with fertility and decrease mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/24/afghanistan-fertility-rate-declines/1824009/|title=Fertility rate drops in Afghanistan, but will it continue?|last1=Nasser|first1=Haya El|last2=Overberg|first2=Paul|website=USA Today|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[abortion]] is the deliberate termination of an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, but women and couples have other reasons to perform them as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bpas.org/abortion-care/considering-abortion/what-is-abortion/|title=What is Abortion? {{!}} BPAS|website=www.bpas.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion|title=Should I Get An Abortion? {{!}} Information to Help You Decide|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan law is influenced by [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which comes from the religious text the [[Quran|Qur’an]], which Muslims believe comes from God.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These laws state that abortion is only legal if it is performed to save the life of the mother or if the child is going to be born with a severe [[Foetal impairment|disability]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/afghan-women-use-abortion-as-a-way-out/a-17612865|title=Afghan women use abortion as a way out|last1=Hasrat-Nazimi|first1=Waslat|website=DW Made for Minds|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation fo Islamic law is based in Islamic medicine, as Muslims cherish the sanctity of human life and believe God does not cause harm or illnesses that are incurable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review|date=2001|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|pages=17–18|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these constraints, women choose either to pursue an abortion illegally or be shunned by society due to a pregnancy outside of the socially accepted norms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Contraception is approved by Islam when it prevents the formation of the [[zygote]] and prevents implantation in the uterus.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Athat|first1=Shahidi|title=Islam and Abortion|journal=Islamic Horizons|volume=45|issue=4|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Birthrates &amp; fertility==

Afghanistan has one of the highest [[Demographics of Afghanistan#Fertility and Births|fertility rates]] in the world, with very few women actively using contraceptive methods, despite support from the government and conformance with religious ethics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only 22.5% of people utilize contraceptive measures in comparison to the United States, where 74.1% of people utilize contraception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html|title=The World Factbook: Afghanistan|website=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the average woman had 8 children throughout her lifetime, but this decreased in the mid-2000s to 6.,1 with hopes to hit an average of 5 births per woman by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since the [[Taliban|Taliban's]] fall in 2001, fertility levels are decreasing, stemming from the Taliban's belief in not educating girls, child brides, and not providing healthcare for women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The decreased presence of the Taliban has allowed an entrance of aid workers to the country to provide educational funding for schools, family planning, and more access to birth control. The uncontrolled high fertility rates make it difficult for Afghanistan to manage the poverty levels and improve other social conditions which leaves a high dependence on aid from other countries. High fertility rates cause high birthrates, which contribute to the high fetal mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/24/afghan-babies-have-been-dying-in-huge-numbers-for-decades-now-something-is-changing/?noredirect=on|title=Afghan babies have been dying in huge numbers for decades. Now, something is changing.|last1=Constable|first1=Pamela|website=World Views|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan has the highest fetal mortality rate in the world, with 110.6 deaths per 1000 births.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mothers are also 19.9 years old on average at her first birth. As access to education across Afghanistan is increasing due to the fall of the Taliban, the fetal mortality rate is also decreasing. In rural areas the mortality rate still remains high, but aid workers are being sent to many regions of the country after receiving training on deliveries and care for newborns.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/26/human-toll-abortion-afghanistan|title='I Am a Criminal. What is My Crime?': the Human Toll of Abortion in Afghanistan|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Sune|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===

An important aspect of abortion is the stage of the cells in the womb. The cells have many different names at the different stages they pass through, and the stage affects the acceptability of the procedure. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development Prenatal Development] outlines these different stages. From conception, when the sperm and egg fuse in the fallopian tube, until week 5 of the pregnancy, it is referred to as the zygote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stöppler|first1=Melissa|last2=Cunha|first2=John|title=Embryo vs. Fetus: Differences between Stages Week by Week|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/embryo_vs_fetus_differences_week-by-week/article.htm#your_first_prenatal_visit_with_your_doctor_or_midwife|website=MedicineNet.com|publisher=MedicineNet|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From week 5 until week 10 of the pregnancy, it is referred to as an embryo. At week 10 in the pregnancy, the embryo becomes a fetus and development of all organ systems and body parts begins. At around the 38-40th week, a fully developed baby will be born. For Islam followers, once the cells reach the zygote stage abortions are no longer acceptable.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; But contraceptive methods are acceptable if the formation of the zygote is prevented.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Religious limitations==

[[Sharia|Islamic law]] comes from the Qur'an, which they believe comes from God and Muslims use it to dictate their every day actions. The religious laws of Islam dictate strict policies on gender interactions. One of these requirements is that women use a female gynecologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-rulings-medical-issues-sayyid-ali-khamenei/rules-regarding-looking-touching-and-examining|title=Rules Regarding Looking, Touching and Examining|website=Al-Islam.org|publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic rule says that males in the medical field should only treat females if there are no other females in the field to care for them. Women are more likely to seek care from a female gynecologist to conform to their religious convictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A suggested improvement is to increase the number of female doctors in Afghanistan to encourage seeking professional help rather than nonprofessional help.

Islamic medicine ideals are based on the sanctity of human life, which states that God created humans and did not create diseases or other ailments that do not have cures or other solutions that humans have the ability to discover.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Muslim teachings say that human life begins at conception because the fetus is able to perform actions within the womb that humans outside of the womb are able to perform, such as movement and digestion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This means that the fetus has a soul. This means that the fetus has rights, which the mother is responsible for protecting until delivery. This leads to the overriding belief that abortion should be avoided whenever possible.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowen|first1=Donna Lee|title=Abortion, Islam, and the 1994 Cairo Population Conference|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=161–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any action that would take away the soul of the fetus is illegal. This includes a pregnant mother being murdered leading to the murderer being tried for both deaths; or if the father dies while the mother is pregnant the estate will not be divided until the birth of the child, because the fetus has rights to the estate and the father's inheritances.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, in cases of rape, abortion is not permitted because one crime cannot be solved with another crime, and having an abortion for reasons other than the health of the mother and the baby is considered a crime. If a fetus is predicted to die right after birth, the mother and the father must make the decision, considering all factors, that they feel aligns best with the Qur'an.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Islam approves certain forms of [[Birth control|contraception]] as well. Contraceptive methods are acceptable when they prevent ovulation and formation of the zygote.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once the zygote has formed, which means the egg and the sperm have fused, it is considered a human life and thus is protected as such. Ethicists believe that the proper use of contraceptives prevents the need for abortion and the consideration of the moral dilemma.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Stigmatization of abortions===

Due to the religious views on abortion, society stigmatizes the women who receive abortions. Many women account that they are stuck deciding between whether to have an abortion or have a child outside of marriage, both of which cause them to be ostracized from society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some reasons that lead women to pursue abortions to avoid being ostracized include drug and/or alcohol addicted husbands, poverty, and being single. Due to the constraints that the government places on access to abortions, women must pursue abortion through illegal means to avoid being shunned by their families or punished criminally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The culture in Afghanistan developed both from the government and religion, makes women believe that it is their job to have children. This social role for women does not take into account that Afghanistan has an extremely high birthrate, ranked 12th in the world, with little access to education on family planning and contraceptive usage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Current legislation==

Afghan legislation is based heavily in Islam, with the preamble of their constitution referencing Allah.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afghanembassy.us/about-afghanistan/constitution/|title=The Constitution ::: Embassy of Afghanistan|website=www.afghanembassy.us|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of Chapter 1 outlines that no law in Afghanistan should contradict Islam.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission]] was created to protect human rights and as a response to [[Shia Personal Status Law|Shia Family Law]], which violates human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihrc.org.af/home/press_release/6865|title=Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission|website=www.aihrc.org.af|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~jasin20s/classweb/Introduction.html|title=The Shia Family Law|website=www.mtholyoke.edu|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy influence of religious beliefs on the law leads to strict laws surrounding abortion. Chapter 4 of the [[Law of Afghanistan|Afghanistan Penal Code]] outlines the consequences for performing abortions. It states that abortions outside of saving the life of the mother or if the babies life is endanger, interpreted as a severe disability or low quality of life, are illegal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Article 402 says that anyone who purposefully kills a fetus will be sentenced to no more than 7 years in prison. Article 403 says that anyone who performs the abortion will either be imprisoned or fined up to approximately 12,000 Afghanis ($165USD). If the person performing the abortion is a doctor they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tfafordblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/abortion-in-afghanistan/|title=Abortion in Afghanistan|website=Women In Afghanistan|publisher=Word Press|accessdate=23 May 2018|date=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to abortions==
 
Few legal cases allow women to seek abortion care. Women are able to get an abortion when their life is endangered by the pregnancy, or if the baby will be born with [[Fetal viability|severe deformities or disabilities]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Religious ethical committees must rule on the ethics and legality of the abortion before it can be carried out.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After ethical approval of the abortion, the woman must obtain approval from a gynecologist, three general practitioners, a counselor, and permission of the doctor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One additional situation that occasionally allows abortion to occur is due to poverty. This is especially prominent in areas that the Taliban is still present in. Within Taliban controlled areas, poverty based abortions are generally approved more often because they have too many children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Women often pursue abortions through illegal means because of the few cases that allow abortions legally. They believe it is necessary in order to avoid shame from their husbands, families, and society. This leads women to having to fund the abortion themselves, which can be difficult because of the social norm that implies that it is women's job to have children and thus they don't have jobs outside of taking care of the house and the family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many women would prefer not to have children, but lack knowledge of how to limit the number of children they have outside of use of abortions. When pursuing abortions, they many times need to use uneducated midwives who don't know how to properly perform the procedure or deal with complications. Another option they have is to use expensive private clinics, which leads to the issue of funding the expenditure. Since women are typically unemployed, rounding up the funds for an abortion can be difficult. The price of an abortion has decreased from 250,000 Afghanis (US$3,500) to 17,500 Afghanis (US$250).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This decrease has been seen because of the increasing need of abortions. But the price is still 15,000 Afghani (US$150) higher than the average price of an [[abortion in the United States]], where abortions are legal and generally publicly accepted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Safety of the procedure===

Afghanistan is in the top 16 worldwide for the highest mortality rate from [[Unsafe abortion|abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ansari|first1=Nasratullah|title=Assessing Post-Abortion Care in Health Facilities in Afghanistan: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|date=February 2015|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Afghanistan#Health|healthcare system in Afghanistan]] is also not at a level to properly care for pregnant mothers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Every 2 hours there is a pregnancy-related death in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The high maternal mortality is due to lack of post procedure care. Although the procedure is illegal in most cases, women still pursue abortions, motivating aid workers to make it safer. International aid workers are working to improve the safety of the procedures by educating [[Midwife|midwives]] and nurses about how to improve care for their patients and limit the mortality of the procedure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Aid workers hope to decrease the stigma surrounding the procedure so that there is lower mortality.

The '''Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program''' (AVIP), is the name of the policy set forth by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] to immunize its [[Military of the United States|military]] and certain civilian personnel with the ''[[BioThrax]]'' [[anthrax vaccine]].  It began in earnest in 1997 by the [[Clinton administration#Second Term (1997–2001)|Clinton administration]].  Thereafter it ran into [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and judicial obstacles (mainly concerning the methods and viability of the vaccine manufactured by [[Bioport|BioPort]], a subsidiary of [[Emergent BioSolutions]] Inc.). Over 8 million doses of ''BioThrax'' were administered to over 2 million U.S. military personnel as part of the program between March 1998 and June 2008.

==History==
===1990s===
In 1998, the Clinton administration required the inoculation of all military members with the anthrax vaccine known as [[Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed]] (AVA) and by the trade name ''BioThrax''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/1998/b05221998_bt255-98.html ''DoD Press Release'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrax.osd.mil/ ''DoD AVIP Website'']&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the DoD halted vaccinations due to non-FDA approved changes in BioPort's manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,SS_102004_Anthrax,00.html ''Military.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 at [[Offutt Air Force Base]], the first ever Anthrax refusal court-martial in the [[United States Air Force]] was prosecuted. In the case of U.S. v. Bickley, Captain Jeffrey A. Lustick, USAF, prosecuted an airman's refusal to submit to the immunization. The airman was convicted and later administratively separated from the U.S. Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richmond|first1=Mike, Capt.|title=Airman convicted in anthrax court-martial|url=http://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/news99/n19990423_990759.htm|website=Air Force News|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
On October 15, 2001, military members filed a FDA Citizen Petition highlighting the fact that the license for AVA had never formally been finalized by the FDA in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR § 10.30 as Docket # 01P-0471.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/01/Oct01/101501/101501.htm#_Toc527850400 ''FDA Citizen Petition, Docket 01P-0471'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Petition was later utilized as the foundational basis for a Preliminary [[Injunction]] by a Federal Court to temporarily halt the program  [''Doe v. Rumsfeld'', 297 F. Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2003)].

On June 28, 2002, in the wake of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] and leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], all military personnel were required to receive AVA in addition to their other vaccinations of [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2002/n06282002_200206283.html ''DoD News Article'']&lt;/ref&gt; The military does give this vaccination regularly as well as [[Japanese encephalitis]] (JEV) when the service member is to be deployed to Southeast Asia, and other vaccines such as pneumococcal, [[tetanus]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaccines.mil/documents/969r40_562.pdf ''DoD Vaccines.mil Website''])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While some military personnel had questions about the safety of the vaccine, it was considered a lawful order at that time, and this made refusing the vaccine at peril of the subordinate, including possible discharge (i.e., losing their job and any benefits depending on the type of discharge).  This pressure, at least for the National Guard and Reserve pilots and crewmembers, became a deciding retention factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02445.pdf ''"Anthrax Vaccine, GEO's Survey of Guard and Reserve Pilots and Aircrew"] United States General Accounting Office Report to Congressional Requesters. Sept. 2002.  GAO-02-445''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, the DOD made it policy to include any personnel spending 15 days or more in high anthrax-risk areas, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0206e&amp;L=safety&amp;D=1&amp;P=860 Pentagon shifts Anthrax vaccine to civilian uses"]  James Dao with Judith Miller, June 29, 2002.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2003, Judge [[Emmet G. Sullivan]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] ruled that the Department of Defense could not force military personnel to take the vaccine unless through a special order by the president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/22/national/main589812.shtml ''"Judge: U.S. Can't Force Vaccines," CBS News, Dec. 22, 2003'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, for about 8 days in (October 20–28), anthrax vaccinations were resumed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,SS_102004_Anthrax,00.html "Pentagon Says 200,000 Who Started Anthrax-Shot Regimen Must Continue" ''Sandra Jontz, Stars and Stripes European Edition, October 20, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; but then an injunction against mandatory vaccination was filed on the basis that AVA was not proven to work against inhalation anthrax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrax.mil/documents/library/AnthraxSJtOrder_Op.pdf ''DC District Court Permanent Injunction on Summary Judgment, Oct 27, 2004''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825005302/http://www.anthrax.mil/documents/library/AnthraxSJtOrder_Op.pdf |date=August 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ruling held that the mandatory program was illegal. The DoD was now required to either let the individual member choose under an [[informed consent]] policy, or allowed the president to bypass this requirement by executive order (''Doe v. Rumsfeld'', 341 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2004)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,FL_anthrax_102804,00.html "Anthrax Vaccinations Halted Again" United Press International, October 28, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt;  For military members who had started the vaccination (which usually takes build-up and booster shots), they tended to continue the vaccination program under informed consent.  For those who had a choice, they usually decided against it.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulfwarvets.com/voluntary_anthrax1.htm "Troops divided on getting voluntary vaccine shots" ''GulfWarVets.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Deborah Funk, July 25, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcetimes.com/ AF Times ''AF Times Article'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The government stated that they will resume the vaccination program under informed consent in April 2005.

On December 15, 2005, the FDA re-issued a Final Rule &amp; Order&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/bvactoxanth.htm Department of Health and Human Services,  Food and Drug Administration.]&lt;br&gt;Docket No. 1980N-0208&lt;br&gt;Biological Products; Bacterial Vaccines and Toxoids; Implementation of Efficacy Review; Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed; Final Order.&lt;br&gt;AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Notice.&lt;/ref&gt; on the license status of AVA, clearing the way for mandatory vaccination reinstatement. After reviewing extensive scientific evidence and carefully considering comments from the public, the FDA again determined that the vaccine is licensed for the prevention of anthrax, regardless of the route of exposure. Pertaining to the previous ruling, the DC District Federal Appeals Court declined to vacate or overturn the injunction in 2006, instead mooting the case based on the FDA’s new 2005 licensing of the vaccine.[''Doe v. Rumsfeld'', 127 Fed. App’x 327 (D.C. Cir. 2006)]

On October 16, 2006 the military announced intentions to resume vaccinations for select personnel again, but the vaccinations remained voluntary until further guidance by the DoD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngms.state.ms.us/publicaffairs/Cmd%20Info%20Articles/pentagon_to_resume_anthrax_inocu.htm Pentagon to Resume Anthrax Inoculations."]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Lolita C. Baldor, Monday, October 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The DoD's official resumption status of the program awaited publication of service messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrax.mil ''DoD's official anthrax vaccine immunization program website'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2006, a new [[class-action]] lawsuit,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121201454.html "Defense Employees Set For Another Suit to Halt Mandatory Anthrax Shots."]  Josh White, Wednesday, December 13, 2006; Page A19.&lt;/ref&gt; filed on behalf of six unnamed plaintiffs, revived the legal battle over the military’s mandatory anthrax immunization program.  According to court documents, the basic premise of the lawsuit is the plaintiffs’ claim that the vaccine is “unapproved for its applied/intended use”. The lawsuit says that “plaintiffs will suffer substantial and irreparable injury if they are forced to take the vaccine”, which the suit says has not been properly approved by the government, despite the FDA issuing its “final rule” on the vaccine on December 15, 2005. The suit also says the DOD has failed to follow presidential orders and federal laws that require the government to obtain informed consent before giving an unapproved and experimental vaccine to anyone.

On February 8, 2007, the military has resumed mandatory vaccinations of certain troops.  Specific policies and troop selection varies according to branch of service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrax.osd.mil/resource/policies/policies.asp Current Policies on DoD Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2007, the original court affirmed that the AVIP was not substantially justified prior to the consequent FDA licensure and requisite rule making for the vaccine in December 2005. The Court ultimately granted “prevailing party” status for the plaintiffs against defendants DoD and FDA [Doe v. Rumsfeld, 501 F. Supp. 2d 186, 188 (D.D.C. 2007)].

By March 2008, a different Federal Judge affirmed the prior ruling in its opinion regarding corrections of records writing, “Taken as a whole, Judge Sullivan’s decisions in ''Doe v. Rumsfeld'' conclude that, prior to the FDA’s December 2005 rulemaking, it was a violation of federal law for military personnel to be subjected to involuntary AVA inoculation because the vaccine was neither the subject of a presidential waiver nor licensed for use against inhalation anthrax.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv2350-31 ''DC District Court Remand to the USAF Board for Correction of Military Records'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 6, 2008, an FBI press briefing theorized that the "failing" anthrax vaccine immunization program led as the primary motivator in the fall 2001 anthrax letter attacks allegedly perpetrated by U.S. Army scientist Bruce Ivins. FBI documents reveal the FDA "suspended further production" of anthrax vaccine just prior to the attacks (Ivins' emails and FBI analysis available on pp.&amp;nbsp;12–16 of affidavit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/amerithrax/docs/07-524-m-01.pdf ''FBI Affidavit Documents in Amerithrax Case''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206121845/http://www.usdoj.gov/amerithrax/docs/07-524-m-01.pdf |date=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failed potency tests prevented FDA approval. FBI released emails by Ivins showing the vaccine "isn’t passing the potency test" and that "no approved lots" were available just prior to the letter attacks.  The FBI explained Ivins' involvement with the failed potency tests.  FBI affidavits also documented Ivins receiving the highest Defense Department honors for "getting the anthrax vaccine back into production". The U.S. Department of Justice press statements theorized Ivins’ anthrax letter attack motive:  "by launching these attacks, he creates a situation, a scenario, where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/August/08-opa-697.html ''Department of Justice Press Release in Amerithrax Investigation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2008, [[Michael O. Leavitt]], Secretary of Health and Human Services, declared a need "to provide targeted liability protections for anthrax countermeasures" because "I have determined there is a credible risk that the threat of exposure of ''B. anthracis'' and the resulting disease constitutes a public health emergency" until the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/disasters/emergency/manmadedisasters/bioterorism/prepact-081001.html ''HHS PREP Act Declaration'', Oct. 1, 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017053948/http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/emergency/manmadedisasters/bioterorism/prepact-081001.html |date=October 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent BioSolutions immediately prepared to supply 14.5 million doses of anthrax vaccine by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122286877254994109?mod=googlewsj Wall Street Journal online: SHIRLEEN DORMAN, ''Emergent BioSolutions Agrees To Supply More Anthrax Vaccine'' , OCTOBER 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
On February 19, 2010, the FBI released its final summary on the [[Amerithrax]] investigation. The "motive", according to the FBI, was detailed on page 8 of the report:  "Motive. According to his e-mails and statements to friends, in the months leading up to the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001, Dr. Ivins was under intense personal and professional pressure. The anthrax vaccine program to which he had devoted his entire career of more than 20 years was failing. The anthrax vaccines were receiving criticism in several scientific circles, because of both potency problems and allegations that the anthrax vaccine contributed to [[Gulf War Syndrome|Gulf War syndrome]]. Short of some major breakthrough or intervention, he feared that the vaccine research program was going to be discontinued. Following the anthrax attacks, however, his program was suddenly rejuvenated."  The FBI continued on page 39 finding, "within a few months of the anthrax attacks, the FDA fast-tracked the approval process and approved the Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (“AVA”), even though it didn't meet the original potency standards. This was a significant development for the anthrax researchers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf ''AMERITHRAX INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY'', Feb. 19, 2010.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528162603/http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the DOD has not announced a reevaluation of the AVIP, nor consideration of correcting the records of previously punished soldiers, in light of the above-mentioned legislative, legal and criminal findings related to the anthrax vaccine.

The '''Aqueduct of the Gier''' (French ''Aqueduc du Gier'')&lt;ref&gt;It was called the ''Aqueduct of Pilat'' when [[Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison]] visited it and inspected its dramatic remains in 1804 (Millin de Grandmaison, (tr.) ''Travels through the southern departments of France'' London, 1808:136f; the translator renders ''Pilat'' "Pila"&lt;/ref&gt;  is an ancient [[Roman aqueduct]] probably constructed in the 1st century AD to provide water for [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]), in what is now eastern [[France]]. It is the longest and best preserved of four  Roman aqueducts&lt;ref&gt;The others were the Mont d'Or, the Yzeron and the Brevenne aqueducts (L. Mays, ''Ancient Water Technologies'', 2010;132); the names, of course, are modern.&lt;/ref&gt; that served the growing capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]]. It drew its water from the source of the [[Gier (river)|Gier]], a small tributary of the [[Rhone]], on the slopes of [[Mont Pilat]], {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-west of Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;Distance in James Stephen Bromwich, ''The Roman remains of Northern and Eastern France: a guidebook'' 2003:420; Bromwich gives detailed instructions for viewing sections of the aqueduct system.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a sinuous path, at {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} the aqueduct of the Gier is the longest known of the Roman aqueducts. Its route has been retraced in detail, following the numerous remains. Leaving the uplands of the ''massif du Pilat'', [[department of the Loire]], the aqueduct hugs the surface relief and crosses the [[department of the Rhone]], passing through Mornant, Orliénas, Chaponost and Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon to terminate at Lyon.

In its extent, it draws upon the whole repertory of Roman techniques of aqueduct building, taking a slope that averages 0.1%, or a meter every kilometer. There are {{convert|73|km|mi|abbr=on}} of covered ditches laid with a concrete culvert {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, which is sunk as deep as {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} beneath the land surface. The aqueduct passes through 11 tunnels, one of which, near Mornant, is {{convert|825|m|ft|abbr=on}} in extent. Access for cleaning and repairs was through manholes at {{convert|77|m|ft|abbr=on}} distances. There are some thirty stretches in the open air. There are ten stretches raised on walls and  arches, which provide the most spectacular visible remains of the aqueduct (''illustrations''). 

Four  [[Siphon|inverted siphon]] tunnels cross the particularly deep and wide river valleys of the Durèze, the Garon,&lt;ref&gt;Here the siphon drops 21 m, the length of the crossing 208 m (Jean Pierre Adam and Anthony Mathews, ''Roman Building: materials and techniques'', 2003:244).&lt;/ref&gt; the Yzeron and the Trion on pipe bridges raised on high arches. In these, water filled a sunken tank tower (''castellum''&lt;ref&gt;The parts of a Roman aqueduct are illustrated and explained in Peter J. Aicher, ''Guide to the aqueducts of ancient Rome'', 1995 and A. Trevor Hodge, ''Roman Aqueducts &amp; Water Supply'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;) on the brim of a slope. The tank effected a transition between open channel flow and a lead pipeline. From the ''castellum'' water was carried, now pressurized, in a set of airtight lead pipes laid side by side, with [[solder]]ed joints, down the valley slope, across a bridge spanning the river—whose piers and arches are the most notable remains of the system—and up the facing slope, to a tank slightly lower than the head tank, losing just a little [[hydraulic head]] in the process. The inverted siphons obviated the bridging of deep valleys with arcade upon arcade of arches, as at [[Pont du Gard]], which marks the limit of such a system.

==Date==
The Gier aqueduct was built in a single great campaign, since no part of it could have served until it was completed; it must have taken years. The aqueduct of Giers was dated by Germain de Montauzon&lt;ref&gt;Montauzon, ''Les aqueducs antiques de Lyon'', 1909, refers to a Hadrianic inscription (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' XII 2494) at Chagnon, in effect a "no trespassing" notice to farmers who were in the practice of diverting water for irrigation. Within the limits Roman aqueduct zones were public property (Rabun Taylor, ''Public Needs and Private Pleasures: water distribution, the Tiber river and the urban development of ancient Rome'' 2000:57ff.&lt;/ref&gt; to the reign of [[Hadrian]] in the early 2nd century AD, but, as James Stephen Bromwich points out, its reticulated stonework (''[[opus reticulatum]]'') was characteristic of the later 1st century BC and the first half of the 1st century AD, rather than of later masonry.&lt;ref&gt;Date revision was suggested by Jeancolas,  ''JEAR'' 183, noted by Hodge 2002:435 note 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition he notes that a recently excavated public fountain on the hill of Fourvières, datable about 50 AD could not have been supplied with water until the Giers aqueduct was complete.

'''Arne Bjork''' (1911–1996) was a Swedish dentist famous for his ''The Face in Profile'' Analysis which he published in 1947. He is also known to develop the implant radiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Profitt|first1=William|title=Contemporary Orthodontics|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Dr. Bjork was born in [[Darlane]], Sweden. He received his dental training in [[Stockholm]]. He practiced dentistry from 1937 to 1951. He served as chairman of orthodontics in Malmo, Sweden from 1940-1950. He then served as Professor of Orthodontics in [[Royal Dental College]], Denmark. Eventually he became the head of Department of Orthodontics and head of Craniofacial Growth Center at the Royal Dental College for next 30 years. He was nominated as member of World Federations of Orthodontists in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Members|url=http://www.wfo.org/about-wfo/history/honorary-members/|website=World Federation of Orthodontists|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bjork was one of the first people to work on '''Implant Radiography'''. He along with his coworkers, placed metal pins in bones of jaws and other parts of skeleton. They then looked at these pins in a Cephalometric Analysis to assess the growth pattern of a growing individual. This technique was instrumental in providing a way to study the grown pattern of a human mandible.

Bjork also developed '''seven structural signs''' that helped find the direction of the growth of mandible, also known as '''Bjork Analysis'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lager|first1=H|title=Arne Bjork 60 years|journal=Tandlaegebladet|date=1971|pmid=4946246|volume=75|pages=1149–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">'''Biloma''' is collection of [[bile]] within the [[abdominal cavity]]. It happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for removing the [[gallbladder]] ([[laparoscopic cholecystectomy]]), with an incidence of 0.3–2%. Other causes are biliary surgery, [[liver biopsy]], [[abdominal trauma]], and, rarely, spontaneous perforation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Norton J. Greenberger et al. | chapter=Endoscopic Management of Acute Biliary &amp; Pancreatic Conditions | title=Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endoscopy | series=[[Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment]] | year=2009 | pages=355-356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms are usually diffused or localized [[abdominal pain]]. [[Ascites]] and [[peritonitis]] are less common. Fever is often absent. Blood tests may show [[leukocytosis]] and nonspecific [[liver test]] abnormalities.

Diagnosis is by [[abdominal ultrasound]], [[Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography|MRCP]], or [[HIDA scan]].

Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and ranges from [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] with [[sphincterotomy]] or [[stent]] placement to surgical [[hepaticojejunostomy]].

Encompass Health (formerly HealthSouth Corporation), based in Birmingham, Alabama, is one of the United States' largest providers of post-acute healthcare services, offering both facility-based and home-based post-acute services in 36 states and Puerto Rico through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies.[1] Effective January 2, 2018, the organization changed its name to Encompass Health Corporation and its New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol from HLS to EHC.[2]

==History==
Central Georgia Health System founded CareSouth on November 1, 1995 with the purchase of a large home healthcare company, which had a successful 25-year history. Two distinct lines of business evolved from CareSouth's infancy. The first was the direct delivery of patient care, and the second was the delivery of business services to others that owned homecare agencies.
 
In 1998 the executive management team, working with the Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm, Capitol Partners, acquired the company from Central Georgia Health System, which enabled both of CareSouth's business lines to grow.
 
CareSouth has been providing in-home care services to seniors across the Southeastern US for more than 20 years. Today, CareSouth maintains more than 60 offices across country with services including home health care, hospice, and private duty personal care services, as well as health and wellness services in select assisted living facilities. Additionally, CareSouth maintains joint ventures and partnerships in more than 20 locations.
 
It was announced on August 31, 2015, that CareSouth was to be purchased by [[HealthSouth Corporation]] for $170 million in cash.  HealthSouth would acquire CareSouth's home health locations, and leave the private duty locations, co-owned with LCS, a Des Moines, Iowa-based provider of senior lifestyle products and services.  These remaining locations would be rebranded under the name of Careity, effective fourth quarter 2015 and would take with it, the entire upper management structure.  The CareSouth brand would become part of HealthSouth, and fall under the management of Encompass Home Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150831/NEWS/150839984|title=HealthSouth acquires CareSouth|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.healthsouth.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2015/HealthSouth-Announces-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-CareSouth-Home-Health-Agency-Operations/default.aspx|title=Healthsouth Corp - HealthSouth Announces Definitive Agreement to Acquire CareSouth Home Health Agency Operations|website=investor.healthsouth.com|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2015/08/healthsouth_buys_caresouth_for.html|title=HealthSouth buys CareSouth for $170 million|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthsouth-acquires-caresouth-home-health-and-hospice-agency-operations-300170560.html|title=HealthSouth Acquires CareSouth Home Health and Hospice Agency Operations|last=Corporation|first=HealthSouth|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
In 2007, the company had more than $20 billion [[United States dollar|USD]] in assets.

==Key people==
Since the company was sold in 2015, CareSouth has fallen under the auspices of the Encompass Home Health leadership.  They include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehhi.com/our-people|title=Our People {{!}} Encompass Home Health|website=www.ehhi.com|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5814">'''Civil laws regarding [[kashrut]]''' ([[Jewish]] religious standards, [[kosher food|mainly concerning food]]) are found in several countries. Advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase ''kosher'' in a product's labelling, unless it can be shown that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, the legal qualifications for ''conforming'' to Jewish dietary laws are often defined differently in different jurisdictions. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the ''kashrut'' nature, in others the rules of ''kosher'' are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the term ''kosher'' have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark A. Berman, Kosher Fraud Statutes and the Establishment Clause: Are. They Kosher?, 26 COLUM. J.L. &amp; SOC. PROBS. 1, 28 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==

Historically, the statutes of some states in the United States&lt;ref&gt;specifically, [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], and [[Virginia]], as well as local ordinances in two counties in [[Florida]] and the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define ''kosher'', and make it a [[felony]] to sell a product which was called ''kosher'' if, in general, it was not processed in accordance with the Jewish religion.  However, challenges were made to such laws on the basis that they appear to be [[Lemon test|establishment of a religious practice]] by the states in question, which would constitute a violation of the [[US constitution|constitutional]] rule that there should be ''[[establishment clause|no law respecting an establishment of religion]]''. Although earlier courts upheld some of these laws, courts have since determined that the laws would establish religious practice, and therefore struck the laws down; opponents of this decision had attempted to argue that ''kashrut'' was simply a set of standards for food preparation, and therefore there would be no difference between labelling something as ''kashrut'' and labelling it as ''low sodium'', ''high-fiber'', ''pasteurised'', ''calcium-enriched'', or ''contains no cholesterol''. The legal rulings include:
*The ordinance of Baltimore City which created a kosher law being found to be unconstitutional&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.law.emory.edu/4circuit/oct95/941918.p.html Barghout v. Bureau of Kosher Meat &amp; Food Control]'', 66 F. 3d 1337 (4th Cir. 1995) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041221145300/http://www.law.emory.edu/4circuit/oct95/941918.p.html |date=December 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Jersey's Kosher laws being found to violate the Establishment clauses of both the New Jersey state constitution and the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''Perretti v. Ran-Dav's County Kosher Inc.'', 289 N.J. Super 618, 674 A. 2d 647 (Superior Ct. Appellate Div 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion was affirmed by the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] in which it found that the State's use of "Orthodox Jewish law" as a basis for the definition of kosher was an adoption of substantive religious standards which violated the State and Federal constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;129 N.J. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  The State's response was to create a new law which avoids any definition of a what is or is not ''kosher''. Instead, establishments which claim to be ''kosher'' must provide details about what they mean by ''kosher'', and the State will check to ensure that this standard is adhered to. For example, ''kosher'' restaurants must display a poster (provided by the ''Kosher Food Enforcement Bureau'') on which they display the name of their rabbinic certifier, how often he inspects the establishment, whether or not he requires all ingredients to be kosher-supervised, and so on. In this manner, government enforcement becomes a consumer-protection issue, and avoids the problems of advancing any particular religious view.
*The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] finding that the challenged provisions of [[New York (state)|New York]]'s Kosher Fraud law ''on their face violate the Establishment Clause because they excessively entangle the State of New York with religion and impermissibly advance Orthodox Judaism''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1355808.html Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats, Inc. v. Weiss] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320193241/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=2nd&amp;navby=case&amp;no=009116&amp;exact=1 |date=March 20, 2005 }}'', 294 F.3d 415 (2d Cir. 2002), 45 ATLA L. Rep. 282 (October 2002) &lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and denied [[certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;123 S. Ct. 1250 (mem.) (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The statute has since been revised and a new statute, ''The McKinney's Agriculture and Markets Law Sec. 201-a'', has since been passed. Under the new law, the state merely maintains a database of certification organizations and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

A '''clinical coder''' – also known as '''clinical coding officer''', '''diagnostic coder''', '''medical coder''', '''nosologist'''  or '''medical records technician''' – is a [[Health information management|health information professional]] whose main duties are to analyse [[medical record|clinical statements]] and assign standard codes using a [[medical classification|classification system]]. The data produced are an integral part of [[health information management]], and are used by local and national governments, private healthcare organizations and international agencies for various purposes, including medical and health services research, [[epidemiology|epidemiological studies]], health resource allocation, [[case mix]] management, [[public health]] programming, [[medical billing]], and public education.

For example, a clinical coder may use a set of published codes on medical diagnoses and procedures, such as the [[ICD-10|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) or the [[HCPCS|Common Coding System for Healthcare Procedures]] (HCPCS), for reporting to the [[health insurance]] provider of the recipient of the care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to Health Insurance Billing|author=Marie A. Moisio|year=2000|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author = Michelle A. Green and JoAnn C. Rowell
  |title = Understanding Health Insurance, A Guide to Billing and Reimbursement, 10e
  |publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]
  |year = 2011
  |isbn = 978-1-111-03518-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The use of standard codes allows insurance providers to map equivalencies across different service providers who may use different terminologies or abbreviations in their written claims forms, and be used to justify reimbursement of fees and expenses. The codes may cover topics related to [[Diagnostic code|diagnoses]], [[Procedure code|procedures]], [[pharmaceutical code|pharmaceuticals]] or [[Topographical code|topography]]. The medical notes may also be divided into specialities for example [[cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[nephrology]], [[neurology]] , [[pulmonology]] or [[orthopedic]] care.

A clinical coder therefore requires a good knowledge of [[medical terminology]], [[anatomy and physiology]], a basic knowledge of clinical procedures and diseases and injuries and other conditions, medical illustrations, clinical documentation (such as medical or surgical reports and patient charts), legal and ethical aspects of health information, health data standards, classification conventions, and computer- or paper-based data management, usually as obtained through formal education and/or on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Classifying health workers: Medical records and health information technicians''. Geneva, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;Department of Human Services, Victoria, Australia. [http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/ahs/archive/hdss/13-19720.htm#clinical Clinical Coders Creed.] ''Health Data Standards and Systems Bulletin'', Issue 13, 19 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
The basic task of a clinical coder is to classify medical and health care concepts using a standardised [[medical classification|classification]]. Most clinical coders are employed in coding [[inpatient]] episodes of care.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, [[Death|mortality]] events, [[outpatient]] episodes, [[general practitioner]] visits and [[population health]] studies can all be coded.

Clinical coding has three key phases: a) Abstraction; b) Assignment; and c) Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wooding A |title=Clinical coders and decision making |journal=HIM J |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=79–83 |year=2004 |pmid=18490784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstraction===
The abstraction phase involves reading the entire record of the [[reason for encounter|health encounter]] and analysing the information to determine what condition(s) the patient had, what caused it and how it was treated. The information comes from a variety of sources within the [[medical record]], such as clinical notes, laboratory and radiology results, and operation notes.

===Assignment===
The assignment phase has two parts: finding the appropriate code(s) from the classification for the abstraction; and entering the code into the system being used to collect the coded data.

===Review===
Reviewing the code set produced from the assignment phase is very important. Clinical coder must ask themselves, "does this code set fairly represent what happened to this patient in this health encounter at this facility?" By doing this, clinical coders are checking that they have covered everything that they must, but not used extraneous codes. For health encounters that are funded through a [[case mix]] mechanism, the clinical coder will also review the [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) to ensure that it does fairly represent the health encounter.

==Competency levels==
Clinical coders may have different competency levels depending on the specific tasks and employment setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker S |title=Capturing health information—a perspectives paper |journal=HIM J |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=13–22 |year=2006 |pmid=18195424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry-level / trainee coder===
An entry level coder has completed (or nearly completed) an introductory training program in using clinical classifications. Depending on the country; this program may be in the form of a certificate, or even a degree; which has to be earned before the trainee is allowed to start coding. All trainee coders will have some form of continuous, on-the-job training; often being overseen by a more senior coder. 

===Intermediate level coder===
An intermediate level coder has acquired the skills necessary to code many cases independently. Coders at this level are also able to code cases with incomplete information. They have a good understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] along with disease processes. Intermediate level coders have their work audited periodically by an Advanced coder.

===Advanced level / senior coder===
Advanced level and senior coders are authorized to code all cases including the most complex. Advanced coders will usually be credentialed and will have several years of experience. An advanced coder is also able to train entry-level coders.

===Nosologist===
{{main|Nosology}}
A nosologist understands how the classification is underpinned. Nosologists consult nationally and internationally to resolve issues in the classification and are viewed as experts who can not only code, but design and deliver education, assist in the development of the classification and the rules for using it.

Nosologists are usually expert in more than one classification, including morbidity, mortality and casemix. In some countries the term "nosologist" is used as a catch-all term for all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-11/nosologist Nosologist.] ''Popular Science'', posted 11.11.2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Clinical coders may use many different classifications, which fall into two main groupings: statistical classifications and nomenclatures.

===Statistical classification===
{{Main|Medical classification|Procedural classification}}

A statistical classification, such as ICD-10 or [[DSM-5]], will bring together similar clinical concepts, and group them into one category. This allows the number of categories to be limited so that the classification does not become too big, but still allows statistical analysis. An example of this is in [[ICD-10]] at code I47.1. The code title (or [[rubric]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241548342|page=19|edition=10th revision, 2010|ref=Footnote 1|chapter=3. How to use the ICD|quote=In the context of the ICD, "rubric" denotes either a three-character category or a four-character subcategory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Supraventricular tachycardia]]. However, there are several other clinical concepts that are also classified here. Amongst them are paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, auricular tachycardia and nodal tachycardia.

===Nomenclature===
With a [[nomenclature]], for example [[SNOMED CT]], there is a separate listing and code for every clinical concept. So, in the tachycardia example above, each type and clinical term for tachycardia would have its own code listed. This makes nomenclatures unwieldy for compiling health statistics.

==Education and professional qualification==
In some countries, clinical coders may seek voluntary [[Certification and Accreditation|certification or accreditation]] through assessments conducted by professional associations, health authorities or, in some instances, universities.&lt;ref name="Bramley"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bramley | first1 = M | last2 = Reid | first2 = B.  | year = | title = Evaluation standards for clinical coder training programs | url = http://www.himaa.org.au/members/journal/HIMJ_36_3_2007/Bramey%20and%20Reid%20Evaluation%20standards%20for%20clinical%20coder%20training%20programs.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Health Information Management Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 3| page = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The options available to the coder will depend on the country,&lt;ref name="Bramley" /&gt; and, occasionally, even between states within a country.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===United Kingdom===
Clinical coders start as trainees, and there are no conversion courses for coders [[immigration|immigrating]] to the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[National Clinical Coding Qualification (UK)|National Clinical Coding Qualification]] (NCCQ) is an exam for experienced coders, and is recognised by the four health agencies of the UK.

&lt;!-- Countries have been listed in the order they appear in paragraph two of the lead section at the United Kingdom article --&gt;
====England====
In [[England]], a novice coder will complete the national standards course written by [[NHS Digital]] within 6 months of being in post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Clinical Coding Training Handbook 2016-17|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160921135209/http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/clinicalcoding/trainingaccred/sc_rc_hbk1617.pdf#page=3|publisher=Clinical Classifications Service|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will then start working towards the NCCQ. 

Three years after passing the NCCQ, two further professional qualifications are made available to the coder in the form of NHS Digital's clinical coding auditor and trainer programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delen: Home: CLINICAL CODING AUDITOR PROGRAMME|url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297779|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delen: Home: CLINICAL CODING TRAINER PROGRAMME|url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297747|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In 2015, [[NHS National Services Scotland|National Services Scotland]], in collaboration with Health Boards, launched the Certificate of Technical Competence (CTC) in Clinical Coding (Scotland). Awarded by the Institute of Health Records &amp; Information Management (IHRIM); the aims of the certificate include supporting staff new to clinical coding, and providing a standardised framework of clinical coding training across NHS Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Technical Competence in Clinical Coding (Scotland)|url=http://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Terminology-Services/Terminology-Advice-and-Support/Publicity-20170802-CTC.PDF|website=ISD Services|publisher=NHS Scotland|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCCQ is a recognized coding qualification in [[Scotland]].

===United States===
As of 2016; the typical qualification for an entry-level medical coder in the United States is completion of a diploma or certificate, or, where they are offered, an associate degree. The diploma, certificate, or degree will usually always include an Internet-based and/or in-person [[internship]], at some form of a medical office or facility, at the conclusion. Some form of on-the-job training, or at least oversight, is also usually provided in the first months on the job, until the coder can earn an intermediate or advanced level of certification and accumulate time on the job. For further academic training, a baccalaureate or master's degree in medical information technology, or a related field, can be earned by those who wish to advance to a supervisory or academic role. That option would be recommended for those wishing to teach medical billing or coding at a college or university, community college, or technical or vocational institute, or who wish to become heads of medical billing and coding departments, especially if the doctor's office or clinic, or other facility (among other working options, a medical school or hospital, a skilled nursing facility or other nursing home, a psychiatric facility, an assisted or independent living facility, a rehabilitation facility, a rest home or domiciliary or boarding house, etc.) is very large and receives complex cases, such as a referral facility or a Level I trauma teaching hospital center. A [[nosologist]] (medical coding expert) in the U.S. will usually be certified by either AHIMA or the AAPC (often both) at their highest level of certification and specialty inpatient and/or outpatient certification (pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, gerontology, oncology are among those offered by AHIMA and/or the AAPC), have at least 3-5 years of intermediate experience beyond entry-level certification and employment, and often holds an associate, bachelor's, or graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://icc.edu/academics/catalog/health-careers/medical-coder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midstate.edu/programs/healthinformationtechnology.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midwesttech.edu/Program-Description/medical-coder-course-description.html&lt;/ref&gt;   

The [[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]] offers the following entry-level certifications in the U.S.: Certified Professional Coder (CPC); which tests on most areas of medical coding, and also the Certified Inpatient Coder (CIC) and Certified Outpatient Coder (COC). Also in the [[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA) offers the entry-level Certified Coding Associate (CCA); which is, like the AAPC's CPC, a wide-ranging introductory test.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} 

Some U.S. states, though decidedly not the majority, as it is a very recent trend, now mandate or at least strongly encourage certification or a degree from a college- or at the minimum, some evidence of competency beyond the record of on the job training- and/or from either the AAPC or AHIMA, to be employed. Some states have registries of medical coders, though these can be voluntary listings- which is, for those few who do, most often the case- and so not mandatory. This trend was accelerated in part by the passage of [[HIPAA]] (which enforces among other things, patient privacy and access to and the form of medical records) and the [[Affordable Care Act]] (U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s health care reform law); and similar changes in other developed and developing countries, many of which, especially in the Western developed countries, and beyond, use the [[ICD-10]] for diagnostic medical coding, which is a quite complex system of codes. The change to more regulation and training has also been driven by the need to create accurate, detailed, and secure medical records- especially patient charts, bills, and claim form submissions, that can be recorded efficiently in an electronic era of medical records where they need to be carefully shared between different providers or institutions of care, which was encouraged and later required by legislation and institutional policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/federal-requirements-medical-billing-companies-3069.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb-guide.org/medical-billing-laws.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/medical_billing_pros.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/prof_advance.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/medical_billing_schools.htm?pc=&amp;sub=medbilling&amp;qual=associate&amp;ct=either&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Professional associations==
In many countries clinical coders are accommodated for by both professional bodies specific to coding, and organisations who represent the health information management profession as a whole.

===Australia===
*Clinical Coders' Society of Australia (CCSA)&lt;ref name=ccsa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccsofa.org.au/ |title=Clinical Coders' Society of Australia |access-date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IHRIM are the awarding body for the National Clinical Coding Qualification (NCCQ).

===United States===
There are several associations that medical coders in the United States may join, including:
*[[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA)&lt;ref name=ahima&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahima.org/ |title= AHIMA Home - American Health Information Management Association |access-date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]] (formerly American Academy of Professional Coders)

The AHIMA and AAPC societies' accredited programs will generally train medical coders at a sufficient level to work in their respective states. Some medical coders elect to be certified by both societies.  

AHIMA maintains a list of accredited medical coding certificate (and health information management associate, bachelor's, and graduate programs, through a link on the AHIMA accredited programs page, to [[CAHIIM]]) here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahima.org/careers/codingprograms&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corduroy''' (August 1, 1989 – c. November 2016) was a male domestic cat that held the record as the world's oldest living cat until May 2016.&lt;ref name=guinness&gt;{{cite web|last=Swatman |first=Rachel |title=Spotlight: Corduroy is crowned the oldest living cat|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/8/spotlight-corduroy-is-crowned-the-oldest-living-cat-391829|publisher=Guinness World Records |date=13 August 2015|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the oldest cat in 2014, aged 25 years old at the time, until being replaced by [[Tiffany Two]].

On May 10, 2016, Corduroy was replaced by a 30-year-old Siamese cat named [[Scooter (cat)|Scooter]] (born March 26, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/5/guinness-world-records-announces-30-year-old-scooter-as-oldest-living-cat-428117|title=Guinness World Records announces 30-year-old Scooter as oldest living cat|date=9 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scooter died less than a week after being named the record-holder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Szathmary|first=Zoe|last2=Associated Press|title=World's oldest living cat Scooter - who only was revealed as the Guinness record holder this week - has died at age 30|date=14 May 2016|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3590434/World-s-oldest-living-cat-Scooter-revealed-Guinness-World-Record-holder-week-died-age-30.html|access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly making Corduroy the holder of oldest living cat once again.

{{lowercase|title=dGH}}

'''Degrees of general hardness''' ('''dGH or °GH''') is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[Hard water|water hardness]], specifically of general hardness. General hardness is a measure of the concentration of [[divalent]] metal ions such as [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) per volume of water. Specifically, 1 dGH is defined as 10 milligrams (mg) of [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) per litre of water. Since CaO has a [[molar mass]] of 56.08 g/mol, 1 dGH is equivalent to 0.17832 [[mmol]] per litre of elemental calcium and/or magnesium ions.

In water testing, paper strips often measure hardness in parts per million (ppm), where one part per million is defined as one milligram of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) per litre of water.  Consequently, 1 dGH corresponds to 10 ppm CaO but 17.848 ppm CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which has a molar mass of 100.09 g/mol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15471">The '''Employment Standards Act of British Columbia''' ([[Canada]]), is legislation enacted by the provincial government of [[British Columbia]] to protect the rights of working people. Sections within the act outline the employers responsibility to their employees, notably things such as [[minimum wage]], meal breaks, and [[parental leave]]. The act also works to protect residents of the province by preventing [[employment discrimination]].

==Part I: Introduction==

This Act applies to all employees, with the exception of those expressly excluded by regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The standards set out in the Act are considered minimum requirements, and agreements to waive such requirements are considered of no force and effect, unless the agreement in question is referred to in s. 3(2) or (4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectives===

The purposes of this Act are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
*(a) to ensure that employees in British Columbia receive at least basic standards of compensation and conditions of employment;
*(b) to promote the fair treatment of employees and employers;
*(c) to encourage open communication between employers and employees;
*(d) to provide fair and efficient procedures for resolving disputes over the application and interpretation of this Act;
*(e) to foster the development of a productive and efficient labour force that can contribute fully to the prosperity of British Columbia;
*(f) to contribute in assisting employees to meet work and family responsibilities.

===Scope of the Act===

The Act applies to all employees other than those excluded by regulation.

"Employee" includes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A person, including a deceased person, receiving or entitled to wages for work performed for another,
*A person an employer allows, directly or indirectly, to perform work normally performed by an employee,
*A person being trained by an employer for the employer’s business
*A person on leave from an employer, and
*A person who has a right of recall

===Exceptions===

Federally regulated employers (for example, banks, broadcasting, rail transportation, and postal contractors) are governed by the Canada Labour Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-2/FullText.html/ Canada Labour Code, RSC 1985 c L-2, s 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some specific exemptions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/11_396_95#section31/ BC Employment Standards Act Regulation, s 31]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Professionals, such as accountants, engineers, dentists, lawyers
*Students engaged in work study programs

In addition, if a ''collective agreement'' deals with:

*Hours of work or overtime
*Statutory holidays
*Annual vacation or vacation pay
*Seniority retention, recall, termination of employment or layoff

then corresponding provisions of the Act do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 3(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; If the collective agreement does not deal with these topics, this Act does apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 3(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Managers'' are exempt from the hours of work, overtime and statutory holiday provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/11_396_95#section31/ BC Employment Standards Act Regulation, s 34(f)]&lt;/ref&gt; "Manager" is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/11_396_95#section31/ BC Employment Standards Act Regulation, s 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A person whose principal employment responsibilities consist of supervising and/or directing human or other resources
*A person employed in an executive capacity

''Independent contractors'' are not considered employees. In order to classify an individual as one or the other, there are four common law tests that can be applied:&lt;ref&gt;BC Ministry of Labour, Citizens' Services and Open Government - Interpretation Guidelines Manual: British Columbia Employment Standards Act and Regulations [http://www.labour.gov.bc.ca/esb/igm/igm-toc.htm BC Ministry of Labour, Citizens' Services and Open Government - Interpretation Guidelines Manual: British Columbia Employment Standards Act and Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Control test
*Four-fold test
*Organization or integration test
*Permanency test
*Specific result test
*Economic reality test

It is important to note that the requirements set out in this Act generally cannot be waived since they are minimum requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part II: Hiring Employees==

The provisions in this section deal with topics such as the hiring of children, the licensing of employment and talent agencies and farm labour contractors, and requirements for those working as domestics and working in residences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 8-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part III: Wages, Special Clothing and Records==

The general minimum is $10.25 per hour since May 1, 2012.

Wages can be paid by cash, cheque, draft or money order. Direct deposit can be used only if expressly authorized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 20]&lt;/ref&gt;
Wages should be paid semi-monthly, with no more than 16 days between pay days, and no more than 8 days after the pay period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

An employer cannot directly or indirectly withhold wages, and cannot require employees to contribute towards the costs of business (except under the Regulation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the employee has been with the employer for 5 consecutive years, they are entitled to 3 weeks per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 57]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part VIII: Termination of Employment==

The amount of notice or pay in lieu of notice than an employee is entitled to depends on their length of service with their employer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96113_01/ BC Employment Standards Act, RSBC 1996 c 113, s 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

== By age and gender ==
Schizophrenia is diagnosed 1.4 times more frequently in males than females, and typically appears earlier in men&lt;ref name=BMJ07 /&gt;—the peak ages of onset are 20–28 years for males and 26–32 years for females.&lt;ref name="castle1991"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Castle D, Wessely S, Der G, Murray RM |title=The incidence of operationally defined schizophrenia in Camberwell, 1965–84 |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=159 |pages=790–4 |year=1991 |month=December |pmid=1790446 |doi=10.1192/bjp.159.6.790}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pediatric schizophrenia|Onset in childhood]] is much rarer,&lt;ref name="Kumra_et_al_2001"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kumra S, Shaw M, Merka P, Nakayama E, Augustin R |year=2001 |title=Childhood-onset schizophrenia: research update |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=46 | issue=10 |pages=923–30 |pmid=11816313|doi=10.1177/070674370104601004 |doi-broken-date=2017-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is onset in middle- or old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hassett|first1=Anne M.|last2=Ames|first2=David|last3=Chiu|first3=Edmond|title=Psychosis in the Elderly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMfjVgZDGn0C|date=20 June 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=978-1-84184-394-0|page=6|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the mean age of first hospital admission for treatment of schizophrenia is between 25 and 35. Studies have suggested that lower income individuals tend to have their disorder diagnosed later after the onset of symptoms, relative to those of better economic standings. As a result, the lower social classes are more likely to be living with their illness untreated.&lt;ref name=CJP97 /&gt;

It is generally accepted that women tend to present with schizophrenia anywhere between 4–10 years after their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="Hafner1994"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hafner H, Maurer K, Loffler W, et al. |title=The epidemiology of early schizophrenia: Influence of age and gender on onset and early course |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=23 |pages=29–38 |year=1994|pmid=8037899}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, using broad criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia shows that males have a bimodal age of onset, with peaks at 21.4 years and 39.2 years old, while females have a trimodal age of onset with peaks at 22.4, 36.6, and 61.5 years old.&lt;ref name="Castle1998"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Castle D, Sham P, Murray R. |title=Differences in distribution of ages of onset in males and females with schizophrenia |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=179–183 |year=1998 | doi = 10.1016/s0920-9964(98)00070-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This additional post-menopausal peak of late-onset schizophrenia in women calls into question the etiology of the disease and raises a debate about "subtypes" of schizophrenia, with men and women being susceptible to different types (see [[Causes of Schizophrenia]]). This is further supported by the variability in presentation of the disease between the genders.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni2001"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kulkarni J, Riedel A, de Castella AR, et al. |title=Estrogen – A potential treatment for schizophrenia |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=137–144 |year=2001 |pmid=11278160 | doi = 10.1016/s0920-9964(00)00088-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that may explain this difference include protective or predisposing factors in men or women that may render them more (or less) susceptible to the disease at different points in life. For example, estrogen may be a protective factor for women, as estradiol has been found to be effective in treating schizophrenia when added to antipsychotic therapy.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni2001" /&gt;

== By country ==
In 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] found the prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia to be roughly similar around the world, with age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranging from 343 in Africa to 544 in Japan and Oceania for men and from 378 in Africa to 527 in Southeastern Europe for women.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global burden of schizophrenia in the year 2000|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/bod_schizophrenia.pdf|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|last=Ayuso-Mateos|first=Jose Luis|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the impact of schizophrenia tends to be highest in [[Oceania]], the [[Middle East]], and [[East Asia]], while the nations of [[Australia]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and most of [[Europe]] typically have low impact. Despite relative geographical proximity, the DALY rate of schizophrenia in [[Indonesia]] nearly doubles that of Australia (the nations with the highest and lowest respective DALY rates). Discrepancies between DALY rates and prevalence may arise from differences in availability of medical treatment: years lived with mental disorders carry significantly higher DALY values when unmedicated than when medicated.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

The following tables record the age-standardised disability-adjusted life years rates per 100,000 inhabitants (recorded in 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/gbddeathdalycountryestimates2004.xls |title=Age-standardized DALYs per 100,000 by cause, and Member State, 2004 |accessdate=2011-04-01 |work=Global burden of disease: 2004 update |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12827">'''European Immunization Week''' (EIW) is an annual regional initiative, coordinated by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe]] (WHO/Europe), to promote immunization against [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. EIW activities are carried out by participating WHO/Europe [[member state]]s. In the past these have included: disseminating informational materials about immunization, organizing immunization campaigns, organizing training sessions for health care workers, arranging workshops or conferences with political decision makers to discuss immunization, and holding press conferences about immunization-related issues.
 
EIW takes place each year in April. The initiative has spread from [[Vaccination Week In The Americas|the Americas]] and Europe to become a global immunization effort known as [[World Immunization Week]].&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/annual/immunization_week/en/index.html World Immunization Week]&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative promotes the message that immunization of every child is vital in order to prevent diseases and protect life.&lt;ref name="EIW web site"&gt;WHO Regional Office for Europe, [http://www.euro.who.int/eiw About European Immunization Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The EIW slogan is: ''Prevent. Protect. Immunize.''

As stated by WHO/Europe, the goal of EIW is threefold: to increase vaccination coverage across the European Region by raising public awareness about the benefits of immunization; to support national immunization systems; and to provide a framework for mobilizing public and political support for immunization efforts. Partner organizations involved in EIW include, but are not limited to, [[UNICEF]], the [[Measles Initiative]] and the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]] (ECDC).

== Background ==
The first EIW was conducted in October 2005 by the WHO/Europe and a number of Member States across the Region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Immunization Week 2005|url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/european-immunization-week/european-immunization-week-20052015/european-immunization-week-2005|website = www.euro.who.int|date = 2016-02-08|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Immunization Week (EIW) is an annual initiative to raise awareness, improve communication and advocate immunization across the WHO European Region.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Immunization Week|url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/european-immunization-week|website = www.euro.who.int|date = 2016-02-08|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIW started out of a concern that immunization is becoming less valued because of the decline in the incidence of, and reduced fear of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consequently, the coverage rates have declined in many countries across the WHO European Region; this has resulted in large, sporadic disease outbreaks. Average coverage rates vary greatly between Member States, however vulnerable groups exist all over the Region. This reduction in coverage rates have been influenced by media scares and groups/individuals opposed to immunization. Also, immunization often suffers from low political commitment due to competing health priorities.

EIW has the goal to increase vaccination coverage by drawing attention to increasing awareness of the importance of every child’s need and right to be protected from vaccine preventable diseases. This initiative targets parents and caregivers, health care professionals and policy makers; with a special focus is placed on activities targeting vulnerable groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;1p2r90 e91r3 2oqjwr 7awplp12oi61[2140=-1 qdi12eoAI WEEN0Q

==Themes of European Immunization Week==

=== 2016 : “Close the immunization gap” ===
EIW 2016 will take place in 24–30 April 2016. EIW 2016 will highlight progress being made towards elimination of measles and rubella, while also pointing to the remaining gap between those who are protected and those who sadly remain vulnerable to these diseases.

===2015: “Commitment to immunization- How can Europe free itself from vaccine-preventable diseases?”===
Immunization has saved more lives than any other public health intervention, yet 2013 saw 31 685 measles cases alone in Europe, an increase of 348% compared to 2007. The cost of these outbreaks in both human and monetary terms is extremely high. To move closer to WHO’s vision of a European Region free of vaccine-preventable diseases, a new and innovative approach is needed, as set out in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020 (EVAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Vaccine Action Plan|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/publications/2014/european-vaccine-action-plan-20152020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIW 2015 marked the 10th European Immunization Week, which took place on 20–25 April 2015. It highlighted examples of innovative practice in Member States, where new policies and initiatives addressed the key factors affecting immunization decisions: complacency, confidence, convenience and access.  Communication and advocacy activities celebrated the progress achieved so far- particularly towards elimination of measles and rubella, maintaining the Region’s polio-free status, and introduction of new vaccines. It also focused on what immediate action needed to be taken to maintain commitment and achieve the Region’s ambitious immunization goals.[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/284327/EIW-Narrative-Report.pdf?ua=1 Narrative Report: European Immunization Week 2015.]

===2014: "Immunization for Life" ===
EIW 2014 took place on 22–26 April 2014. It highlighted the need for and protection provided by vaccination in infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, parenthood and old age. Activities organized at national and local level throughout the European Region raised awareness among health care workers, policy-makers, parents, grandparents and other individuals of the benefits of full immunization. A summary of activities that took place is available on the WHO/Europe website. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/publications/2014/narrative-report-european-immunization-week-2014) Narrative report: European Immunization Week 2014].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narrative report: European Immunization Week 2014|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/publications/2014/narrative-report-european-immunization-week-2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
EIW 2013 took place on 22–27 April 2013. In addition to awareness-raising activities organized by individual Member States, a series of guest bloggers contributed to the [http://eiw.euro.who.int/ EIW campaign site] and information materials were published on the [http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/vaccines-and-immunization/immunization-resource-centre Immunization Resource Centre] of the WHO/Europe website. Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, patron of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, made a [http://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/patron/speeches-and-statements/statement-by-her-royal-highness-crown-princess-mary-of-denmark-for-european-immunization-week-and-world-immunization-week video statement] in support of European Immunization Week and World Immunization Week. The [http://www.euro.who.int/narrative-report-eiw2013 EIW 2013 Narrative Report] provides a summary of EIW 2013 activities.

===2012: " Increase demand for immunization" ===
EIW 2012 took place on 21–27 April 2012. This year, marked the first time that all 53 Member States in the WHO European Region took part simultaneously, hosting a large array of immunization awareness activities. This marked a milestone in the initiative’s seven-year history. Such widespread support was particularly critical for the Region as Member States work to eliminate measles and rubella by 2015 and to maintain Europe’s polio-free status. The vital role of health workers, as the most trusted source of information about vaccines, was also in focus.

===2011" Shared solutions to common threats" ===
EIW 2011 took place on 23–30 April 2011. This year theme highlighted the importance of collaborating and sharing both experiences and solutions for achieving immunization goals, such as eliminating measles by 2015, maintaining the polio-free status of the Region and keeping all vaccine-preventable diseases under control in the European Region. The theme was selected in the wake of [[polio]] outbreaks in the European Region in 2010. The outbreaks have clearly illustrated that when vaccine-preventable diseases spread; shared borders lead to common threats. Therefore, one of the best ways to combat these threats is by sharing responsibility for immunization, particularly on a sub-regional level. Of the 53 Member States in the WHO European Region, 52 participated in European Immunization Week 2011. The Regional launch of the initiative was attended by Princess Mathilde of Belgium in her first year acting as Special Representative for Immunization for the WHO Regional Office for Europe.&lt;ref name="WHO/Europe website"&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/european-immunization-week/european-immunization-week-20052010/european-immunization-week-2011/eiw-2011-regional-launch EIW 2011 regional launch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EIW Royal Patron==

[[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Crown Princess Mary of Denmark]] is the patron of the WHO Regional Office for Europe and, as such, has participated in activities related to European Immunization Week. She became Patron of WHO/Europe in 2005. In 2006 she described her commitment to public health issues in the WHO European Region, and her plans to focus on specific areas of WHO/Europe’s work to generate greater awareness in Europe, where poor health, suffering and lack of access to basic medical services were an everyday reality for many. At the launch of EIW 2008, she stated, “It is the right of every child to grow up healthy, and vaccinated against those diseases that can so easily be controlled. I hope that the countries within the region will act quickly and effectively to ensure that children and adults, especially those in vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups, have access to immunization and basic health services.” &lt;ref name="HRH web site"&gt;[http://www.kronprinsparret.dk/5bc2774/Year/2008 Official web site of HRH Crown Princess Mary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Princess Mary participated for the first time in a WHO Regional Committee session outside Copenhagen, Denmark where she emphasized her commitment to immunization and maternal and child health within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals. In April 2013 she made a  [http://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/patron/speeches-and-statements/statement-by-her-royal-highness-crown-princess-mary-of-denmark-for-european-immunization-week-and-world-immunization-week video statement] in support of European Immunization Week and World Immunization Week. In 2014 on World Polio Day, Princess Mary and Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, visited Tajikistan. Princess Mary commended both the Government of Tajikistan and WHO on their collaboration and continuing efforts to improve reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in the country. In 2015, she made a statement promoting immunization and encouraging the Region to immunize, advocate, and generally contribute to achieving immunity for all.

'''Fantasy''' in a psychological sense refers to two different possible aspects of [[the mind]], the conscious, and the unconscious.  In the unconscious sense, it is sometimes spelled "phantasy".

==Conscious fantasy==

A fantasy is a situation [[imagination|imagined]] by an individual that expresses certain desires or aims on the part of its creator. Fantasies sometimes involve situations that are highly unlikely; or they may be quite realistic. Fantasies can also be [[sexual fantasy|sexual]] in nature. Another, more basic meaning of fantasy is something which is not 'real,' as in perceived explicitly by any of the senses, but exists as an imagined situation of object to subject.

In everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done...fantasies of control or of sovereign choice...daydreams'.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Eman Vaillant]] in his study of [[defence mechanisms]] took as a central example of 'an immature defence...''fantasy''  —  living in a "[[Walter Mitty]]" dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job'.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) pp. 53–4&lt;/ref&gt;  Fantasy, when pushed to the extreme, is a common trait of [[narcissistic personality disorder]]; and certainly 'Vaillant found that not one person who used fantasy a lot had any close friends'.&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements&amp;nbsp;— providing 'small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Deirdre Barrett]] reports that people differ radically in the vividness, as well as frequency of fantasy, and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art, literature, or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Deirdre Fantasizers and Dissociaters: An Empirically based schema of two types of deep trance subjects.  Psychological Reports, 1992, 71, p. 1011 1014; Barrett, Deirdre L. Dissociaters, Fantasizers, and their Relation to Hypnotizability in Barrett, Deirdre (Ed.) Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy, (2 vol.): Vol. 1: History, theory and general research, Vol. 2: Psychotherapy research and applications, NY, NY: Praeger/Greenwood, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and Fantasy==
For Freud, a fantasy is constructed around multiple, often repressed wishes, and employs disguise to mask and mark the very defensive processes by which desire is enacted. The subject's desire to maintain distance from the repressed wish and simultaneously experience it opens up a type of third person syntax allowing for multiple entry into the fantasy. Therefore, in fantasy, vision is multiplied—it becomes possible to see from more than one position at the same time, to see oneself and to see oneself seeing oneself, to divide vision and dislocate subjectivity. This radical omission of the “I” position creates space for all those processes that depend upon such a center, including not only identification but also the field and organization of vision itself.

For Freud, sexuality is linked from the very beginning to an object of fantasy. However, “the object to be rediscovered is not the lost object, but its substitute by displacement; the lost object is the object of self-preservation, of hunger, and the object one seeks to re-find in sexuality is an object displaced in relation to that first object.”  This initial scene of fantasy is created out of the frustrated infants’ deflection away from the instinctual need for milk and nourishment towards a phantasmization of the mothers’ breast, which is in close proximity to the instinctual need. Now bodily pleasure is derived from the sucking of the mother's breast itself. The mouth that was the original source of nourishment is now the mouth that takes pleasure in its own sucking.  This substitution of the breast for milk and the breast for a phantasmic scene represents a further level of mediation which is increasingly psychic. The child cannot experience the pleasure of milk without the psychic re-inscription of the scene in the mind. “The finding of an object is in fact a re-finding of it.”  It is in the movement and constant restaging away from the instinct that desire is constituted and mobilized.

==Freud and daydreams==
[[File:Helleu - Daydream.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Rêverie'' ([[daydreaming|Daydream]]), 1901, by [[Paul César Helleu]]]]
A similarly positive view of fantasy was taken by [[Sigmund Freud]] who considered fantasy ({{lang-de|Fantasie}}) a [[defence mechanism]].  He considered that men and women "cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality.  'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions,' as [[Theodor Fontane]] once said ... [without] dwelling on imaginary [[wish fulfillment]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;  As childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed, so too 'one species of thought activity was split off; it was kept free from reality-testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone.  This activity is ''fantasying''...continued as ''day-dreaming''.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  He compared such phantasising to the way a 'nature reserve preserves its original state where everything...including what is useless and even what is noxious, can grow and proliferate there as it pleases'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Introductory'' p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daydreaming|Daydreams]] for Freud were thus a valuable resource.  "These day-dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest; they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity ... such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Penguin Freud Library 100 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered "These phantasies include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of the subject's personality" and that the energetic man "is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality," whereas the artist "can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms ... the doom of neurosis."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1995) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==In schizophrenia==
In the context of occurrences of the mental disorder known as [[schizophrenia]], individuals who exhibit symptoms fulfilling this particular classification might be experiencing fantasies as part of the diagnosis (Shneidman, E. S. 1948).&lt;ref&gt;Shneidman, E. S. (1948) - [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1949-02816-001 Schizophrenia and the MAPS test: a study of certain formal psycho-social aspects of fantasy production in schizophrenia as revealed by performance on the Make A Picture Story (MAPS) test.] Genetic Psychology Monographs, 38, 145-223. [[American Psychological Association]] Accessed November 19th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific investigation into activity of the so-called [[Default mode network|default network within the brain]] (Randy Buckner et al. 2008) has shown individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have high levels ("...overactive...")  of activity within their brains.&lt;ref&gt;SB Kaufmann (2009), (Josie Glausiusz 2009) - [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/200903/are-people-schizophrenia-living-dream] [[Psychology Today]] Accessed November 19th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckner RL, Andrews-Hanna JR, Schacter DL. (2008) &amp; [https://cnl.rc.fas.harvard.edu/ Buckner Laboratory] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400922 The brain's default network: anatomy, function, and relevance to disease.] Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2008 Mar;1124:1-38 doi: 10.1196/annals.1440.011 Retrieved November 19th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of eighty individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, it was found one quarter of men who had committed a contact crime against women were motivated by sexually orientated fantasy (A.D. Smith 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Smith (04 Jan 2008) - [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585189908402158 Aggressive sexual fantasy in men with schizophrenia who commit contact sex offences against women] The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry Volume 10, 1999 Accessed November 19th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klein and unconscious fantasy==

[[Melanie Klein]] extended Freud's concept of fantasy to cover the developing child's relationship to a world of internal objects.  In her thought, this kind of 'play activity inside the person is known as "unconscious fantasy".  And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive.  They are different from ordinary day-dreams or "fantasies" (spelled with an "f")'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hinshelwood and Susan Robinson, ''Introducing Melanie Klein'', (Cambridge 2006) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fantasy" became a central issue with the development of the Kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and was at the heart of the so-called [[Controversial discussions]] of the wartime years.  'A paper by Susan Isaacs (1952) on "The nature and function of Phantasy"...has been generally accepted by the Klein group in London as a fundamental statement of their position'.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Middlesex 1969) p. 17 and note&lt;/ref&gt;  As a defining feature, 'Kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects.  These are thought of as primary and innate, and as the mental representations of instincts...the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms'.&lt;ref&gt;Hinshelwood/Robinson, ''Introducing'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaacs considered that 'Unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life, both in normal and neurotic people, the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies';&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Laing, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that 'Both in analysis and life, we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious fantasy'.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: the Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Isaacs however claimed that 'Freud's "hallucinatory wish-fulfilment" and his.."introjection" and "projection" are the basis of the fantasy life';&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Laing, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and how far unconscious fantasy was a genuine development of Freud's ideas, how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic [[paradigm]], is perhaps the key question of the Controversial discussions.

==Lacan, fantasy, and desire==

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] engaged from early on with 'the phantasies revealed by Melanie Klein...the ''imago'' of the mother...this shadow of the ''bad internal objects'''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 284 and p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; — with the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary]].  Increasingly, however, it was Freud's idea of fantasy as a kind of 'screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (Penguin Freud Library 9) p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; that was for him of greater importance.  Lacan came to believe that 'the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Phantasies thus both link to and block off the individual's unconscious, his kernel or real core: ' ''subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split, in the resistance of the phantasy'' ',&lt;ref&gt;F. Wahl, in Lacan, ''Four'' p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; which thus comes close to the centre of the individual's personality and its splits and conflicts. 'The subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy...whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well-developed forms of day-dreaming';&lt;ref&gt;Lacan ''Four'' p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; and as a rule 'a subject's fantasies are close variations on a single theme...the "fundamental fantasy"...minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire'.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners (London 1997) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of therapy thus became ' ''la traversee du fantasme'', the crossing over, traversal, or traversing of the fundamental fantasy'.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance'' (Princeton 1997) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  For Lacan, 'The traversing of fantasy involves the subject's assumption of a new position with respect to the Other as language and the Other as desire...a utopian moment beyond neurosis'.&lt;ref&gt;Fink p. 62 and p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  The question he was left with was 'What, then, does he who has passed through the experience...who has traversed the radical phantasy...become?'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''fantasy principle''==

The postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication.   Here, we are told, 'We need to go beyond the pleasure principle, the reality principle, and repetition compulsion to...the ''fantasy principle'' ' - 'not, as Freud did, reduce fantasies to wishes...[but consider] all other imaginable emotions';&lt;ref&gt;Michael Vannoy Adams 1996 (''The Multicultural Imagination: Race, Color, and the Unconscious''), quoted in Dawn Freshwater and Chris Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating.

Such a perspective 'sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective "typifications"'.&lt;ref&gt;Freshwater/robertson, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissistic personality disorder==
Two characteristics of someone with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] are:&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"&gt;[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108003738/http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm |date=2010-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A pervasive pattern of [[grandiosity]] (in fantasy or behavior)
* A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.

'''Foerster's syndrome''' is the name used by [[Arthur Koestler]] in his account&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur: ''The Act of Creation'' - many editions, e.g. Arkana, {{ISBN|978-0-14-019191-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the compulsive punning first described&lt;ref&gt;ARNMD (1940), Vol. XX, p.732, cited in Koestler&lt;/ref&gt; by the German neurosurgeon [[Otfrid Foerster]].

In 1929, Foerster was operating on a patient suffering from a [[tumor]] in the third ventricle – a small cavity deep down in the phylogenetically ancient regions of the [[midbrain]], adjacent to structures intimately concerned with the arousal of emotions. When the surgeon began to manipulate the tumor, affecting those sensitive structures, the (conscious) patient burst into a manic flight of [[pun]]s. He exhibited typical sound associations, and with every word of the operator broke into a [[flight of ideas]]. The sound of one word swiftly echoed in the sound of the next, and all of the words had something to do with knives and butchery. This gruesome humour, Koestler noted, all came "from a man tied face down to the operating table with his skull open".

'''Food engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field which combines [[Food microbiology|microbiology]], applied [[physical sciences]], [[chemistry]] and engineering for food and related industries.  Food engineering includes, but is not limited to, the application of [[agricultural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] principles to food materials. Food engineers provide the technological knowledge transfer essential to the [[cost-effective]] production and [[commercialization]] of food products and services. Physics, chemistry, and mathematics are fundamental to understanding and engineering products and operations in the [[food industry]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0123985307 | title=Introduction to Food Engineering (5th ed.) | publisher=Academic Press |author1=Singh , R Paul |author2=Dennis R. Heldman | year=2013 | pages=1 | isbn=978-0123985309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food engineering encompasses a wide range of activities. Food engineers are employed in food processing, food machinery, [[packaging]], [[ingredient]] manufacturing, instrumentation, and control. Firms that design and build food processing plants, consulting firms, government agencies, [[pharmaceutical]] companies, and [[health-care]] firms also employ food engineers. Specific food engineering activities include:

*  drug/food products;
* design and installation of food/biological/pharmaceutical production processes;
* design and operation of environmentally responsible waste treatment systems;
* marketing and technical support for manufacturing plants.

==Topics==
In the development of food engineering, one of the many challenges is to employ modern tools, technology, and knowledge, such as computational materials science and [[nanotechnology]], to develop new products and processes. Simultaneously, improving quality, safety, and security remain critical issues in food engineering study. New packaging materials and techniques are being developed to provide more protection to foods, and novel preservation technology is emerging. Additionally, [[process control]] and [[process automation|automation]] regularly appear among the top priorities identified in food engineering. Advanced monitoring and control systems are developed to facilitate automation and flexible food manufacturing. Furthermore, [[energy saving]] and minimization of environmental problems continue to be important food engineering issues, and significant progress is being made in [[waste management]], efficient utilization of energy, and reduction of effluents and emissions in food production.

Typical topics include:food people
* Advances in classical unit operations in engineering applied to food manufacturing
* Progresses in the transport and [[Food storage|storage]] of liquid and solid foods
* Developments in heating, chilling and [[frozen foode|freezing]] of foods
* Advanced mass transfer in foods
* New chemical and biochemical aspects of food engineering and the use of kinetic analysis
* New techniques in dehydration, thermal processing, non-thermal processing, [[Food extrusion|extrusion]], liquid food concentration, membrane processes and applications of membranes in food processing
* Shelf-life, electronic indicators in [[inventory management]], and sustainable technologies in food processing
* Modern [[Food packaging|packaging]], cleaning, and sanitation technologies.

The '''Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network''' (GRaPH-Int) is an international collaboration of experts and researchers focused in the area of population health. The principal goal of the network is to promote the translation of [[genome]]-based science and technology into improvements in [[population health]].

One of GRaPH-Int's key features is the integration of knowledge from a range of disciplines, such as genome-based science, [[population sciences]], the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. The ‘Int’ underscores the interdisciplinarity of the collaboration, but also signifies that it is international and integrated.

==Mission==
The mission of the Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network (GRaPH-Int) is to promote an [[international]] collaboration that facilitates the responsible and effective integration of genome-based knowledge and technologies into public policies, programmes, and services for improving [[population health]].

==History==

=== Bellagio Initiative ===
Modern research in [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], boosted by information emerging from the [[Human Genome Project]], offers new opportunities for the promotion of [[population health]]. Anticipated benefits include more effective population-based public health disease [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] and control activities; population [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] and predictive [[genetic testing]] for common multi-factorial diseases; and targeted populations-based [[interventions]].&lt;ref name="ShattuckLecture"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Collins | first =FS | title =Shattuck lecture – medical and societal consequences of the Human Genome Project | journal =English Journal of Medicine | volume =34 | issue =1 | pages = 28–37 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, mining the genome-based information for potential benefits and ensuring that they are effectively implemented, with appropriate attention to avoiding harm, has proven to be an enormous task. A new field within public health, called [[public health genomics]] has evolved which addresses these issues.&lt;ref name="GenPublicHealth"&gt;{{cite book | last =Khoury | first =MJ |author2=W Burke |author3=EJ Thompson | title =Genetics and public health in the 21st century | publisher= Oxford University Press. |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntroPHGenetics"&gt;{{cite book | last =Stewart | first =A |author2=P Brice |author3=H Burton |author4=P Pharaoh |author5=S Sanderson |author6=R Zimmern | title =Genetics, Health Care and Public Policy. An Introduction to Public Health Genetics. | publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting of experts was convened in [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]] [[Italy]] in 2005 with funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to address the tasks involved in deriving public health benefit from this vast array of new knowledge. The delegates saw the need for an international network, which would promote the goals of public health genomics. Based on discussions of the challenges involved, they developed the framework and priorities of the Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network (GRaPH-Int).  The Bellagio group defined GRaPH-Int as a network of individuals who are interested in the impact of the interaction between genes and the environment on population health &lt;ref name="BellagioGroup"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Burke | first=W |author2=MJ Khoury |author3=A Stewart |author4=RL Zimmern  | title =Bellagio Group. The path from genome-based research to population health: development of an international public health genomics network. | journal = Genetics in Medicine | date=July 2006 | volume=8 | issue=7 | pages= 451–458 | doi =10.1097/01.gim.0000228213.72256.8c | pmid= 16845279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Bellagio meeting, The GRaPH-Int website was launched at the 4th International DNA Sampling Conference - Montreal, June 2006.

==Goals==
GRaPH-Int aims to establish itself as an international network that promotes the goals of public health, engages international experts, and shares knowledge and resources. The following six goals have identified for the network:

*To provide an international forum for dialogue and collaboration
*To promote relevant research
*To support the development of an integrated knowledge base
*To promote education and training
*To encourage communication and engagement with the public and other stakeholders

==Enterprise==
The GRaPH-Int Enterprise was developed and introduced at the Bellagio workshop as a conceptual and systematic description of the flow of information. It describes the process of translating genome-based science and technology into improvements in population health.

==Bioportal==
The recent overload of information on public health genome-based science necessitates the creation of an international search engine to link policymakers, researchers and public health professionals to national policy statements, epidemiological data, public health, news and events. GRaPH-Int has undertaken the task of developing this service, and the first phase of development began in 2007.

This search engine, referred to as the Bioportal, will optimize searches on:
*the ethical, legal and social issues surrounding public health genome-based science;
*public health genome-based literature;
*epidemiological data; and
*public health genome-based news and events.

== History ==

The creation  of Grand Challenges Canada  was based on  the [[Grand Challenges in Global Health]] model of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Grand Challenges Canada Launched"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/announcement/grand-challenges-canada-launched

In 2007, Singer wrote an [[op-ed]] in the [[National Post]] that made the argument for a parallel organization that would catalyze innovation from Canada and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/national-post-latest-edition/20051109/281870113838344|title=Think Small|publisher=[[National Post]]|date=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew the attention of the Canadian government, leading to the creation of Grand Challenges Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40597542
|title=Grandmother power in Canada's global aid
|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was founded with CAD$225 million over 5 years from the [[2008 Canadian federal budget]] to "support breakthrough research that addresses critical global health problems to bring lasting improvements to the health and lives of people in low-income countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/health/Inventor+uses+stinky+socks+fight+malaria/5095013/story.html

The current dual sector system is in the process of being replaced with a National Health System that aims to provide [[universal coverage]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hio.org.cy/docs/mercer_report_october2013.pdf|title=ACTUARIAL STUDY OF CYPRUS NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM.|last=|first=|date=|website=Health Insurance Organization|publisher=Mercer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Health System is estimated to save €292 million from 2016-2025 compared to the predicted expenditures of the current system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The public health sector managed by the Ministry of Health provided free services to approximately 83% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title="Coverage for health care"|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/health_glance_eur-2016-50-en|journal=Health at a Glance: Europe 2016: State of Health in the EU Cycle|volume=|pages=153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public coverage includes dental, mental health and pharmaceutical services, as well as general public health resources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/180616/1/ccs_cyp_en.pdf?ua=1|title=Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS) - Cyprus|last=|first=|date=2014|website=WHO Regional Office for Europe|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three government bills and regulations introducing the national health system, [[Gesy]], were agreed by parliament on 16th June 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3656">In the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the quality of [[Uzbekistan]]’s [[health care]] has declined. Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian [[emigration]] in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s, [[anesthetics]], and [[antibiotics]] are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to [[free health care]], in the post-Soviet era [[bribery]] has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Uzbekistan.pdf Uzbekistan country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health status ==
Among the most common diseases are those associated with polluted [[drinking water]]: [[typhoid]], [[hepatitis]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], and various types of [[cancer]]. The chief causes of death are, in order of frequency, disorders of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems and infectious and parasitic diseases. The reported incidence of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) has increased sharply beginning in 2002, partly because of a new government reporting policy and partly because of increased [[drug abuse]] In 2005 about 5,600 cases of HIV were known, after 2,000 new cases appeared in 2004. At least two-thirds of cases have been linked with drug abuse. The geographic centers of the HIV cases are [[Tashkent]] and [[Surkhandarya Province]] on the [[Afghanistan]] border. Expanding drug trafficking through Uzbekistan has led to increased drug addiction in urban areas. Some HIV treatment and counseling centers exist. There are 27.4 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants or 2.74 per 1,000 people.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Health/Physicians/Per-1,000-people|title=Countries Compared by Health &gt; Physicians &gt; Per 1,000 people. International Statistics at NationMaster.com|website=www.nationmaster.com|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal and child health ===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Uzbekistan is 30.  This is compared with 44.6 in 2008 and 61.1 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 38 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 48. In Uzbekistan the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 1400.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/data/sowmy/UZ|title=UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Senator [[Joseph S. Clark Jr.|Joseph S. Clark]]'s and Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s tour of the [[Mississippi Delta]]''' occurred on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer [[Marian Wright]], Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to [[Mississippi]] to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]] to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarkesdale]], stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing for a series of reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.

== Background ==
[[File:Mississippi Delta Cotton Pickers.jpg|thumb|Black cotton pickers in the Mississippi Delta c. 1966|275px]]

In 1967, the majority of legislative program supporting the United States government's "[[War on Poverty]]" was due to expire. In an attempt to generate national interest in renewing funding for the effort, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|United States Senate Committee on Labor]]'s Subcommittee on Poverty held a series of hearings related to hunger, starting March 15. One of  first the testifying witnesses was [[Marian Wright]], a 27-year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]'s [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]] in [[Mississippi]].{{sfn|Guthman|Allen|1993|p=199}} She told the subcommittee that increased [[Mechanised agriculture|mechanization]] and requirements that [[cotton]] fields [[Crop rotation|lie fallow]] under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black [[sharecropper]]s out of work in the [[Mississippi Delta]].{{sfn|Shesol|1998|p=329}} In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]].{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=794}} With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [the senators] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and the number of people who are going around and begging just to feed their children."{{sfn|Tye|2016|pp=348−349}}

Chairman [[Joseph S. Clark Jr.|Joseph S. Clark]] suggested that the subcommittee travel to Mississippi to verify Wright's testimony. Of the subcommittee's nine members, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Jacob Javits]], [[George Murphy]] agreed to the idea and accompanied him. Kennedy dispatched his aide [[Peter Edelman]] to get an advanced view on the situation. Edelman spoke extensively with Wright, whom he would marry 15 months later.{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=794}}

== Trip to the Delta ==
The subcommittee members flew into [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on April 9. That evening the senators dined with prominent Mississippians, including [[Oscar Clark Carr Jr.|Oscar Carr]] and [[Charles Evers]]. Carr later described Kennedy as "a very shy man" who "continuously asked questions." Evers said "We talked and talked and he listened."{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=794}} Local civil rights activist [[Amzie Moore]] acted as Kennedy's host.{{sfn|Wilkie|2002|p=169}}

=== Hearing in Jackson ===
A field hearing was scheduled for April 10. Mississippi Senator [[John Stennis]], a staunch [[Racial segregation|segregationist]], was scheduled to be interviewed. He disapproved of the federal efforts to improve the economic situation of black people and sought to discredit them by attacking the [[Head Start (program)|Head Start program]]'s parent agency, the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CDGM). The Head Start project provided services to impoverished children and was funded with grants from the federal government, thereby preventing state authorities from interfering with its activities.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|pp=67–68}} By potentially improving the socioeconomic status of black Mississippians, Head Start threatened the political power base that dominated the state. Just days after money for the program had been appropriated, Stennis and state officials began scrutinizing it and requesting financial records.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|p=68}} In the days before Stennis' scheduled testimony Jackson's two newspapers, both supportive of segregation, ran several stories about the senator's planned critique. Upon the poverty subcommittee's arrival in the city, Chairman Clark announced that he considered questions concerning Head Start and funding irregularities to already be answered and that the hearing would not spend significant time discussing the issue. Stennis responded by leaking his draft testimony to the press.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|p=68}}

The subcommittee hearing took place in the Olympic Ballroom of Hotel Heidelberg in Jackson. It was originally supposed to take place in a room meant to accommodate 300 persons, but the subcommittee relocated after local media attention stirred enough interest to bring the crowd to about 1,000 people. In his opening remarks, Clark stated that the hearing intended to be "neither a [[witch hunt]] or a whitewash. We are here to find out the basic facts."{{sfn|Meacham|2018|pp=70–72}} Stennis was called as the first witness. He admitted that there was poverty in his state, but posited that federal anti-poverty programs were overrunning expected costs and that he wished to support taxpayers. He then declared that the federal government had bypassed "responsible, honest, capable local leadership" and in favor of northerners and as a result its offices had become "a stake hold of beatniks and immorality". He requested that the governor be empowered to suspend "any project he determines not in the public interest" and finished by highlighting the fact that $500,000–$650,000 dollars worth of CDGM's funds were proclaimed by a government audit to be unaccounted for.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|p=74}}

Clark then allowed members of the subcommittee to question Stennis. Kennedy presented a private report conducted by a New York-based firm at the behest of the college that hosted CDGM. According to the new audit, the amount of wasted funds was deemed to be "relatively minor" and no evidence was found to substantiate the government's allegation. Stennis was flustered and declared that the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]] of which he was a member should have been informed of the conflicting calculations. He concluded, "It's another illustration of the mysterious way in which this independent agency operates," thanked the committee for their time, and left the hotel.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|pp=74–75}} Testimony was then given about conditions in the Delta from both public officials and local impoverished inhabitants.{{sfn|Guthman|Allen|1993|p=199}} A black doctor stated that the state suffered from a high [[infant mortality rate]], and that the rate was twice as high for black babies. He added that the mortality rate of black babies from early childhood illnesses was five times greater than that for white infants. Head Start workers testified that older children they had examined displayed symptoms of anemia and other nutritional deficiencies. It was also stated that the decline in demand for agriculture labor increased unemployment, and that many of the adults were unskilled, did not have access to adequate transportation or training programs, or faced racial discrimination in their work. Robert Ezelle, former chairman of the Jackson Chamber of Commerce, asserted that the greatest problem afflicting Mississippi was its dysfunctional education system. He stated that 200,000 adults (out of the total 2 million) had not received schooling beyond the fourth grade and that a further 40,000 had never had any education.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|p=75}}

Civil rights activist [[Unita Blackwell]] defended the Head Start program, saying it was the only anti-poverty initiative that addressed the locals' problems. When quested by Kennedy about hunger, she stated that there was a problem with hunger in her county and that the shift from surplus food aid to the stamp program had worsened the situation.{{sfn|Meacham|2018|pp=78–79}} Wright spoke once more, asserting, "After two civil rights bills and the third year of the poverty bill, the...Negro in Mississippi is poorer than he was, he has less housing, he is badly educated; he is almost in despair."{{sfn|Guthman|Allen|1993|p=199}} Kennedy took his greatest interest in the locals' statements. Afterwards, he told Evers, "I want to see it."{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=794}}

=== Kennedy's and Clark's tour ===
[[File:Mississippi Delta House Porch 1960s.jpg|thumb|A run-down house in the Mississippi Delta c. 1966|275px|left]]

The following day Kennedy and Clark drove into the Delta area, while the other senators flew back to [[Washington D.C.]] They were accompanied by Evers, Wright, Moore, Edelman, Carr, a dozen or so reporters from state and national newspapers and the [[Big Three television networks]], and an assortment of [[U.S. Marshal]]s, [[Mississippi Highway Patrol|state highway patrolmen]], and local police.{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=350}}{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=795}}{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}} That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]] and a nearby [[tent city]] that had been established by striking farm workers. After lunch, Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80&amp;nbsp;mph down [[U.S. Route 61]] to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore.{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}}

Their first stop was a dilapidated [[shotgun house]] in [[Cleveland, Mississippi|Cleveland]], in which 15 people resided. Holes were present in the flooring and roofing, and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter. One boy told Kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was [[molasses]], and that he didn't eat any lunch. Walking to the next house, Kennedy whispered to Edelman, "I've been to third-world countries and I've never seen anything like this."{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=349}}

The following home belonged to a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20-month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger.{{sfn|Thomas|2013|p=339}} Kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek. He said, "My God, I didn't know this kind of thing existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know."{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=795}} Clark labeled what lay before them a "national disgrace." Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry.{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=349}} Kennedy stepped outside and quietly remarked, "We spend $75 billion a year on armaments and $3 billion a year on dogs. We have to do more for these children that didn't ask to be born into this." Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, "Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side."{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}} Langford added, "I don't know of anybody starving down here." Kennedy responded, "Step over here and I'll introduce you to some."{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=350}} Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to "find fault," but rather "just to see if we can do anything about it."{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}}

The senators' motorcade continued on towards [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], but Kennedy asked that they stop in the small town of [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi|Mound Bayou]]. With no advanced notice, Kennedy, his aides, and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a 39-year-old man named Andrew Jackson, his wife, and their six kids.{{sfn|Wilkie|2002|p=169}}{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}} There was no electricity, running water, or toilet. There were two pictures in the house; one of the Glorybound Singers (a Clarksdale-based [[Gospel music|Gospel]] group) and another of [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=350}} Jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked, "Is you really Mr. Bobby Kennedy?" Kennedy smiled and shook his hand, replying, "Yes. And are you really Mr. [[Andrew Jackson]]?"{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}}

A thousand people—mostly black school children—awaited the senators outside the Clarksdale Neighborhood Center. The two stayed in the city for only 20 minutes; Clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled, as their flight in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was "going to catch that plane." Meanwhile, Kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd. He said he was glad to have made the trip, and told them, "The problems of poverty are problems of all United States citizens." He was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs, though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued onto the highway.{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Government response ===
Kennedy returned to Washington D.C. on the evening of April 10. He walked in on his family having dinner at [[Hickory Hill (McLean, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]], highly agitated and, in the words of his daughter [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend|Kathleen]], "ashen faced." He announced to his children, "In Mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room. The children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food. Do you know how lucky you are? Do you ''know'' how ''lucky'' you are? Do something for your country."{{sfn|Thomas|2013|p=339}}

The following morning Kennedy and Edelman met with [[Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Orville Freeman]], and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families that had no income.{{sfn|Thomas|2013|p=339}} Though Freeman was keen to avoiding a political dispute with Kennedy, he feared that by concurring with the senator he would anger the Southern bloc in Congress that held great influence over his department's budget.{{sfn|Guthman|Allen|1993|p=201}} He deflected, "Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income." Kennedy replied, "I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [Edelman] here back down there with some of your people... Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?" Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps.{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=351}} Returning to New York on April 12, Kennedy exclaimed to the wife of one of his aides, "You don't know what I saw! I have done nothing in my life! Everything I have done was a waste! Everything I have done was worthless!"{{sfn|Schmitt|2011|p=179}} When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, Clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty. He also said that the United States needed a "reawakening of a conscience."{{sfn|Wilkie|2014|loc=Mississippi—Now. And Then}} The entire subcommittee sent a letter to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] about their discoveries and the findings of the Department of Agriculture officials who had been dispatched to the Delta, writing about "conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger...that can only be described as shocking" and imploring federal government to declare an emergency. Johnson never responded.{{sfn|Guthman|Allen|1993|p=201}}{{sfn|Eisinger|1998|p=78}}

Several [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson administration]] officials, in addition to Freeman, were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the Delta. Johnson had seen the news coverage of the event and on April 17 he ordered that his top domestic aide, [[Joseph Califano]], give him a "quick report." Califano replied 20 minutes later, writing that Freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administration's food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by Congress.{{sfn|Shesol|1998|p=330}} When his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan, Johnson, already uneasy about the food stamp program, rejected the proposal. Kennedy made a direct appeal to Johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for 40,000–60,000 of the most impoverished Mississippians. Johnson ignored it, a decision an editorial in ''[[The Nation]]'' claimed was due to the fact that he was "incapable of rising above personal politics."{{sfn|Shesol|1998|p=330}} Once news of the situation in the Delta went public, Mississippi Governor [[Paul B. Johnson Jr.]] dismissed the report as the product of "Socialist-minded senators." He also told journalist [[Bill Minor]], "all the Negroes I've seen around here are so fat they shine." Following the publication in June of a particularly severe report compiled by the [[Field Foundation of New York]], Governor Johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about children's nutrition. Its findings concurred with those of the Field Foundation.&lt;ref name= meacham&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.clarionledger.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/04/10/50-years-ago-rfk-exposed-hunger-mississippi-delta/100296752/| title = 50 years ago, RFK exposed hunger in Mississippi Delta| last = Meacham| first = Ellen| date = 10 April 2017| publisher = ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]''| access-date = 23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11 and July 12, Clark held another set of congressional hearings on hunger in the Delta to pressure Freeman, attracting widespread media coverage.{{sfn|Guthman|Allen|1993|p=201}}{{sfn|Eisinger|1998|p=77}} The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators Stennis and [[James Eastland]] (also a staunch segregationist), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray.{{sfn|Ferris|2014|p=294}} Kennedy called [[Developmental psychology|child psychologist]] [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]] to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta.{{sfn|Thomas|2013|p=339}} One North Carolina doctor described "an unwritten policy on the part of those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing [[libel]] against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months ago[...]and we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi."{{sfn|Ferris|2014|p=294}} Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, "It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal."{{sfn|Schmitt|2011|p=182}}

In the end, Kennedy managed to amend the renewal of the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]] to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services.{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=351}} Despite resistance from other Southern legislators and a lack of support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed.{{sfn|Schmitt|2011|p=182}} The [[United States Senate|Senate]] also voted unanimously to create a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs|Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]].{{sfn|Maurer|Sobal|1995|p=19}} Kennedy subsequently embarked on more "poverty tours" to investigate and publicize impoverished conditions across the United States. He frequently invoked the Delta tour in legislative discussions and during [[Robert F. Kennedy presidential campaign, 1968|his 1968 presidential campaign]].{{sfn|Jones|2017|p=226}}

=== Public reaction ===
[[File:Poor People's March at Lafayette Park ppmsca.04302.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators of the Poor People's March on Washington|300px]]
The media coverage from the event brought national attention to the food insecurity issues in the Delta. Most Americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area. Almost immediately, the Field Foundation of New York dispatched a team of doctors to Mississippi to examine children and verify the senators' findings.{{sfn|Maurer|Sobal|1995|p=19}} They labeled the conditions they observed a "national disaster," documenting cases of [[Kwashiorkor]], [[Rickets]], and other signs of malnutrition and starvation.{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=351}} One doctor likened state of affairs to the worst he had seen in eastern [[Kenya]].{{sfn|Ferris|2014|p=294}} This countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation. The Citizens Crusade Against Poverty, an advocacy group already studying the problems in the Delta, quickly created a "Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition in the United States." In April 1968, the board published a report of its findings, entitled ''Hunger U.S.A.''. This was shortly followed by a critique of the [[National School Lunch Program]] by a coalition of women's organizations.{{sfn|Maurer|Sobal|1995|p=19}}

In conversation with Wright and Edelemen, Kennedy remarked, "The only way there's going to be change is if it's more uncomfortable for Congress not to act than it is for them to act...You've got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to Washington and stay here until[...]Congress gets really embarrassed and they have to act." The following week Wright proposed the idea to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who subsequently organized the [[Poor People's March on Washington]].{{sfn|Schlesinger Jr.|2002|p=873}} Around the same time [[CBS]] broadcast a major documentary, ''Hunger in America'', which had been made on the suggestion of Kennedy to television executive [[Don Hewitt]].{{sfn|Raphael|2010|p=40}}

== Legacy ==
The trip to the Mississippi Delta made hunger a public issue of interest in the United States.{{sfn|Maurer|Sobal|1995|p=19}}{{sfn|Poppendieck|1999|p=10}} Following the revelations of food insecurity, a powerful anti-hunger movement emerged in the country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones. Federal expenditures on food assistance grew by 500 percent over the next decade.{{sfn|Poppendieck|1999|p=11}} Marian Wright would later say that the episode "set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in the virtual elimination of [[Hunger in the United States|hunger in America]] during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon years]]."{{sfn|Tye|2016|p=351}}

The Mississippi Delta tour was featured in the 1980s American civil rights documentary series, ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]''.{{sfn|Jones|2017|p=226}} In May 1997, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], inspired by the original trip, visited the Delta to bring attention to "race and gender and poverty and children in America."&lt;ref name= stone&gt;{{cite news| last = Stone| first = Andrea| title = New dawn in Mississippi Delta| newspaper = USA Today| date = 30 May 1997| url = https://search.proquest.com/docview/408733895?accountid=12725}}&lt;/ref&gt; From July 11 until July 12, 2017, Wright led local activists and politicians on a bus tour of the region to observe the 50th anniversary of the event. It was followed by a panel discussion on poverty, hunger, and healthcare in the Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 50th anniversary tour to Mississippi Delta furthers conversation on poverty and hunger| newspaper = Jackson Advocate| date = 20 July 2017| url = https://search.proquest.com/docview/1928322108?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=12725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lindsay June Sandiford'''  (born 25 June 1956) is a former legal secretary and convicted drug smuggler from [[Redcar]], [[Teesside]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]] who was [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|sentenced to death]] in January 2013 by a court in [[Indonesia]] after being found guilty of smuggling [[cocaine]] into [[Bali]]. Although death is the maximum punishment for drugs-related offences under Indonesian law, the severity of the sentence was greeted with shock because prosecutors had not recommended the death penalty for Sandiford. The ruling was also condemned by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] and anti–death penalty campaigners.

Sandiford was arrested on 19 May 2012 after arriving at the island's [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] on a flight from [[Bangkok]] when a routine luggage search uncovered the drugs stash. Under subsequent police interrogation she claimed to have been coerced into carrying the drugs by a criminal gang that had made threats against her family, and took part in a [[sting operation]] to arrest several other individuals she alleged to be part of a drugs trafficking ring.

In December 2012, she was convicted of drug smuggling at Denpasar District Court and sentenced to [[Execution by firing squad|death by firing squad]] in January 2013. By contrast, the others involved in the case were convicted of lesser drugs-related offences and received custodial sentences. Prosecutors had recommended Sandiford should also receive a custodial sentence because of her willingness to cooperate with police, but the panel of judges overseeing the hearing felt her actions had undermined Indonesia's anti-drugs policy and concluded there were no mitigating circumstances in her favour.

Sandiford subsequently launched an appeal against the court's decision. She had funded her own defence costs during the initial trial but had no money for representation at appeal. Funds were subsequently raised to pay for an appeal lawyer, and the appeals procedure began. In the United Kingdom lawyers applied to seek a judicial review of the government's stance of not providing financial aid for Britons facing criminal proceedings overseas, but their legal challenge was dismissed by judges at the [[High Court of England and Wales]] on the grounds that Sandiford had little chance in successfully appealing the sentence. An appeal arguing the government's position was unlawful was also rejected. The British government submitted a statement to the Court in Bali alleging unlawful behaviour towards Sandiford by officials at the time of her arrest. The High Court in Bali rejected the first stage of Sandiford's appeal in April 2013, upholding the death sentence. An appeal was subsequently lodged with the country's Supreme Court, but in August this was also rejected.

Sandiford was raised in the north-eastern town of Redcar, Teesside in [[North Yorkshire]], before moving to London.

Sandiford was arrested on 19 May 2012 after arriving at [[Bali]]'s [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] on a [[Thai Airways]] flight from [[Bangkok]], Thailand, when 4.8&amp;nbsp;kg (10.6&amp;nbsp;lb) of cocaine was found in the lining of her suitcase during a routine search.&lt;ref name=Channel4News-2012-05-29&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/briton-faces-death-penalty-over-drugs-smuggling |title=Briton faces death penalty over Bali drugs 'smuggling' |work=Channel 4 News |publisher=ITN |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126063107/http://www.channel4.com/news/briton-faces-death-penalty-over-drugs-smuggling |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed to have been forced into carrying the drugs by a gang who had threatened to harm members of her family if she did not comply with their demands.&lt;ref name=Channel4News-2012-05-29/&gt; When informed she could receive the death penalty for drug trafficking she broke down and told police that she had been asked to carry the drugs for Julian Ponder, a British antiques dealer living in Bali, and his partner Rachel Dougall, and agreed to help in a sting operation to arrest them.&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-01-22/&gt; Sandiford was booked into a hotel with an undercover police officer, where she went about contacting members of the alleged syndicate.

==Trial and conviction==
At her trial prosecutors alleged that Sandiford met Dougall and Beales at a hotel in Bangkok on 17 May 2012, where arrangements were made for her to courier the cocaine into Bali. She arrived on the island two days later.&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-01-22&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Robinson |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2266463/Lindsay-Sandiford-A-drug-smuggler-suburbia-King-Queen-Bali-plot-import-1-6m-cocaine.html |title=Lindsay Sandiford: A drug smuggler from suburbia, the 'King and Queen of Bali' and the plot to import £1.6m of cocaine |newspaper=Daily Mail |publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130420012720/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2266463/Lindsay-Sandiford-A-drug-smuggler-suburbia-King-Queen-Bali-plot-import-1-6m-cocaine.html |archivedate=20 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her defence, Sandiford claimed that she had been pressured into carrying the drugs by a gang who had made threats against her children, while her lawyers argued she was suffering from mental health problems.&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-01-22a/&gt; In a statement to the court she expressed regret over her involvement, "I would like to begin by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement.

"There is … evidence to suggest that a trafficker would seek someone who was vulnerable. Having reviewed extracts from Lindsay's medical records I know that Lindsay has a history of mental health issues … This may have unfortunately made her an attractive target for threats, manipulation and coercion."&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-01-22a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian-2013-01-22/&gt;

Sandiford was convicted on 19 December, with a recommendation from prosecutors that she be spared the death penalty – the maximum punishment for drug trafficking under Indonesian law – because of her age and cooperation with police, and instead receive a 15-year custodial sentence. On the same day, Rachel Dougall was found guilty of failing to report a crime, while Paul Beales was convicted of possessing hashish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eimer |first=David |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/9758850/British-grandmother-faces-15-years-in-Bali-jail-for-drug-smuggling.html |title=British grandmother faces 15 years in Bali jail for drug smuggling |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223092448/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/9758850/British-grandmother-faces-15-years-in-Bali-jail-for-drug-smuggling.html |archivedate=23 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later received one year and four-year prison sentences respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/british-grandmother-lindsay-sandiford-may-appeal-bali-death-sentence/story-e6frea6u-1226559748961 |title=British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford may appeal Bali death sentence |publisher=News Limited |newspaper=The Advertiser |date=23 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Ponder was cleared of drug smuggling, but convicted of the possession of narcotics in January 2013, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-01-29&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21240673 |work=BBC News |title=Julian Ponder jailed for six years for Bali drug possession |publisher=BBC |date=29 January 2013 |accessdate=29 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129020144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21240673 |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KerobokanPrison.jpg|thumb|left|Sandiford was held at [[Kerobokan Prison]] following her sentence.]]

Despite the prosecution's recommendation of leniency, at her sentencing hearing on 22 January 2013 a panel of judges ruled there were no mitigating circumstances in Sandiford's favour, and imposed a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21137649 |work=BBC News |title=Bali drugs: Death sentence for Briton Lindsay Sandiford |publisher=BBC |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122184154/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21137649 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Buncombe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/british-grandmother-lindsay-sandiford-weeps-as-she-is-sentenced-to-death-by-indonesian-court-for-drug-trafficking-8461071.html |title=British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford weeps as she is sentenced to death by Indonesian court for drug trafficking |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123163503/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/british-grandmother-lindsay-sandiford-weeps-as-she-is-sentenced-to-death-by-indonesian-court-for-drug-trafficking-8461071.html |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amser Simanjuntak, who headed the panel said Sandiford's actions had damaged Bali's reputation as a tourist destination and undermined Indonesia's fight against drugs, while his colleague, Komang Wijaya Adi said their decision had been influenced by several factors, including what was viewed as her lack of remorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/23/death-sentence-surprises-defendant.html |title=Death sentence surprises defendant |publisher=PT Bina Media Tenggara |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125231624/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/23/death-sentence-surprises-defendant.html |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Smith |first2= |last2=Rossington |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/lindsay-sandiford-sentenced-to-death-in-indonesia-1548903 |title=Lindsay Sandiford sentenced to death in Indonesia for smuggling £1.6million of cocaine |newspaper=Daily Mirror |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124101508/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/lindsay-sandiford-sentenced-to-death-in-indonesia-1548903 |archivedate=24 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was greeted with gasps from around the courtroom.&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-01-22a/&gt; In Indonesia an execution is generally carried out by firing squad, often at night in an isolated location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/british-woman-gets-bali-death-sentence-over-cocaine-smuggling/story-e6frf7jo-1226559509016 |title=British grandma gets Bali death sentence over cocaine smuggling |newspaper=Herald Sun |publisher=The Herald and Weekly Times |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the judgment Sandiford was led from the court in a distressed state, where she declined to speak to journalists before being escorted away by guards to be held at Bali's notorious [[Kerobokan Prison]].&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-01-22a/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/lindsay-june-sandiford-sentenced-death-indonesian-court-after-smuggling-25-million-worth-cocaine |title=Lindsay June Sandiford Sentenced To Death By Indonesian Court After Smuggling $2.5 Million Worth Of Cocaine Into Bali |publisher=Etienne Uzac |newspaper=International Business Times |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127011332/http://www.ibtimes.com/lindsay-june-sandiford-sentenced-death-indonesian-court-after-smuggling-25-million-worth-cocaine |archivedate=27 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her lawyers announced she would appeal, a process that can take several years under Indonesian law.&lt;ref name=Sky-News-2013-01-22&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1041142/bali-death-penalty-for-british-drug-smuggler |title=Bali: Death Penalty For British Drug Smuggler |publisher=British Sky Broadcasting |work=Sky News |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123100059/http://news.sky.com/story/1041142/bali-death-penalty-for-british-drug-smuggler |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae8d5054-64ae-11e2-ac53-00144feab49a.html#axzz2Iu5Opfte |title=UK woman sentenced to death in Indonesia |publisher=Pearson PLC |newspaper=Financial Times |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the sentence the British embassy in Indonesia said the United Kingdom "remains strongly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances" and that it was in touch with the UK government to discuss how best to provide Sandiford with legal representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lisnawati |first=Firdia |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/world/Indonesian+court+sentences+British+woman+death+over+drug/7852197/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216114152/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/world/Indonesian+court+sentences+British+woman+death+over+drug/7852197/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2013 |title=Indonesian court sentences 56-year-old British woman to death over drug smuggling to Bali |publisher= Postmedia Network|newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement to the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]], [[Hugo Swire]], Minister of State for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] expressed his concern about the decision. "We are aware that Lindsay Sandiford is facing the death penalty in Indonesia. We strongly object to the death penalty and continue to provide consular assistance to Lindsay and her family during this difficult time." He also said that [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] had raised the matter with his Indonesian counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Pearlman |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/9818499/Lindsay-Sandiford-execution-cruel-in-the-extreme.html |title=Lindsay Sandiford execution 'cruel in the extreme' |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123202654/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/9818499/Lindsay-Sandiford-execution-cruel-in-the-extreme.html |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Horwood]], MP for [[Cheltenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheltenham]], Sandiford's most recent UK residence, expressed his shock at the sentence.

The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, "She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water.

===UK government legal challenge===
On the day Sandiford lodged her preliminary appeal the London-based law firm [[Leigh Day]] which is working with Reprieve on her behalf said it would seek a judicial review of the UK government's position that it does not provide funds for the legal representation of British nationals facing criminal proceedings overseas.&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-01-28&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-21228605 |work=BBC News |title=Death penalty Briton Lindsay Sandiford requests appeal |publisher=BBC |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131063124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-21228605 |archivedate=31 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reprieve believed that by not providing Sandiford, a British citizen, with financial help to cover her legal costs the government had breached its obligations towards her.&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-01-29/&gt; The legal challenge was heard at the High Court before [[Elizabeth Gloster|Mrs Justice Gloster]] and [[Nicola Davies (judge)|Mrs Justice Nicola Davies]] on 31 January, but the case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21272490 |work=BBC News |title=Bali drugs: Lindsay Sandiford loses legal funding case |publisher=BBC |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131185449/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21272490 |archivedate=31 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Armstrong |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lindsay-sandiford-gran-on-death-row-1567489 |title=Lindsay Sandiford: Gran on death row for smuggling drugs loses legal battle with British government over appeal funding |newspaper=Daily Mirror |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131205157/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lindsay-sandiford-gran-on-death-row-1567489 |archivedate=31 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges ruled that Sandiford had "no reasonable prospect of success", remarks that attracted criticism from anti–death penalty campaigners.&lt;ref name=Telegraph-2013-02-11/&gt;

Sandiford appealed against this decision, but it was again rejected at the High Court in April 2013, by a three-judge panel, chaired by [[Master of the Rolls]] [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]]. By then Sandiford's first line of appeal against her death sentence had been rejected, and she required £6,000 towards her legal costs for the next stage of her appeal.{{efn|The full cost of Sandiford's appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court was £8,000. £2,000 of this had been raised at the time the case was heard on 22 April 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-04-22/&gt; By 1 May £10,000 had been raised.&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-05-01/&gt;}} In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was "most unfortunate" Sandiford required "relatively speaking ... [a] very small sum indeed" for her legal costs, but that this "cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. It may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days."&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-04-22&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22244809 |work=BBC News |title=Drug smuggler Lindsay Sandiford loses appeal for legal funds |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422113011/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22244809 |archivedate=22 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges published their reasons for rejecting the appeal on 22 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sophie |last=Barley |url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/teesside-gran-lindsay-sandifords-death-4002129 |title=Teesside gran Lindsay Sandiford's death appeal ruling "not unlawful" |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Evening Gazette |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=28 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906165714/http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/teesside-gran-lindsay-sandifords-death-4002129 |archivedate=6 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was "unlawful" but that the High Court had been "right to conclude" it was not. "As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But the question is not whether the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy. It is whether the policy that he has produced is irrational. I am in no doubt that the policy is not irrational. It is based on reasoning which is coherent and which is neither arbitrary nor perverse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/north-east/death-appeal-ruling-not-unlawful-1-5696402 |title=Death appeal ruling 'not unlawful' |publisher=Johnston Press |newspaper=Hartlepool Mail |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written interview with [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] presenter [[Victoria Derbyshire]] shortly after the UK appeal was rejected, Sandiford said that the Foreign Office's stance was "tantamount to condoning the death penalty" and claimed she was receiving little support from them. "The government and FCO are doing all they can to resist me at this difficult time."&lt;ref name=BBC-2013-05-01&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22365358 |work=BBC News |title=Lindsay Sandiford accuses UK of condoning death penalty |publisher=BBC |date=1 May 2013 |accessdate=2 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502215200/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22365358 |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maddox Wing''' is an instrument utilized by [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]], [[orthoptics|orthoptists]] and [[optometry|optometrists]] in the measurement of [[strabismus]] (misalignment of the eyes; commonly referred to as a ''squint'' or ''lazy eye'' by the lay person). It is a quantitative and subjective method of measuring the size of a strabismic deviation by dissociation of the eyes brought about by two septa which are placed in such a way as to present  fields to either eye separated by a diaphragm at the centre.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;  The right eye sees a red and white arrow, each of which point to a scale with numbers seen by the left eye; the red arrow points to the vertical red scale and the white arrow points to the horizontal white scale. A third arrow located to the right and below the horizontal white scale is used to measure torsion

[[File:Maddox Wing..jpg|thumb|The Maddox Wing]]

== Indications ==
The Maddox Wing measures the size of [[heterophoria]]s (latent deviations) and small [[heterotropia]]s (manifest deviations) at near when [[normal retinal correspondence]] (NRC) is present. It is especially helpful when patients present with symptoms of [[diplopia]] (double vision) with no apparent cause.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; Unsuspected torsional deviations may also be revealed where there are no symptoms present. It is a quick and convenient method of measuring the size of a deviation and is generally used in association with a number of other tests before a full diagnosis is determined.

[[File:Maddox Wing.jpg|thumb|The scale card of the Maddox Wing, depicting the horizontal, vertical, torsional scales and their respective arrows.]]

== Equipment ==
'''The Handle:'''

The handle is retractable and is located at the base of the instrument. This is where the patient holds the apparatus.

'''The Eye Piece:'''

Located anteriorly, the eye piece is where the patient looks into.

'''The Eye-piece lens holder:'''

Mainly used to hold lens for patients who have difficulties seeing the board with their glasses

'''The Septa:'''

There are 2 septa that separates the eye piece so that the patient has two separate fields of view.

'''The Scale Card:'''

Used to measure the deviation of heterophorias, small heterotropias (with NRC) and also torsion. The scale card has the horizontal, vertical and torsional scales. The board also contains the red and white arrows. This will be further discuss throughout the video.

'''The Torsion Lever:'''

On the measuring board there is an adjustable lever which the patient subjectively aligns to measure torsion.

== Method ==
The Maddox Wing test is performed at near with the instrument held in reading position, slightly inferior (approximately 15° depression and 33&amp;nbsp;cm away). The room or location of the test should be brightly illuminated and the patient's optical correction (e.g. glasses, bifocals, multifocals, contact lens) is required to be worn. In the event that correction cannot be worn due to the obstruction of vision through the eye piece, lenses may be placed within the lens holder before each eye. The examiner instructs the patient to hold the Maddox Wing and identify the number that the white (vertical arrow) and red (horizontal arrow) arrows point to on their respective scales.

Example instructions and examiner questions:
* "Hold the device up to your eyes and look into the eye piece as if you're reading a book"
* "What number is the white arrow pointing to?"
* It is important for the examiner to ask "Is it actually pointing to the number (e.g. number 4) or in between two numbers (e.g. between the numbers 3 and 5)?" This avoids possible confusion as only the odd numbers show on one side of the scale and the even figures on the other, if misinterpreted, diagnosis may be incorrect.
* "What number is the red arrow pointing to?"
* " I want you to lift the red torsion lever and hold it parallel to the red arrow"

== Recording ==
'''Example:'''
# MW: cc exo 10∆ R/L 7∆ excyclo 4° ''OR'' MW:  cc  -10∆ R/L 7∆ excyclo 4°
# MW cc eso 5∆ ө

== Interpretation ==
With the maddox wing, you cannot differentiate between a manifest deviation or latent deviation. The white arrow on the white [[X-axis|X-Axis]] measures for horizontal deviations in which, odd numbers represent eso deviations and even numbers represents exo deviations. The red arrow on the red [[Y-axis|Y-Axis]] measures for vertical deviations; odd numbers represent right hyper deviations and even numbers represents left hyper deviations. In the absence of a deviated eye, both red and white arrows point to zero, indicating that there is no deviation present. The presence of torsion is determined subjectively; the patient is instructed to take hold of the torsion lever and make it straight.

== Advantages ==
* Time efficient method of measuring strabismus
* Measures horizontal, vertical and torsional deviations
* Hand held instrument
* Not a difficult skill to learn
* Can be used on children

== Disadvantages ==
* Contraindicated where [[Retinal correspondence|abnormal retinal correspondence (ARC)]] or suppression are present
* The associative nature of the test may cause irregularities in measurements
* Does not differentiate between latent and manifest strabismus
* Septa is easily bent, may lead to incorrect results as one eye sees both arrows and numbers
* Cannot be performed in the distance

== Considerations  ==
* Time must be allowed for dissociation of the eyes to take place
* Numbers and arrows should be seen clearly. Relaxation of accommodation can result in an increase in exophoria and a decrease in esophoria, leading to an inaccurate result
* The examiner should check the function of the Maddox Wing Instrument before use; the septa can be easily bent, leading to the septa not covering the intended view. When that happens one eye can see both arrows and numbers which gives inaccurate results.

The '''main course''' is the featured or primary dish in a [[meal]] consisting of several courses. It usually follows the [[entrée]] ("entry") course. 

==Usage==
In the United States and Canada (except [[Quebec]]), the main course is traditionally called an "'''entrée'''".&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/entr%C3%A9e|title=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/entree|title=entrée (noun) definition and synonyms - Macmillan Dictionary|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/entree_1 Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etiquette"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TL8PFlYRkUC&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=entree%20main%20course&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=entree%20main%20course&amp;f=false | title=Commonsense Etiquette: A Guide to Gracious, Simple Manners for the Twenty-First Century | year=1999 | author=Stewart, Marjabelle Young and Elizabeth Lawrence | publisher=St. Martin's Press | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; English-speaking Québécois follow the modern French use of the term entrée to refer to a [[Entrée|dish served before the main course]].

According to linguist Dan Jurafsky, North American usage ("entrée") retains the original French meaning of a substantial meat course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-22/sure-you-are-what-you-eatbut-youre-also-how-you-translate-menu|title=You are what you eat — and how you translate the menu|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sirloin steak.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A [[sirloin steak]] dinner. This may be the main course of a meal.]]

==Serving==
The main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish on a menu. The main ingredient is usually [[meat]], [[Fish (food)|fish]] or another protein source. It is most often preceded by an [[Hors d'œuvre|appetizer]], [[soup]] or [[salad]], and followed by a [[dessert]]. For those reasons the main course is sometimes referred to as the "meat course".

In formal dining, a well-planned main course can function as a sort of gastronomic apex or climax. In such a scheme, the preceding courses are designed to prepare for and lead up to the main course in such a way that the main course is anticipated and, when the scheme is successful, increased in its ability to satisfy and delight the diner. The courses following the main course then calm the [[palate]] and the [[stomach]], acting as a sort of [[dénouement]] or anticlimax.

==Early history==
History of medicine in Azerbaijan has deep roots. Ancient people believed in [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] for struggle against various sicknesses. Carvings and painted signs in [[Azykh Cave]] dated from the [[Stone Age]] evidence about it.&lt;ref name="axmedova"/&gt;
 
Early people used [[Herbalism|medicinal plants]] for treatment of different sicknesses. Their experience has developed and became a traditional medicine. Development of oral and written branches of [[traditional medicine]] was dividing with origination of writing.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva"&gt;{{cite web

Rich flora of Azerbaijan attracted attention of doctors and scientists from ancient times. A lot of medicinal plants were used for prophylaxis and treatment. Seeds, roots, flowers and leaves of these plants were used in treatment. Women easily observed the influence fruits, vegetables and medicinal tea upon organism and their influence upon [[cough]], [[bleeding]], ache, [[diarrhea]] and other illnesses.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt;

From ancient manuscripts it is known that they used not only plants, but were also acquainted with [[surgery]], treatment of [[tumor]]s and setting of [[Bone fracture|broken bones]]. For instance, [[Nariman Narimanov]] found a [[human skull]] dated from the 4th millennium BC ([[Bronze Age|Eneolithic]]) with traces of [[trepanning]] on it, in Erefli village of [[Agdam Rayon]].&lt;ref name="axmedova"&gt;{{cite web

R.Gasimova, who investigated the skull, said that “artificial trepanation was performed near junction of parietal and frontal bones”.&lt;ref name="axmedova"/&gt;

In 1958, pitchers dated from the 6th century BC with burned [[Rutaceae|rues]] which were used as medicine for treatment of [[rheumatism]], [[fever]] and prophylactics of various illnesses, were found out in Garakepektepe village of [[Mugan plain]] during archeological excavations.&lt;ref name="axmedova"/&gt;

[[Aromatherapy]] was also broadly spread. It was believed that smell of a [[quince]] strengthens body’s energy. [[Lemon]] was used for adjusting of [[nervous system]], and [[apple]] for stimulation of brain’s work.

In ancient times there was an active cultural interchange between Azerbaijanis and residents of [[Mesopotamia]]. [[Sesamum|Sesame]] oil and [[crocus]] were imported from [[Sumer]]. There is information about medicinal drugs and medicine in [[Avesta]], a sacred book of [[Zoroastrianism|fire worshippers]] and the ancient monument of people of Azerbaijan and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; There is also written that “a doctor has three weapons: word, herbs and a knife”. A doctor curing by words and suggestion was considered as the best at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Works by [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen|Claudius Galenus]] were popular there because of spreading of [[Christianity]] and [[Greek language]]. Some knowledge about medicine was taught in religious schools and churches.&lt;ref name= "faridalakbarli" /&gt;

==Development of medicine in the Middle Ages==
In this period medicine was quickly developing which is evidenced by archeological findings. For instance, polished marble vessels for [[antimony]] and golden brushes for applying it, which was used as anti-cough and antiemetic medicine in the [[Middle Ages]], were found out.&lt;ref name="axmedova"/&gt; Sick men drunk wine from these made of antimony cups. Various glass vessels used for preparation and storage of medicines, which were used by [[Alchemy|alchemists]] both in traditional medicine and [[pharmacology]], were found out in [[Şamaxı|Shamakhi]] during excavations. These findings confirm that people in Azerbaijan were engaged in pharmaceutics in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="axmedova"/&gt;

According to Farid Alakbarli, a historian Turkish traditional medicine which was called “Turkachare” and was similar to [[shamanism]] and treatment by wizardry and herbs began to be spread in the 4th century AD with entering of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes into Azerbaijan. In Turkish doctors were called gam, which meant “shaman” or otachi which meant “herbalist”. Herbals were called ota (ot is herb in translation from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]). Goddess ''Oleng'' was considered as the patroness of doctors.&lt;ref name="alakbarli"&gt;{{cite web

In VIII [[Shirvan]], where mainly [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]]ns and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] lived, was occupied by [[Arab people|Arabs]]. Sciences and culture developed due to mutual influence of cultures as a part of single [[Caliphate]]. Universities, observatories, libraries, [[mosque]]s and hospitals were built. Progress of medicine is observed namely in [[Islam]]ic period. At that time, [[madrasa]], where [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] languages, religion, math, calligraphy, history and literature were taught, functioned in Azerbaijan. Medicine and alchemy were also taught there. “Malham” madrasa in Shamakhi was one of the most famous madrasa’s of that time. Eminent scientist and doctor Kafiyaddin Omar ibn Osman – uncle of eminent Persian poet [[Khaqani|Khagani Shirvani]] – led this educational institution.&lt;ref name="alakbarli"/&gt;

Medieval doctors warned sick people against tiredness. For example, Mahmud inb Ilyas, a doctor lived in the 12th century advised nervous people to listen to [[mugham]].

Medicine was strongly developing in the 13th century in the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] of [[Eldiguzids (Atabegs of Azerbaijan)|Azerbaijani Atabegs]]. Almost every eastern scientist and philosopher had a work in medicine. Residents from different oblasts of Azerbaijan compiled, rewrote and investigated books in medicine, including monuments of the 14th-18th centuries. There are more than four hundred manuscripts in medicine in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], Arabic, Persian and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages both written in the territory of modern Azerbaijan and brought from different oblasts in the [[Fuzûlî|Muhammad Fuzuli]] [[Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan]] of [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], in [[Baku]].&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs-az.com/pdf/100328190339.pdf Медицинские рукописи средневекового Азербайджана]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], the former Director-General of [[UNESCO]], “this collection shows the role of Azerbaijan in development of world medicine”.&lt;ref name="portalunesco"&gt;{{cite web

Mir Muhammad Momin, palatial figure at Suleyman the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]], wrote several instructive works in Persian, including “Tohfat al Mominin” in 1669. Descriptions of more than 4000 plants, animals, minerals and other ingredients used in medicine were written in the work. Momin described each plant, its specific characteristic, where it can be picked, other oblasts where it is used and its name in other languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Hindi]] in detail.

In 1712, Muhammad Yusif Shirvani wrote “Tibbname” in Azerbaijani language. Being a palatial doctor, Shirvani advised to use natural minerals for treatment, for example, rubbing of orange peel while tiredness in neck. In this work it’s also written that resting place of sick men should be decorated with flowers in light-blue, green and white tints. It means that even the color had a great importance in works of medieval healers.

Generally, in the 17th-18th centuries, number of works had been written in the sphere of medicine and pharmacology by Azerbaijani scientists such as Murtuzagulu Shamlu ([[Sexology|sexual pathologist]]), Abdulhasan [[Maragheh|Maraghai]], pharmacologists such as Hasan Rza oglu Shirvani, Haji Suleyman Iravani and others. 724 kinds of medicinal plants were described.&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt;

==Development of medicine in the 19th and early 20th century==
[[File:Abdulkhalig Akhundov.jpg|120px|thumb|Abdulkhalig Akhundov, founder of basis of scientific investigation in the [[history of medicine]] in Azerbaijan.]] 
In the early 19th century when northern [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanates]] of Azerbaijan ([[Shirvan Khanate|Shirvan]], [[Baku Khanate|Baku]], [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchivan]], [[Quba Khanate|Quba]], [[Talysh Khanate|Talysh]], [[Karabakh Khanate|Karabakh]], [[Shaki Khanate|Shaki]], Derbend and other) were joined to [[Russia]] and the southern ([[Tabriz]], [[Khoy]], [[Ardabil]] and others) ones to Iran, Azerbaijani community in Iran continued to exist under the influence of Persian and generally, the whole [[Islamic culture]], but Azerbaijani community in the [[Russian Empire]] (later the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]) was developing under the influence of Europeanized secular Russian culture (mainly in the Soviet times). Medicine in two regions was developing in two different ways.&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt;

There wasn’t any European like pharmacy in Azerbaijan until 1828. During the reign of the Russian such hospitals and pharmacies were established in Azerbaijan as in the whole [[South Caucasus]], where Russian doctors applied their skills.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt;

Abdulkhalig Akhundov founded basis of scientific investigation in the [[history of medicine]] in Azerbaijan. Abdulkhalig studied and translated famous pharmaceutics encyclopedia written by Abu Mansur Kharavi in the 9th century from Persian into [[German language|German]]. After, the book was published in [[Germany]]. Abdulkhalig Akhundov also defended a dissertation in the history of medicine at the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt; In 1895, Dr.Mammad Rza Vakilov, Dr.Kerimbey Mehmandarov and others established Baku Union of Medicine.&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt;

[[File:Hasan bey Zardabi.jpg|120px|left|thumb|[[Hasan bey Zardabi]]]] 
[[Hasan bey Zardabi]] and [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] used knowledge in medicine in their works for expression of philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt; Akhundov was one of the firsts who acted against traditional healers. He was the author of works about [[hygiene]] and [[Sanitation|sanitary]]. Zardabi also had an important role in development of medicine. He was the first Azerbaijani in the sphere of [[natural history]] and [[Social Darwinism]].

Being the author of “[[Akinchi]]” – the first Azerbaijani newspaper in the Russian Empire – Zardabi, together with Akhundov worked upon works about [[malaria]] devastated the country at that time. His “Hygiene” book is the first scientific research work about medicine in the sphere of hygiene in Azerbaijan. It was published in 1914, in Azerbaijan.

Sometimes doctors gave gratuitous help to sick men. During [[cholera]] devastation in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], in 1847, Mirza Nasrulla Mirza Ali oglu gratuitously treated both Azerbaijani and [[Armenians|Armenian]] sick men, due to which he was respected among people.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[File:HolyBukhara from Molla Nasreddin Azerbaijanian.jpg|thumb|250px|"Holy Bukhara". “[[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]]”, 1911, № 20. Artist I.Rotter]]
Alongside all these, pharmacies where herbs imported from Iran and [[India]] were sold, were also functioning at that time. Such pharmacies were in every city of Azerbaijan – Baku, Shamakhi, [[Shusha]], [[Agdam]], Nakhchivan, [[Lahij]], [[Ordubad]], [[Salyan, Azerbaijan|Salyan]], [[Lankaran]] etc. Mir-Baba Mir-Abdulla oglu, father of eminent Azerbaijani literary man [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]] had a pharmacy in Aghdam. 142 kinds of medicines, more than 100 of which were made of herbs, were sold in his pharmacy. Chamanzaminli himself, being the son of the pharmacist, described everyday life and practices of Azerbaijani healers of the 19th century in his narrative called “The Doctor”.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Such pharmacies were mainly in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian (Southern) Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt; At the beginning of the 20th century treatment by herbs was enough spread method of treatment in Azerbaijan. But healers perceived appearance of new, modern medicines as something strange.

“[[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]]” – popular Azerbaijani magazine of that time, which was of great importance in medicine education, criticized such kinds of remains of the past, ridiculed backwardness of healers-evils of that time, their ignorant treatment of modern knowledge in medicine.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt; For instance, a caricature called “Holy Bukhara” (painted by [[Azim Azimzade]]) was given in the 20th issue of the magazine (1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Medicine in Azerbaijan Democratic Republic==
In 1918, Ministry of health-care led by Dr.Rafiyev was established in independent [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Dozens of new pharmacies and hospitals were opened in Baku and [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] at that time.

[[File:Azerbaijani students in Paris 1920.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Azerbaijani students in Paris, 1920.]]
Many students of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic sent for educating abroad, mainly to Germany, [[Saint Petersburg]], Moscow, [[Kiev]] and other cities, learned medicine there.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt;

In 1919, [[Baku State University]] with a medicine faculty was established in Baku. Professor V.I.Razumovskiy, an eminent surgeon, became its first chairman (until 1920). History of medicine was also taught there. Razumovskiy established the First Preparatory Commission for a short period of time. Admission examinations were held in August of the same year and so the first course of students – future doctors – was collected.&lt;ref name="amueduaz"&gt;{{cite web|author= |authorlink= |date=16 October 2009 |url=http://amu.edu.az/yeni/index.php?Itemid=291 |title=История Азербайджанского медицинского университета. |publisher=Официальный сайт Азербайджанского медицинского университета. |accessdate= |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109115125/http://amu.edu.az/yeni/index.php?Itemid=291 |archivedate=January 9, 2012 }} {{ref-az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 1922 there were only three Azerbaijanis – A.Alakbarov, Jeyran Sultanova and Adliya Shahtakhtinskaya-Babayeva, who became the Doctor of Sciences and Professor – among the first 29 alumni of medicine faculty.&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt;

==Medicine in the Azerbaijan SSR==
After [[Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|establishment of the Soviet Power]], during the 1920s, pharmacies where herbs were sold were closed, and manuscripts written with [[Arabic alphabet]] were burned. It was a part of the Soviet Power’s policy carried out against [[Islam]] (mainly in Azerbaijan and Central Asia).&lt;ref name="efendiyeva" /&gt;
 
[[File:Terapie institute in Azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|200px|Building of Physiotherapy Institute in Baku, 1930s.]]
Nariman Narimanov, who also was a doctor, was the leader of a newly established administration. From 1920 to 1921 Aghahuseyn Kazimov and then in 1935 Mir Movsum Gadirly were national commissars of health-care in the Azerbaijan SSR.&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt;

In 1930, [[Azerbaijan Medical University|Azerbaijan State Medical Institute]] was established and M.N.Gadirly was its first rector. Eminent scientists and professors such as I.Shirokorogov, S.Davidenkov, F.Ilyin, Lev Levin, N.Ushinkiy, k.Malinovskiy and others had a great contribution on development of the institute. Scientists such as M.Mirgasimov, M.A.Topchubashov, A.M.Aliyev, I.M.Ismayilzade and others graduated from this institute, who then brought Azerbaijani medical science fame.&lt;ref name="amueduaz" /&gt;

Generally, from 1920 to 1940 hundreds of polyclinics, hospitals and pharmacies were established in Azerbaijan. Academicians such as Mirasadulla Mirgasimov and [[Mustafa Topchubashov]], and professors such as Alibey Alibeyov, Kamil Balakishiyev and others were world-famous scientists and doctors of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt;

==Medicine in the Republic of Azerbaijan==
In the first years of independence, the situation in healthcare was very bad in Azerbaijan. Government could keep the healthcare system standing just with support of international organizations.The necessary medical equipment, lack of medicine was great problem.

New stage in development of medicine began after Azerbaijan acquired independence.&lt;ref name="azeriru" /&gt; More than 10 laws were established in the sphere of health-care. In March 1998, [[Heydar Aliyev]], former president of Azerbaijan, signed a direction “About establishment of State Committee of reforms in the sphere of health-care”. Unique state policy was established in the country and quality of medical service of the population was also improved.As soon as healthcare programs which were included repair and rehabilitation of medical institutions, providing them with equipment, provision and treatment of citizens with free medicines and preparations, diagnostic centers in the regions, in particular coverage of children with all medical services were accepted.&lt;ref&gt;http://sehiyye.gov.az/umumi_melumat.html&lt;/ref&gt; Today medical centers and modern pharmaceutics industry of Azerbaijan is created at a level of world standards. A national plan against illnesses such as [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]] is developed in the country. In 2001, a direction about celebration of June 17 as a holiday of health-care employers was signed. In 2004, Azerbaijani Association of Medicine Historians which was included into International Union of the History of Medicine headquartered in [[Paris]], in 2005, was established. The First National Conference of the Association was held on February 1–2 of the same year in Baku.&lt;ref name="alakbarli" /&gt; In recent years Heydar Aliyev Foundation has launched a number of projects on treatment of diabetes, thalassemia, blood donation campaigns, and the protection of maternal and child health.

About 870 private medical companies and 2,300 pharmaceutical organizations operate in Azerbaijan. Health system in modern Azerbaijan includes mainly primary healthcare, outpatient and inpatient services. 

In 2012-2013, 11 priority healthcare programs with total amount of 387.7 million manat were implemented in the country. In 2013 the amount of funds allocated to the healthcare system from the state budget has been increased 11 times compared to 2003. On the basis of this growth, up to 500 healthcare facilities were created or renewed. The range of the most important medicine supply has been increased from 60 to 166. Over the past 10 years, the mortality rates have decreased; the natural population grows increased.

Within the framework of the "Health Month" disease prevention campaign organized by the Ministry of Health in December in 2012 under the slogan "For a Healthy Life” medical institutions that carry out prophylactic examinations have been provided with the necessary equipment and reagents, 3 million patients were checked and treated accordingly.

M. Topchubashov Scientific Surgery Center carried out open heart surgery for adults and children for the first time in these years. In the Republican Clinical Urology Hospital named after M. Javadzade kidney transplantation has been started in early 2000.

In order to treat patients with chronic renal failure, more than 2,000 patients are receiving hemodialysis sessions in 27 centers and are provided with appropriate medications.
Measures have been taken to improve the quality of medical services provided to mothers and children. If the infant mortality rate in the country was 16.7 in 2003. In 2013 this figure was 10.8. The maternal mortality ratio decreased from 18.5 to 14.9, compared to 2003.

According to the Law "On Education", the training of physicians in the country is carried out through residency, accepted in the medical education system of most countries of the world. In 2012 about 500 doctors were admitted to residency in various specialties passing through the State Commission on Student Admission. Besides, in 2009-2012, 451 doctors and midwives have been trained in private and state clinics in foreign countries for 3-6 months.

Refresher trainings were organized in Baku with the participation of specialists from different countries and 1363 participants have gained practical knowledge in these trainings.
Since 2003, 12 relevant decisions have been established to increase the salaries of medical workers.

Within the framework of the "Electronic Azerbaijan" State Program "Citizen's Electronic Health Card" has been launched. There are currently about 10 registrars of various diseases, single registry of cadres, electronic surveillance system of infectious diseases, drug circulation, dispatching service of emergency medical station and others. The Ministry of Health has provided 38 e-services. The "Electronic Services" section has been created on the official website of the Ministry and there are 11 electronic services.

The Ministry of Health cooperates with about 40 countries. In addition, the Sanitation and Epidemiological Service Development Program for 2015-2020 has been developed, which took appropriate measures to prevent infectious diseases. An Action Plan covering 2013-2020 on combating non-infectious diseases (such as smoking, obesity, physical activity, alcohol abuse, etc.) and National Action Plan on Early Prevention and Treatment of Childhood Disorders (2014-2020) have been implemented.

In 2009, a new approach was introduced which seeks to define the number and type of staff needed in the system based on demographic criteria.

In July 2009, the government issued a new law on education. Within the framework of the law on education the Ministry of Health had to prepare a draft law on medical education by October 2009. The Azerbaijan Medical University is the only provider of undergraduate medical education in the country. Several unlicensed private medical schools operated in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but they all were closed by the Ministry of Education by 2005. In 2013 about 1020 medical students are enrolled annually in 8 departments. 

The Department of Human Resources, Education and Science of Ministry of Health, organizing the planning of health staff, provides data on vacancies in health facilities. In accordance with data on vacancies the Ministry of Health asks the Azerbaijan Medical University to provide them with medical staff. The University sends graduates to the relevant specialty internships. The planning of nursing and midlevel healthcare personnel also follows the same process.

Since February 1, 2008 governmental medical institutions show a gratuitous medical aid to population, by a direction signed by Ogtay Shirinov, a minister of health-hare of Azerbaijan. In November, 2009, Azerbaijani doctors performed the first operation in [[heart]] for prevention of [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|arrhythmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Medical trainings === 

There are 8 nursing schools in [[Azerbaijan]] which closely cooperates with the Ministry of Health. Being a [[nurse]] does not require higher education.  Candidates may become a nurse by graduating nurse trainings. Graduated nurses are presented vocational diplomas. In 2008, the total annual admission to all nursing schools was 1950. Postdiploma education for nurses is provided through three nursing schools located in Baku, Ganja and Mingechevir. Depending on the specialty, refresher trainings are required every five years. The course duration is from five days to two months. In 2008, approximately 2200 nurses completed these trainings. 

[[Physicians]] should participate in refresher trainings every five years that organized by the Azerbaijan Physicians’ Advancement Institute. In 2008, more than 2700 physicians attended various refresher trainings organized by Institute. At the same time international organizes such as UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, USAID, etc. also organized and funded various trainings on maternalchild care, primary care and emergency medicine, family planning and reproductive health, primary care and public health, and others. The trainings lasted from 22 months to 30 months depending on specialty profile. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/118156/E94132.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Health''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Manatū Hauora'') is the public service department of New Zealand responsible for  [[healthcare in New Zealand]].

The Ministry in its current form came into existence in 1993.

==History==
The Department of Health was formed in 1903 by the merging of other government departments. Its structure remained relatively static even when the 1938 Social Security Act was passed where the New Zealand government took a larger role in health purchasing. The department remained actively involved in policy (as opposed to purchasing).

By the 1970s problems had appeared in the health system. The high growth rate in hospital expenditure was occurring at a time when the economy was slowing down. Thus, the government was unable to sustain funding this growth.

This led the health system to undergo a series of changes over a 20-year period from the 1980s. During the 1990s the [[New Zealand National Party|National]] government attempted to stream-line the system in a series of reforms such as separating the government purchasing and provision of health care services. During this time the department was renamed as the ''Ministry of Health''.

==Current role==

The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]-[[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]] coalition government redefined the role of the Ministry of Health as part of Labour's election promises in the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 election]].

The separate government health service purchasing entity, the [[Health Funding Authority]], was merged with the Ministry of Health. Critics were anxious as to how the Ministry would perform as a funder, as they commented that the Ministry had in the past only performed as a policy organisation. However, supporters of this move stated that they believed this would make these agencies more accountable.

The Ministry of Health funds public health promotions such as smoking cessation and immunisation programmes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/immunisation| title=Immunisation| publisher=Ministry of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the ''New Zealand Primary Health Strategy'' will move towards funding universal access to primary care services for New Zealand citizens. In 2003 the Ministry of Health began forming [[Primary Health Organisation]]s in an effort to move health care services from fee-for-service arrangements to capitation funding for health professionals who are members of these organisations.

[[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]] were formed in 2001 as a subsidiary organisation of the Ministry. As of 2005, 21 different District Health Boards (DHBs) exist. These are responsible for hospitals and funding some health provisions in their respective areas [http://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/key-health-sector-organisations-and-people/district-health-boards]. 75% of VOTE: Health goes to the ''District Health Boards'' of New Zealand. Funding for these DHBs is allocated according to the Ministry's population-based funding formula [http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/9EC525446F3ACC8CCC256E9000125381/$File/PopulationBasedFundingFormula2003.pdf]. The District Health Boards can be considered much like the board of trustees of a school, some members are elected while others are government-appointed.

== Structure ==
So-called "[[business unit]]s" of the Ministry include:&lt;ref&gt;

The council is chaired by [[Lim Hock San]] and has 19 members.

One of the main tasks of NCPG is to promote public awareness on problem gambling. In January 2006, a TV series ''Bet Your Life'' was launched to examine problem gambling and its effects on families and society. {{ref|initiativeJan06}}  A fund of [[S$]]150,000 was also set aside for public education programmes initiated by voluntary welfare organisations.

To counsel and help compulsive gamblers, two hotlines are set up by [[Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)|Institute of Mental Health]] and [[Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society]].

The '''Pepsi Challenge''' is an ongoing [[marketing]] promotion run by [[PepsiCo]] since 1975. It is also the name of a cross country ski race at [[Giant's Ridge Ski Area]] in [[Biwabik, Minnesota]], an event sponsored by Pepsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pepsi Challenge Cup Cross Country Ski Race!|publisher=Pepsichallengeskirace.com|url=http://pepsichallengeskirace.com/pepsi.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203014443/http://pepsichallengeskirace.com/pepsi.php|archivedate=February 3, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
[[File:Pepsi Challenge.jpg|thumb|right|An early 1980s "Pepsi Challenge" 16 oz. (355 ml.) promotional can, and a metal tab button publicizing the challenge.]]
The challenge originally took the form of a [[single blind]] [[Blind taste test|taste test]]. At malls, shopping centers, and other public locations, a Pepsi representative sets up a table with two white cups: one containing [[Pepsi]] and one with [[Coca-Cola]]. Shoppers are encouraged to taste both colas, and then select which drink they prefer. Then the representative reveals the two bottles so the taster can see whether they preferred Coke or Pepsi.  The results of the test leaned toward a consensus that Pepsi was preferred by more Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knew Coke|publisher = [[Snopes]]| url = http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/newcoke.asp|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:CokePepsiChallenge.jpg|thumb|right| A [[Coca-Cola]] pinback button, "I picked [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] in the Pepsi Challenge."]]
In his book ''[[Blink (book)|Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]'' (2005), author [[Malcolm Gladwell]] presents evidence that suggests Pepsi's success over Coca-Cola in the "Pepsi Challenge" is a result of the flawed nature of the "sip test" method. His research shows that tasters will generally prefer the sweeter of two beverages based on a single sip, even if they prefer a less sweet beverage over the course of an entire can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Zen Of Choosing| publisher =Trust Me, I'm A Scientist| url = http://trustmeimascientist.com/2012/01/01/the-zen-art-of-choosing-speakers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the preference in blind tests is compared to tests wherein cups are labeled with arbitrary labels (e.g., S or L) or brand names, the ratings of preference change.&lt;ref&gt;Woolfolk, Castellan, Brooks&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific findings do support a perceptible difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but not between Pepsi and [[RC Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, Herman&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Bad Habits'', humorist [[Dave Barry]] describes the Pepsi challenge as, "Pepsi’s ongoing misguided attempt to convince the general public that Coke and Pepsi are not the same thing, which of course they are."&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Dave. ''Bad Habits'', pp. 75, c.1985, Holt &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contest==
In 1981, Pepsi ran a "Pepsi Challenge Payoff" contest that would hand out a large prize to anyone who could gather Pepsi [[bottle cap]]s that spelled out the words "Pepsi Challenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kanner |first=Bernice |title=Coke vs. Pepsi: The Battle of the Bubbled |date=October 5, 1981 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=%22In+one+under-the-cap+promotion,+consumers+try+to+collect+caps+to+spell+out+Pepsi+Challenge%22&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;f=false|magazine=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media, LLC |access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education&lt;ref name="saybrook_a"&gt;http://www.saybrook.edu/sites/default/files/alumni/newsletters/200906.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;==
Rivka Bertisch was born in [[Argentina]] to European Jewish parents.  Most of her relatives were killed by the Nazis in Poland during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="saybrook_a" /&gt;  She attended the [[University of Hawaii]] where she received dual bachelor's degrees in Communications and Psychology and a Masters in Public Health.&lt;ref name="saybrook_a" /&gt;  Meir pursued and completed all but one graduate level course at the [[University of Hawaii]] and then received a PhD from the University for Humanistic Studies (presently [[Alliant International University]]). Her dissertation centered on: Life Pattern Counseling—Theory and Practice. Her dissertation work used [[cell memory]] techniques to access and modify traumatic memories.&lt;ref name="search.proquest"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/305372711&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Meir was a program planner and researcher at the School of Community Medicine of the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] at [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], Israel, and then at the [[Jerusalem Municipality]], Department of Public Health where Rivka (as Rivka Danziger) co-directed [[Project KIDUM]] in which she developed clinic and community-based programs in counseling and how to improve cognitive and intelligence development,  implementing it in the 30 Well Baby Clinics in Jerusalem, Israel (Tipat Chalav).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rivka Danziger, a new immigrant from Hawaii and KIDUM Specialist|newspaper=Jerusalem Post Magazine|date=June 22, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meir also introduced and directed "EST" ([[Erhard Seminar Training]]—[[Landmark Education]]) to Israel from 1977 to 1979. In 1986, she moved back to [[Argentina]], where she pioneered using large group formats to teach human development and the Integrative Rivka’s Method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v9SDiX6pOZQC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22rivka's+integrative+technique%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rivka's%20integrative%20technique%22&amp;f=false | title = Stop Beliefs That Stop Your Life: Fixed Beliefs and Life Pattern Theory | isbn = 9781463472467 | author1 = Rivka Bertisch Meir | first1 = Ph.

In 1996, she moved to the New York City area.&lt;ref name="saybrook_a" /&gt; Her work has continued at the corporate level centering on organizational productivity, life and business management coaching, team building and serving as a consultant, trainer, and resource person for top executives, staff, individuals, and groups.

==Facts==
Roe and Woolley  underwent surgery on 13 October 1947 at the Chesterfield Hospital. It was managed under the general supervision of the Minister of Health. Before entering the operating theatre, an [[anaesthetic]] consisting of [[Nupercaine]] was administered by means of a [[lumbar puncture]].

Unknown to the staff, the glass had a number of micro-cracks which were invisible to the eye but which allowed the phenol to penetrate. When used, the phenol-contaminated anaesthetic caused permanent [[paraplegia]].

A later analysis suggests that the most probable cause of the paralyses was an acidic descaler which, by an oversight, had been allowed to remain in the sterilizing water boiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Woolley and Roe case.

==Decision==
As the law then stood, to find [[negligence]] proved, there must be a [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]], the defendant must have [[breach of duty in English law|breached that duty]], and that breach must have [[causation (law)|caused]] the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff. The [[standard of care]] required of defendants was judged by applying an objective test, considering what a [[reasonable person|"reasonable man"]] would or would not have done in the same situation. In ''Hall v Brooklands Auto Racing Club'' (1933) 1 KB 205, it was held that it was the duty of the operators to ensure that the racing track they had designed was as free from danger as reasonable care and skill could make it, but that they were not insurers against accidents which no reasonable diligence could foresee. Similarly, in ''Glasgow Corporation v Muir'' (1943) 2 AER 44, a defendant was not negligent in allowing a group to enter a tea room to escape bad weather, because the "reasonable man" would not have foreseen that these invitees would be injured (scalded) upon entering the tearoom.

In the Supreme Court of Judicature, court of appeal the learned Justices said as follows:

[[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Denning LJ.]]  "We must not look at the 1947 incident with 1954 spectacles." It was held that the micro-cracks were not foreseeable given the prevailing scientific knowledge of the time. Thus, since no reasonable anaesthetist would have stored the anaesthetic differently, it was inappropriate to hold the hospital management liable for failing to take precautions. That the profession had changed its practice in the light of experience proved that the profession was responsible in its self-regulation. In 1954, anaesthetists coloured the phenol with a [[dye]]. If a vial became contaminated, the dye showed inside the vial. These vials were then discarded. But, given that the hospital was applying the best practice of the time, there was no negligence.

[[Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow|Somervell LJ.]] "It is now clear that phenol can find its way into an ampoule of nupercaine stored in a solution of phenol through cracks which are not detectable by the ordinary visual or tactile examination which takes place in an operating theatre — these cracks were referred to in the evidence as "invisible cracks" — or through molecular flaws in the glass. The attention of the profession was first drawn to this risk in this country by the publication of Professor Macintosh's book on Lumbar Puncture and Spinal Anaesthesia in 1951. In 1947 the general run of competent anaesthetists would not appreciate this risk. (Dr Mcintosh, Day 3, 18, 19, 42-E; Dr Organe, Day 8, 61; Dr Cope, Day 9, 25). Dr Graham certainly did not appreciate this as a risk. I accordingly find that by the standard of knowledge to be imputed to competent anaesthetists in 1947, Dr Graham was not negligent in failing to appreciate this risk and a fortiori the theatre staff were not negligent."

[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Morris LJ]] "It is now  known that there could be cracks not ordinarily detectable. But care has to be exercised to ensure that conduct in 1947 is only judged in the light of knowledge which then was or ought reasonably to have been possessed. In this connection the then-existing state of medical literature must be had in mind. The question arises whether Dr Graham was negligent in not adopting some different technique. I cannot think that he was"

The Cantabrian Health Service is an autonomous public health organization which depends of the [[Government of Cantabria]]. It was created by the Law of Cantabria 10/2001 of December 28.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/2002/BOE-A-2002-1377-consolidado.pdf Law 10/2001, December 28, of creation of Cantabrian Health Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the [[Spanish National Health System]] and is responsible, in [[Cantabria]], for the public provision of the [[health service]], both care and prevention and rehabilitation.

In 2006, The Cantabria Health Service had 7,458 professionals in its workforce to provide healthcare through its network of primary care and specialized care.

==Functions==
* Management of health benefits in the field of health promotion and protection, disease prevention, health care and rehabilitation in the territory of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria.
* Administration, management, control and inspection of the Institutions, centers and those health services that are under their dependence, organically and functionally.
* Management of the financial, material and human resources that are granted to perform the functions mentioned above.
* Adoption of preventive measures for the protection of health when there is or is reasonably suspected an imminent and extraordinary risk to health.
* The execution and, where appropriate, coordination of teaching and research programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2003-323 Law 7/2002, December 10, on Health Ordinance of Cantabria.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Cantabrian Health Service is structured territorially in four areas called Health Areas: [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], [[Laredo, Cantabria|Laredo]], [[Torrelavega]] and [[Reinosa]].
Your organization is coordinated through the following subdirectories:
* Administrative Coordination
* Healthcare
* Economic Management and Infrastructures
* Human Resources
* Development and Quality Assisted

==Primary health care==
It is the first level of access of citizens to the Public Health System of Cantabria and among its characterizing elements are the offer of comprehensive health care through preventive, curative and rehabilitative care. It also includes health promotion, health education and environmental health surveillance. On October 18, 2010, the functional structure was created by creating the Laredo Primary Care Primary Management, which includes the former Specialized Care Management and the Primary Care Management Area II as well as the Primary Care Management that includes areas I, III and IV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://boc.cantabria.es/boces/verAnuncioAction.do?idAnuBlob=185782 Decree 66/2010, September 30, on the Basic Structure of Peripheral organs of the Cantabrian Health Service.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary Care Services===
The primary care services in Cantabria are constituted in primary care districts, which are known as basic health areas, of which in 2008 there were a total of 37. In each of these zones are located health centers and clinics, Where primary health care is provided to the population. Cantabria has a total of 37 health centers and 122 offices.

==Specialized health care==
It provides the population with the technical and human resources necessary for appropriate diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation, which can not be solved at the primary care level. The Cantabrian Health Service manages the five public hospitals in Cantabria.

===Specialized care services===
Among the functions of the specialized attention are:

* Medical and surgical support to Primary Health Care through:
** Hospital Services
*** [[Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital]]: it is located in Santander and is the reference center for all of Cantabria.
*** Sierrallana Hospital: is located in Torrelavega and serves the central and western area of Cantabria.
*** Comarcal Hospital of Laredo, it is located in the town of the same name and serves the eastern part of the region.
*** Tres Mares Hospital: it is located in Reinosa and serves the south of Cantabria.
*** Santa Cruz Hospital: it is located in Liencres, very close to Santander, and actually serves as a complementary hospital of Valdecilla in some services.
* Planning of the Specialized Attention in the Cantabrian Health Service, coordinating the actions of the Area Management and Addresses.
* Participation in teaching and research activities.
* Coordination with Primary Care through Specific Programs, continued training and establishment of joint protocols for certain pathologies or processes.

'''Spray drying''' is a method of producing a dry powder from a liquid or slurry by rapidly drying with a hot gas. This is the preferred method of drying of many thermally-sensitive materials such as foods and [[pharmaceuticals]]. A consistent particle size distribution is a reason for spray drying some industrial products such as catalysts. Air is the heated drying medium; however, if the liquid is a flammable solvent such as [[ethanol]] or the product is oxygen-sensitive then [[nitrogen]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKOGg1vk61MC&amp;pg=PA710|page=710|title=Handbook of industrial drying|author=A. S. Mujumdar|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=1-57444-668-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All spray dryers use some type of [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizer]] or [[spray nozzle]] to disperse the liquid or slurry into a controlled drop size spray. The most common of these are rotary disk and single-fluid high pressure swirl nozzles. Atomizer wheels are known to provide broader particle size distribution, but both methods allow for consistent distribution of particle size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elantechnology.com/spray-drying/&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, for some applications two-fluid or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s are used. Depending on the process needs, drop sizes from 10 to 500&amp;nbsp;µm can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The most common applications are in the 100 to 200&amp;nbsp;µm diameter range. The dry powder is often free-flowing.&lt;ref name=dia&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkpNO5RnxNgC&amp;pg=PA588|page=588|title=Combustion and incineration processes|author=Walter R. Niessen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8247-0629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of spray dryers are called single effect. There is a single source of drying air at the top of the chamber (see n°4 on the diagram). In most cases the air is blown in the same direction as the sprayed liquid (co-current). A fine powder is produced, but it can have poor flow and produce a lot of dust. To overcome the dust and poor flow of the powder, a new generation of spray dryers called multiple effect spray dryers have been produced. Instead of drying the liquid in one stage, drying is done through two steps: the first at the top (as per single effect) and the second with an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. The bed provides a humid environment which causes smaller particles to clump, producing more uniform particle sizes, usually within the range of 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;µm. These powders are free-flowing due to the larger particle size.

The fine powders generated by the first stage drying can be recycled in continuous flow either at the top of the chamber (around the sprayed liquid) or at the bottom, inside the integrated [[fluidized bed]].
The drying of the powder can be finalized on an external vibrating fluidized bed.

The hot drying gas can be passed in as a co-current, same direction as sprayed liquid atomizer, or counter-current, where the hot air flows against the flow from the atomizer.  With co-current flow, particles spend less time in the system and the particle separator (typically a cyclone device).  With counter-current flow, particles spend more time in the system and is usually paired with a fluidized bed system.  Co-current flow generally allows the system to operate more efficiently.

Alternatives to spray dryers are:&lt;ref&gt;Onwulata p.66&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Freeze-drying|Freeze dryer]]: a more-expensive batch process for products that degrade in spray drying. Dry product is not free-flowing.
#[[Drum drying|Drum dryer]]: a less-expensive continuous process for low-value products; creates flakes instead of free-flowing powder.
#Pulse combustion dryer: A less-expensive continuous process that can handle higher viscosities and solids loading than a spray dryer, and that sometimes gives a freeze-dry quality powder that is free-flowing.

==Spray dryer==
[[File:SDXFamily1.JPG|thumb|Spray drying nozzles.]]
[[File:Spray Dryer.gif|thumb|Schematic illustration of spray drying process.]]
A spray dryer takes a liquid stream and separates the solute or suspension as a solid and the solvent into a vapor. The solid is usually collected in a drum or cyclone. The liquid input stream is sprayed through a nozzle into a hot vapor stream and vaporized. Solids form as moisture quickly leaves the droplets. A nozzle is usually used to make the droplets as small as possible, maximizing heat transfer and the rate of water vaporization. Droplet sizes can range from 20 to 180 μm depending on the nozzle.&lt;ref name=dia/&gt;
There are two main types of nozzles: high pressure single fluid nozzle (50 to 300 bars) and two-fluid nozzles: one fluid is the liquid to dry and the second is compressed gas (generally air at 1 to 7 bars).

Spray dryers can dry a product very quickly compared to other methods of drying. They also turn a solution, or slurry into a dried powder in a single step, which can be advantageous as it simplifies the process and improves profit margins.

In pharmaceutical arena, spray drying is employed to manufacture Amorphous Solid Dispensation, by uniformly disperse Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients into a polymer matrix. This state will put the active compounds (drug) in a higher state of energy which in turn facilitates diffusion of drug spices in patient body&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poozesh |first1=Sadegh |last2=Lu |first2=Kun |last3=Marsac |first3=Patrick J. |title=On the particle formation in spray drying process for bio-pharmaceutical applications: Interrogating a new model via computational fluid dynamics |journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer |date=July 2018 |volume=122 |pages=863–876 |doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.02.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Micro-encapsulation==
Spray drying often is used as an [[Micro-encapsulation|encapsulation technique]] by the food and other industries. A substance to be encapsulated (the load) and an [[Amphiphile|amphipathic]] carrier (usually some sort of [[modified starch]]) are [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenized]] as a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in water (the slurry). The slurry is then fed into a spray drier, usually a tower heated to temperatures well over the boiling point of [[water]].

As the slurry enters the tower, it is atomized. Partly because of the high [[surface tension]] of water and partly because of the [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]/[[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] interactions between the amphipathic carrier, the water, and the load, the atomized slurry forms [[micelle]]s. The small size of the drops (averaging 100 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s in diameter) results in a relatively large surface area which dries quickly. As the water dries, the carrier forms a hardened shell around the load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JvVoRFe7AkC&amp;pg=PA179|page=179|title=Bioseparation Engineering|author=Ajay Kumar|publisher=I. K. International |year=2009|isbn=93-8002-608-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Load loss is usually a function of molecular weight. That is, lighter molecules tend to boil off in larger quantities at the processing temperatures. Loss is minimized industrially by spraying into taller towers. A larger volume of air has a lower average humidity as the process proceeds. By the [[osmosis]] principle, water will be encouraged by its difference in [[fugacity|fugacities]] in the vapor and liquid phases to leave the micelles and enter the air. Therefore, the same percentage of water can be dried out of the particles at lower temperatures if larger towers are used. Alternatively, the slurry can be sprayed into a partial vacuum. Since the boiling point of a solvent is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the ambient pressure, reducing pressure in the tower has the effect of lowering the boiling point of the solvent.

The application of the spray drying encapsulation technique is to prepare "dehydrated" powders of substances which do not have any water to dehydrate. For example, instant [[drink mix]]es are spray dries of the various chemicals which make up the beverage. The technique was once used to remove water from food products; for instance, in the preparation of dehydrated milk. Because the milk was not being encapsulated and because spray drying causes [[thermal degradation]], milk dehydration and similar processes have been replaced by other dehydration techniques. Skim [[Powdered milk|milk powders]] are still widely produced using spray drying technology around the world, typically at high solids concentration for maximum drying efficiency. Thermal degradation of products can be overcome by using lower operating temperatures and larger chamber sizes for increased residence times.&lt;ref&gt;Onwulata pp.389–430&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research is now suggesting that the use of spray-drying techniques may be an alternative method for crystallization of amorphous powders during the drying process since the temperature effects on the amorphous powders may be significant depending on drying residence times.&lt;ref&gt;Onwulata p.268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07373930701536718 |title=Crystallization of Amorphous Components in Spray-Dried Powders |year=2007 |last1=Chiou |first1=D. |last2=Langrish |first2=T.

{{About|the dental structure|the colloquialism|Nit comb}}
[[File:Toothcomb - Jones 1918.jpg|thumb|The [[Lemuriformes|lemuriform]] toothcomb, viewed from the underside of the lower jaw]]

A '''toothcomb''' (also '''tooth comb''' or '''dental comb''') is a [[Dentition|dental]] structure found in some mammals, comprising a group of front teeth arranged in a manner that facilitates grooming, similar to a [[hair comb]].  The toothcomb occurs in [[Lemuriformes|lemuriform]] [[primate]]s (which includes [[lemur]]s and [[Lorisoidea|lorisoids]]), [[treeshrew]]s, [[colugo]]s, [[hyrax]]es, and some African [[antelope]]s.  The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through [[convergent evolution]] and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include [[incisor]]s and [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] that tilt forward at the front of the lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first [[premolar]].  The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple [[wikt:tine|tines]] per tooth.

The toothcomb is usually used for [[personal grooming|grooming]]. While licking the fur clean, the animal will run the toothcomb through the fur to comb it. Fine grooves or striations are usually cut into the teeth during grooming by the hair and may be seen on the sides of the teeth when viewed through a [[scanning electron microscope]]. The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or, in the case of lemuriforms, the [[sublingua]], a specialized "under-tongue". The toothcomb can have other functions, such as food procurement and bark gouging. Within lemuriforms, [[fork-marked lemur]]s and [[Indriidae|indriids]] have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions. In some lemurs, such as the [[aye-aye]], the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition.

In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb has been used by scientists in the interpretation of the [[Evolutionary history of lemurs|evolution of lemurs]] and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early [[Adapiformes|adapiform]] primates around the [[Eocene]] or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European [[Adapidae|adapids]], but the [[Fossil|fossil record]] suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the [[Paleocene]] (66 to 55&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|mya]]) and might have evolved from early [[Cercamoniinae|cercamoniines]] from Asia. Fossil primates such as ''[[Djebelemur]]'', ''[['Anchomomys' milleri]]'', and ''[[Plesiopithecus]]'' may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record before to 40&amp;nbsp;mya has created a conflict with [[molecular clock]] studies that suggest an older [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a [[ghost lineage]] of lemuriform primates in Africa.

== Homologous and analogous structures ==
[[File:Dermoptera - toothcomb 01.jpg|thumb|upright|The toothcomb of a [[colugo]] differs significantly in shape from that of lemuriform primates.]]
The toothcomb, a special morphological arrangement of teeth in the anterior [[Mandible|lower jaw]], is best known in [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine primates]], which include [[lemur]]s and [[Lorisoidea|lorisoid]] primates (collectively known as lemuriforms{{efn|Although the [[Monophyly|monophyletic relationship]] between lemurs and lorisoids is widely accepted, their clade name is not.  The term "strepsirrhine" has been used as a [[wastebasket taxon]] for non-[[Haplorhini|haplorhine]] primates, most of whom do not exhibit the characteristic toothcomb, and "lemuriform" has been problematic because of its historical membership of living and fossil primates, which included the [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] lemurs and European [[Adapidae|adapids]], but excluded the lorisoids.{{Sfn|Rasmussen|Nekaris|1998|p=252}} The term "lemuriforms" is used here because it derives from one popular taxonomy that clumps the toothcombed primates into one [[Taxonomic rank|infraorder]] and the extinct, non-toothcombed adapiforms into another, both within the [[Taxonomic rank|suborder]] Strepsirrhini.{{Sfn|Cartmill|2010|p=15}}}}).{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=68}} This [[Homology (biology)|homologous structure]] is a diagnostic character that helps define this [[clade]] (related group) of [[primate]]s.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=73}}{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=76}} An [[Analogy (biology)|analogous trait]] is found in the [[bald uakari]] (''Cacajao calvus''), a type of [[New World monkey]].{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|pp=278 &amp; 280}}

Toothcombs can also be found in colugos and treeshrews, both close relatives of primates; however, the structures are different and these are considered to examples of [[convergent evolution]].{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|pp=345–346}}{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|pp=279–280}}  Likewise, small- or medium-sized African [[antelope]]s, such as the [[impala]] (''Aepyceros melampus''),{{Sfn|Mooring|McKenzie|Hart|1996|p=970}} have a similar structure sometimes referred to as the "lateral dental grooming apparatus".{{Sfn|McKenzie|1990|p=117}}{{Sfn|Mooring|McKenzie|Hart|1996|p=966}}  Living and extinct hyraxes (hyracoids) also exhibit a toothcomb, although the number of tines in the comb vary throughout the fossil record.{{Sfn|Stevens|O'Connor|Roberts|Gottfried|2009|p=974}}

Dating to the Eocene epoch over 50 [[Mya (unit)|mya]], ''[[Chriacus]]'' and ''[[Thryptacodon]]''—two types of [[Arctocyonidae|arctocyonids]] (primitive [[Eutheria|placental mammals]])—also possessed an independently evolved toothcomb.{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|p=277}}{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}}

== Anatomical structure ==

The toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth, four [[incisor]]s and two [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] that are procumbent (tilt forward) in the front of the mouth.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=73}}{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=235}} The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them,{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=235}} but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors.{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|p=277}} In the [[Permanent teeth|permanent dentition]], the canines erupt after the incisors.{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|p=281}} The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt,{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=235}} and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|pp=52–53}} The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=78}} As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=235}}

[[File:Lemur catta toothcomb.jpg|thumb|left|Toothcomb of a [[ring-tailed lemur]], with canine-like premolars behind it]]
The French [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] first identified the two [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840.{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|p=279}}  Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=234}}  With modified lower canine teeth, the first lower [[premolar]]s following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth (caniniform){{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=73}}{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=53}} and assume their function.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=235}} These premolars are commonly confused with canines.{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|p=345}}  Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=235}}

The lemuriform toothcomb is kept clean by the [[sublingua]] or "under-tongue", a specialized muscular structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua can extend below the end of the tongue and is tipped with [[keratin]]ized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|p=347}}{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=73}}{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=421–423}}

Among lemurs, the toothcomb is variable in structure.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=68}} Among [[Indriidae|indriids]] (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=254}} and consists of four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=78}} It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=73}}{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=233}} In [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner'') the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct [[monkey lemur]]s (Archaeolemuridae) and [[sloth lemur]]s (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration in the front of the mouth.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|pp=78–79}} The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of [[rodent]]s.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=73}}{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}}

In colugos, the toothcomb has a completely different structure. Instead of individual incisors and canine teeth being finely spaced to act like the teeth of a comb, the biting edge of the four incisors have become serrated with as many as 15 tines each,{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=585}} while the canine acts more like a molar.{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|p=346}} These serrated incisors are kept clean using the front of the tongue, which is serrated to match the serrations of the incisors.{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|p=347}}  Similarly, the hyracoid toothcomb consists of incisors with multiple tines, called "[[pecten (biology)#Etymology|pectinations]]".  In contrast to the colugos, the size and shape of the tines are more uniform.{{Sfn|Stevens|O'Connor|Roberts|Gottfried|2009|p=974}}

The toothcomb of treeshrews is like the lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors are included in the toothcomb{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|pp=279–280}}{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=585}}{{Sfn|Sargis|2004|p=58}} and the canines are also excluded.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=585}} The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger.{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|pp=279–280}} In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=585}} In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.{{Sfn|McKenzie|1990|p=117}}

== Functions ==

As a homologous structure in lemuriforms, the toothcomb serves variable biological roles, despite its superficially stereotypic shape and appearance.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=76}}  It is primarily used as a toiletry device or grooming comb.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=238}}{{Sfn|Rosenberger|2010|p=291}}  Additionally, some species use their toothcomb for food procurement{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=238}} or to gouge tree bark.{{Sfn|Rosenberger|2010|p=291}}

=== Grooming ===
[[File:Sublingua of a slow loris 001.jpg|thumb|The [[sublingua]] is a secondary tongue below the primary tongue and is used to remove hair and debris from the toothcomb of lemuriforms.|alt=A close-up of a slow loris licking its nose and the sublingua sticking out beneath it]]
The primary function of the toothcomb, grooming, was first noted by the French [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1829, who pointed out that the [[ring-tailed lemur]] (''Lemur catta'') had lower incisors that "''sont de véritables peignes''" ("are real combs").{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|p=346}} More than 100&amp;nbsp;years later, the grooming function was questioned since it was difficult to observe and the interdental spaces were thought to be too small for fur.{{Sfn|Roberts|1941|p=236}} Observations later showed the teeth were used for that purpose and that immediately after grooming, hair may be found trapped in the teeth, but is removed by the sublingua later.{{Sfn|Roberts|1941|pp=236–237}}

In 1981, [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found on the sides of the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth.{{efn|Based on dental microwear patterns that are characteristic of dental combing, as well as the similarities between a laterally flared anterior incisor and the appearance of the lateral canine tooth in the lemuriform toothcomb, American [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropologist]] [[Jeffrey H. Schwartz]] suggested that [[tarsier]]s have a highly [[Derived trait|derived]] toothcomb, homologous with that of lemuriforms.{{Sfn|Schwartz|2003|pp=66–67}} However, studies of tarsier dentition showed that only some tarsier species exhibit the characteristic striations on their incisors, yet all the species examined were reported to use their front teeth when grooming, suggesting the presence or absence of striations can be affected by grooming frequency, fur thickness, or interdental spacing.{{Sfn|Musser|Dagosto|1987|pp=33–34}} Dental combing (as a function of the teeth with or without a toothcomb) has also been documented in early primates from the late Eocene. ''[[Necrolemur]]'', a type of European [[Microchoeridae|microchoerid]] (close relatives of tarsier-like [[Omomyidae|omomyid]]s), lacked a toothcomb but showed signs of dental microwear attributed to dental combing.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}}{{Sfn|Schmid|1983|pp=6–8}}}} Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}}

Among non-primates, the extinct ''Chriacus'' exhibits microscopic groves on its toothcomb,{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}} but the [[Philippine colugo]] (''Cynocephalus volans'') does not. The toothcomb of the colugos is generally considered to function as a toothcomb, but due to the lack of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=585}}

In African antelopes, the lateral dental grooming apparatus does not appear to be used during [[grazing]] or [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]]. Instead, it is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove [[ectoparasite]]s.{{Sfn|McKenzie|1990|p=117}}{{Sfn|Mooring|McKenzie|Hart|1996|p=966}}

=== Olfaction in lemuriforms ===

In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb may also play a secondary role in [[olfaction]], which may account for the size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=72}}{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|pp=74–76}} The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur.{{Sfn|Rosenberger|Strasser|1985|p=73}} Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the [[philtrum]] (a cleft in the middle of the wet nose, or [[rhinarium]]) to the [[vomeronasal organ]] in the roof of the mouth. This would allow [[pheromone]]s to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|pp=74–76}}{{Sfn|Asher|1998|p=355}}

=== Food procurement and other uses ===

[[Mouse lemur]]s (''Microcebus''), [[sifaka]]s (''Propithecus''), and the [[indri]] (''Indri'') use their toothcombs to scoop up fruit pulp.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}} Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (''Phaner''), the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus''), and [[galago]]s (particularly the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Lesser bushbaby|Galago]]'' and ''[[Needle-clawed bushbaby|Euoticus]]'') use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as [[Gum (botany)|gum]] and [[Plant sap|sap]].{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}}{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|pp=76–77}} In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is specially adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=80}} The [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] colugos in the genus ''[[Cynocephalus]]'' may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=585}}

Indriids such as the sifakas use their toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising),{{Sfn|Rose|Walker|Jacobs|1981|p=583}}{{Sfn|Rosenberger|2010|p=291}}{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|pp=76–77}} which is done before scent-marking with the gland on their chest.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=572}} The more robust structure of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=78}}

== Evolution in lemuriforms ==
{{See also|Evolutionary history of lemurs}}

The origins of the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of considerable debate for more than a century. In 1920, British [[Paleoanthropology|palaeoanthropologist]] [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark]] proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was an early version of the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the [[Miocene]] as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the [[Monophyly|monophyletic relationship]] between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.{{Sfn|Rosenberger|Strasser|1985|p=74}}

The ancestral condition of the anterior dentition on the lower jaw, based on Eocene primate fossils, suggests that earliest primates had lacked a differentiated toothcomb.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=455}} Most fossil strepsirrhines lacked the stereotypic lemuriform toothcomb.  Collectively, early strepsirrhine primates are known as [[Adapiformes|adapiforms]].{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=446}} Adapiforms are considered to be a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group (containing many but not all of the descendants of the last common ancestor of the group's members) because the lemuriforms are assumed to have evolved from one of several groups of adapiforms.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|pp=446–447}} In terms of ecology, the evolution of the toothcomb is assumed to have required a [[Folivore|folivorous]] (leaf-eating) diet among the ancestral adapiform population, since that would select for reduced incisors, which would serve as an [[exaptation]] (a trait with adaptive value for something other than what it was originally selected for), which could then be used for personal or [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Rosenberger|2010|p=291}} However, the inclusion of the canines into the toothcomb must have required exceptional conditions, since large lemuriforms have secondarily modified caniniform premolars to substitute for the loss.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=77}}

A popular hypothesis about the origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as [[Adapidae|adapids]].{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|p=9}} In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Philip D. Gingerich]] has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=447}} However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene,{{Sfn|Rasmussen|Nekaris|1998|pp=256–258}} and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|pp=455–456}}

Lemuriforms are currently thought to have evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are [[Azibiidae|azibiids]] from the early Eocene,{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=446}} which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the [[Paleocene]] (66 to 55&amp;nbsp;mya).{{Sfn|Seiffert|Simons|Ryan|Attia|2005|p=11400}} [[Stem group|Stem]] lemuriforms, including ''[[Djebelemur]]'' and ''[['Anchomomys' milleri]]'', have been found in Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=446}} However, they lack a toothcomb.{{Sfn|Seiffert|Simons|Ryan|Attia|2005|p=11400}}{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=452}} These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with [[Cercamoniinae|cercamoniines]] from outside of Europe.{{efn|Cercamoniines were an early branch of strepsirrhine primates that occupied the northern hemisphere during the early [[Paleogene]].{{Sfn|Beard|2004|pp=55–56}}  They originated in Asia and are considered a subfamily of the [[Notharctidae|notharctids]], extinct North American primates that resembled modern lemurs.{{Sfn|Beard|2004|pp=51–52}}}}{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|pp=453–455}} Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, ''[[Plesiopithecus]]'', a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the [[Faiyum Oasis|Fayum Depression]] in [[Egypt]], is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms.{{Sfn|Simons|Rasmussen|1994|p=9946}}{{Sfn|Rasmussen|Nekaris|1998|p=261}} Together, ''Djebelemur'', ''‘Anchomomys’ milleri'', and ''Plesiopithecus'' are considered to be [[Sister group|sister taxa]] (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.{{Sfn|Seiffert|Simons|Ryan|Attia|2005|p=11400}}

=== Dating inconsistencies ===
Although stem lemuriforms like ''Djebelemur'' may have been contemporaneous with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40&amp;nbsp;mya according to the French paleoanthropologist [[Marc Godinot]].{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=446}} This would conflict with the [[molecular clock]] estimates by [[Evolutionary anthropology|evolutionary anthropologist]] [[Anne Yoder]] and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8&amp;nbsp;mya.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=458}}

In 2001, the discovery of ''[[Bugtilemur]]'', a fossil primate from [[Pakistan]] dating to the [[Oligocene]] and initially thought to be a [[Cheirogaleidae|cheirogaleid]] lemur, further challenged the [[Evolutionary history of lemurs|theory of lemur origins]];{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=8–9}} however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|pp=447–449}}

The minimum paleontological estimate for the divergence of lemurs and lorisoids nearly doubled when additional discoveries were made in northern Egypt during the 2000s of a stem galagid (''[[Saharagalago]]'') and a stem or crown lorisoid (''[[Karanisia]]'') dating to 37 and 40&amp;nbsp;mya respectively.{{Sfn|Jaeger|Beard|Chaimanee|Salem|2010|p=1095}}{{Sfn|Seiffert|Simons|Ryan|Attia|2005|p=11396}} ''Karanisia'' is the oldest fossil primate to exhibit a distinct lemuriform toothcomb.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|p=7}} This, as well as studies of other African adapiforms like ''‘Anchomomys’ milleri'', suggests a more ancient [[ghost lineage]] for lemuriforms in Africa.{{Sfn|Seiffert|Simons|Ryan|Attia|2005|p=11400}}{{Sfn|Seiffert|Simons|Attia|2003|pp=423–424}}

=== Original function of the lemuriform toothcomb ===

The [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] that shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb has been a topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence can be seen as supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|pp=73–74}} In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although [[prosimian]] primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one [[grooming claw]] on each foot to compensate.{{Sfn|Wood Jones|1918|p=346}} Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|p=75}}

The hypothesis that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform [[Taxon|taxa]], such as [[Cheirogaleidae|cheirogaleid]] lemurs (particularly fork-marked lemurs and the hairy-eared dwarf lemur) and galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered "primitive" forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|pp=76–77}} Also, strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized, based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct [[koala lemur]]s (''Megaladapis'').  If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on the shape of the anterior dentition, then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus ''[[Callithrix]]'' (a type of [[marmoset]]).{{Sfn|Rosenberger|Strasser|1985|p=75}}

In contrast, the grooming hypothesis emphasized that all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly suited for the mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding.{{Sfn|Rosenberger|Strasser|1985|p=75}} Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms.{{Sfn|Szalay|Seligsohn|1977|pp=80–81}} Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|p=74}} Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more important role in the use of the toothcomb than food procurement.{{Sfn|Eaglen|1980|p=276}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11992">'''Water privatization in Morocco''' goes back to the times of the [[French protectorate of Morocco|French Protectorate]] when most [[water supply system]]s were run under a private [[Contractual rights|concession]]. After independence the private utility was nationalized, but in the mid-1990s the [[Moroccan government]] privatized water and sewer services again, alongside electricity distribution, in four cities. The privatization process began with the award of the [[Casablanca]] concession to Lyonnaise des Eaux (now [[SUEZ]]) in 1997, followed by the award of a concession for the capital [[Rabat]] in 1998 and the award of another concession for [[Tangiers]] and [[Tetouan]] to [[Veolia Environnement]]. In 2009 private companies provided water and [[sanitation]] services to 38% of the urban population of the country.

== History ==
At the time of the French protectorate of Morocco beginning in 1912 the water supply of [[Casablanca]], [[Rabat]], [[Salé]], [[Tangiers]] and [[Meknes]] was provided by the French private company ''Société Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'électricité'' (SMD), a subsidiary of [[:fr:Lyonnaise des Eaux|Lyonnaise des Eaux]], under concession contracts. These contracts were terminated when Morocco became independent in 1956, at which time municipal public utilities became responsible for water supply and electricity distribution in the major cities of the Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Miras"&gt;Claude de Miras and Xavier Godard:[http://mediterranee.revues.org/index438.html Les firmes concessionnaires de service public au Maroc : eau potable, assainissement et transport collectifs], in:Méditerranée, No. 106 (2006), p. 114-117&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casablanca'''. In the early 1990s the municipal public utility ''Régie Autonome Intercommunale de Distribution d'Eau et d'Electricité de Casablanca'' (RAD) had a poor service record. Therefore, "after the direct intervention of King Hassan" the government decided in the mid-1990s to bring in a private company to manage the city's water, sewerage and power networks. Lyonnaise des Eaux under its CEO [[:fr:Jérôme Monod|Jérôme Monod]], a close adviser of [[Jacques Chirac]], negotiated the contract with the Interior Ministry under [[Driss Basri]]. The lengthy negotiations process for the contract was accompanied by intense criticism from the press, the Moroccan trade association ''Confédération Générale des Entreprises du Maroc'', and city councilors.&lt;ref name="MEED"&gt;[[Middle East Economic Digest]]:"No smooth course for private water", 7 March 1997, p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally a consortium led by [[Lyonnaise des Eaux]] (now SUEZ), was awarded the 30-year concession without a competitive tender. Lyonnaise des Eaux thus returned to a city where it had already provided services for almost half a century. The consortium was called Lydec and originally included [[Lyonnaise des Eaux]] (35%), [[Elyo]] (24%), [[Agbar]] (5%), [[EdF]] (18%) and [[Endesa (Spain)]] (18%). The contract was signed on April 28, 1997, between Jérôme Monod, CEO of Lyonnaise des Eaux, and [[Abdelmoughit Slimani]], President of the Council of Greater Casablanca (''Communauté Urbaine de Casablanca'').&lt;ref name="Miras2"&gt;{{fr}} Claude de Miras and Xavier Godard:[http://mediterranee.revues.org/index438.html Les firmes concessionnaires de service public au Maroc:eau potable, assainissement et transport collectifs], in:Méditerrannée, No. 106 (2006), p. 113-124&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the concession contract was renegotiated to provide a better balance between the two partners, limiting the rate of return of the concessionnaire from 14.6% to 11.7% and requiring him to increase his investments by Dirham 1bn. Also, automatic tariff increases will now be limited to specific situations such as increases in bulk water or electricity tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.lavieeco.com/Aproposdelavieeco Lavieéco]:[http://www.lavieeco.com/economie/3187-tarifs-de-leau-et-de-lelectricite-lydec-fait-des-concessions.html Tarifs de l’eau et de l’électricité : Lydec fait des concessions], March 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rabat'''. After direct negotiations in 1998, a concession for [[Rabat]] was signed in January 1999 with REDAL, a company consisting of a Portuguese partner (Electrocidade), a Spanish company (Urbaser) and a Moroccan company (Alborada). The concession met with problems from the very beginning. According to a presentation by Moroccan government officials, "the firm was not ready" the four partners were not coordinated, the start-up was slow contractual obligations were not fulfilled leading to tumultuous meetings, contestation of bills and protests. As a result, the founding shareholders transferred their equity in REDAL to [[Vivendi Environnement]].&lt;ref name="Nouha"&gt;Hassan Nouha (Ministry of Interior), Mehdi Berradi (Delegated Management Control Department in Casablanca), Mohammed Dinia (Delegated Management Control Department in Rabat-Sale) and Mustapha El Habti (Delegated Management Control Department in Tangiers):Public-Private Partnerships – The Case of Morocco, International Development Research Center Water Demand Management Forum, Amman, October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tangiers and Tetouan'''. The concession in Tangiers and Tetouan covering 23 municipalities with 1.1 million inhabitants was awarded in January 2002 after competitive bidding. Seven bids were received, of which one was discarded for non-conformity. The six offers included groups led by Lyonnaise des Eaux (France), [[Enron]] (USA), Thames Water (UK), Union Fenosa (Spain) SAUR (France) and Vivendi (France). The bids were evaluated on the basis of technical and financial criteria combined in a single score. The contract was awarded to the group led by Vivendi, which used the brand name [[Amendis]]. The formal name of the group is ''Société des eaux et d'électricité du Nord'' (SEEN), consisting of [[Vivendi]], [[Hydro-Québec|Hydro-Québec International]] (Canada) and ONA (Morocco).&lt;ref name="Miras"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nouha"/&gt;

== Regulation ==

The public counterparts (delegating authorities) of the concessions in Morocco are the municipalities. Each delegating authority has set up a technical committee to regulate the contracts, comprising representatives of the municipality, the Ministry of Interior and the concessionnaire. The committee reviews work plans and reports. In addition, about one year after the contracts in Casablanca and Rabat were signed local supervisory commissions were set up. Also, a supervisory commission was created at the national level. As of 2002, the government concluded that the members representing the delegating authority in the technical committee in Casablanca felt constrained by a lack of expertise compared to the specialists from the private concessionnaire. On the other hand, the concessionnaire felt that there was interference in the management of the services. This improved somewhat after the local supervisory commission was set up in Casablanca. This experience influenced the design of the concession contracts in Tangiers and Tetouan where clauses to protect consumers were added and local supervisory commissions were included in contract design from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Nouha"/&gt;

== Investment ==

Lydec's 30-year investment plan totals 30 billion Moroccan Dirham. According to one source 21 billion of this sum will come from connection fees paid by new customers into a fund, 8.2 billion would come from Bank loans and internal cash generation, and 0.8 billion would be in the form of equity to be raised by the subsidiary running the concession.&lt;ref name="MEED"/&gt; According to another source the concessionnaire will not provide any significant equity, nor will it borrow significant debt. Instead it will generate 87.8% of its contribution of 6.3 billion Dirham by using its technical and commercial know-how to mobilize funding from its customers. The remainder would be mobilized through connection fees.&lt;ref name="Miras"/&gt; According to Lydec, the company invested 7.7 billion Dirham between 1997 and 2008, of which the company financed 4.4 billion. 33% of the investment was for sanitation, 23% for water supply, 34% for electricity and 10% were investments that benefited all three sectors. A substantial share of the investments in sanitation were dedicated to storm water management.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Lydec:[http://www.lydec.ma/html/investissements.htm Investissements], accessed on October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==

'''Casablanca'''. According to Lydec, surveys show that more than 90% of its customers have noticed improvements: shorter waiting time at customer centers, simplified procedures, quicker repairs, more reliable billing and less inundations. In particular, Lydec built the Western collector, a 4.7&amp;nbsp;km underground stormwater drain with a capacity of 40 m3/s. Also, the company says that it saved 25 million cubic meters of drinking water in 2002 compared to the situation before the concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Lydec:[http://www.lydec.ma/html/visite.htm Carte de visite], accessed on October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other cities'''. According to Amendis, during the first five years of its concession in Tangiers and Tetouan it expanded the wastewater collection and treatment system in the two cities and provided 40,000 subsidized water and wastewater connections.&lt;ref&gt;Veolia Water:[http://www.veoliawater.com/press/case-studies/collectivites/2252,tangier-tetouan.htm Tangier and Tetouan – Morocco. Water, wastewater and electricity services], accessed on October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The level of [[non-revenue water]] has been reduced from 32% in 2002 to 19% in 2008 in Rabat, and from 41% to 21% in Tangiers, according to Veolia.&lt;ref name="GWI Veolia"&gt;Global Water Intelligence:Debtors impact Veolia Maroc's cashflow, February 2010, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tariffs ==

'''Casablanca'''. According to the Casablanca concession contract, tariffs are adjusted annually based on a price index defined in the contract. If the resulting tariff increase is less than 3% it is applied automatically. If it is more than 3% the private company and the state decide about the measures to be taken. If no decision is taken within two months, the company can apply a 3% tariff increase while the contracting parties decide about how to deal with the remaining tariff increase. Increases in bulk water tariffs and in electricity production tariffs are passed on automatically to consumers, based on the principle "no loss, no gain".&lt;ref name=Hajji&gt;{{cite book|last=Hajji|first=Mohammad|title=Droit et pratique des services publics au Maroc. De la concesion à la gestion déléguée.|year=2007|publisher=Editions Zaouia|isbn=9954-438-37-8|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1997 and 2001 the average water tariff in Casablanca increased by 35% and the average sewerage tariff by 34%. However, the electricity tariff decreased by 6%. During public management by RAD water tariffs had increased by 60% between 1990 and 1995. However, this increase had to a large extent been due to an increase in bulk water tariffs charged by ONEP to RAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Dominique Lorrain:Multiutilité à Casablanca, [[:fr:CEMS|CEMS]], [[CNRS]]/[[EHESS]], Juin 2002, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other cities'''. Concerning the concessions by Veolia, tariff increases in the 2007–10 period were lower than contractually required, according to Veolia. The company claims that the government owes it Dirham 93 million (US$11.5 million) because of unimplemented tariff increases. Increases in the tariffs for bulk water supplied by the public company ONEP to the private companies, as well as increases in electricity tariffs, cannot automatically be passed on to consumers.&lt;ref name="GWI Veolia"/&gt;
