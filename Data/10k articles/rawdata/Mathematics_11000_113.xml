      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">The '''circuit topology''' of a linear [[polymer]] refers to arrangement of its intra-molecular contacts.  Examples of linear polymers with intra-molecular contacts are [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s. For defining the circuit topology, contacts are defined depending on the context. For proteins with disulfide bonds, these bonds could be considered as contacts. In a context where beta-beta interactions in proteins are more relevant, these interactions are used to define the circuit topology. As such, circuit topology framework can be applied to a wide range of applications including protein folding and analysis of genome architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212614002093 | doi=10.1016/j.str.2014.06.015 | volume=22 | title=Circuit Topology of Proteins and Nucleic Acids | year=2014 | journal=Structure | pages=1227–1237 | last1 = Mashaghi | first1 = Alireza | last2 = van Wijk | first2 = Roeland J. | last3 = Tans | first3 = Sander J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, data from [[Chromosome conformation capture|Hi-C]] and related technologies can be readily analysed using circuit topology framework. 

For a chain with two binary contacts, three arrangements are available: parallel, series and crossed. For a chain with n contacts, the topology can be described by an n by n matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a pair of contacts and may take one of the three states, P, S and X. 
[[Image:Circuit topology.jpg|right|250px|right|Circuit topology relations in a chain with two binary contacts.]] Multi-valent intra chain interactions can often be structurally decomposed into binary interactions and then be subjected to similar analysis. 

Circuit topology has implications for folding kinetics and molecular evolution. Circuit topology along with contact order and size are determinants of folding rate of linear polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1039/C4CP03402C | url =  http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/cp/c4cp03402c#!divAbstract | volume=16 | title=Circuit topology of self-interacting chains: implications for folding and unfolding dynamics | year=2014 | journal=Phys.

[[Image:wiki constant function 175 200.png|270px|right|Constant function ''y''=4]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''constant function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose (output) value is the same for every input value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|last1=Tanton|first1=James|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File, New York|isbn=0-8160-5124-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics, Constant Function | author=C.Clapham, J.Nicholson | publisher =Addison-Wesley | year =2009|page=175|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric|publisher=CRC Press, London|isbn=0-8493-9640-9|year=1999|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the function &lt;math&gt;y(x) = 4&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function because the value of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is 4 regardless of the input value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (see image).

==Basic properties==
As a real-valued function of a real-valued argument, a constant function has the general form &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y(x)=c&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;or just &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=c&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;.

:'''Example:''' The function &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y(x)=2&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;or just &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=2&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is the specific constant function where the output value is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c=2&lt;/math&gt;. The [[domain of a function|domain of this function]] is the set of all real numbers ℝ. The [[codomain]] of this function is just {2}. The independent variable ''x'' does not appear on the right side of the function expression and so its value is "vacuously substituted". Namely ''y''(0)=2, ''y''(−2.7)=2, ''y''(π)=2,.... No matter what value of ''x'' is input, the output is "2".

:'''Real-world example:''' A store where every item is sold for the price of 1 euro.

The graph of the constant function &lt;math&gt;y=c&lt;/math&gt; is a '''horizontal line''' in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] that passes through the point &lt;math&gt;(0,c)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College Algebra|last1=Dawkins|first1=Paul|year=2007|publisher= Lamar University|url=http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Alg.aspx|page=224|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of a [[polynomial]] in one variable ''x'', the '''non-zero constant function''' is a polynomial of degree 0 and its general form is &lt;math&gt;f(x) = c \, ,\,\, c \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;. This function has no intersection point with the ''x''-axis, that is, it has no [[Zero of a function|root (zero)]]. On the other hand, the polynomial &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;is the '''identically zero function'''. It is the (trivial) constant function and every ''x'' is a root. Its graph is the ''x''-axis in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Mathematical Concepts - Pre-calculus with Applications, Student Edition|last1=Carter|first1=John A.|last4=Marks|first4=Daniel|last2=Cuevas|first2=Gilbert J.|last3=Holliday|first3=Berchie|last5=McClure|first5=Melissa S. |publisher=Glencoe/McGraw-Hill School Pub Co|year=2005|isbn=978-0078682278|chapter=1|edition=1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constant function is an [[Even and odd functions|even function]], i.e. the graph of a constant function is symmetric with respect to the ''y''-axis.

In the context where it is defined, the [[derivative]] of a function is a measure of the rate of change of function values with respect to change in input values. Because a constant function does not change, its derivative is 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DerivativeProofs.aspx|title=Derivative Proofs|year=2007|last1=Dawkins|first1=Paul|publisher= Lamar University|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often written: &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(c)'=0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;. The converse is also true. Namely, if ''y''&amp;#39;(''x'')=0 for all real numbers ''x'', then ''y''(''x'') is a constant function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Zero_Derivative_implies_Constant_Function|title=Zero Derivative implies Constant Function|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Example:''' Given the constant function  &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y(x)=-\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;. The derivative of ''y'' is the identically zero function &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y'(x)=(-\sqrt{2})'=0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;.

==Other properties==
For functions between [[preorder|preordered sets]], constant functions are both [[order-preserving]] and [[order-reversing]]; conversely, if ''f'' is both order-preserving and order-reversing, and if the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of ''f'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then ''f'' must be constant.

* Every constant function whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] are the same is [[idempotent]].
* Every constant function between [[topological space]]s is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].
* A constant function factors through the [[singleton (mathematics)|one-point set]], the [[terminal object]] in the [[category of sets]]. This observation is instrumental for [[F. William Lawvere]]'s axiomatization of set theory, the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Leinster|first1=Tom|title=An informal introduction to topos theory|date=27 Jun 2011|eprint=1012.5647|class=math.CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Every set X is [[isomorphic]] to the set of constant functions into it.  For each element x and any set Y, there is a unique function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}: Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}(y) = x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if a function &lt;math&gt;f: Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(y) = f(y')&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y, y' \in Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a constant function.
** As a corollary, the one-point set is a [[generator (category theory)|generator]] in the category of sets. 
** Every set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is canonically isomorphic to the function set &lt;math&gt;X^1&lt;/math&gt;, or [[hom set]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(1,X)&lt;/math&gt; in the category of sets, where 1 is the one-point set. Because of this, and the adjunction between cartesian products and hom in the category of sets (so there is a canonical isomorphism between functions of two variables and functions of one variable valued in functions of another (single) variable, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(X \times Y,Z) \cong \operatorname{hom}(X(\operatorname{hom}(Y,Z))&lt;/math&gt;) the category of sets is a [[closed monoidal category]] with the [[cartesian product]] of sets as tensor product and the one-point set as tensor unit. In the isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\lambda :1\times X \cong X\cong X\times1:\rho&lt;/math&gt; [[natural transformation|natural in X]], the left and right unitors are the projections &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; the [[ordered pair]]s &lt;math&gt;(*,x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x,*)&lt;/math&gt; respectively to the element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the unique [[point (mathematics)|point]] in the one-point set.

A function on a [[connected set]] is [[locally constant]] if and only if it is constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2757">In [[constraint satisfaction]], '''constraint inference''' is a relationship between constraints and their consequences. A set of constraints &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; entails a constraint &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if every solution to &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a valuation of the variables in the scopes of the constraints in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and all constraints in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are satisfied by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies the constraint &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

Some operations on constraints produce a new constraint that is a consequence of them. '''Constraint composition''' operates on a pair of binary constraints &lt;math&gt;((x,y),R)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;((y,z),S)&lt;/math&gt; with a common variable. The composition of such two constraints is the constraint &lt;math&gt;((x,z),Q)&lt;/math&gt; that is satisfied by every evaluation of the two non-shared variables for which there exists a value of the shared variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that the evaluation of these three variables satisfies the two original constraints &lt;math&gt;((x,y),R)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;((y,z),S)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Constraint projection''' restricts the effects of a constraint to some of its variables. Given a constraint &lt;math&gt;(t,R)&lt;/math&gt; its projection to a subset &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; of its variables is the constraint &lt;math&gt;(t',R')&lt;/math&gt; that is satisfied by an evaluation if this evaluation can be extended to the other variables in such a way the original constraint &lt;math&gt;(t,R)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied.

'''Extended composition''' is similar in principle to composition, but allows for an arbitrary number of possibly non-binary constraints; the generated constraint is on an arbitrary subset of the variables of the original constraints. Given constraints &lt;math&gt;C_1,\ldots,C_m&lt;/math&gt; and a list &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of their variables, the extended composition of them is the constraint &lt;math&gt;(A,R)&lt;/math&gt; where an evaluation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; satisfies this constraint if it can be extended to the other variables so that &lt;math&gt;C_1,\ldots,C_m&lt;/math&gt; are all satisfied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10572">In [[control theory]], we may need to find out whether or not a system such as 

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t)\boldsymbol{=Ax}(t)+\boldsymbol{Bu}(t)\\
\boldsymbol{y}(t)=\boldsymbol{Cx}(t)+\boldsymbol{Du}(t)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

is [[Controllability|controllable]] or not, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{D}&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\times p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q\times n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q\times p&lt;/math&gt; matrices. 

One of the many ways one can achieve such goal is by the use of the '''Controllability Gramian'''.


== Controllability in LTI Systems==
Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems are those systems in which the parameters &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{D}&lt;/math&gt; are invariant with respect to time.

One can observe if the LTI system is or is not controllable simply by looking at the pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we can say that the following statements are equivalent:

1. The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt; is controllable.

2. The &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix 

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W_{c}}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}d\tau=\int_{0}^{t}e^{\boldsymbol{A}(t-\tau)}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}(t-\tau)}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

is nonsingular for any &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The &lt;math&gt;n\times np&lt;/math&gt; controllability matrix

&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{C}}=[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\boldsymbol{B} &amp; \boldsymbol{AB} &amp; \boldsymbol{A^{2}B} &amp; ... &amp; \boldsymbol{A^{n-1}B}\end{array}]&lt;/math&gt;

has rank n.

4. The &lt;math&gt;n\times(n+p)&lt;/math&gt; matrix 

&lt;math&gt;[\begin{array}{cc}
\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{-\lambda}\boldsymbol{I} &amp; \boldsymbol{B}\end{array}] &lt;/math&gt;

has full row rank at every eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

5. If, in addition, all eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; have negative real parts (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is stable), then the unique solution of

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{W}_{c}+\boldsymbol{W}_{c}\boldsymbol{A^{T}}=-\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

is positive definite. The solution is called the Controllability Gramian and can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W_{c}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

In the following section we are going to take a closer look at the Controllability Gramian.

== Controllability Gramian ==

The controllability Gramian can be found as the solution of the [[Lyapunov equation]] given by

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{W}_{c}+\boldsymbol{W}_{c}\boldsymbol{A^{T}}=-\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we can see that if we take

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W_{c}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

as a solution, we are going to find that:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccccc}
\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{W}_{c}+\boldsymbol{W}_{c}\boldsymbol{A^{T}} &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{\infty}\boldsymbol{A}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}d\tau &amp; + &amp; \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}\boldsymbol{A^{T}}d\tau\\
 &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{d}{d\tau}(e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{B}\boldsymbol{B}^{T}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau})d\tau &amp; = &amp; e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}\boldsymbol{B}\boldsymbol{B}^{T}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}t}|_{t=0}^{\infty}\\
 &amp; = &amp; \boldsymbol{0}-\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}\\
 &amp; = &amp; \boldsymbol{-BB^{T}}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we used the fact that &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}=0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t=\infty&lt;/math&gt; for stable &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; (all its eigenvalues have negative real part). This shows us that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed the solution for the Lyapunov equation under analysis.

=== Properties ===

We can see that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric matrix, therefore, so is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}&lt;/math&gt;. 

We can use again the fact that, if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is stable (all its eigenvalues have negative real part) to show that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is unique. In order to prove so, suppose we have two different solutions for 

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{W}_{c}+\boldsymbol{W}_{c}\boldsymbol{A^{T}}=-\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

and they are given by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{(W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})+\boldsymbol{(W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})\boldsymbol{A^{T}}=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}&lt;/math&gt; by the left and by &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}t}&lt;/math&gt; by the right, would lead us to

&lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}[\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{(W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})+\boldsymbol{(W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})\boldsymbol{A^{T}}]e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}=\frac{d}{dt}[e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}[(\boldsymbol{W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}]=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;[e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}[(\boldsymbol{W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}]|_{t=0}^{\infty}=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

using the fact that &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{0}-(\boldsymbol{W}_{c1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{c2})=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}&lt;/math&gt; has to be unique.

Also, we can see that

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x^{T}W_{c}x}=\int_{0}^{\infty}\boldsymbol{x}^{T}e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}t}\boldsymbol{x}dt=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left\Vert \boldsymbol{B^{T}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}t}\boldsymbol{x}}\right\Vert _{2}^{2}dt&lt;/math&gt;

is positive for any t, and that makes &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}&lt;/math&gt; a positive definite matrix. 

More properties of controllable systems can be found in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Chi-Tsong|title=Linear System Theory and Design Third Edition|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-19-511777-8|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the proof for the other equivalent statements of “The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt; is controllable” presented in section Controllability in LTI Systems.

== Discrete Time Systems ==

For discrete time systems as

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{x}[k+1]\boldsymbol{=Ax}[k]+\boldsymbol{Bu}[k]\\
\boldsymbol{y}[k]=\boldsymbol{Cx}[k]+\boldsymbol{Du}[k]
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

One can check that there are equivalences for the statement “The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt; is controllable” (the equivalences are much alike for the continuous time case). 

We are interested in the equivalence that claims that, if “The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt; is controllable” and all the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; have magnitude less than &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is stable), then the unique solution of

&lt;math&gt;W_{dc}-\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{W}_{dc}\boldsymbol{A^{T}}=\boldsymbol{BB^{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

is positive definite and given by

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{dc}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\boldsymbol{A}^{m}\boldsymbol{BB}^{T}(\boldsymbol{A}^{T})^{m}&lt;/math&gt;

That is called the discrete Controllability Gramian. We can easily see the correspondence between discrete time and the continuous time case, that is, if we can check that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{dc}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, and all eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; have magnitude less than &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the system &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt; is controllable. More properties and proofs can be found in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Chi-Tsong|title=Linear System Theory and Design Third Edition|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-19-511777-8|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


== Linear Time Variant Systems ==

Linear time variant (LTV) systems are those in the form:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t)\boldsymbol{=A}(t)\boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{B}(t)\boldsymbol{u}(t)\\
\boldsymbol{y}(t)=\boldsymbol{C}(t)\boldsymbol{x}(t)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the matrices &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; have entries that varies with time. Again, as well as in the continuous time case and in the discrete time case, one may be interested in discovering if the system given by the pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A}(t),\boldsymbol{B}(t))&lt;/math&gt; is controllable or not. This can be done in a very similar way of the preceding cases.

The system &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A}(t),\boldsymbol{B}(t))&lt;/math&gt; is controllable at time &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a finite &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix also called the Controllability Gramian is given by

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t_{0},t_{1})=\int_{_{0}}^{^{\infty}}\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t_{1},\tau)\boldsymbol{B}(\tau)\boldsymbol{B}^{T}(\tau)\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T}(t_{1},\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t,\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is the state transition matrix of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\dot{x}}=\boldsymbol{A}(t)\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular.

Again, we have a similar method to determine if a system is or not a controllable system.

=== Properties of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t_{0},t_{1})&lt;/math&gt; ===

We have that the Controllability Gramian &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t_{0},t_{1})&lt;/math&gt; have the following property:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t_{0},t_{1})=\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t_{0},t)+\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t,t_{0})\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t,t_{0})\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T}(t,t_{0})&lt;/math&gt;

that can easily be seen by the definition of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{c}(t_{0},t_{1})&lt;/math&gt; and by the property of the state transition matrix that claims that:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t_{0},t_{1})=\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t_{1},\tau)\boldsymbol{\Phi}(\tau,t_{0})&lt;/math&gt;

More about the Controllability Gramian can be found in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Chi-Tsong|title=Linear System Theory and Design Third Edition|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-19-511777-8|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe''''' is a science book by [[mathematical physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] published by [[The Bodley Head]] in 2010. The book outlines Penrose's [[Conformal Cyclic Cosmology]] (CCC) model, which is an extension of [[general relativity]] but opposed to the widely supported multidimensional [[String theory|string theories]] and [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]] following the [[Big Bang]].

==Synopsis==
Penrose examines implications of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second Law]] of Thermodynamics and its inevitable march toward a maximum [[entropy]] state of the [[universe]]. Penrose illustrates entropy in terms of information state [[phase space]] (with 1 dimension for every [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]) where particles end up moving through ever larger grains of this phase space from smaller grains over time due to random motion. He disagrees with [[Stephen Hawking]]'s back-track&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawking|first=S.W.|title=Information Loss in Black Holes|journal=Physical Review D|date=18 July 2005|volume=72|issue=8 |pages=084013|arxiv=hep-th/0507171 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.72.084013 |bibcode = 2005PhRvD..72h4013H }}&lt;/ref&gt; over whether [[Black hole information paradox|information is destroyed]] when matter enters [[black holes]]. Such information loss would non-trivially lower total entropy in the universe as the black holes wither away due to [[Hawking radiation]], resulting in a loss in phase space degrees of freedom.

Penrose goes on further to state that over enormous scales of time (beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years), distance ceases to be meaningful as all [[mass]] breaks down into extremely [[red shift|red-shifted]] [[photon]] energy, whereupon time has no influence, and the universe continues to expand without event {{math|[[Arrow (symbol)|→]]}}{{math|[[Infinity|∞]]}}. This period from Big Bang to infinite expansion Penrose defines as an [[aeon]]. The smooth [[no-hair theorem|“hairless”]] [[Infinity|infinite]] oblivion of the previous aeon becomes the low-entropy Big Bang state of the next aeon cycle. [[Conformal geometry]] preserves the angles but not the distances of the previous aeon, allowing the new aeon universe to appear quite small at its inception as its phase space starts anew.

Penrose cites concentric rings found in the [[WMAP]] [[cosmic microwave background]] survey as preliminary evidence for his model, as he predicted black hole collisions from the previous aeon would leave such structures due to ripples of [[gravitational waves]].

==Reception==
Most nonexpert critics (nonscientists) have found the book a challenge to fully comprehend; a few such as ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe – Review|journal=Kirkus Reviews|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Doug Johnstone for ''[[The Scotsman]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnstone|first=Doug|title=Book reviews: The Grand Design {{!}} Cycles of Time|url=http://living.scotsman.com/books/Book-reviews-The-Grand-Design.6538072.jp|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; appreciate the against the grain innovative ideas Penrose puts forth.

In [[information theory]], '''dual total correlation''' (Han 1978), '''excess entropy''' (Olbrich 2008), or '''binding information''' (Abdallah and Plumbley 2010) is one of the two known non-negative generalizations of [[mutual information]].  While [[total correlation]] is bounded by the sum entropies of the ''n'' elements, the dual total correlation is bounded by the joint-entropy of the ''n'' elements.  Although well behaved, dual total correlation has received much less attention than the total correlation.  A measure known as "TSE-complexity" defines a continuum between the total correlation and dual total correlation (Ay 2001).

==Definition==

[[Image:VennInfo3Var.svg|thumb|256px|right|[[Venn diagram]] of information theoretic measures for three variables x, y, and z. The dual total correlation is represented by the union of the three mutual informations and is shown in the diagram by the yellow, magenta, cyan, and gray regions.]]

For a set of ''n'' [[random variable]]s &lt;math&gt;\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the dual total correlation &lt;math&gt;D(X_1,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; D(X_1,\ldots,X_n) = H\left( X_1, \ldots, X_n \right) - \sum_{i=1}^n H\left( X_i \mid X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_n \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[joint entropy]] of the variable set &lt;math&gt;\{X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(X_i \mid \cdots )&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional entropy]] of variable &lt;math&gt;X_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, given the rest.

==Normalized==
The dual total correlation normalized between [0,1] is simply the dual total correlation divided by its maximum value &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n})&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;ND(X_1,\ldots,X_n) = \frac{D(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}{H(X_1,\ldots,X_n)} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Bounds==
Dual total correlation is non-negative and bounded above by the joint entropy &lt;math&gt;H(X_1, \ldots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq D(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \leq H(X_1, \ldots, X_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, Dual total correlation has a close relationship with total correlation, &lt;math&gt;C(X_1, \ldots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{C(X_1, \ldots, X_n)}{n-1} \leq D(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \leq (n-1) \; C(X_1, \ldots, X_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to other quantities==

In [[Information theory and measure theory|measure theoretic]] terms, by the definition of dual total correlation:

:&lt;math&gt;
D(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \mu\left(\bigcup_i \tilde{X}_i \setminus \left(\bigcup_j \tilde{X}_j \setminus \bigcup_{k\neq j} \tilde{X}_k) \right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equal to the union of the pairwise mutual informations:

:&lt;math&gt;
D(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \mu\left(\bigcup_{i}\bigcup_{j\neq i} \left(\tilde{X}_i\cap\tilde{X}_j\right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Han (1978) originally defined the dual total correlation as,
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; D(X_1,\ldots,X_n) \\[10pt]
\equiv {} &amp; \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_n ) \right] - (n-1) \; H(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \; .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
However Abdallah and Plumbley (2010) showed its equivalence to the easier-to-understand form of the joint entropy minus the sum of conditional entropies via the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; D(X_1,\ldots,X_n) \\[10pt]
\equiv {} &amp; \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_n ) \right] - (n-1) \; H(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \\
= {} &amp; \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_n ) \right] + (1-n) \; H(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \\
= {} &amp; H(X_1, \ldots, X_n) + \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_n ) - H(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \right] \\
= {} &amp; H\left( X_1, \ldots, X_n \right) - \sum_{i=1}^n H\left( X_i \mid X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_n \right)\; .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal approach''''' is a textbook by [[Howard Jerome Keisler|H. Jerome Keisler]]. The subtitle alludes to the [[infinitesimal]] numbers of the [[hyperreal number]] system of [[Abraham Robinson]] and is sometimes given as '''''An approach using infinitesimals'''''. The book is available freely online and is currently published by Dover.{{sfn|Keisler|2011}}

==Textbook==
Keisler's textbook is based on Robinson's construction of the [[hyperreal numbers]]. Keisler also published a companion book, ''Foundations of Infinitesimal Calculus'', for instructors which covers the foundational material in more depth.

Keisler defines all basic notions of the calculus such as continuity, derivative, and integral using infinitesimals. The usual definitions in terms of ε-δ techniques are provided at the end of Chapter 5 to enable a transition to a standard sequence.

In his textbook, Keisler used the pedagogical technique of an infinite-magnification microscope, so as to represent graphically, distinct [[hyperreal number]]s infinitely close to each other.  Similarly, an infinite-resolution telescope is used to represent infinite numbers.

When one examines a curve, say the graph of ''ƒ'', under a magnifying glass, its curvature decreases proportionally to the magnification power of the lens.  Similarly, an infinite-magnification microscope will transform an infinitesimal arc of a graph of ''ƒ'', into a straight line, up to an infinitesimal error (only visible by applying a higher-magnification "microscope").  The derivative of ''ƒ'' is then the ([[standard part]] of the) slope of that line (see figure).  
[[File:Standard part function with two continua.svg|360px|thumb|right|The standard part function "rounds off" a finite hyperreal to the nearest real number. The "infinitesimal microscope" is used to view an infinitesimal neighborhood of a standard real.]]

Thus the microscope is used as a device in explaining the derivative.

==Reception==

The book was first reviewed by [[Errett Bishop]], noted for his work in constructive mathematics.  Bishop's review was harshly critical; see [[Criticism of non-standard analysis]].  Shortly after, [[Martin Davis]] and Hausner published a detailed favorable review, as did [[Andreas Blass]] and [[Keith Stroyan]].{{sfn|Davis|Hausner|1978}}{{sfn|Blass|1978}}{{sfn|Madison|Stroyan|1977}}  Keisler's student K.&amp;nbsp;Sullivan,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.wisc.edu/oldhome/directories/alumni/1974.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as part of her Ph.D. thesis, performed a controlled experiment involving 5 schools which found ''Elementary Calculus'' to have advantages over the standard method of teaching calculus.{{sfn|Keisler|2011}}{{sfn|Sullivan|1976}} Despite the benefits described by Sullivan, the vast majority of mathematicians have not adopted infinitesimal methods in their teaching.{{sfn|Tall|1980}} Recently, Katz &amp; Katz{{sfn|Katz|Katz|2010}} give a positive account of a calculus course based on Keisler's book. O'Donovan also described his experience teaching calculus using infinitesimals.  His initial point of view was positive, {{sfn|O'Donovan|Kimber|2006}} but later he found pedagogical difficulties with approach to non-standard calculus taken by this text and others.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2007}}

G. R. Blackley remarked in a letter to Prindle, Weber &amp; Schmidt, concerning ''Elementary Calculus: An Approach Using Infinitesimals'', "Such problems as might arise with the book will be political. It is revolutionary. Revolutions are seldom welcomed by the established party, although revolutionaries often are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = Kathleen | year = 1976 | title = Mathematical Education: The Teaching of Elementary Calculus Using the Nonstandard Analysis Approach | url = | journal = Amer. Math. Monthly | volume = 83 | issue = 5| pages = 370–375 | doi=10.2307/2318657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hrbacek writes that the definitions of ''continuity'', ''derivative'', and ''integral'' implicitly must be grounded in the ε-δ method in Robinson's theoretical framework, in order to extend definitions to include non-standard values of the inputs, claiming that the hope that non-standard calculus could be done without ε-δ methods could not be realized in full.{{sfn|Hrbacek|2007}} Błaszczyk et al. detail the usefulness of [[microcontinuity]] in developing a transparent definition of uniform continuity, and characterize Hrbacek's criticism as a "dubious lament".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Transfer principle==
Between the first and second edition of the ''Elementary Calculus'', much of the theoretical material that was in the first chapter was moved to the epilogue at the end of the book, including the theoretical groundwork of non-standard analysis.

In the second edition Keisler introduces the extension principle and the transfer principle in the following form:
:Every real statement that holds for one or more particular real functions holds for the hyperreal natural extensions of these functions.

Keisler then gives a few examples of ''real statements'' to which the principle applies:
*Closure law for addition: for any ''x'' and ''y'', the sum ''x'' + ''y'' is defined.
*Commutative law for addition: ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x''.
*A rule for order: if 0 &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''y'' then 0 &lt; 1/''y'' &lt; 1/''x''.
*Division by zero is never allowed: ''x''/0 is undefined.
*An algebraic identity: &lt;math&gt;(x-y)^2 = x^2-2xy+y^2&lt;/math&gt;.
*A trigonometric identity: &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
*A rule for logarithms: If ''x'' &gt; 0 and ''y'' &gt; 0, then &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} (xy) = \log_{10}x + \log_{10}y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Eleusis''''' is a [[Card games#Multi-genre games|multi-genre card game]] where one player chooses a secret rule to determine which cards can be played on top of others, and the other players attempt to determine the rule using [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive logic]].

The game was invented by [[Robert Abbott (game designer)|Robert Abbott]] in 1956, and was first published by [[Martin Gardner]] in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine in June 1959.  A revised version appeared in Gardner's July 1977 column.

Eleusis is sometimes considered an analogy to the problems of [[scientific method]]. It can be compared with the card game [[Mao (game)|Mao]], which also has secret rules that can be learned inductively. The games of [[Penultima]] and [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]] also feature players attempting to discover inductively a secret rule or rules thought of by a "Master" or "Spectators" who declare plays legal or illegal on the basis of the rules.

The formalization of Eleusis+Nobel inspired new modes of [[communication]] by [[Trade|exchange]] of [[logic]]al notes.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sallantin, Christophe Douy, Abdelkader Gouaich, Juan Carlos Martinez, Denis Pierre, Antoine Seilles, [[Jean-Baptiste Soufron]], Jean-Philippe Cointet. ''A Logical Framework to Annotate Documents in a VirtualAgora'', Square of Opposition 07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eleusis Express==
In 2006, John Golden developed a streamlined version of the game, intended to assist elementary school teachers in explaining the [[scientific method]] to students. Abbott himself considers the variant a "great game", and refers to it as "Eleusis Express".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=Robert|title=Eleusis and Eleusis Express|url=http://www.logicmazes.com/games/eleusis/|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To play Eleusis Express, each player is dealt 12 cards, and the dealer decides on a rule on how a card can correctly be played (such as "alternate red then black cards" or "alternate cards with a closed loop (e.g. 4, 6, 8, 9, Q, A) and those without"). The object of the game is to empty the player's hand. Once a player thinks they have figured out the rule then they can declare themselves a "prophet" and make the good/bad card calls for the dealer.

An incorrect card goes below the line of cards starting a sideline. Players making an incorrect play draw another card.

If a player thinks he cannot play a legitimate card, he may declare a no play, and show his hand to everybody. If incorrect the dealer plays the correct card and gives the player another card. If the player is right the dealer replaces the player's hand with a smaller hand (with one fewer card) from the deck.

The round ends with a player running out of cards or a player correctly guessing the rule. At the end of the round a player scores 12 points minus the total of cards he has in his hand. The full game ends once everyone has had a chance to be dealer.

'''Enrico Bombieri''' (born 26 November 1940 in [[Milan]]) is an Italian [[mathematician]], known for his work in [[analytic number theory]], [[algebraic geometry]], univalent functions, theory of several complex variables, [[partial differential equations]] of minimal surfaces, and the theory of finite groups. He won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131113045006/http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1974.1/ICM1974.1.ocr.pdf Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bombieri published his first mathematical paper in 1957 when he was 16 years old. In 1963 at age 22 he earned his first degree (Laurea) in mathematics from the [[Università degli Studi di Milano]] under the supervision of Giovanni Ricci and then studied at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] with [[Harold Davenport]].

Bombieri was an assistant professor (1963–1965) and then a full professor (1965–1966) at the [[University of Cagliari|Università di Cagliari]], at the [[Università di Pisa]] in 1966–1974, and then at the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] in 1974–1977. From Pisa he emigrated in 1977 to the USA, where he became a professor at the  ''School of Mathematics'' at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In 2011 he became professor emeritus.

Bombieri's research in [[number theory]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis]] have earned him many international prizes — a [[Fields Medal]] in 1974 and the [[Balzan Prize]] in 1980. In 2010 he received the [[King Faisal International Prize]] (jointly with [[Terence Tao]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.com/ King Faisal Foundation], - retrieved 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bombieri and Tao Receive King Faisal Prize|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=May 2010|volume=57|issue=5|pages=642–643|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201005/rtx100500642p.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[List of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1974 at Vancouver. He is a member, or foreign member, of several learned academies, including the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (elected 1984), the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (elected 1996), and the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] (elected 1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincei.it/modules.php?name=Soci&amp;file=scheda&amp;func=Soci_scheda&amp;Id=438 Scheda socio], from the website of [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei|Accademia dei Lincei]] (elected 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 he was made ''Cavaliere di Gran Croce al Merito della Repubblica Italiana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Torno Armando|title=BOMBIERI Il re dei numeri che ha conquistato il mondo|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=28 May 2002|page=35|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/maggio/28/BOMBIERI_dei_numeri_che_conquistato_co_0_0205285644.shtml|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem]] is one of the major applications of the [[large sieve method]]. It improves [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] on [[prime number]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]s, by showing that by averaging over the modulus over a range, the mean error is much less than can be proved in a given case. This result can sometimes substitute for the still-unproved [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]].

In 1969 Bombieri, [[Ennio de Giorgi|De Giorgi]], and [[Enrico Giusti|Giusti]] solved [[Bernstein's problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Bombieri | first1=Enrico | last2=De Giorgi | first2=Ennio | last3=Giusti | first3=Enrico | title=Minimal cones and the Bernstein problem | doi=10.1007/BF01404309 | mr=0250205 | year=1969 | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | issn=0020-9910 | volume=7 | pages=243–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Bombieri developed the technique known as the "asymptotic sieve".&lt;ref name="asymp-sieve"&gt;E. Bombieri, "The asymptotic sieve", ''[[:it:Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze|Mem. Acad. Naz. dei XL]]'', 1/2 (1976) 243–269.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 he supplied the completion of the proof of the uniqueness of finite groups of Ree type in characteristic 3; at the time of its publication it was one of the missing steps in the classification of finite simple groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bombieri, E.|title=Thompson's problem σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=3.

Bombieri is also known for his [[pro bono]] service on behalf of the [[mathematics]] [[profession]], e.g. for serving on external review boards and for [[peer review|peer-reviewing]] extraordinarily complicated manuscripts (like the paper of [[Per Enflo]] on the [[invariant subspace problem]]).

Bombieri, accomplished also in the arts, explored for wild orchids and other plants as a hobby in the Alps when a young man.

Married with a grown daughter, he is a gourmet cook and a serious painter: He carries his paints and brushes with him whenever he travels. Still, mathematics never seems far from his mind.

The '''strict epigraph''' is the epigraph with the graph itself removed:

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{epi}_S f = \{ (x, \mu) \, : \, x \in \mathbb{R}^n,\, \mu \in \mathbb{R},\, \mu &gt; f(x) \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The same definitions are valid for a function that takes values in {{math|ℝ ∪ {∞}|}}. In this case, the epigraph is empty if and only if ''f'' is identically equal to infinity.

The domain (rather than the co-domain) of the function is not particularly important for this definition; it can be any [[linear space]]&lt;ref name="NeittaanmäkiRepin2004"/&gt; or even an arbitrary set&lt;ref name="AliprantisBorder2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charalambos D.

Similarly, the set of points on or below the function is its [[Hypograph (mathematics)|hypograph]].

The epigraph can often be used to give geometrical interpretations of the properties of convex functions or to prove these properties.

==Properties==
A [[convex function|function is convex]] if and only if its epigraph is a [[convex set]]. The epigraph of a real [[affine function]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;→'''R''' is a [[Half-space (geometry)|halfspace]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A function is [[Semi-continuity|lower semicontinuous]] if and only if its epigraph is [[Closed set|closed]].

'''Fast Fourier Transform Telescope''' is [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga|Zaldarriaga]]'s name for a design for an all-[[Digital data|digital]] [[aperture synthesis|synthetic-aperture]] [[telescope]]. It is a type of [[interferometer]] designed to be cheaper than standard telescope interferometers currently in use.

In 1868, [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] realized that the lenses and mirrors in a [[telescope]] perform a physical approximation of a [[Fourier transform]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} He noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array — a technique which later became known as [[astronomical interferometry]].  See [[History of astronomical interferometry]].

In a 2008 paper, Tegmark and Zaldarriaga proposed a telescope design&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4414 The Fast Fourier Transform Telescope]&lt;/ref&gt; that dispenses altogether with the lenses and mirrors, relying instead on computers fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms. The concept is an all-digital telescope with an antenna consisting of a rectangular grid. Building [[radio telescope]]s this way should become feasible within a few years if [[Moore's law]] continues to hold. Eventually [[optical telescope]]s could also be built this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926752.100-ultimate-telescope-could-take-astronomers-back-in-time.html New Scientist article, issue 2675, 24 September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is already being used in [[radar]] applications.

This paper refers to an earlier telescope design from 1993 which took direct images of the [[Crab nebula]] at radio wavelengths using an eight-by-eight-[[pixel]] two-dimensional spatial FFT processor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PASJ...46..503O Two-dimensional direct images with a spatial FFT interferometer]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7372">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[integral geometry]], the '''Funk transform''' (also known as '''Minkowski–Funk transform''', '''Funk–Radon transform''' or '''spherical Radon transform''') is an [[integral transform]] defined by integrating a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on [[great circle]]s of the [[sphere]].  It was introduced by [[Paul Funk]] in 1911, based on the work of {{harvtxt|Minkowski|1904}}.  It is closely related to the [[Radon transform]].  The original motivation for studying the Funk transform was to describe [[Zoll surface|Zoll metrics]] on the sphere.

== Definition ==
The Funk transform is defined as follows.  Let ''&amp;fnof;'' be a [[continuous function]] on the [[sphere|2-sphere]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then, for a [[unit vector]] '''x''', let

:&lt;math&gt;Ff(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\mathbf{u}\in C(\mathbf{x})} f(\mathbf{u})\,ds(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is carried out with respect to the arclength ''ds'' of the great circle ''C''('''x''') consisting of all unit vectors perpendicular to '''x''':

:&lt;math&gt;C(\mathbf{x}) = \{\mathbf{u}\in S^2\mid \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{x}=0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Inversion ==
The Funk transform annihilates all [[odd function]]s, and so it is natural to confine attention to the case when ''&amp;fnof;'' is even.  In that case, the Funk transform takes even (continuous) functions to even continuous functions, and is furthermore invertible.  

=== Spherical harmonics ===
Every square-integrable function &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2 (S^2)&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere can be decomposed into [[spherical harmonics]] &lt;math&gt;Y_n^k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=-n}^n \hat f (n,k) Y_n^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Funk transform of ''f'' reads

:&lt;math&gt;F f = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=-n}^n P_n(0) \hat f (n,k) Y_n^k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{2n+1}(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; for odd values and 
:&lt;math&gt;P_{2n}(0) = (-1)^n\, \frac{1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdots 2n-1}{2\cdot 4\cdot 6 \cdots 2n}
= (-1)^n\, \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!}&lt;/math&gt; 
for even values. This result was shown by {{harvtxt|Funk|1913}}.

=== Helgason's inversion formula ===
Another inversion formula is due to {{harvtxt|Helgason|1999}}.
As with the Radon transform, the inversion formula relies on the dual transform ''F''* defined by

:&lt;math&gt;(F^*f)(p,\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2\pi\cos p}\int_{\|\mathbf{u}\|=1,\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{u}=\sin p} f(\mathbf{u})\,|d\mathbf{u}|.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the average value of the circle function ''&amp;fnof;'' over circles of arc distance ''p'' from the point '''x'''.  The inverse transform is given by

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left\{\frac{d}{du}\int_0^u F^*(Ff)(\cos^{-1}v,\mathbf{x})v(u^2-v^2)^{-1/2}\,dv\right\}_{u=1}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalization ==
The classical formulation is invariant under the [[rotation group SO(3)]].  It is also possible to formulate the Funk transform in a manner that makes it invariant under the [[special linear group]] SL(3,'''R'''), due to {{harv|Bailey|Eastwood|Gover|Mason|2003}}.  Suppose that ''&amp;fnof;'' is a [[homogeneous function]] of degree &amp;minus;2 on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then, for [[linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors '''x''' and '''y''', define a function φ by the [[line integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint f(u\mathbf{x} + v\mathbf{y})(u\,dv-v\,du)&lt;/math&gt;

taken over a simple closed curve encircling the origin once.  The [[differential form]]

:&lt;math&gt;f(u\mathbf{x} + v\mathbf{y})(u\,dv-v\,du)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[closed and exact differential forms|closed]], which follows by the homogeneity of ''&amp;fnof;''.  By a [[integration by substitution|change of variables]], φ satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(a\mathbf{x}+b\mathbf{y},c\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{|ad-bc|}\phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}),&lt;/math&gt;

and so gives a homogeneous function of degree &amp;minus;1 on the [[exterior algebra|exterior square]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;Ff(\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}) = \phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''F&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' agrees with the Funk transform when ''&amp;fnof;'' is the degree &amp;minus;2 homogeneous extension of a function on the sphere and the projective space associated to Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is identified with the space of all circles on the sphere.  Alternatively, Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be identified with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in an SL(3,'''R''')-invariant manner, and so the Funk transform ''F'' maps smooth even homogeneous functions of degree &amp;minus;2 on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\{0} to smooth even homogeneous functions of degree &amp;minus;1 on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\{0}.

== Applications ==
The Funk-Radon transform is used in the Q-Ball method for [[Diffusion MRI]] introduced in {{harv|Tuch|2004}}.
It is also related to [[intersection body|intersection bodies]] in convex geometry. 
Let &lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; be a [[star body]] with radial function &lt;math&gt;\rho_K(\boldsymbol x)=\max\{t:t\boldsymbol x\in K\},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x\in S^{d-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the intersection body ''IK'' of ''K'' has the radial function &lt;math&gt;\rho_{IK}=F\rho_K&lt;/math&gt;, see {{harv|Gardner|2006|p=305}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12586">In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''gadget''' is a subset of a problem instance that simulates the behavior of one of the fundamental units of a different computational problem. Gadgets are typically used to construct [[Reduction (complexity)|reductions]] from one computational problem to another, as part of proofs of [[NP-complete]]ness or other types of computational hardness. The '''component design''' technique is a method for constructing reductions by using gadgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|Szabó|2009}} traces the use of gadgets to a 1954 paper in [[graph theory]] by [[W. T. Tutte]], in which Tutte provided gadgets for reducing the problem of finding a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] with given [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] constraints to a [[matching (graph theory)|perfect matching]] problem. However, the "gadget" terminology has a later origin, and does not appear in Tutte's paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Example==
[[File:3SAT-3COL reduction.svg|thumb|400px|NP-completeness reduction from [[3-satisfiability]] to [[Graph coloring|graph 3-coloring]]. The gadgets for variables and clauses are shown on the upper and lower left, respectively; on the right is an example of the entire reduction for the 3-CNF formula {{nowrap|(''x'' ∨ ''y'' ∨ ~''z'') ∧ (~''x'' ∨ ~''y'' ∨ ''z'')}} with three variables and two clauses.]]
Many NP-completeness proofs are based on [[many-one reduction]]s from [[3-satisfiability]], the problem of finding a satisfying assignment to a Boolean formula that is a conjunction (Boolean and) of clauses, each clause being the disjunction (Boolean or) of three terms, and each term being a Boolean variable or its negation. A reduction from this problem to a hard problem on [[undirected graph]]s, such as the [[Hamiltonian cycle]] problem or [[graph coloring]], would typically be based on gadgets in the form of subgraphs that simulate the behavior of the variables and clauses of a given 3-satisfiability instance. These gadgets would then be glued together to form a single graph, a hard instance for the graph problem in consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For instance, the problem of testing 3-colorability of graphs may be proven NP-complete by a reduction from 3-satisfiability of this type. The reduction uses two special graph vertices, labeled as "Ground" and "False", that are not part of any gadget. As shown in the figure, the gadget for a variable ''x'' consists of two vertices connected in a triangle with the ground vertex; one of the two vertices of the gadget is labeled with ''x'' and the other is labeled with the negation of ''x''. The gadget for a clause {{nowrap|(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} consists of six vertices, connected to each other, to the vertices representing the terms ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and to the ground and false vertices by the edges shown. Any [[3-CNF]] formula may be converted into a graph by constructing a separate gadget for each of its variables and clauses and connecting them as shown.&lt;ref&gt;This reduction is described in {{citation|first=Oded|last=Goldreich|authorlink=Oded Goldreich|title=Computational Complexity: A Conceptual Perspective|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|at=Proposition 2.27, p. 81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuguvA-w5OEC&amp;pg=PA81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any 3-coloring of the resulting graph, one may designate the three colors as being true, false, or ground, where false and ground are the colors given to the false and ground vertices (necessarily different, as these vertices are made adjacent by the construction) and true is the remaining color not used by either of these vertices. Within a variable gadget, only two colorings are possible: the vertex labeled with the variable must be colored either true or false, and the vertex labeled with the variable's negation must correspondingly be colored either false or true. In this way, valid assignments of colors to the variable gadgets correspond one-for-one with truth assignments to the variables: the behavior of the gadget with respect to coloring simulates the behavior of a variable with respect to truth assignment.
Each clause assignment has a valid 3-coloring if at least one of its adjacent term vertices is colored true, and cannot be 3-colored if all of its adjacent term vertices are colored false. In this way, the clause gadget can be colored if and only if the corresponding truth assignment satisfies the clause, so again the behavior of the gadget simulates the behavior of a clause.

==Restricted reductions==
{{harvtxt|Agrawal|Allender|Impagliazzo|Pitassi|1997}}  considered what they called "a radically simple form of gadget reduction", in which each bit describing part of a gadget may depend only on a bounded number of bits of the input, and used these reductions to prove an analogue of the [[Berman–Hartmanis conjecture]] stating that all NP-complete sets are polynomial-time isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The standard definition of NP-completeness involves [[polynomial time]] [[many-one reduction]]s: a problem in NP is by definition NP-complete if every other problem in NP has a reduction of this type to it, and the standard way of proving that a problem in NP is NP-complete is to find a polynomial time many-one reduction from a known NP-complete problem to it. But (in what Agrawal et al. called "a curious, often observed fact") all sets known to be NP-complete at that time could be proved complete using the stronger notion of [[AC0|AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] many-one reductions: that is, reductions that can be computed by circuits of polynomial size, constant depth, and unbounded fan-in. Agrawal et al. proved that every set that is NP-complete under AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; reductions is complete under an even more restricted type of reduction, [[NC (complexity)|NC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] many-one reductions, using circuits of polynomial size, constant depth, and bounded fan-in. In an NC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; reduction, each output bit of the reduction can depend only on a constant number of input bits,

The  Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is an unsolved problem in computational complexity theory stating that all NP-complete problem classes are polynomial-time isomorphic. That is, if ''A'' and ''B'' are two NP-complete problem classes, there is a polynomial-time one-to-one reduction from ''A'' to ''B'' whose inverse is also computable in polynomial time. Agrawal et al. used their equivalence between AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; reductions and NC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; reductions to show that all sets complete for NP under AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; reductions are AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-isomorphic.

==Optimization of gadgets==
One application of gadgets is in proving [[hardness of approximation]] results, by reducing a problem that is known to be hard to approximate to another problem whose hardness is to be proven. In this application, one typically has a family of instances of the first problem in which there is a gap in the objective function values, and in which it is hard to determine whether a given instance has an objective function that is on the low side or on the high side of the gap. The reductions used in these proofs, and the gadgets used in the reductions, must preserve the existence of this gap, and the strength of the inapproximability result derived from the reduction will depend on how well the gap is preserved.

{{harvtxt|Trevisan|Sorkin|Sudan|Williamson|2000}} formalize the problem of finding gap-preserving gadgets, for families of [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s in which the goal is to maximize the number of satisfied constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this gadget, and the fact that (unless [[P versus NP problem|P = NP]]) there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] for maximizing the number of 3-SAT clauses that a truth assignment satisfies, it can be shown that there is similarly no approximation scheme for MAX 2-SAT.

Trevisan et al. show that, in many cases of the constraint satisfaction problems they study, the gadgets leading to the strongest possible inapproximability results may be constructed automatically, as the solution to a [[linear programming]] problem. The same gadget-based reductions may also be used in the other direction, to transfer approximation algorithms from easier problems to harder problems. For instance, Trevisan et al. provide an optimal gadget for reducing 3-SAT to a weighted variant of 2-SAT (consisting of seven weighted 2-SAT clauses) that is stronger than the one by {{harvtxt|Garey|Johnson|Stockmeyer|1976}}; using it, together with known [[semidefinite programming]] approximation algorithms for MAX 2-SAT, they provide an approximation algorithm for MAX 3-SAT with approximation ratio 0.801, better than previously known algorithms.

In [[mathematics]], an '''infinitesimal transformation''' is a [[limit (mathematics)|limiting]] form of ''small'' [[transformation (geometry)|transformation]]. For example one may talk about an [[infinitesimal rotation]] of a [[rigid body]], in three-dimensional space. This is conventionally represented by a 3×3 [[skew-symmetric matrix]] ''A''. It is not the matrix of an actual [[rotation]] in space; but for small real values of a parameter ε the transformation

:&lt;math&gt;T=I+\varepsilon A&lt;/math&gt;

is a small rotation, up to quantities of order ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==History==
A comprehensive theory of infinitesimal transformations was first given by [[Sophus Lie]]. This was at the heart of his work, on what are now called [[Lie group]]s and their accompanying [[Lie algebra]]s; and the identification of their role in [[geometry]] and especially the theory of [[differential equation]]s. The properties of an abstract [[Lie algebra]] are exactly those definitive of infinitesimal transformations, just as the axioms of [[group theory]] embody [[symmetry]]. The term "Lie algebra" was introduced in 1934 by [[Hermann Weyl]], for what had until then been known as the ''algebra of infinitesimal transformations'' of a Lie group.
==Examples==
For example, in the case of infinitesimal rotations, the Lie algebra structure is that provided by the [[cross product]], once a skew-symmetric matrix has been identified with a 3-[[Vector (geometric)|vector]]. This amounts to choosing an axis vector for the rotations; the defining [[Jacobi identity]] is a well-known property of cross products.

The earliest example of an infinitesimal transformation that may have been recognised as such was in [[Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions]]. Here it is stated that a function ''F'' of ''n'' variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that is homogeneous of degree ''r'', satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta F=rF \, &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta=\sum_i x_i{\partial\over\partial x_i},&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Theta operator]].  That is, from the property

:&lt;math&gt;F(\lambda x_1,\dots, \lambda x_n)=\lambda^r F(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

it is possible to differentiate with respect to λ and then set λ equal to 1. This then becomes a [[necessary condition]] on a [[smooth function]] ''F'' to have the homogeneity property; it is also sufficient (by using [[Schwartz distribution]]s one can reduce the [[mathematical analysis]] considerations here). This setting is typical, in that there is a [[one-parameter group]] of [[scaling (mathematics)|scalings]] operating; and the information is coded in an infinitesimal transformation that is a [[first-order differential operator]].

==Operator version of Taylor's theorem==
The operator equation

:&lt;math&gt;e^{tD}f(x)=f(x+t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;D={d\over dx}&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] version of [[Taylor's theorem]] &amp;mdash; and is therefore only valid under ''caveats'' about ''f'' being an [[analytic function]]. Concentrating on the operator part, it shows that ''D'' is an infinitesimal transformation, generating translations of the real line via the [[exponential function|exponential]]. In Lie's theory, this is generalised a long way. Any [[connected space|connected]] Lie group can be built up by means of its [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|infinitesimal generator]]s (a basis for the Lie algebra of the group); with explicit if not always useful information given in the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]].

In the context of [[differential equations]] to ''integrate'' an equation means to solve it from [[initial condition]]s.  Accordingly, an '''integrable system''' is a system of [[differential equation]]s whose behavior is determined by initial conditions and which can be ''integrated'' from those initial conditions.  

Many systems of differential equations arising in physics are integrable.  A standard example is the motion of a rigid body about its center of mass.  This system gives rise to a number of [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]]: the [[angular momenta]].  Conserved quantities such as these are also known as the [[first integral]]s of the system.  Roughly speaking, if there are enough first integrals to give a coordinate system on the set of solutions, then it is possible to reduce the original system of differential equations to an equation that can be solved by computing an explicit [[integral]].  Other examples giving rise to integrable systems in physics are some models of shallow water waves ([[Korteweg–de Vries equation]]), the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]], and the [[Toda lattice]] in statistical mechanics.

While the presence of many conserved quantities is generally a fairly clear-cut criterion for integrability, there are other ways in which integrability can appear.  It is famously difficult to be precise about what the term means.  [[Nigel Hitchin]] {{harv|Hitchin|Segal|Ward|p=1}} draws a comparison to a quotation by jazz musician [[Louis Armstrong]], who when asked what jazz was, is rumored to have replied "If you gotta ask, you'll never know."  Hitchin identifies three generally recognizable features of integrable systems: 
* the existence of many conserved quantities
* the presence of [[algebraic geometry]]
* the ability to give explicit solutions

==Frobenius integrability (overdetermined differential systems)==
A differential system is said to be ''completely integrable'' in the [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] sense if the space on which it is defined has a [[foliation]] by maximal [[integral manifold]]s. The [[Frobenius theorem (differential topology)|Frobenius theorem]] states that a system is completely integrable if and only if it generates an ideal that is closed under [[exterior derivative|exterior differentiation]]. (See the article on [[integrability conditions for differential systems]] for a detailed discussion of foliations by maximal integral manifolds.)

==General dynamical systems==
In the context of differentiable [[dynamical systems]], the notion of '''integrability''' refers to the existence of  invariant, regular foliations;  i.e., ones whose leaves are [[embedded submanifold]]s of the smallest possible dimension that are invariant under the  [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]. There is thus a variable notion of the degree of integrability, depending on the dimension of the leaves of the invariant foliation.
This concept has a refinement in the case of [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian systems]], known as '''complete integrability in the sense of [[Liouville]]''' (see below), which is what is most frequently referred to in this context.

An extension of the notion of  integrability is also applicable to discrete systems such as lattices.
This definition can be adapted to describe  '''evolution equations''' that either are systems of
[[differential equations]] or [[finite difference| finite difference equations]].

The distinction between integrable and  nonintegrable dynamical systems thus has the qualitative
implication of '''regular motion''' vs. [[chaotic motion]] and hence is an intrinsic property, not just a matter of whether
a system can be explicitly integrated in exact form.

==Hamiltonian systems and Liouville integrability==
In the special setting of  [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian systems]], we have the notion of integrability in the [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] sense, see the [[Liouville-Arnold theorem]].
'''Liouville integrability''' means that there exists a regular foliation of the phase space by invariant manifolds such that the Hamiltonian vector fields
associated to the invariants of the foliation span the tangent distribution.  Another way to state this is that there exists
a '''maximal set''' of Poisson commuting invariants (i.e., functions on the phase space whose [[Poisson bracket]]s with the Hamiltonian of the system,
and with each other, vanish).

In finite dimensions, if the [[phase space]]   is  [[Symplectic geometry|symplectic]] (i.e., the center of the Poisson algebra consists only of constants), then it must have
even dimension &lt;math&gt;2n &lt;/math&gt;, and the maximal number of independent Poisson commuting invariants (including the Hamiltonian itself) is
&lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;. The leaves of the foliation are [[Isotropic quadratic form|totally isotropic]] with respect to the symplectic form and such a maximal isotropic foliation is
called '''[[Lagrangian submanifold|Lagrangian]]'''. All ''autonomous'' Hamiltonian systems (i.e. those for which the Hamiltonian and Poisson brackets are not explicitly time dependent)
have at least one invariant; namely, the '''Hamiltonian''' itself, whose value along the flow is the energy. If the energy level sets are compact, the
leaves of the Lagrangian foliation are tori, and the natural linear coordinates on these are called "angle" variables. The cycles of the canonical &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;-form
are called the '''action''' variables, and the resulting canonical coordinates are called '''[[action-angle variables]]''' (see below).

There is also a distinction between '''complete integrability''', in the [[Liouville]] sense,  and '''partial integrability''', as well as
a notion of  '''[[Superintegrable Hamiltonian system|superintegrability]]''' and '''maximal superintegrability'''.  Essentially, these distinctions correspond to the dimensions of the leaves of the foliation.
When the number of independent Poisson commuting invariants is less than maximal (but, in the case of
autonomous systems, more than one), we say the system is '''partially integrable'''.
When there exist further functionally independent invariants, beyond the maximal number that
can be Poisson commuting, and hence the dimension of the leaves of the invariant foliation is
less than n, we say the system is [[Superintegrable Hamiltonian system|'''superintegrable''']]. If there is a regular foliation with one-dimensional
leaves (curves), this is called '''maximally superintegrable'''.

==Action-angle variables==
When a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system is completely integrable in the Liouville sense,
and the energy level sets are compact, the flows are complete, and the leaves of the invariant foliation are [[torus|tori]].
There then exist, as mentioned above, special sets of [[canonical coordinates]] on the [[phase space]]  known as [[action-angle variables]],
such that the invariant tori are the joint level sets of the [[action (physics)|action]]  variables. These thus provide a complete set of invariants
of the Hamiltonian flow (constants of motion), and the angle variables are the natural periodic coordinates on the torus. The motion on the
invariant  tori, expressed in terms of these canonical coordinates, is linear in the angle variables.

== The Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi approach ==
In [[canonical transformation]] theory, there is the [[Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equations|Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi method]], in which solutions to Hamilton's equations are sought by first finding a '''complete solution''' of the associated [[Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equation]]. In classical terminology, this is described as determining a transformation to a canonical set of coordinates consisting of '''completely ignorable variables'''; i.e., those in which there is no dependence of the Hamiltonian on a complete set of canonical "position" coordinates, and hence the corresponding canonically conjugate momenta are all conserved quantities.  In the case of compact energy level sets, this is the first step towards determining the [[action-angle variables]]. In the general theory of partial differential equations of [[Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equations|Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi]] type, a '''complete solution''' (i.e. one that depends on ''n'' independent constants of integration, where ''n'' is the dimension of the configuration space), exists in very general cases, but only in the local sense. Therefore, the existence of a complete solution of the [[Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equation]] is by no means a characterization of complete integrability in the Liouville sense. Most cases that can be "explicitly integrated" involve a complete [[separation of variables]], in which the separation constants provide the complete set of integration constants that are required.  Only when these constants can be reinterpreted, within the full phase space setting, as the values of a complete set of Poisson commuting functions restricted to the leaves of a Lagrangian foliation, can the system be regarded as completely integrable in the Liouville sense.

==Solitons and inverse spectral methods==
A resurgence of interest in classical  integrable systems came with the discovery, in the late 1960s, that [[soliton]]s, which are strongly stable, localized solutions of partial differential equations  like the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] (which describes 1-dimensional non-dissipative fluid dynamics in shallow basins), could be understood by viewing these equations as infinite-dimensional integrable
Hamiltonian systems. Their study leads to a very fruitful approach for "integrating" such systems, the  [[inverse scattering transform]] and more general '''inverse spectral methods''' (often reducible to [[Riemann–Hilbert problem]]s),
which generalize local linear methods like Fourier analysis to nonlocal linearization, through the solution of associated integral equations.

The basic idea of this method is to introduce a linear operator that is determined by the position in phase space and which evolves under the dynamics of the system in question in such a way that its "spectrum" (in a suitably generalized sense) is invariant under the evolution, cf. [[Lax pair]].  This provides, in certain cases, enough invariants, or "integrals of motion" to make the system completely integrable.  In the case of systems having an infinite number of degrees of freedom, such as the KdV equation, this is not sufficient to make precise the property of '''Liouville integrability'''. However, for suitably defined boundary conditions, the spectral transform can, in fact, be interpreted as a transformation to '''completely ignorable coordinates''', in which the conserved quantities form half of a doubly infinite set of canonical coordinates, and the flow linearizes in these. In some cases, this may even be seen as a transformation to action-angle variables, although typically only a finite number of the "position" variables are actually angle coordinates, and the rest are noncompact.

==Quantum integrable systems==
There is also a notion of '''quantum integrable systems'''.

In the quantum setting, functions on phase space must be replaced by [[self-adjoint operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]], and the notion
of '''Poisson commuting functions''' replaced by '''commuting operators'''.

To explain quantum integrability, it is helpful to consider the free particle setting.  Here all dynamics are one-body reducible.  A quantum
system is said to be integrable if the dynamics are two-body reducible.  The [[Yang-Baxter equation]] is a consequence of this reducibility and leads to trace identities which provide an infinite set of conserved quantities.  All of these ideas are incorporated into the [[quantum inverse scattering method]] where the algebraic [[Bethe Ansatz]] can be used to obtain explicit solutions. Examples of quantum integrable models are the [[Lieb-Liniger Model]], the [[Hubbard model]] and several variations on the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Vladimir Korepin|V.E. Korepin]], N. M. Bogoliubov, A. G. Izergin  | title=Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and Correlation Functions| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 1997 | isbn=978-0-521-58646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other types of quantum integrability are known in explicitly time-dependent quantum problems, such as the driven Tavis-Cummings model &lt;ref name='sinitsyn-16pra1'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.93.063859|title=Solvable multistate model of Landau-Zener transitions in cavity QED|author1=N. A. Sinitsyn |author2=F. Li |journal=[[Phys. Rev. A]]|volume=93|issue=6|year=2016|pages= 063859|bibcode=2016PhRvA..93f3859S|arxiv=1602.03136}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Exactly solvable models==
In physics, completely integrable systems, especially in the infinite-dimensional setting, are often referred to as  '''exactly solvable models'''.  This obscures the distinction between integrability in the Hamiltonian sense, and the more general dynamical systems sense.

There are also '''exactly solvable models''' in statistical mechanics, which are more closely related to quantum integrable systems than classical ones. Two closely related methods: the [[Bethe ansatz]] approach, in its modern sense, based on the '''[[Yang–Baxter equation]]s''' and the '''[[quantum inverse scattering method]]''' provide quantum analogs of the '''inverse spectral methods'''. These are equally important in the study of solvable models in statistical mechanics.

An imprecise notion of "exact solvability" as meaning: "The solutions can be expressed explicitly in terms of some previously known functions" is also sometimes used, as though this were an intrinsic property of the system itself, rather than the purely calculational feature that we happen to have some "known" functions available, in terms of which the solutions may be expressed.  This notion has no intrinsic meaning, since what is meant by "known" functions very often  is defined precisely by the fact that they satisfy certain given equations, and the list of such "known functions" is constantly growing. Although such a characterization of "integrability" has no intrinsic validity, it often implies the sort of regularity that is to be expected in integrable systems. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''John Vincent Pardon''' (born June 1989) is an American [[Mathematics|mathematician]] who works on [[geometry]] and [[topology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/people/john-pardon Clay Mathematics Institute &gt; People]&lt;/ref&gt; He is primarily known for having solved [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Gromov]]'s problem on [[stretch factor|distortion]] of knots, for which he was awarded the 2012 [[Morgan Prize]]. He is currently a full professor of mathematics at [[Princeton University]].

==Education and accomplishments==
Pardon's father, William Pardon, is a mathematics professor at [[Duke University]], and when Pardon was a high school student at the [[Durham Academy]] he also took classes at Duke.&lt;ref name="eq"/&gt; He was a three-time gold medalist at the [[International Olympiad in Informatics]], in 2005, 2006, and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://stats.ioinformatics.org/halloffame/|title=Hall of Fame|work=International Olympiad in Informatics|accessdate=2015-11-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Pardon placed second in the [[Intel Science Talent Search]] competition, with a generalization to [[rectifiable curve]]s of the [[carpenter's rule problem]] for polygons. In this project, he showed that every rectifiable [[Jordan curve]] in the plane can be continuously deformed into a [[convex curve]] without changing its length and without ever allowing any two points of the curve to get closer to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Aimee Cunningham, "The Next Generation", ''[[Science News]]'', 17 March 2007, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; He published this research in the ''[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]]'' in 2009.

Pardon then went to [[Princeton University]], where after his sophomore year he primarily took graduate-level mathematics classes.&lt;ref name="eq"/&gt;
At Princeton, Pardon solved a problem in [[knot theory]] posed by [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]] in 1983 about whether every [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] can be [[Embedding|embedded]] into three-dimensional space with bounded [[stretch factor]]. Pardon showed that, on the contrary, the stretch factor of certain [[torus knot]]s could be arbitrarily large.
His proof was published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' in 2011, and earned him the [[Morgan Prize]] of 2012.&lt;ref name="eq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clay Mathematics Institute]], "[http://www.claymath.org/events/news/research-fellow-john-pardon Research Fellow: John Pardon]" (28 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201204/rtx120400569p.pdf|title=2012 Morgan Prize|date=April 2012|pages=569–571|volume=59|issue=4|first=Elaine|last=Kehoe}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pardon also took part in a Chinese-language immersion program at Princeton, and was part of Princeton's team at an international debate competition in Singapore, broadcast on Chinese television. As a [[cello]] player he was a two-time winner of the Princeton Sinfonia concerto competition.  He graduated in 2011, as Princeton's [[valedictorian]].&lt;ref name="eq"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S30/58/27Q66/index.xml|title=Pardon breaks new ground on path to becoming valedictorian|date=May 23, 2011|first=Eric|last=Quiñones|work=News at Princeton|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=2015-11-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[Stanford University]] for his graduate studies, where his accomplishments included solving the three-dimensional case of the [[Hilbert–Smith conjecture]]. He completed his Ph.D. in 2015, under the supervision of [[Yakov Eliashberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=196713}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and continued at Stanford as an assistant professor. In 2015, he was also appointed to a five-year term as a [[Clay Mathematics Institute|Clay Research Fellow]].&lt;ref name="clay"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.claymath.org/events/news/research-fellow-john-pardon|title=Research Fellow: John Pardon|date=January 28, 2015|publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]]|accessdate=2015-11-27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since fall 2016, he has been a full professor of mathematics at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S46/12/66C86/index.xml?section=topstories&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 2017, Pardon received [[National Science Foundation]] [[Alan T. Waterman Award]] for his contributions to geometry and topology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.princeton.edu/news/home-page/professor-john-pardon-11-receives-nsf-waterman-award&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the 2018 class of [[fellow]]s of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ams.org/profession/ams-fellows/new-fellows|title=2018 Class of the Fellows of the AMS|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2018 he was an [[List of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers#2018, Rio de Janeiro|invited speaker]] at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

'''Karl Walter Schröter''' (* 7 September 1905 in [[Biebrich (Wiesbaden)|Biebrich]] near [[Wiesbaden]], † 22 August 1977 in [[Berlin]]) was a German [[mathematician]] and [[logician]].&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt; Later on, after the war, he made important contributions concerning [[Logical consequence#Semantic consequence|semantic consequences]] ({{lang-de|semantische Folgerungsrelationen}}) and [[provability logic]] ({{lang-de|syntaktische Ableitbarkeitsrelationen}}).&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt; He worked as a mathematical theoretician and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] for the civilian [[Pers Z S]], the cipher bureau of the Foreign Office ({{lang-de|Auswärtiges Amt}}), from Spring 1941 to the end of [[World War II]].

==Personal life==
From 1928 to 1936, Schröter studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]] at the Universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Due to family reasons he had to interrupt his studies several times. He then worked in the [[mathematical logic]] group at the [[University of Münster]] lead by [[Heinrich Scholz]]. From April 1, 1939, he was a [[research assistant]] at the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Münster]]. On 20 December 1941, he took his examination for promotion of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr. phil]] under the logician Heinrich Scholz studying mathematics, logic, and [[calculus]] with a thesis titled ''Ein allgemeiner Kalkülbegriff'' ({{lang-en|A General Concept of Calculus}}). On April 1, 1941, he took a leave of absence to join [[Pers Z S]], the Foreign Office civilian cipher bureau, working as a mathematician. However, even during this time he continued to work on problems of basic mathematical research.&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt;

On 19 March 1943 he presented the application to the Faculty of Philosophy and Natural Sciences, with the publication ''Axiomatisierung der Fregeschen Aussagenkalküle'' ({{lang-en| [[Axiom]]atisation of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] [[Propositional Calculus]]}}), to be admitted to his Habilitation. On the basis of the positive opinions of [[Heinrich Scholz]] and [[Adolf Kratzer]], the degree of Doctor ''rerum naturalium habilitatus'' was awarded to him by certificate of May 22, 1943. On June 9, 1943, the report on the completed Habilitation was given to the Reich Minister. On July 1, 2 and 3, 1943, he held a public trial lecture on the topic ''Der Nutzen der mathematischen Logik für die Mathematik'' ({{lang-en|The Benefits of Mathematical Logic for Mathematics}}) as a prerequisite for a civil service position as a lecturer. On August 18, 1943, he was appointed lecturer with the authorisation to teach "Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research", all the while still being employed in Berlin as a "scientific assistant worker" at Pers Z S.&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt;

Karl Schröter remained at the University of Münster from 31 December 1943 until his contract was up on 31 April 1945, when he was taken prisoner by the [[Counterintelligence Corps]] (CIC). From early May to the September 30, 1945, he appeared before a joint Anglo-American Commission, first in [[London]], then in [[Marburg]], concerning his work at Pers Z S during the war. After completion, he was dismissed in Marburg after the CIC had determined his political attitude. In the winter semester of 1945/46 he was affiliated as a lecturer in Münster.&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt;

From May 1946 until his appointment to Berlin, Schröter was working at Münster as a substitute for the Review Committee of the [[Denazification]] Main Committee at the Westfälische Landesuniversität. In 1948, Karl Schröter was appointed Professor Extraordinarius for mathematical logic at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University in Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt;

In 1967, he became director of the Institute for pure mathematics of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Elstrodt-201x-GMU-295-296"/&gt;

He was elected corresponding member in 1962 and two years later ordinary member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin.

In 1955, Schröter together with [[Günter Asser]] founded the ''Zeitschrift für Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik'' ({{lang-en|Journal of mathematical logic and foundations of mathematics}}) which since 1991 is known as ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date= 1978 | title= Karl Schröter 7. 9. 1905 – 22. 8. 1977 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/malq.19780240102| journal= Mathematical Logic Quarterly| volume = 24| issue= 1-6 | pages= 1–4| issn= 1521-3870| doi= 10.1002/malq.19780240102 | archive-date= 1978| archive-url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3870| publisher= WILEY-VCH Verlag Berlin GmbH| access-date = 7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathrin Bringmann''' (born 8 May 1977) is a German [[number theorist]] in the [[University of Cologne]], [[Germany]], who has made fundamental contributions to the theory of [[mock theta function]]s.

==Education and career==
Kathrin Bringmann was born on 8 May 1977, in [[Münster|Muenster]], [[Germany]]. She passed the State Examinations in Mathematics and Theology at the [[University of Würzburg]], Germany, in 2002, and obtained a Diploma in Mathematics at [[Würzburg]] in 2003.  She received PhD in 2004 from [[University of Heidelberg]] under the supervision of {{Interlanguage link multi|Winfried Kohnen|de}}.

During 2004–07, she was [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]] Assistant Professor with the [[University of Wisconsin]] where she began her collaboration with [[Ken Ono]]. After briefly serving as an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], she joined the [[University of Cologne]], Germany, as Professor.

==Recognition==
Bringmann has been awarded the Alfried Krupp-Förderpreis for Young Professors, a one-million-Euro prize instituted by the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation]]. She is the third mathematician to win this prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/news/home-news.html#bringmann-krupp Bringmann Receives One Million Euro Krupp Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been awarded the [[SASTRA Ramanujan Prize]] in 2009 for her contributions to "areas of mathematics influenced by the genius [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sastra.edu/mnews/2009/sep/Ramanujan_Award.htm German Professor bags SASTRA Ramanujan Award for 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004105145/http://www.sastra.edu/mnews/2009/sep/Ramanujan_Award.htm |date=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/news/home-news.html#sastra-09 Bringmann to Receive 2009 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="571">In [[mathematics]], a '''Lagrangian foliation''' or '''polarization''' is a [[foliation]] of a [[symplectic manifold]], whose leaves are [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s. It is one of the steps involved in the [[geometric quantization]] of a square-integrable functions on a symplectic manifold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">In [[mathematics]], '''L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cohomology''' is a [[cohomology theory]] for [[smooth manifold|smooth]] non-compact [[manifold]]s ''M'' with [[Riemannian metric]]. It is defined in the same way as [[de Rham cohomology]] except that one uses [[square-integrable]] [[differential form]]s. The notion of square-integrability makes sense because the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on ''M'' gives rise to a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on differential forms and a [[volume form]].

L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cohomology, which grew in part out of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; d-bar estimates from the 1960s, was studied cohomologically, independently by [[Steven Zucker]] (1978) and [[Jeff Cheeger]] (1979). It is closely related to [[intersection cohomology]]; indeed, the results in the preceding cited works can be expressed in terms of intersection cohomology.

Another such result is the '''Zucker conjecture''', which states that for a [[Hermitian variety|Hermitian]] [[locally symmetric variety]] the L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cohomology is [[isomorphic]] to the [[intersection cohomology]] (with the [[middle perversity]]) of its [[Baily–Borel compactification]] (Zucker 1982). This was proved in different ways by [[Eduard Looijenga]] (1988) and by Leslie Saper and [[Mark Stern]] (1990).

'''MASH-1''' ('''Modular Arithmetic Secure Hash''') is a [[hash function]] based on [[modular arithmetic]].

== History ==
Despite many proposals, few hash functions based on modular arithmetic have withstood attack, and most that have tend to be relatively inefficient.  MASH-1 evolved from a long line of related proposals successively broken and repaired.

== Standard ==
Committee Draft ISO/IEC 10118-4 (Nov 95)

== Description ==
MASH-1 involves use of an [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-like modulus M, whose bitlength affects the security.  M should be difficult to [[factorization|factor]], and for M of unknown factorization, the security is based in part on the difficulty of extracting modular roots.  M also determines the block size for processing messages.

== MASH-2 ==
There is a new version of the algorithm called MASH-2 with a different exponent. The original &lt;math&gt;e=2&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;e=2^8+1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5613">In mathematics, the '''Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem''' states that every non-zero linear [[differential operator]] with [[constant coefficients]] has a [[Green's function]]. It was first proved independently by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Leon |last=Ehrenpreis|authorlink=Leon Ehrenpreis|year1=1954|year2=1955}} and
{{Harvs|txt=yes|first=Bernard|last=Malgrange|authorlink=Bernard Malgrange|year=1955–1956}}.

This means that the [[differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;P\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \cdots,  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\ell}}\right)u(\mathbf{x})=\delta(\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is a polynomial in several variables and δ is the [[Dirac delta function]], has a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributional]] solution ''u''. It can be used to show that

:&lt;math&gt;P\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \cdots,  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\ell}}\right)u(\mathbf{x})=f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

has a solution for any compactly supported distribution ''f''. The solution is not unique in general.

The analogue for differential operators whose coefficients are polynomials (rather than constants) is false: see [[Lewy's example]].

==Proofs==
The original proofs of Malgrange and Ehrenpreis were non-constructive as they used the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]]. Since then several constructive proofs have been found.

There is a very short proof using the Fourier transform and the [[Bernstein–Sato polynomial]], as follows.  By taking [[Fourier transform]]s the Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem is equivalent to the fact that every non-zero polynomial ''P'' has a distributional inverse. By replacing ''P'' by the product with its complex conjugate, one can also assume that ''P'' is non-negative. For non-negative polynomials ''P'' the existence of a distributional inverse follows from the existence of the Bernstein–Sato polynomial, which implies that ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; can be analytically continued as a meromorphic distribution-valued function of the complex variable ''s''; the constant term of the Laurent expansion of ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; at ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 is then a distributional inverse of ''P''.

Other proofs, often giving better bounds on the growth of a solution, are given in {{harv|Hörmander|1983a|loc=Theorem 7.3.10}}, {{harv|Reed|Simon|1975|loc=Theorem IX.23, p. 48}} and {{harv|Rosay|1991}}.
{{harv|Hörmander|1983b|loc=chapter 10}} gives a detailed discussion of the regularity properties of the fundamental solutions.

A short constructive proof was presented in {{harv|Wagner|2009|loc=Proposition 1, p. 458}}:

:&lt;math&gt; E=\frac{1}{\overline{P_m(2\eta)}} \sum_{j=0}^m a_j e^{\lambda_j\eta x} \mathcal{F}^{-1}_{\xi}\left(\frac{\overline{P(i\xi+\lambda_j\eta)}}{P(i \xi + \lambda_j \eta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a fundamental solution of ''P''(∂), i.e., ''P''(∂)''E'' = δ, if ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the principal part of ''P'', η ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''(η) ≠ 0, the real numbers λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are pairwise different, and

:&lt;math&gt;a_j=\prod_{k=0,k\neq j}^m(\lambda_j-\lambda_k)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences''''' is a 1966 textbook by [[mathematician]] [[Mary L. Boas]] intended to develop skills in mathematical problem solving needed for junior to senior-graduate courses in [[engineering]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]]. The book provides a comprehensive survey of [[mathematical physics|analytic techniques]] and provides careful statements of important theorems while omitting most detailed proofs. Each section contains a large number of problems, with selected answers. [[Computational physics|Numerical computational approaches]] using computers are outside the scope of the book.

The book, now in its third edition, was still widely used in university classrooms as of 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spector|first=Donald|title=Book Reviews|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|year=1999|volume=67|issue=2|pages=165–169|doi=10.1119/1.19216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">In [[classical mechanics]], '''Maupertuis's principle''' (named after [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]), states that the path followed by a physical system is the one of least length (with a suitable interpretation of ''path'' and ''length'').  It is a special case of the more generally stated [[principle of least action]].  Using the [[calculus of variations]], it results in an [[integral equation]] formulation of the [[equations of motion]] for the system.

==Mathematical formulation==

Maupertuis's principle states that the true path of a system described by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; [[generalized coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \left( q_{1}, q_{2}, \ldots, q_{N} \right)&lt;/math&gt; between two specified states &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is an extremum (i.e., a [[stationary point]], a minimum, maximum or saddle point) of the  [[Action (physics)#Abbreviated action (functional)|abbreviated action functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_{0}[\mathbf{q}(t)] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \left( p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{N} \right)&lt;/math&gt; are the conjugate momenta of the generalized coordinates, defined by the equation 

:&lt;math&gt;
p_{k} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_{k}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] for the system.  In other words, any ''first-order'' perturbation of the path results in (at most) ''second-order'' changes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the abbreviated action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] (i.e. a function from a vector space into its underlying scalar field), which in this case takes as its input a function (i.e. the pathes between the two specified states).

==Jacobi's formulation==

For many systems, the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic in the generalized velocities &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{M} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

although the '''mass tensor''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; may be a complicated function of the generalized coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;.  For such systems, a simple relation relates the kinetic energy, the generalized momenta and the generalized velocities

:&lt;math&gt;
2 T = \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}
&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; does not involve the generalized velocities.  By defining a normalized distance or [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; in the space of generalized coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^{2} = d\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{M} \cdot d\mathbf{q}
&lt;/math&gt;

one may immediately recognize the mass tensor as a [[metric tensor]]. The kinetic energy may be written in a massless form

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;
2 T dt = \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q} = \sqrt{2 T} \ ds.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the abbreviated action can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_0 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q} = 
 \int ds \, \sqrt{2}\sqrt{E_\text{tot} - V(\mathbf{q})}
&lt;/math&gt;

since the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;T = E_\text{tot} - V(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; equals the (constant) total energy &lt;math&gt;E_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; minus the potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt;.   In particular, if the potential energy is a constant, then Jacobi's principle reduces to minimizing the path length &lt;math&gt;s = \int ds&lt;/math&gt; in the space of the generalized coordinates, which is equivalent to [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Comparison with Hamilton's principle==

[[Hamilton's principle]] and Maupertuis's principle are occasionally confused and both have been called the [[principle of least action]].  They differ from each other in three important ways: 
* ''their definition of the [[action (physics)|action]]...'' 
:::Hamilton's principle uses &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int L \, dt&lt;/math&gt;, the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] over [[time]], varied between two fixed end times &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and endpoints &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.  By contrast, Maupertuis's principle uses the abbreviated action integral over the [[generalized coordinates]], varied along all constant energy paths ending at &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

*''the solution that they determine...''
:::Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}(t)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis's principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates.  For example, Maupertuis's principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as [[gravitation|gravity]], but does not describe ''per se'' how the particle moves along that trajectory.  (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the conservation of energy.)  By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time.

*''...and the constraints on the variation.''
:::Maupertuis's principle requires that the two endpoint states &lt;math&gt;q_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_{2}&lt;/math&gt; be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory.  By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{2}&lt;/math&gt; be  specified as well as the endpoint states &lt;math&gt;q_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==

Maupertuis was the first to publish a ''principle of least action'', where he defined ''action'' as &lt;math&gt;\int v \, ds&lt;/math&gt;, which was to be minimized over all paths connecting two specified points.  However, Maupertuis applied the principle only to light, not matter (see [[s:Accord between different laws of Nature that seemed incompatible|the 1744 Maupertuis reference below]]).  He arrived at the principle by considering [[Snell's law]] for the [[refraction]] of [[light]], which [[Fermat]] had explained by [[Fermat's principle]], that light follows the path of shortest ''time'', not distance.  This troubled Maupertuis, since he felt that time and distance should be on an equal footing: "why should light prefer the path of shortest time over that of distance?"  Accordingly, Maupertuis asserts with no further justification the principle of least action as equivalent but more fundamental than [[Fermat's principle]], and uses it to derive [[Snell's law]].  Maupertuis specifically states that light does not follow the same laws as material objects.

A few months later, well before Maupertuis's work appeared in print, [[Leonhard Euler]] independently defined action in its modern abbreviated form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int m v \, ds \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int p \, dq&lt;/math&gt; and applied it to the motion of a particle, but not to light (see [[s:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|the 1744 Euler reference below]]).  Euler also recognized that the principle only held when the speed was a function only of position, i.e., when the total energy was conserved.  (The mass factor in the action and the requirement for energy conservation were not relevant to Maupertuis, who was concerned only with light.)  Euler used this principle to derive the equations of motion of a particle in uniform motion, in a uniform and non-uniform force field, and in a central force field.  Euler's approach is entirely consistent with the modern understanding of Maupertuis's principle described above, except that he insisted that the action should always be a minimum, rather than a stationary point.

Two years later, Maupertuis cites Euler's 1744 work as a "beautiful application of my principle to the motion of the planets" and goes on to apply the principle of least action to the lever problem in mechanical equilibrium and to perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic collisions (see [[s:Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle|the 1746 publication below]]).  Thus, Maupertuis takes credit for conceiving the principle of least action as a ''general'' principle applicable to all physical systems (not merely to light), whereas the historical evidence suggests that Euler was the one to make this intuitive leap.   Notably, Maupertuis's definitions of the action and protocols for minimizing it in this paper are inconsistent with the modern approach described above.  Thus, Maupertuis's published work does not contain a single example in which he used Maupertuis's principle (as presently understood).

In 1751, Maupertuis's priority for the principle of least action was challenged in print (''Nova Acta Eruditorum'' of Leipzig) by an old acquaintance, Johann Samuel Koenig, who quoted a 1707 letter purportedly from [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] that described results similar to those derived by Euler in 1744.  However, Maupertuis and others demanded that Koenig produce the original of the letter to authenticate its having been written by Leibniz.  Koenig only had a copy and no clue as to the whereabouts of the original.  Consequently, [[s:Translation:Investigation of the letter of Leibniz|the Berlin Academy under Euler's direction declared the letter to be a forgery]] and that its President, Maupertuis, could continue to claim priority for having invented the principle.  Koenig continued to fight for Leibniz's priority and soon luminaries such as [[Voltaire]] and the King of Prussia, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] were engaged in the quarrel.  However, no progress was made until the turn of the twentieth century, when other independent copies of Leibniz's letter were discovered.

'''Michel Rolle''' (21 April 1652 – 8 November 1719) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]. He is best known for [[Rolle's theorem]] (1691). He is also the co-inventor in Europe of [[Gaussian elimination]] (1690).

==Life==
Rolle was born in [[Ambert]], [[Basse-Auvergne]]. Rolle, the son of a shopkeeper, received only an elementary education. He married early and as a young man struggled to support his family on the meager wages of a transcriber for notaries and attorney. In spite of his financial problems and minimal education, Rolle studied algebra and [[Diophantine analysis]] (a branch of number theory) on this own. He moved from Ambert to [[Paris]] in 1675.

Rolle’s fortune changed dramatically in 1682 when he published an elegant solution of a difficult, unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis. The public recognition of his achievement led to a patronage under minister Louvois, a job as an elementary mathematics teacher, and eventually to a short-termed administrative post in the Ministry of War. In 1685 he joined the Académie des Sciences in a very low-level position for which he received no regular salary until 1699. Rolle was promoted to a salaried position in the Academy, a ''pensionnaire géometre,''. This was a distinguished post because of the 70&amp;nbsp;members of the Academy, only 20 were paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barrow-Green|2009}}, p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt; He had then already been given a [[pension]] by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] after he solved one of [[Jacques Ozanam]]'s problems. He remained there until he died of apoplexy in 1719.

While Rolle’s forté was always Diophantine analysis, his most important work was a book on the algebra of equations, called ''Traité d'algèbre'', published in 1690. In that book Rolle firmly established the notation   for the ''n''th root of a polynomial, and proved a polynomial version of the theorem that today bears his name. ([[Rolle's theorem]] was named by [[Giusto Bellavitis]] in 1846.)

Rolle was one of the most vocal early antagonists of calculus &amp;ndash; ironically so, because Rolle's theorem is essential for basic proofs in calculus. He strove intently to demonstrate that it gave erroneous results and was based on unsound reasoning. He quarreled so vehemently on the subject that the Académie des Sciences was forced to intervene on several occasions.

Among his several achievements, Rolle helped advance the currently accepted size order for negative numbers. Descartes, for example, viewed  –2  as smaller than  –5. Rolle preceded most of his contemporaries by adopting the current convention in 1691.  

Rolle died in Paris. No contemporary portrait of him is known.

==Work==
Rolle was an early critic of [[infinitesimal calculus]], arguing that it was inaccurate, based upon unsound reasoning, and was a collection of ingenious fallacies,&lt;ref&gt;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Rolle.html&lt;/ref&gt; but later changed his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/biography/michel-rolle-wom/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michel Rolle - Traité d'algèbre.jpg|thumb|Michel Rolle, ''Traité d'algèbre'' (1690).]]
In 1690, Rolle published ''Traité d'Algebre.'' It contains the first ''published'' description in Europe of the [[Gaussian elimination]] algorithm, which Rolle called the method of substitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grcar|2011}}, §2.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of the method had previously appeared in algebra books, and Isaac Newton had previously described the method in his lecture notes, but Newton's lesson was not published until 1707. Rolle's statement of the method seems not to have been noticed in so far as the lesson for Gaussian elimination that was taught in 18 and 19th century algebra textbooks owes more to Newton than to Rolle.

Rolle is best known for [[Rolle's theorem]] in differential calculus. Rolle had used the result in 1690, and he proved it (by the standards of the time) in 1691. Given his animosity to infinitesimals it is fitting that the result was couched in terms of algebra rather than analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barrow-Green|2009}}, p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 18th century was the theorem interpreted as a fundamental result in differential calculus. Indeed, it is needed to prove both the [[mean value theorem]] and the existence of [[Taylor series]]. As the importance of the theorem grew, so did the interest in identifying the origin, and it was finally named ''Rolle's theorem'' in the 19th century. Barrow-Green remarks that the theorem might well have been named for someone else had not a few copies of Rolle's 1691 publication survived.

==Critique of infinitesimal calculus==
In a criticism of [[infinitesimal calculus]] that predated [[George Berkeley]]'s, Rolle presented a series of papers at the French academy, alleging that the use of the methods of infinitesimal calculus leads to errors. Specifically, he presented an explicit algebraic curve, and alleged that some of its local minima are missed when one applies the methods of infinitesimal calculus. [[Pierre Varignon]] responded by pointing out that Rolle had misrepresented the curve, and that the alleged local minima are in fact singular points with a vertical tangent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Blay|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">The [[formal fallacy]] of the '''modal fallacy''' is a special type of fallacy that occurs in [[modal logic]]. It is the fallacy of placing a proposition in the wrong modal scope,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/127/Modal_Scope_Fallacy|title=Modal (Scope) Fallacy|last=Bennett|first=Bo|date=|website=Logically Fallacious|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically inferring that because something ''is'' true, it is [[Necessarily true|''necessarily'' true]]. A statement is considered necessarily true if and only if it is impossible for the statement to be untrue and that there is no situation that would cause the statement to be false. Some philosophers further argue that a necessarily true statement must be true in all [[Possible world|possible worlds]].

In modal logic, a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be necessarily true or false (denoted &lt;math&gt;\Box P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box\lnot P&lt;/math&gt;, respectively), meaning that it is logically necessary that it is true or false; or it could be possibly true or false (denoted &lt;math&gt;\diamond P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\diamond\lnot P&lt;/math&gt;), meaning that it is true or false, but it is not logically necessary that it is so: its truth or falseness is ''[[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]]''. The modal fallacy occurs when there is a confusion of the distinction between the two.

==Description==
In modal logic, there is an important distinction between what is logically necessary to be true and what is true but not logically necessary to be so. One common form is replacing &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow \Box q&lt;/math&gt;. In the first statement, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is true given &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; but is not logically necessary to be so.

A common example in everyday life might be the following:
# [[Donald Trump]] is the President of the United States.
# The President is at least 35 years old.
# Thus, Donald Trump is necessarily 35 years or older.
The conclusion is false, since, even though Donald Trump is over 35 years old, there is no logical necessity for him to be. Even though it is certainly true in this world, a possible world can exist in which Donald Trump is not yet 35 years old. If instead of adding a stipulation of necessity, the argument just concluded that Donald Trump is 35 or older, it would be valid.

[[Norman Swartz]] gave the following example of how the modal fallacy can lead one to conclude that the future is already set, regardless of one's decisions; this is based on the "sea battle" example used by Aristotle to discuss the [[problem of future contingents]] in his ''[[On Interpretation]]:''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/modal_fallacy.htm|title=The Modal Fallacy|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Two admirals, A and B, are preparing their navies for a sea battle tomorrow. The battle will be fought until one side is victorious. But the 'laws' of the excluded middle (no third truth-value) and of non-contradiction (not both truth-values), mandate that one of the propositions, 'A wins' and 'B wins', is true (always has been and ever will be) and the other is false (always has been and ever will be). Suppose 'A wins' is today true. Then whatever A does (or fails to do) today will make no difference; similarly, whatever B does (or fails to do) today will make no difference: the outcome is already settled. Or again, suppose 'A wins' is today false. Then no matter what A does today (or fails to do), it will make no difference; similarly, no matter what B does (or fails to do), it will make no difference: the outcome is already settled. Thus, if propositions bear their truth-values timelessly (or unchangingly and eternally), then planning, or as Aristotle put it 'taking care', is illusory in its efficacy. The future will be what it will be, irrespective of our planning, intentions, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Suppose that the statement "A wins" is given by &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and "B wins" is given by &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. It is true here that only one of the statements "A wins" or "B wins" must be true. In other words, only one of &lt;math&gt;\diamond A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\diamond B&lt;/math&gt; is true. In logic syntax, this is equivalent to

&lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt; (either &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is true)

&lt;math&gt;\lnot\diamond (A \land B)&lt;/math&gt; (it is not possible that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are both true at the same time)

The fallacy here occurs because one assumes that &lt;math&gt;\diamond A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\diamond B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\Box A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box B&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, one believes that, since one of both events is logically necessarily true, no action by either can change the outcome.

Swartz also argued that the [[argument from free will]] suffers from the modal fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15996">'''Number sense in animals''' is the ability of creatures to represent and discriminate quantities of relative sizes by [[number sense]]. It has been observed in various species, from [[fish]] to [[primate]]s. Animals are believed to have an [[approximate number system]], the same system for number representation demonstrated by humans, which is more precise for smaller quantities and less so for larger values. An exact representation of numbers higher than 3 has not been attested in wild animals,&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|author2=Carey, Susan|author3=Hauser, Lilan B.|title=Spontaneous number representation in semi–free–ranging rhesus monkeys.|year=2000|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be demonstrated after a period of training in captive animals.

In order to distinguish number sense in animals from the symbolic and verbal number system in humans researchers use the term ''numerosity'',&lt;ref name="Dehaene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehaene|first=Stanislas|title=The Number Sense: How the mind creates Mathematics|year=2011|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''number'', to refer to the concept that supports approximate estimation but does not support an exact representation of number quality.

Number sense in animals includes the recognition and comparison of number quantities. Some numerical operations, such as addition, have been demonstrated in many species, including rats and great apes. Representing fractions and fraction addition has been observed in chimpanzees. A wide range of species with an approximate number system suggests an early evolutionary origin of this mechanism or multiple [[convergent evolution]] events.

==Early studies==

[[File:Osten und Hans.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm von Osten and Clever Hans]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, Wilhelm von Osten famously, but prematurely, claimed human-like counting abilities in animals on the example of his horse named Hans.  His claim is widely rejected today, as it is attributed to a methodological fallacy, which received the name [[Clever Hans]] phenomenon after this case. Von Osten claimed that his horse could perform arithmetic operations presented to the horse in writing or verbally, upon which the horse would knock on the ground with its hoof the number of times that corresponded to the answer. This apparent ability was demonstrated numerous times in the presence of the horse's owner and a wider audience, and was also observed when the owner was absent.  However, upon a rigorous investigation by [[Oskar Pfungst]] in the first decade of 20th century, Hans' ability was shown to be not arithmetic in nature, but to be the ability to interpret minimal unconscious changes in body language of people when the correct answer was approaching. Today, the arithmetic abilities of Clever Hans are commonly rejected and the case serves as a reminder to the scientific community about the necessity of rigorous control for experimenter expectation in experiments.&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt;

There were, however, other early and more reliable studies on number sense in animals. A prominent example is the work of [[Otto Koehler]], who conducted a number of studies on number sense in animals between 1920s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Rilling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rilling|first=Mark|title=Invisible counting animals: A history of contributions from comparative psychology, ethology, and learning theory.|year=1993|journal=The development of numerical competence: Animal and human models|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his studies&lt;ref name="Koehler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Otto |title="Zähl"-Versuche an einem Kolkraben und Vergleichsversuche an Menschen.|journal= Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|year=1943|pages=575–712|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1943.tb00665.x|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he showed that a raven named Jacob could reliably distinguish the number 5 across different tasks. This study was remarkable in that Koehler provided a systematic control condition in his experiment, which allowed him to test the number ability of the raven separately from the ability of the raven to encode other features, such as size and location of the objects. However, Koehler's work was largely overlooked in the English-speaking world, due to the limited availability of his publications, which were in German and partially published during World War II.

The experimental setup for the study of numerical cognition in animals was further enriched by the work of [[Francis Mechner|Francis]]&lt;ref name="Mechner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechner|first=Francis |title=Probability relations within response sequences under ratio reinforcement|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|year=1958|pages=109–121|doi= 10.1901/jeab.1958.1-109|volume=1|pmc=1403928}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Platt and Johnson.&lt;ref name="Platt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platt|first=John R|author2=Johnson, David M. |title=Localization of position within a homogeneous behavior chain: Effects of error contingencies.|journal=Learning and Motivation|year=1958|pages=386–414}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiments, the researchers deprived rats of food and then taught them to press a lever a specific number of times to obtain food. The rats learned to press the lever approximately the number of times specified by the researchers. Additionally, the researchers showed that rats' behavior was dependent on the number of required presses, and not for example on the time of pressing, as they varied the experiment to include faster and slower behavior on the rat's part by controlling how hungry the animal was.

== Methodology ==
Examining the representation of numerosity in animals is a challenging task, since it is not possible to use language as a medium. Because of this, carefully designed experimental setups are required to differentiate between numerical abilities and other phenomena, such as the Clever Hans phenomenon, memorization of the single objects or perception of object size and time.Also these abilities are seen only from the past few decades and not form the time of evolution.

One of the ways that numerical ability is thought to be demonstrated is the transfer of the concept of numerosity across modalities. This was for example the case in the experiment of Church and Meck,&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite book|last=Church|first=Russell M.|author2=Meck, Warren H.|chapter=The numerical attribute of stimuli.|year=1984|title= Animal Cognition|pages=445–464|isbn= 0898593344|editors=H.L. Roitblat, T.G. Bever, &amp; H.S. Terrace}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which rats learned to "add" the number of light flashes to the number of tones to find out the number of expected lever presses, showing a concept of numerosity independent of visual and auditory modalities.

Modern studies in number sense in animals try to control for other possible explanations of animal behavior by establishing control conditions in which the other explanations are tested. For example, when the number sense is investigated on the example of apple pieces, an alternative explanation is tested that assumes that the animal represents the volume of apple rather than a number of apple pieces. To test this alternative, an additional condition is introduced in which the volume of the apple varies and is occasionally smaller in the condition with a greater number of pieces. If the animal prefers a bigger number of pieces also in this condition, the alternative explanation is rejected, and the claim of numerical ability supported.&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt;

== Approximate number and parallel individuation systems ==
Numerosity is believed&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=D.|title=Two systems of non-symbolic numerical cognition|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to be represented by two separate systems in animals, similarly to humans. The first system is the [[approximate number system]], an imprecise system used for estimations of quantities. This system is distinguished by distance and magnitude effects, which means that a comparison between numbers is easier and more precise when the distance between them is smaller and when the values of the numbers are smaller.  The second system for representation of numerosity is the [[parallel individuation system]] which supports the exact representation of numbers from 1 to 4. In addition, humans can represent numbers through symbolic systems, such as language.

The distinction between the approximate number system and the parallel individuation system is, however, still disputed, and some experiments&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Simon|author2=Low, Jason|author3=Burns, K.|title=Adaptive numerical competency in a food-hoarding songbird.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2008|volume=275|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0702|pages=2373–2379|pmc=2603231}}&lt;/ref&gt; record behavior that can be fully explained with the approximate number system, without the need to assume another separate system for smaller numbers. For example, New Zealand robins repeatedly selected larger quantities of cached food with a precision that correlated with the total number of cache pieces. However, there was no significant discontinuity in their performance between small (1 to 4) and larger (above 4) sets, which would be predicted by the parallel individuation system. On the other hand, other experiments only report knowledge of numbers up to 4, supporting the existence of the parallel individuation system and not the approximate number system.&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt;

== Number sense by species ==

=== Fish ===
An approximate number system has been found in a number of fish species, such as [[guppy|guppies]], [[green swordtail]]s and [[mosquitofish]]. For example, preference for a bigger social group in mosquitofish was exploited to test the ability of the fish to discriminate numerosity.&lt;ref name= "agrillo2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|author2=Dadda, M|author3=Serena, G|author4=Bisazza, A|title=Do fish count?

Similarly, guppies discriminated between values up to 4, after which they only detected differences when the ratio between the two quantities was 1:2.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rats ===
Rats have demonstrated behavior consistent with an approximate number system&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt; in experiments where they had to learn to press a lever a specified number of times to obtain food. While they did learn to press the lever the amount specified by the researchers, between 4 and 16, their behavior was approximate, proportional to the number of lever presses expected from them. This means that for the target number of 4, the rats' responses varied from 3 to 7, and for the target number of 16 the responses varied from 12 to 24, showing a much greater interval.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; This is compatible with the approximate number system and magnitude and distance effects.

=== Birds ===
Birds were one of the first animal species tested on their number sense. A raven named Jacob was able to distinguish the number 5 across different tasks in the experiments by Otto Koehler.&lt;ref name="Koehler"/&gt; Later experiments supported the claim of existence of a number sense in birds, with [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], a grey parrot, able to label and comprehend labels for sets with up to six elements.&lt;ref name="Pepperberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pepperberg|first=Irene M. |author2=Gordon, Jesse D|title=Number comprehension by a grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), including a zero-like concept.|journal= Journal of Comparative Psychology|year=2005|page=197|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest that pigeons can also represent numbers up to 6 after an extensive training.&lt;ref name="Xia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xia|first=Li |author2=Sieman, Martina|author3=Delius Juan D. |title=Matching of numerical symbols with number of responses by pigeons|journal= Animal Cognition|year=2000|pages=35–43|doi=10.1007/s100710050048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dogs ===
A sense of number has also been found in dogs. For example, dogs were able&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Rebecca |author2=Rebecca, E|author3=Young, Robert J. |title=Do domestic dogs show any evidence of being able to count?|journal= Animal Cognition|year=2002|volume=5|pages=183–186.|doi=10.1007/s10071-002-0140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform simple additions of two objects, as revealed by their surprise when the result was incorrect. It is however argued that wolves perform better on quantity discrimination tasks than dogs and that this could be a result of a less demanding natural selection for number sense in dogs.&lt;ref name="Range"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Range|first=Federike|author2=Jenikejew, J|author3=Schröder, I|author4=Virányi, Z|title=Difference in quantity discrimination in dogs and wolves.|journal= Front. Psychol. |volume=5 |pages=1299|year=2014|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monkeys ===
[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus monkeys]] seem to have an innate understanding of numbers up to 4. This is shown by the study on semi-free-ranging rhesus monkeys in their natural environment&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt; in which the monkeys spontaneously discriminated numbers from 1 to 3 but did not demonstrate a numerical ability beyond this number. In another study that included training, rhesus monkeys showed the ability to generalize this knowledge to numerosities up to nine.&lt;ref name="Brannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannon|first=Elisabeth M.|author2=Herbert, Terrace S.|title=Ordering of the Numerosities 1 to 9 by Monkeys.|year=1988|journal= Science, New Series|volume=282|number=5389|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.746|pmid=9784133|pages=746–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===
[[Chimpanzees]] are believed to have a sense of number, albeit an imprecise one. While they can correctly compare numbers such as 6 and 7 by choosing a tray with more pieces of reward, their performance is more error-free when the difference between the numbers is bigger and when the numbers are smaller; that is when the distance and magnitude effects take place. Chimpanzees also seem to have knowledge of proportions. In an experiment by Woodroof and Premack&lt;ref name="Woodruff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodruff|first=Guy|author2=David Premack|title=Primative &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; mathematical concepts in the chimpanzee: proportionality and numerosity |year=1981 |journal=Nature |volume=293 |issue=5833 |pages=568–570|doi=10.1038/293568a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adult chimpanzee correctly identified and performed operations on exemplars of numbers and proportions presented on a variety of objects, such as apples, wood disks and water containers. For example, when presented with {{fraction|1|4}} of an apple and {{fraction|1|2}} full water container, the chimpanzee chose {{fraction|3|4}} of a wooden disk, suggesting an addition-like ability. The ability to add fractions has only been demonstrated in primates so far.&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt;

The '''ones' complement''' of a [[binary number]] is defined as the value obtained by inverting all the bits in the binary representation of the number (swapping 0s for 1s and vice versa). The ones' complement of the number then behaves like the negative of the original number in some arithmetic operations. To within a constant (of −1), the ones' complement behaves like the negative of the original number with [[binary addition]]. However, unlike [[two's complement]], these numbers have not seen widespread use because of issues such as the offset of −1, that negating zero results in a distinct [[negative zero]] bit pattern, less simplicity with arithmetic [[Carry (arithmetic)|borrowing]], etc.

A '''ones' complement system''' or '''ones' complement arithmetic''' is a system in which negative numbers are represented by the inverse of the binary representations of their corresponding positive numbers. In such a system, a number is negated (converted from positive to negative or vice versa) by computing its ones' complement. An N-bit ones' complement numeral system can only represent integers in the range −(2&lt;sup&gt;N−1&lt;/sup&gt;−1) to 2&lt;sup&gt;N−1&lt;/sup&gt;−1 while [[two's complement]] can express −2&lt;sup&gt;N−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;N−1&lt;/sup&gt;−1.

The '''ones' complement binary''' [[numeral system]] is characterized by the [[bit complement]] of any integer value being the arithmetic negative of the value.  That is, inverting all of the bits of a number (the logical complement) produces the same result as subtracting the value from 0.

Many early computers, including the [[CDC 6600]], the [[LINC]], the [[PDP-1]], and the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series#1107|UNIVAC 1107]], used ones' complement notation.  Successors of the CDC 6600 continued to use ones' complement until the late 1980s, and the descendants of the UNIVAC 1107 (the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series]]) still do, but the majority of modern computers use two's complement.

==Number representation==

Positive numbers are the same simple, binary system used by two's complement and sign-magnitude.  Negative values are the bit complement of the corresponding positive value. The largest positive value is characterized by the sign (high-order) bit being off (0) and all other bits being on (1).  The smallest negative value is characterized by the sign bit being 1, and all other bits being 0.  The table below shows all possible values in a 4-bit system, from −7 to +7.

      +      −
  0   0000   1111   — Note that both +0 and −0 return TRUE when tested for zero
  1   0001   1110   — and FALSE when tested for non-zero. 
  2   0010   1101
  3   0011   1100
  4   0100   1011
  5   0101   1010
  6   0110   1001
  7   0111   1000

==Basics==

Adding two values is straightforward.  Simply align the values on the least significant bit and add, propagating any carry to the bit one position left. If the carry extends past the end of the word it is said to have "wrapped around", a condition called an "[[end-around carry]]". When this occurs, the bit must be added back in at the right-most bit.  This phenomenon does not occur in two's complement arithmetic.

   0001 0110     22
 + 0000 0011      3
 ===========   ====
   0001 1001     25

Subtraction is similar, except that borrows, rather than carries, are propagated to the left.  If the borrow extends past the end of the word it is said to have "wrapped around", a condition called an "'''end-around borrow'''".  When this occurs, the bit must be subtracted from the right-most bit.  This phenomenon does not occur in two's complement arithmetic.

   0000 0110      6
 − 0001 0011     19
 ===========   ====
 1 1111 0011    −12    —An [[end-around borrow]] is produced, and the sign bit of the intermediate result is 1.
 − 0000 0001      1    —Subtract the end-around borrow from the result.
 ===========   ====
   1111 0010    −13    —The correct result (6 − 19 = -13)

It is easy to demonstrate that the bit complement of a positive value is the negative magnitude of the positive value.  The computation of 19&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 produces the same result as&amp;nbsp;19&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(−3).

Add 3 to 19.

   0001 0011     19
 + 0000 0011      3
 ===========   ====
   0001 0110     22

Subtract −3 from 19.

   0001 0011     19
 − 1111 1100     −3
 ===========   ====
 1 0001 0111     23    —An [[end-around borrow]] is produced.
 − 0000 0001      1    —Subtract the end-around borrow from the result.
 ===========   ====
   0001 0110     22    —The correct result (19 − (−3) = 22).

==Negative zero==
{{main article|Signed zero}}

Negative zero is the condition where all bits in a signed word are 1.  This follows the ones' complement rules that a value is negative when the left-most bit is 1, and that a negative number is the bit complement of the number's magnitude.  The value also behaves as zero when computing.  Adding or subtracting negative zero to/from another value produces the original value.

Adding negative zero:

   0001 0110     22
 + 1111 1111     −0
 ===========   ====
 1 0001 0101     21    —An [[end-around carry]] is produced.
 + 0000 0001      1
 ===========   ====
   0001 0110     22    —The correct result (22 + (−0) = 22)

Subtracting negative zero:

   0001 0110     22
 − 1111 1111     −0
 ===========   ====
 1 0001 0111     23    —An [[end-around borrow]] is produced.
 − 0000 0001      1
 ===========   ====
   0001 0110     22    —The correct result (22 − (−0) = 22)

Negative zero is easily produced in a 1's complement adder.  Simply add the positive and negative of the same magnitude.

   0001 0110     22
 + 1110 1001    −22
 ===========   ====
   1111 1111     −0    —Negative zero.

Although the math always produces the correct results, a side effect of negative zero is that software must test for negative zero.

==Avoiding negative zero==

The generation of negative zero becomes a non-issue if addition is achieved with a complementing subtractor.  The first operand is passed to the subtract unmodified, the second operand is complemented, and the subtraction generates the correct result, avoiding negative zero. The previous example added 22 and −22 and produced −0.

   0001 0110     22         0001 0110     22                  1110 1001   −22         1110 1001   −22
 + 1110 1001    −22       − 0001 0110     22                + 0001 0110    22       − 1110 1001   −22
 ===========   ====  but  ===========   ====   likewise,    ===========   ===  but  ===========   ===
   1111 1111     −0         0000 0000      0                  1111 1111    −0         0000 0000     0

"Corner cases" arise when one or both operands are zero and/or negative zero.

   0001 0010     18         0001 0010     18
 − 0000 0000      0       − 1111 1111     −0
 ===========   ====       ===========   ====
   0001 0010     18       1 0001 0011     19
                          − 0000 0001      1
                          ===========   ====
                            0001 0010     18

Subtracting +0 is trivial (as shown above).  If the second operand is negative zero it is inverted and the original value of the first operand is the result.  Subtracting −0 is also trivial.  The result can be only 1 of two cases.  In case 1, operand 1 is −0 so the result is produced simply by subtracting 1 from 1 at every bit position.  In case 2, the subtraction will generate a value that is 1 larger than operand 1 and an [[end-around borrow]].  Completing the borrow generates the same value as operand 1.

The next example shows what happens when both operands are plus or minus zero:

   0000 0000      0         0000 0000      0         1111 1111     −0         1111 1111     −0
 + 0000 0000      0       + 1111 1111     −0       + 0000 0000      0       + 1111 1111     −0
 ===========   ====       ===========   ====       ===========   ====       ===========   ====
   0000 0000      0         1111 1111     −0         1111 1111     −0       1 1111 1110     −1
                                                                            + 0000 0001      1
                                                                            ==================
                                                                              1111 1111     −0

   0000 0000      0         0000 0000      0         1111 1111     −0         1111 1111     −0
 − 1111 1111     −0       − 0000 0000      0       − 1111 1111     −0       − 0000 0000      0
 ===========   ====       ===========   ====       ===========   ====       ===========   ====
 1 0000 0001      1         0000 0000      0         0000 0000      0         1111 1111     −0
 − 0000 0001      1
 ===========   ====
   0000 0000      0

This example shows that of the 4 possible conditions when adding only ±0, an adder will produce −0 in three of them.  A complementing subtractor will produce −0 only when both operands are −0.

The method substitutes boundary conditions at the interface by a partial differential equation for the evolution of an auxiliary field (the phase field) that takes the role of an [[order parameter]]. This phase field takes two distinct values (for instance +1 and &amp;minus;1) in each of the phases, with a smooth change between both values in the zone around the interface, which is then diffuse with a finite width. A discrete location of the interface may be defined as the collection of all points where the phase field takes a certain value (e.g., 0). 

A phase field model is usually constructed in such a way that in the limit of an infinitesimal interface width (the so-called sharp interface limit) the correct interfacial dynamics are recovered. This approach permits to solve the problem by integrating a set of partial differential equations for the whole system, thus avoiding the explicit treatment of the boundary conditions at the interface.

Phase field models were first introduced by Fix&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Fix, in Free Boundary Problems: Theory and Applications, Ed. A. Fasano and M. Primicerio, p. 580, Pitman (Boston, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and Langer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1142/9789814415309_0005|chapter=Models of Pattern Formation in First-Order Phase Transitions|title=Directions in Condensed Matter Physics|journal=Directions in Condensed Matter Physics.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have experienced a growing interest in solidification and other areas.

==Equations of the Phase field model==

Phase field models are usually constructed in order to reproduce a given interfacial dynamics. For instance, in solidification problems the front dynamics is given by a diffusion equation for either concentration or temperature in the bulk and some boundary conditions at the interface (a local equilibrium condition and a conservation law),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.52.1|title=Instabilities and pattern formation in crystal growth|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=52|pages=1|year=1980|last1=Langer|first1=J. S.|bibcode=1980RvMP...52....1L}}&lt;/ref&gt; which constitutes the sharp interface model.
[[image:Phase field order parameter.jpg|280px|right|thumb|A two phase microstructure and the order parameter &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; profile is shown on a line across the domain. Gradual change of order parameter from one phase to another shows diffuse nature of the interface.]]

A number of formulations of the phase field model are based on a [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] function depending on an order parameter (the phase field) and a diffusive field (variational formulations). Equations of the model are then obtained by using general relations of [[statistical physics]]. Such a function is constructed from physical considerations, but contains a parameter or combination of parameters related to the interface width. Parameters of the model are then chosen by studying the limit of the model with this width going to zero, in such a way  that one can identify this limit with the intended sharp interface model.

Other formulations start by writing directly the phase field equations, without referring to any thermodynamical functional (non-variational formulations). In this case the only reference is the sharp interface model, in the sense that it should be recovered when performing the small interface width limit of the phase field model.

Phase field equations in principle reproduce the interfacial dynamics when the interface width is small compared with the smallest length scale in the problem. In solidification this scale is the capillary length &lt;math&gt;d_o&lt;/math&gt;, which is a microscopic scale. From a computational point of view integration of partial differential equations resolving such a small scale is prohibitive. However, Karma and Rappel introduced the thin interface limit,&lt;ref name=thin&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.57.4323|title=Quantitative phase-field modeling of dendritic growth in two and three dimensions|journal=Physical Review E|volume=57|issue=4|pages=4323|year=1998|last1=Karma|first1=Alain|last2=Rappel|first2=Wouter-Jan|bibcode=1998PhRvE..57.4323K}}&lt;/ref&gt; which permitted to relax this condition and has opened the way to practical quantitative simulations with phase field models.
With the increasing power of computers and the theoretical progress in phase field modelling, phase field models have become a useful tool for the numerical simulation of interfacial problems.

===Variational formulations===

A model for a phase field can be constructed by physical arguments if one has an explicit expression for the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the system. A simple example for solidification problems is the following:

&lt;math&gt;F[e,\phi]=\int d{\mathbf r} \left[ K|{\mathbf
\nabla}\phi|^2 + h_0f(\phi) + e_0u(\phi)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase field, &lt;math&gt;u(\phi)=e/e_0 + h(\phi)/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the local enthalpy per unit volume, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a certain polynomial function of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_0={L^2}/{T_{M}c_{p}}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[latent heat]], &lt;math&gt;T_M&lt;/math&gt; is the melting temperature, and &lt;math&gt;c_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat). The term with &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the interfacial energy. The function &lt;math&gt;f(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is usually taken as a double-well potential describing the free energy density of the bulk of each phase, which themselves correspond to the two minima of the function &lt;math&gt;f(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. The constants &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_{0}&lt;/math&gt; have respectively dimensions of energy per unit length and energy per unit volume. The interface width is then given by &lt;math&gt;W=\sqrt{K/h_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  
The phase field model can then be obtained from the following variational relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.49.435|title=Theory of dynamic critical phenomena|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=49|issue=3|pages=435|year=1977|last1=Hohenberg|first1=P.|last2=Halperin|first2=B.|bibcode=1977RvMP...49..435H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\partial_{t} \phi = -\frac{1}{\tau}
\left(\frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi} \right) + {\eta}({\mathbf
r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\partial_{t} e =
De_0\nabla^2 \left( \frac{\delta F}{\delta e} \right) -
{\mathbf{\nabla}} \cdot{\mathbf {q}}_e({\mathbf r},t).
&lt;/math&gt;

where D is a diffusion coefficient for the variable &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {q}_e&lt;/math&gt; are stochastic terms accounting for thermal fluctuations (and whose statistical properties can be obtained from the [[fluctuation dissipation theorem]]). The first equation gives an equation for the evolution of the phase field, whereas the second one is a diffusion equation, which usually is rewritten for the temperature or for the concentration (in the case of an alloy). These equations are, scaling space with &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and times with &lt;math&gt;l^2/D&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha \varepsilon^2\partial_{t} \phi =
\varepsilon^2\nabla^2\phi- f'(\phi) - \frac{e_0}{h_0}
h'(\phi)u+\tilde \eta({\mathbf r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\partial_{t}u = \nabla^{2}u+\frac{1}{2}h'(\phi) \partial_{t} \phi -
{\mathbf \nabla}\cdot {\mathbf q_{u}}({\mathbf r},t) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=W/l&lt;/math&gt; is the nondimensional interface width, &lt;math&gt;\alpha={D\tau}/{W^2h_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde\eta({\mathbf r},t)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf q_{u}}({\mathbf r},t)&lt;/math&gt; are nondimensionalized noises.

===Alternative Energy Density Functions===

The choice of free energy function, &lt;math&gt;f(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, can have a significant effect on the physical behaviour of the interface, and should be selected with care.  The double-well function represents an approximation of the Van der Waals EOS near the critical point, and has historically been used for its simplicity of implementation when the phase field model is employed solely for interface tracking purposes.  However, this has led to the frequently observed spontaneous drop shrinkage phenomenon, whereby the high phase miscibility predicted by an Equation of State near the critical point allows significant interpenetration of the phases and can eventually lead to the complete disappearance of a droplet whose radius is below some critical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2006.11.020|title=Spontaneous shrinkage of drops and mass conservation in phase-field simulations|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=223|pages=1|year=2007|last1=Yue|first1=Pengtao|last2=Zhou|first2=Chunfeng|last3=Feng|first3=James J.|bibcode=2007JCoPh.223....1Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimizing perceived continuity losses over the duration of a simulation requires limits on the Mobility parameter, resulting in a delicate balance between interfacial smearing due to convection, interfacial reconstruction due to free energy minimization (i.e. mobility-based diffusion), and phase interpenetration, also dependent on the mobility.   A recent review of alternative energy density functions for interface tracking applications has proposed a modified form of the double-obstacle function which avoids the spontaneous drop shrinkage phenomena and limits on mobility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2011.02.002|title=Diffuse interface tracking of immiscible fluids: Improving phase continuity through free energy density selection|journal=International Journal of Multiphase Flow|volume=37|issue=7|pages=777|year=2011|last1=Donaldson|first1=A.A.|last2=Kirpalani|first2=D.M.|last3=MacChi|first3=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with comparative results provide for a number of benchmark simulations using the double-well function and the VOF sharp interface technique.  The proposed implementation has a computational complexity only slightly greater than that of the double-well function, and may prove useful for interface tracking applications of the phase field model where the duration/nature of the simulated phenomena introduces phase continuity concerns (i.e. small droplets, extended simulations, multiple interfaces, etc.).

===Sharp interface limit of the Phase field equations===

A phase field model can be constructed to purposely reproduce a given interfacial dynamics as represented by a sharp interface model. In such a case the sharp interface limit (i.e. the limit when the interface width goes to zero) of the proposed set of phase field equations should be performed. This limit is usually taken by asymptotic expansions of the fields of the model in powers of the interface width &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. These expansions are performed both in the interfacial region (inner expansion) and in the bulk (outer expansion), and then are asymptotically matched order by order. The result gives a partial differential equation for the diffusive field and a series of boundary conditions at the interface, which should correspond to the sharp interface model and whose comparison with it provides the values of the parameters of the phase field model.

Whereas such expansions were in early phase field models performed up to the lower order in &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; only, more recent models use higher order asymptotics (thin interface limits) in order to cancel undesired spureous effects or to include new physics in the model. For example, this technique has permitted to cancel kinetic effects,&lt;ref name=thin/&gt; to treat cases with unequal diffusivities in the phases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00064-6|title=Thin interface asymptotics for an energy/entropy approach to phase-field models with unequal conductivities|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|volume=144|pages=154|year=2000|last1=McFadden|first1=G.B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=A.A.|last3=Anderson|first3=D.M.|bibcode=2000PhyD..144..154M}}&lt;/ref&gt; to model viscous fingering&lt;ref name="viscous" /&gt; and two-phase Navier–Stokes flows,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/jcph.1999.6332|title=Calculation of Two-Phase Navier–Stokes Flows Using Phase-Field Modeling|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=155|pages=96|year=1999|last1=Jacqmin|first1=David|bibcode=1999JCoPh.155...96J}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include fluctuations in the model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.71.061603 |title=Sharp-interface projection of a fluctuating phase-field model |journal=Physical Review E |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=061603 |year=2005 |last1=Benítez |first1=R. |last2=Ramírez-Piscina |first2=L. |bibcode=2005PhRvE..71f1603B |arxiv=cond-mat/0409707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

== Multi Phase Field Models==
[[image:Multi Phase Field Order Parameters.jpg|280px|right|thumb|Multiple order parameters describe a polycrystalline material microstructure.]]
In multi-phase field models, microstructure is described by set of order parameters, each of which is related to a specific phase or crystallographic orientation. This model is mostly used for solid state phase transformations where multiple grains evolve (e.g.  [[grain growth]], [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] or first order transformation like [[austenite]] to [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] in ferrous alloys). Besides allowing the description of multiple grains in a microstructure, multi-phase field models especially allow for consideration of multiple thermodynamic phases occurring e.g. in technical alloy grades.&lt;ref name=technical&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase-field based simulation of microstructure evolution in technical alloy grades|journal=International Journal of Advances in Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics|volume=2|issue=4|pages=126|year=2011|doi=10.1007/s12572-011-0026-y|last1=Schmitz|first1=G.

PRBS are used in [[telecommunication]], [[encryption]], [[simulation]], [[correlation]] technique and time-of-flight [[spectroscopy]].

== Details ==
A binary sequence (BS) is a [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;a_0,\ldots, a_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; bits, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;a_j\in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=0,1,...,N-1&lt;/math&gt;.

A BS consists of &lt;math&gt;m=\sum a_j&lt;/math&gt; ones and &lt;math&gt;N-m&lt;/math&gt; zeros.

A BS is a '''[[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] binary sequence''' (PRBS) if&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scriptwell.net/correlation.htm |title=Articles on Correlation and Calibration |last1=Naszodi |first1=Laszlo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111050840/http://www.scriptwell.net/correlation.htm |archive-date=11 November 2013 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; its [[autocorrelation function]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;C(v)=\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_ja_{j+v}&lt;/math&gt;

has only two values:

:&lt;math&gt;C(v)=
\begin{cases}
m, \mbox{ if } v\equiv 0\;\; (\mbox{mod}N)\\ 
\\
mc, \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;c=\frac{m-1}{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''duty cycle'' of the PRBS, similar to the [[duty cycle]] of a continuous time signal.  For a [[maximum length sequence]], where &lt;math&gt;N = 2^k - 1&lt;/math&gt;, the duty cycle is 1/2.

A PRBS is 'pseudorandom', because, although it is in fact deterministic, it seems to be random in a sense that the value of an &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; element is independent of the values of any of the other elements, similar to real random sequences.

A PRBS can be stretched to infinity by repeating it after &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements, but it will then be cyclical and thus non-random.  In contrast, truly random sequence sources, such as sequences generated by [[radioactive decay]] or by [[white noise]], are infinite (no pre-determined end or cycle-period).  However, as a result of this predictability, PRBS signals can be used as reproducible patterns (for example, signals used in testing telecommunications signal paths).&lt;ref name="O150"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-O.150-199210-S |title=ITU-T Recommendation O.150 |date=October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:PRBS7  = &lt;math&gt;x^{7} + x^{6} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

:PRBS9  = &lt;math&gt;x^{9} + x^{5} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

:PRBS11  = &lt;math&gt;x^{11} + x^{9} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

:PRBS15 = &lt;math&gt;x^{15} + x^{14} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

:PRBS20 = &lt;math&gt;x^{20} + x^{3} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

:PRBS23 = &lt;math&gt;x^{23} + x^{18} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

:PRBS31 = &lt;math&gt;x^{31} + x^{28} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

An example of generating a "PRBS-7" sequence can be expressed in C as

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    uint8_t start = 0x02;
    uint8_t a = start;
    int i;    
    for(i = 1;; i++) {
        int newbit = (((a &gt;&gt; 6) ^ (a &gt;&gt; 5)) &amp; 1);
        a = ((a &lt;&lt; 1) | newbit) &amp; 0x7f;
        printf("%x\n", a);
        if (a == start) {
            printf("repetition period is %d\n", i);
            break;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this particular case, "PRBS-7" has a repetition period of 127 bits.

== Notation ==

The PRBS''k'' or PRBS-''k'' notation (such as "PRBS7" or "PRBS-7") gives an indication of the size of the sequence.  &lt;math&gt;N = 2^k - 1&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum number&lt;ref name="O150" /&gt;{{Rp|§3}} of bits that be in the sequence.  The ''k'' indicates the size of a unique [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] of data in the sequence.  If you segment the ''N'' bits of data into every possible word of length ''k'', you will be able to list every possible combination of 0s and 1s for a k-bit binary word, with the exception of the all-0s word.&lt;ref name="O150" /&gt;{{Rp|§2}} For example, PRBS3 = "1011100" could be generated from &lt;math&gt;x^{3} + x^{2} + 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bloopist" /&gt;  If you take every sequential group of three bit words in the PRBS3 sequence (wrapping around to the beginning for the last few three-bit words), you will find the following 7 words:
   "&lt;u&gt;101&lt;/u&gt;1100" &amp;rarr; 101
   "1&lt;u&gt;011&lt;/u&gt;100" &amp;rarr; 011
   "10&lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;00" &amp;rarr; 111
   "101&lt;u&gt;110&lt;/u&gt;0" &amp;rarr; 110
   "1011&lt;u&gt;100&lt;/u&gt;" &amp;rarr; 100
   "&lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;0111&lt;u&gt;00&lt;/u&gt;" &amp;rarr; 001 (requires wrap)
   "&lt;u&gt;10&lt;/u&gt;1110&lt;u&gt;0&lt;/u&gt;" &amp;rarr; 010 (requires wrap)
Those 7 words are all of the &lt;math&gt;2^k - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 7&lt;/math&gt; possible non-zero 3-bit binary words, not in numeric order.  The same holds true for any PRBS''k'', not just PRBS3.&lt;ref name="O150" /&gt;{{Rp|§2}}

[[Image:Pythagoras Tree Colored.png|thumb|The Pythagoras tree with an angle of 25 degrees and smooth coloring]]
The '''Pythagoras tree''' is a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[fractal]] constructed from [[Square (geometry)|squares]]. Invented by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[mathematics]] teacher Albert E. Bosman in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsetmathesis.nl/bruno0402.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118100209/http://www.arsetmathesis.nl/bruno0402.htm |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mathematician [[Pythagoras]] because each triple of touching squares encloses a [[right triangle]], in a configuration traditionally used to depict the [[Pythagorean theorem]].
If the largest square has a size of ''L''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''L'', the entire Pythagoras tree fits snugly inside a box of size 6''L''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;4''L''.&lt;ref name="Wisfaq.nl"&gt;[http://www.wisfaq.nl/showrecord3.asp?id=32367 Wisfaq.nl].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourahmadazar"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pourahmadazar, J. |author2=Ghobadi, C. |author3=Nourinia, J. |title=Novel Modified Pythagorean Tree Fractal Monopole Antennas for UWB Applications|publisher=IEEE |location=New York |year=2011 |pages=|doi=10.1109/LAWP.2011.2154354 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5766703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finer details of the tree resemble the [[Lévy C curve]].

==Construction==
The construction of the Pythagoras tree begins with a [[square (geometry)|square]]. Upon this square are constructed two squares, each scaled down by a linear factor of {{radic|2}}/2, such that the corners of the squares coincide pairwise. The same procedure is then applied [[recursion|recursively]] to the two smaller squares, ''ad infinitum''. The illustration below shows the first few [[iteration]]s in the construction process.&lt;ref name="Wisfaq.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourahmadazar"/&gt;

==Area==
Iteration ''n'' in the construction adds 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; squares of area &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, for a total area of 1. Thus the area of the tree might seem to grow without bound in the limit as ''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞. However, some of the squares overlap starting at the order 5 iteration, and the tree actually has a finite area because it fits inside a 6&amp;times;4 box.&lt;ref name="Wisfaq.nl"/&gt;

It can be shown easily that the area ''A'' of the Pythagoras tree must be in the range 5&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;18, which can be narrowed down further with extra effort. Little seems to be known about the actual value of&amp;nbsp;''A''.

==Varying the angle==
An interesting set of variations can be constructed by maintaining an isosceles triangle but changing the base angle (90 degrees for the standard Pythagoras tree).  In particular, when the base half-angle is set to (30°) = arcsin(0.5), it is easily seen that the size of the squares remains constant.  The first overlap occurs at the fourth iteration.  The general pattern produced is the [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]], an array of hexagons bordered by the constructing squares.

{|align="center"

| [[File:Ptang10th.pdf|250px|tenth-order tree]]
|-
|align="center"| Order 4
|align="center"| Order 10
|}
In the limit where the half-angle is 90 degrees, there is obviously no overlap, and the total area is twice the area of the base square.  It would be interesting to know if there's an algorithmic relationship between the value of the base half-angle and the iteration at which the squares first overlap each other.

==History==
Pythagoras tree was first constructed by Albert E. Bosman (1891–1961), [[Dutch people|Dutch]] mathematics teacher, in 1942.&lt;ref name="Wisfaq.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsetmathesis.nl/bruno0402.htm Arsetmathesis.nl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118100209/http://www.arsetmathesis.nl/bruno0402.htm |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Computational learning theory|statistical learning theory]], a '''representer theorem''' is any of several related results stating that a minimizer &lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; of a regularized [[Empirical risk minimization|empirical risk function]] defined over a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] can be represented as a finite linear combination of kernel products evaluated on the input points in the training set data.

==Formal statement==
The following Representer Theorem and its proof are due to [[Bernhard Schölkopf|Schölkopf]], Herbrich, and Smola:

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty set and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; a positive-definite real-valued kernel on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; with corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt;.  Given a training sample &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1), \dotsc, (x_n, y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \R&lt;/math&gt;, a strictly monotonically increasing real-valued function &lt;math&gt;g \colon [0, \infty) \to \R&lt;/math&gt;, and an arbitrary empirical risk function &lt;math&gt;E \colon (\mathcal{X} \times \R^2)^n \to \R \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;f^{*} \in H_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*} = \operatorname{arg min}_{f \in H_k} \left\lbrace E\left( (x_1, y_1, f(x_1)), ..., (x_n, y_n, f(x_n)) \right) + g\left( \lVert f \rVert \right) \right \rbrace, \quad (*)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; admits a representation of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in \R&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
Define a mapping

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \varphi \colon \mathcal{X} &amp;\to \R^{\mathcal{X} }\\
\varphi(x) &amp;= k(\cdot, x)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(so that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) = k(\cdot, x)&lt;/math&gt; is itself a map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \to \R&lt;/math&gt;).  Since &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a reproducing kernel, then

:&lt;math&gt;
 \varphi(x)(x') = k(x', x) = \langle \varphi(x'), \varphi(x) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the inner product on &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Given any &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;, one can use orthogonal projection to decompose any &lt;math&gt;f \in H_k&lt;/math&gt; into a sum of two functions, one lying in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span} \left \lbrace \varphi(x_1), ..., \varphi(x_n) \right \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, and the other lying in the orthogonal complement:

:&lt;math&gt;
 f = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) + v,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle v, \varphi(x_i) \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

The above orthogonal decomposition and the [[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space#The Reproducing Property|reproducing property]] together show that applying &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to any training point &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; produces

:&lt;math&gt;
 f(x_j) = \left \langle \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) + v, \varphi(x_j) \right \rangle = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \langle \varphi(x_i), \varphi(x_j) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;

which we observe is independent of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, the value of the empirical risk &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in (*) is likewise independent of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  For the second term (the regularization term), since &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is strictly monotonic, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 g\left( \lVert f \rVert \right) &amp;= g \left(  \lVert \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) + v \rVert \right) \\
&amp;= g \left( \sqrt{  \lVert \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i)  \rVert^2 + \lVert v \rVert^2} \right) \\
&amp;\ge g \left(  \lVert \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) \rVert \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore setting &lt;math&gt;v = 0&lt;/math&gt; does not affect the first term of (*), while it strictly decreasing the second term.  Consequently, any minimizer &lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; in (*) must have &lt;math&gt;v = 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it must be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the desired result.

==Generalizations==
The Theorem stated above is a particular example of a family of results that are collectively referred to as "representer theorems"; here we describe several such.

The first statement of a representer theorem was due to Kimeldorf and Wahba for the special case in which

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E\left( (x_1, y_1, f(x_1)), ...,  (x_n, y_n, f(x_n)) \right) &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (f(x_i) - y_i)^2, \\
g(\lVert f \rVert) &amp;= \lambda \lVert f \rVert^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Schölkopf, Herbrich, and Smola generalized this result by relaxing the assumption of the squared-loss cost and allowing the regularizer to be any strictly monotonically increasing function &lt;math&gt;g(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; of the Hilbert space norm.

It is possible to generalize further by augmenting the regularized empirical risk function through the addition of unpenalized offset terms.  For example, Schölkopf, Herbrich, and Smola also consider the minimization

:&lt;math&gt;
 \tilde{f}^{*} = \operatorname{arg min} \left\lbrace E\left( (x_1, y_1, \tilde{f}(x_1)),  ...,  (x_n, y_n, \tilde{f}(x_n)) \right) + g\left( \lVert f \rVert \right) \mid \tilde{f} = f  + h \in H_k \oplus  \operatorname{span} \lbrace \psi_p \mid 1 \le p \le M \rbrace  \right \rbrace, \quad (\dagger)
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., we consider functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f} = f + h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f \in H_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is an unpenalized function lying in the span of a finite set of real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \psi_p \colon \mathcal{X} \to \R \mid 1 \le p \le M \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.  Under the assumption that the &lt;math&gt;m \times M&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\left( \psi_p(x_i) \right)_{ip}&lt;/math&gt; has rank &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, they show that the minimizer &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
admits a representation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
 \tilde{f}^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i) + \sum_{p = 1}^M \beta_p \psi_p(\cdot)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i, \beta_p \in \R&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\beta_p&lt;/math&gt; are all uniquely determined.

The conditions under which a representer theorem exists were investigated by Argyriou, Miccheli, and Pontil, who proved the following:

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty set, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; a positive-definite real-valued kernel on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; with corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;R \colon H_k \to \R&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable regularization function.  Then given a training sample &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \R&lt;/math&gt; and an arbitrary empirical risk function &lt;math&gt;E \colon (\mathcal{X} \times \R^2)^m \to \R \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, a minimizer

:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*} =  \operatorname{arg min}_{f \in H_k} \left\lbrace E\left( (x_1, y_1, f(x_1)), ...,  (x_n, y_n, f(x_n)) \right) + R(f) \right \rbrace \quad (\ddagger)
&lt;/math&gt;

of the regularized empirical risk minimization problem admits a representation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in \R&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if there exists a nondecreasing function &lt;math&gt;h \colon [0, \infty) \to \R&lt;/math&gt; for which

:&lt;math&gt;
R(f) = h(\lVert f \rVert).
&lt;/math&gt;

Effectively, this result provides a necessary and sufficient condition on a differentiable regularizer &lt;math&gt;R(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; under which the corresponding regularized empirical risk minimization &lt;math&gt;(\ddagger)&lt;/math&gt; will have a representer theorem.  In particular, this shows that a broad class of regularized risk minimizations (much broader than those originally considered by Kimeldorf and Wahba) have representer theorems.

==Applications==
Representer theorems are useful from a practical standpoint because they dramatically simplify the regularized empirical risk minimization problem &lt;math&gt;(\ddagger)&lt;/math&gt;.  In most interesting applications, the search domain &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt; for the minimization will be an infinite-dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore the search (as written) does not admit implementation on finite-memory and finite-precision computers.  In contrast, the representation of &lt;math&gt;f^{*}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; afforded by a representer theorem reduces the original (infinite-dimensional) minimization problem to a search for the optimal &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector of coefficients &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n) \in \R^n&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can then be obtained by applying any standard function minimization algorithm.  Consequently, representer theorems provide the theoretical basis for the reduction of the general machine learning problem to algorithms that can actually be implemented on computers in practice.

Practical applications of Richardson extrapolation include [[Romberg integration]], which applies Richardson extrapolation to the [[trapezoid rule]], and the [[Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm]] for solving ordinary differential equations.

==Example of Richardson extrapolation==
Suppose that we wish to approximate &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;, and we have a method &lt;math&gt;A(h)&lt;/math&gt; that depends on a small parameter &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that

&lt;math&gt;A(h) = A^\ast + C h^n + O(h^{n+1}).&lt;/math&gt;

Let's define a new function 

&lt;math&gt; R(h,t) := \frac{ t^n A(h/t) - A(h)}{t^n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{h}{t}&lt;/math&gt; are two distinct step sizes.

Then

&lt;math&gt;  R(h, t) = \frac{ t^n ( A^* + C \left(\frac{h}{t}\right)^n + O(h^{n+1}) ) - ( A^* + C h^n + O(h^{n+1}) ) }{ t^n - 1} = A^* + O(h^{n+1}). &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; R(h,t) &lt;/math&gt; is called the Richardson [[extrapolation]] of ''A''(''h''), and has a higher-order
error estimate &lt;math&gt; O(h^{n+1}) &lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt; A(h) &lt;/math&gt;.

Very often, it is much easier to obtain a given precision by using ''R(h)'' rather
than ''A(h')'' with a much smaller '' h' '', which can cause problems due to limited precision ([[rounding error]]s) and/or due to the increasing [[Computational cost|number of calculations]] needed (see examples below).

==General formula==
Let ''&lt;math&gt;A(h)&lt;/math&gt;'' be an approximation of ''&lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;''(exact value) that depends on a positive step size ''h'' with an [[Approximation error|error]] formula of the form 
:&lt;math&gt; A^* = A(h)+a_0h^{k_0} + a_1h^{k_1} + a_2h^{k_2} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are unknown constants and the ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are known constants such that ''h&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' &gt; ''h&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''.

''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the leading order step size behavior of [[Truncation error]] as &lt;math&gt;A^*=A(h)+O(h^{k_0})&lt;/math&gt;

The exact value sought can be given by
:&lt;math&gt; A^* = A(h) + a_0h^{k_0} + a_1h^{k_1} + a_2h^{k_2} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
which can be simplified with [[Big O notation]] to be
:&lt;math&gt; A^* = A(h)+ a_0h^{k_0} + O(h^{k_1}).  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the step sizes ''h'' and ''h / t'' for some ''t'', the two formulas for ''A'' are:
:&lt;math&gt; A^* = A(h)+ a_0h^{k_0} + O(h^{k_1})  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A^* = A\!\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) + a_0\left(\frac{h}{t}\right)^{k_0} + O(h^{k_1}) .&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying the second equation by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and subtracting the first equation gives
:&lt;math&gt; (t^{k_0}-1)A^* = t^{k_0}A\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) - A(h) + O(h^{k_1}) &lt;/math&gt;
which can be solved for &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt; to give
:&lt;math&gt;A^* = \frac{t^{k_0}A\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1}) .&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore using &lt;math&gt;R(h,t)=\frac{t^{k_0}A\left(\frac{h}{t}\right)-A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1}&lt;/math&gt; the truncation error has been reduced to 
&lt;math&gt;O(h^{k_1}) &lt;/math&gt;. This is in contrast to &lt;math&gt;A(h)&lt;/math&gt; where the [[truncation error]] is &lt;math&gt;O(h^{k_0}) &lt;/math&gt; for the same step size &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;

By this process, we have achieved a better approximation of ''A'' by subtracting the largest term in the error which was ''O''(''h''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  This process can be repeated to remove more error terms to get even better approximations.

A general [[recurrence relation]] beginning with &lt;math&gt;A_0=A(h)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined for the approximations by
:&lt;math&gt; A_{i+1}(h) = \frac{t^{k_i}A_i\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) - A_i(h)}{t^{k_i}-1} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; A^* = A_{i+1}(h) + O(h^{k_{i+1}}) &lt;/math&gt;.


The Richardson extrapolation can be considered as a linear [[sequence transformation]].

Additionally, the general formula can be used to estimate ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (leading order step size behavior of [[Truncation error]]) when neither its value nor ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (exact value) is known ''a priori''.  Such a technique can be useful for quantifying an unknown [[rate of convergence]].  Given approximations of ''A'' from three distinct step sizes ''h'', ''h / t'', and ''h / s'', the exact relationship
:&lt;math&gt;A^*=\frac{t^{k_0}A\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1}) = \frac{s^{k_0}A\left(\frac{h}{s}\right) - A(h)}{s^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1})&lt;/math&gt;
yields an approximate relationship (please note that the notation here may cause a bit of confusion, the two O appearing in the equation above only indicates the leading order step size behavior but their explicit forms are different and hence cancelling out of the two O terms is approximately valid)
:&lt;math&gt;A\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) + \frac{A\left(\frac{h}{t}\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} \approx A\left(\frac{h}{s}\right) +\frac{A\left(\frac{h}{s}\right) - A(h)}{s^{k_0}-1}&lt;/math&gt;
which can be solved numerically to estimate ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Example pseudocode code for Richardson extrapolation==

The following pseudocode in MATLAB style demonstrates Richardson extrapolation to help solve the ODE &lt;math&gt;y'(t) = -y^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Trapezoidal method]]. In this example we halve the step size &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; each iteration and so in the discussion above we'd have that &lt;math&gt;t = 2&lt;/math&gt;. The error of the Trapezoidal method can be expressed in terms of odd powers so that the error over multiple steps can be expressed in even powers; this leads us to raise &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to the second power and to take powers of &lt;math&gt;4 = 2^2 = t^2&lt;/math&gt; in the pseudocode. We want to find the value of &lt;math&gt;y(5)&lt;/math&gt;, which has the exact solution of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5 + 1} = \frac{1}{6} = 0.1666...&lt;/math&gt; since the exact solution of the ODE is &lt;math&gt;y(t) = \frac{1}{1 + t}&lt;/math&gt;. This pseudocode assumes that a function called &lt;code&gt;Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)&lt;/code&gt; exists which attempts to computes &lt;code&gt;y(tEnd)&lt;/code&gt; by performing the trapezoidal method on the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, with starting point &lt;code&gt;y0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tStart&lt;/code&gt; and step size &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;. 

Note that starting with too small an initial step size can potentially introduce error into the final solution. Although there are methods designed to help pick the best initial step size, one option is to start with a large step size and then to allow the Richardson extrapolation to reduce the step size each iteration until the error reaches the desired tolerance. 

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
tStart = 0          %Starting time
tEnd = 5            %Ending time
f = -y^2            %The derivative of y, so y' = f(t, y(t)) = -y^2
                    % The solution to this ODE is y = 1/(1 + t)
y0 = 1              %The initial position (i.e. y0 = y(tStart) = y(0) = 1)
tolerance = 10^-11  %10 digit accuracy is desired

maxRows = 20                %Don't allow the iteration to continue indefinitely
initialH = tStart - tEnd    %Pick an initial step size
haveWeFoundSolution = false %Were we able to find the solution to within the desired tolerance? not yet.

h = initialH

%Create a 2D matrix of size maxRows by maxRows to hold the Richardson extrapolates
%Note that this will be a lower triangular matrix and that at most two rows are actually
% needed at any time in the computation.
A = zeroMatrix(maxRows, maxRows)

%Compute the top left element of the matrix
A(1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)

%Each row of the matrix requires one call to Trapezoidal
%This loops starts by filling the second row of the matrix, since the first row was computed above
for i = 1 : maxRows - 1 %Starting at i = 1, iterate at most maxRows - 1 times
    h = h/2             %Half the previous value of h since this is the start of a new row
    
    %Call the Trapezoidal function with this new smaller step size
    A(i + 1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)
    
    for j = 1 : i         %Go across the row until the diagonal is reached
        %Use the value just computed (i.e. A(i + 1, j)) and the element from the
        % row above it (i.e. A(i, j)) to compute the next Richardson extrapolate
     
        A(i + 1, j + 1) = ((4^j).*A(i + 1, j) - A(i, j))/(4^j - 1);
    end
    
    %After leaving the above inner loop, the diagonal element of row i + 1 has been computed
    % This diagonal element is the latest Richardson extrapolate to be computed  
    %The difference between this extrapolate and the last extrapolate of row i is a good
    % indication of the error
    if(absoluteValue(A(i + 1, i + 1) - A(i, i)) &lt; tolerance)   %If the result is within tolerance
        print("y(5) = ", A(i + 1, i + 1))                      %Display the result of the Richardson extrapolation
        haveWeFoundSolution = true
        break                                                  %Done, so leave the loop
    end
end

if(haveWeFoundSolution == false)   %If we weren't able to find a solution to within the desired tolerance
    print("Warning: Not able to find solution to within the desired tolerance of ", tolerance);
    print("The last computed extrapolate was ", A(maxRows, maxRows))
end
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Roger Cotes''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (10 July 1682 – 5 June 1716) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]], known for working closely with [[Isaac Newton]] by proofreading the second edition of his famous book, the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', before publication. He also invented the [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] formulas known as [[Newton–Cotes formulas]] and first introduced what is known today as [[Euler's formula]].&lt;ref&gt;Cotes wrote:  ''"Nam si quadrantis circuli quilibet arcus, radio ''CE'' descriptus, sinun habeat ''CX'' sinumque complementi ad quadrantem ''XE'' ; sumendo radium ''CE'' pro Modulo, arcus erit rationis inter &lt;math&gt;EX + XC \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&amp; ''CE'' mensura ducta in &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;."'' (Thus if any arc of a quadrant of a circle, described by the radius ''CE'', has sinus ''CX'' and sinus of the complement to the quadrant ''XE'' ; taking the radius ''CE'' as modulus, the arc will be the measure of the ratio between &lt;math&gt;EX + XC \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp; ''CE'' multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.)  That is, consider a circle having center ''E'' (at the origin of the (x,y) plane) and radius ''CE''.  Consider an angle ''θ'' with its vertex at ''E'' having the positive x-axis as one side and a radius ''CE'' as the other side.  The perpendicular from the point ''C'' on the circle to the x-axis is the "sinus" ''CX'' ; the line between the circle's center ''E'' and the point ''X'' at the foot of the perpendicular is ''XE'', which is the "sinus of the complement to the quadrant" or "cosinus".  The ratio between &lt;math&gt;EX + XC \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and ''CE'' is thus &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + \sqrt{-1} \sin \theta \ &lt;/math&gt;.  In Cotes' terminology, the "measure" of a quantity is its natural logarithm, and the "modulus" is a conversion factor that transforms a measure of angle into circular arc length (here, the modulus is the radius (''CE'') of the circle).  According to Cotes, the product of the modulus and the measure (logarithm) of the ratio, when multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, equals the length of the circular arc subtended by ''θ'', which for any angle measured in radians is ''CE'' • ''θ''.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} CE \ln{\left ( \cos \theta + \sqrt{-1} \sin \theta \right ) \ } = (CE) \theta &lt;/math&gt;.  This equation has the wrong sign:  the factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; should be on the right side of the equation, not the left side.  If this change is made, then, after dividing both sides by ''CE'' and exponentiating both sides, the result is:  &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + \sqrt{-1} \sin \theta = e^{\sqrt{-1} \theta}&lt;/math&gt;, which is Euler's formula.&lt;br&gt;

*Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., ''Harmonia mensurarum'' … (Cambridge, England:  1722), chapter:  "Logometria",  [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6BGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy|Plumian Professor]] at [[Cambridge University]] from 1707 until his death.

==Early life==
Cotes was born in [[Burbage, Leicestershire]]. His parents were Robert, the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Burbage, and his wife, Grace, ''née'' Farmer. Roger had an elder brother, Anthony (born 1681), and a younger sister, Susanna (born 1683), both of whom died young. At first Roger attended Leicester School, where his mathematical talent was recognised. His aunt Hannah had married Rev. John Smith, and Smith took on the role of tutor to encourage Roger's talent. The Smiths' son, [[Robert Smith (mathematician)|Robert Smith]], would become a close associate of Roger Cotes throughout his life. Cotes later studied at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in [[London]] and entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CTS699R|name=Cotes, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[graduation|graduated]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1702 and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1706.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Meli (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==
Roger Cotes's contributions to modern [[Computational mathematics|computational methods]] lie heavily in the fields of [[astronomy]] and mathematics. Cotes began his educational career with a focus on [[astronomy]]. He became a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellow]] of Trinity College in 1707, and at age 26 he became the first Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. On his appointment to professor, he opened a subscription list in an effort to provide an [[observatory]] for Trinity. Unfortunately, the observatory still was unfinished when Cotes died, and was demolished in 1797.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In correspondence with Isaac Newton, Cotes designed a [[heliostat]] telescope with a mirror revolving by clockwork.&lt;ref&gt;Edleston, J., ed. (1850) ''Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Cotes, …'' (London, England:  John W. Parker), [https://archive.org/stream/correspondenceof00newtrich#page/197/mode/2up "Letter XCVIII.  Cotes to John Smith."] (1708 February 10), pp. 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathforcollege.com/nm/anecdotes/cotes.html|title=cotes - A Historical Anecdote|last=Kaw|first=Autar|date=2003-01-01|website=mathforcollege.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recomputed the solar and planetary tables of [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] and [[John Flamsteed]], and he intended to create tables of the [[moon]]'s [[planetary motion|motion]], based on Newtonian principles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Finally, in 1707 he formed a school of physical sciences at Trinity in partnership with [[William Whiston]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==The ''Principia''==
From 1709 to 1713, Cotes became heavily involved with the second edition of Newton's ''Principia'', a book that explained Newton's theory of [[universal gravitation]]. The first edition of ''Principia'' had only a few copies printed and was in need of revision to include Newton's works and principles of lunar and planetary theory.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Newton at first had a casual approach to the revision, since he had all but given up scientific work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} However, through the vigorous passion displayed by Cotes, Newton's scientific hunger was once again reignited.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The two spent nearly three and half years collaborating on the work, in which they fully deduce, from [[Newton's laws of motion]], the theory of the [[moon]], the [[equinox]]es, and the [[orbit]]s of [[comet]]s. Only 750 copies of the second edition were printed.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; However, a pirate copy from [[Amsterdam]] met all other demand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} As reward to Cotes, he was given a share of the profits and 12 copies of his own.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Cotes's original contribution to the work was a preface which supported the scientific superiority of Newton's principles over the then popular [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation|vortex theory of gravity]] advocated by [[René Descartes]]. Cotes concluded that the Newton's law of gravitation was confirmed by observation of celestial phenomena that were inconsistent with the vortex phenomena that Cartesian critics alleged.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Mathematics==
Cotes's major original work was in mathematics, especially in the fields of [[integral calculus]], [[logarithm]]s, and [[numerical analysis]]. He published only one [[scientific paper]] in his lifetime, titled ''Logometria'', in which he successfully constructs the [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;O'Connor &amp; Robertson (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Logometria'', Cotes evaluated [[e (mathematical constant)|e, the base of natural logarithms]], to 12 decimal places.  See:  Roger Cotes (1714) "Logometria," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''29''' (338) : 5-45; [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324351035;view=2up;seq=16 see especially the bottom of page 10.]  From page 10:  ''"Porro eadem ratio est inter 2,718281828459 &amp;c et 1, … "'' (Furthermore, the same ratio is between 2.718281828459… and 1, … )&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, many of Cotes's mathematical papers were hastily edited by his cousin Robert Smith and published in a book, ''Harmonia mensurarum''.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Harmonia mensurarum'' contains a chapter of comments on Cotes' work by Robert Smith.  On page 95, Smith gives the value of 1 [[radian]] for the first time.  See:  Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., ''Harmonia mensurarum'' … (Cambridge, England:  1722), chapter: Editoris notæ ad Harmoniam mensurarum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6BGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA95#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false top of page 95].  From page 95:  After stating that 180° corresponds to a length of π (3.14159…) along a unit circle (i.e., π radians), Smith writes:  ''"Unde Modulus Canonis Trigonometrici prodibit 57.2957795130 &amp;c. "'' (Whence the conversion factor of trigonometric measure, 57.2957795130… [degrees per radian], will appear.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes's additional works were later published in [[Thomas Simpson]]'s ''The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions''.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; Although Cotes's style was somewhat obscure, his systematic approach to [[integral|integration]] and mathematical theory was highly regarded by his peers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Cotes discovered an important theorem on the ''n''-th [[root of unity|roots of unity]],&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., ''Harmonia mensurarum'' … (Cambridge, England:  1722), chapter:  "Theoremata tum logometrica tum triogonometrica datarum fluxionum fluentes exhibentia, per methodum mensurarum ulterius extensam" (Theorems, some logorithmic, some trigonometric, which yield the fluents of given fluxions by the method of measures further developed), [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6BGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 113-114.]&lt;/ref&gt; foresaw the method of [[least squares]],&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., ''Harmonia mensurarum'' … (Cambridge, England:  1722), chapter:  "Aestimatio errorum in mixta mathesis per variationes partium trianguli plani et sphaerici" Harmonia mensurarum ... , pages 1-22, see especially [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6BGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 22.]  From page 22:  ''"Sit p locus Objecti alicujus ex Observatione prima definitus, … ejus loco tutissime haberi potest."''

An excerpt from the letter which discusses the method was published in:  [Anon.] (1722), Book review:  "An account of a book, intitled, ''Harmonia Mensurarum'', … ," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''32''' : 139-150 ; see [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324350998;view=2up;seq=166 pages 146-148.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also praised for his efforts in numerical methods, especially in [[interpolation]] methods and his table construction techniques.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; He was regarded as one of the few British mathematicians capable of following the powerful work of Sir Isaac Newton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Death and assessment==
Cotes died from a violent fever in [[Cambridge]] in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, "If he had lived we would have known something."&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">A '''signomial''' is an algebraic [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one or more independent variables.  It is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of multi-dimensional [[polynomial]]s—an extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers (rather than just non-negative integers) while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive (so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered).

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector of real, positive numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n)^T&lt;/math&gt;

Then a signomial function has the form

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^M \left(c_i \prod_{j=1}^n x_j^{a_{ij}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; and the exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers.  Signomials are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scaling.

If we restrict all &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to be positive, then the function f is a [[posynomial]]. Consequently, each signomial is either a posynomial, the negative of a posynomial, or the difference of two posynomials.  If, in addition, all exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are  non-negative integers, then the signomial becomes a [[polynomial]] whose domain is the positive [[orthant]].

For example, 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2.7 x_1^2x_2^{-1/3}x_3^{0.7} - 2x_1^{-4}x_3^{2/5}&lt;/math&gt;

is a signomial. 

The term "signomial" was introduced by Richard J. Duffin and Elmor L. Peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic optimization—published in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  A recent introductory exposition involves [[optimization problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Maranas and C. Floudas, ''Global optimization in generalized geometric programming'', pp. 351–370, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[nonlinear optimization]] problems with [[constrained optimization|constraints]] and/or [[objective function|objectives]] defined by signomials are normally harder to solve than those defined by only posynomials (because, unlike posynomials, signomials are not guaranteed to be [[convex set|globally convex]]), signomial  optimization problems often provide a much more accurate mathematical representation of real-world nonlinear optimization problems.

'''''Twisted: The Distorted Mathematics of Greenhouse Denial''''' is a 2007 book by [[Ian G. Enting]], who is the Professorial Research Fellow in the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematics and Statistics of Complex Systems ([[MASCOS]]) based at the [[University of Melbourne]].

The book analyses the arguments of [[greenhouse sceptics]] and the use and presentation of statistics.  Enting contends there are contradictions in the various arguments of the [[climate change sceptics]].

The author also presents calculations of the actual emission levels that would be required to stabilise CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. This is an update of calculations that he contributed to the pre-[[Kyoto]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] report on Radiative Forcing of Climate.

{{Distinguish|class (computer programming)}}

In [[computer science]], a '''type class''' is a [[type system]] construct that supports [[ad hoc polymorphism]]. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in [[parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]] types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and a [[type variable]] &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and means that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.

Type classes first appeared in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell programming language]],&lt;ref&gt;"Type classes, first proposed during the design of the Haskell programming language, ..." —[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jmorri14/pubs/morris-dissertation.pdf John Garrett Morris (2013), "Type Classes and Instance Chains: A Relational Approach" ]&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally conceived as a way of implementing [[operator overloading|overloaded arithmetic and equality operators]] in a principled fashion.&lt;ref name="kaes88parametric"&gt;{{cite conference

In contrast with the "eqtypes" of [[Standard ML]], overloading the equality operator through the use of type classes in Haskell does not require extensive modification of the compiler frontend or the underlying type system.&lt;ref name="appel91standard"&gt;{{cite conference

Since their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.

== Overview ==
The programmer defines a type class by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
  (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has [[Kind (type theory)|kind]] &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (also known as &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; in the latest [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] release),&lt;ref&gt;[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Data-Kind.html#t:Type &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;] from &lt;code&gt;Data.Kind&lt;/code&gt; appeared in version 8 of the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the kind of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
Eq :: Type -&gt; Constraint
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The declaration may be read as stating a "type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; belongs to type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; if there are functions named &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;(/=)&lt;/code&gt;, of the appropriate types, defined on it." A programmer could then define a function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; (which determines if an element is in a list) in the following way:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
elem :: Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
elem y []     = False
elem y (x:xs) = (x == y) || elem y xs
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; with the context &lt;code&gt;Eq a&lt;/code&gt;, which constrains the types which &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can range over to those &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; which belong to the &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; type class. (''Note'': Haskell &lt;code&gt; =&gt; &lt;/code&gt; can be called a 'class constraint'.)

A programmer can make any type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; a member of a given type class &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; by using an ''instance declaration'' that defines implementations of all of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;'s methods for the particular type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.  For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, they may then make this new type an instance of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; by providing an equality function over values of type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; in whatever way they see fit.  Once they have done this, they may use the function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;[t]&lt;/code&gt;, that is, lists of elements of type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that type classes are different from [[Class (computer science)|classes]] in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is not a type: there is no such thing as a ''value'' of type &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;.

Type classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type &lt;code&gt;a -&amp;gt; [a] -&amp;gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; were it not for the type class constraint "&lt;code&gt;Eq a =&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;".

== Higher-kinded polymorphism ==
A type class need not take a type variable of [[Kind (type theory)|kind]] &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, rather than data constructors such as &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;). An example is the [[monad (functional programming)|&lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt;]] class:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
class Monad m where
  return :: a -&gt; m a
  (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind &lt;code&gt;Type -&gt; Type&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type, the kind of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; is thus:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
Monad :: (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Multi-parameter type classes ==
Type classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Haskell']] page ''[http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/MultiParamTypeClasses MultiParamTypeClasses]''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] standard library, the class &lt;code&gt;IArray&lt;/code&gt; expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint &lt;code&gt;IArray a e&lt;/code&gt; means that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an array type that contains elements of type &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement [[Object type (object-oriented programming)#Unboxing|unboxed]] array types, for example.)

Like [[multimethod]]s{{Citation needed|reason=Multimethod like lisp's one are evaluated at runtime, and haskell check types at compile time. Also, there is a thread on haskell mailing list (http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2007-August/030097.html) which seams to show that implementing static multimethod needs universal types.|date=June 2013}}, multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types. &lt;!--They are more efficient than multimethods{{Citation needed|reason=This is a bold claim of specific implementations made without evidence. A multimethod implementation could cache the method implementation in much the same way as the proposed "method to call is stored in a dictionary" and avoid a search. It might also be using tracing JIT compilation to achieve even greater efficiency, though this technique could of course also apply to a type class. At best, any performance advantage here seems dependent on particular implementations, rather than being fundamental to the approach, and thus not particularly noteworthy. Type classes are an excellent concept – they have no need for inflated claims to justify them.|date=January 2017}} because they do not involve--&gt; Multi-parameter type classes do not require searching for the method to call on every call at runtime;&lt;ref&gt;In GHC, the C Core uses Girard &amp; Reynold's System F type signatures to identify a typed case for processing in the optimization phases. -- Simon Peyton-Jones "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg Into the Core - Squeezing Haskell into Nine Constructors"] Erlang User Conference, Sep 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|minute 25:12}} rather the method to call is first compiled and stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single-parameter type classes.

Haskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard.&lt;!-- outdated sentence, as Haskell 98 is not the most recent standard. --&gt; The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and [[Hugs]], support multi-parameter type classes.

== Functional dependencies ==
In Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters&amp;mdash;a concept [[functional dependency|inspired from relational database theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones. ''[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/fundeps.html Type Classes with Functional Dependencies]''. From Proc. 9th European Symposium on Programming. March, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Haskell']] page ''[http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/FunctionalDependencies FunctionalDependencies]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, general [[Monads in functional programming|monads]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; which carry a state parameter of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; satisfy the type class constraint &lt;code&gt;MonadState s m&lt;/code&gt;. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency &lt;code&gt;m -&gt; s&lt;/code&gt;. This means that for a given monad, the state type accessible from this interface is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in [[type inference]], as well as aiding the programmer in [[type-directed programming]].

[[Simon Peyton-Jones]] has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/2006-February/000289.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type classes and implicit parameters ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}

Type classes and implicit parameters are very similar in nature, although not quite the same.  A polymorphic function with a type class constraint such as:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="hs"&gt;sum :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

can be intuitively treated as a function that implicitly accepts an instance of &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="hs"&gt;sum_ :: Num_ a -&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The instance &lt;code&gt;Num_ a&lt;/code&gt; is essentially a record that contains the instance definition of &lt;code&gt;Num a&lt;/code&gt;.  (This is in fact how type classes are implemented under the hood by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.)

However, there is a crucial difference: implicit parameters are more ''flexible'' – you can pass different instances of &lt;code&gt;Num Int&lt;/code&gt;.  In contrast, type classes enforce the so-called ''coherence'' property, which requires that there should only be one unique choice of instance for any given type.  The coherence property makes type classes somewhat antimodular, which is why orphan instances (instances that are defined in a module that neither contains the class nor the type of interest) are strongly discouraged.  On the other hand, coherence adds an additional level of safety to the language, providing the programmer a guarantee that two disjoint parts of the same code will share the same instance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIZxTQP1ifo Edward Kmett, ''Type Classes vs. the World'', Boston Haskell Meetup.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, an ordered [[set (abstract data type)|set]] (of type &lt;code&gt;Set a&lt;/code&gt;) requires a [[total order]]ing on the elements (of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;) in order to function.  This can be evidenced by a constraint &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt;, which defines a comparison operator on the elements.  However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order.  Since set algorithms are generally intolerant of changes in the ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt; to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes).  Thus, enforcing coherence of &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt; in this particular scenario is crucial.

Instances (or "dictionaries") in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] type classes are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity.&lt;ref name="scala-typeclasses"&gt;{{cite conference
 | first = Bruno 
 | last = Oliveira
 |author2=Adriaan Moors |author3=Martin Odersky
  | url = http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~bruno/papers/TypeClasses.pdf

As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters.

This is an example taken from the Cats &lt;ref&gt;[http://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html typelevel.org, Scala Cats]&lt;/ref&gt; documentation:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="scala"&gt;
// A type class to provide textual representation
trait Show[A] {
  def show(f: A): String
}

// A polymorphic function that works only when there is an implicit 
// instance of Show[A] available
def log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a))

// An instance for String
implicit val stringShow = new Show[String] {
  def show(s: String) = s
}

// The parameter stringShow was inserted by the compiler.
scala&gt; log("a string")
a string

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[Coq]] (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/TypeClassesTut/typeclassestut.pdf A Gentle Introduction to Type Classes and Relations in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent versions of [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] 2 also provide a similar feature, called "instance arguments".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=ReferenceManual.ModellingTypeClassesWithInstanceArguments Modelling Type Classes With Instance Arguments]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other approaches to operator overloading ==
In [[Standard ML]], the mechanism of "equality types" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler.  The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types.

SML's and [[OCaml]]'s modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for ''ad hoc'' polymorphism.&lt;ref name="dreyer06modular"&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Derek
 | last = Dreyer |author2=Robert Harper |author3=Manuel M.T. Chakravarty
 | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/751836.html
 | title = Modular Type Classes
 | booktitle = Technical Report TR-2006-03
 | date = April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The object oriented subset of [[OCaml]] is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.

== Related notions ==
An analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]]) is that of [[type family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Type_families&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] supports [[trait (computer programming)|traits]], which are a limited form of type classes with coherence.&lt;ref&gt;https://aturon.github.io/blog/2017/02/06/specialization-and-coherence/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] has typeclasses, although they are not exactly the same as in Haskell. {{Explain|date=May 2018}}

In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], type classes are a [[programming idiom]] which can be implemented with existing language features such as implicit parameters, not a separate language feature per se. Because of the way they are implemented in Scala, it is possible to explicitly specify which type class instance to use for a type at a particular place in the code, in case of ambiguity. However, this is not necessarily a benefit as ambiguous type class instances can be error-prone.

The proof assistant [[Coq (proof assistant)|Coq]] has also supported type classes in recent versions. Unlike in ordinary programming languages, in Coq, any laws of a type class (such as the monad laws) that are stated within the type class definition, must be mathematically proved of each type class instance before using them.

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''ultrafinitism''' (also known as '''ultraintuitionism''',&lt;ref name="LCC"&gt;International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity, ''Logic and Computational Complexity'', Springer, 1995, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; '''strict formalism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"&gt;St. Iwan (2000), "On the Untenability of Nelson's Predicativism", ''Erkenntnis'' '''53'''(1–2), pp. 147–154.&lt;/ref&gt; '''strict finitism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt; '''actualism''',&lt;ref name="LCC"/&gt; '''predicativism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Russell's [[predicativism]].&lt;/ref&gt; and '''strong finitism''')&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt; is a form of [[finitism]]. There are various philosophies of mathematics that are called ultrafinitism. A major identifying property common among most of these philosophies is their objections to [[total function|totality]] of number theoretic functions like [[exponentiation]] over [[natural number]]s.

==Main ideas==
Like other [[finitism|finitists]], ultrafinitists deny the existence of the [[infinite set]] '''N''' of [[natural numbers]].

In addition, some ultrafinitists are concerned with acceptance of objects in mathematics that no one can construct in practice because of physical restrictions in constructing large finite mathematical objects.
Thus some ultrafinitists will deny or refrain from accepting the existence of large numbers, for example, the [[floor function|floor]] of the first [[Skewes's number]], which is a huge number defined using the [[exponential function]] as exp(exp(exp(79))), or
: &lt;math&gt; e^{e^{e^{79}}}. &lt;/math&gt;
The reason is that nobody has yet calculated what [[natural number]] is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of this [[real number]], and it may not even be physically possible to do so. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; (in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]) would be considered only a formal expression which does not correspond to a natural number.  The brand of ultrafinitism concerned with physical realizability of mathematics is often called [[actualism]].

[[Edward Nelson]] criticized the classical conception of natural numbers because of the circularity of its definition. In classical mathematics the natural numbers are defined as 0 and numbers obtained by the iterative applications of the successor function to 0. But the concept of natural number is already assumed for the iteration. In other words, to obtain a number like &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; one needs to perform the successor function iteratively, in fact exactly &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; times to 0.

Some versions of ultrafinitism are forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]], but most constructivists view the philosophy as unworkably extreme.  The logical foundation of ultrafinitism is unclear; in his comprehensive survey ''Constructivism in Mathematics'' (1988), the constructive logician [[A. S. Troelstra]] dismissed it by saying "no satisfactory development exists at present." This was not so much a philosophical objection as it was an admission that, in a rigorous work of [[mathematical logic]], there was simply nothing precise enough to include.

== People associated with ultrafinitism ==
Serious work on ultrafinitism has been led, since 1959, by [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]], who in 1961 sketched a program for proving the consistency of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] in ultrafinite mathematics.  Other mathematicians who have worked in the topic include [[Doron Zeilberger]], [[Edward Nelson]], [[Rohit Jivanlal Parikh]], and [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]]. The philosophy is also sometimes associated with the beliefs of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Robin Gandy]], [[Petr Vopenka]], and [[J. Hjelmslev]].

[[Shaughan Lavine]] has developed a form of set-theoretical ultra-finitism that is consistent with classical mathematics.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/ |title=Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lavine has shown that the basic principles of arithmetic such as "there is no largest natural number" can be upheld, as Lavine allows for the inclusion of "indefinitely large" numbers.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

== Computational complexity theory based restrictions ==
Other considerations of the possibility of avoiding unwieldy large numbers can be based on [[computational complexity theory]], as in [[Andras Kornai]]'s work on explicit finitism (which does not deny the existence of large numbers)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713221118/http://kornai.com/Drafts/fathom_3.html "Relation to foundations"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Sazonov]]'s notion of [[feasible number]].

There has also been considerable formal development on versions of ultrafinitism that are based on complexity theory, like [[Samuel Buss]]'s [[Bounded Arithmetic]] theories, which capture mathematics associated with various complexity classes like [[P (complexity)|P]] and [[PSPACE]]. Buss's work can be considered the continuation of [[Edward Nelson]]'s work on [[predicative arithmetic]] as bounded arithmetic theories like S12 are interpretable in [[Raphael Robinson]]'s theory [[Robinson arithmetic|Q]] and therefore are predicative in [[Edward Nelson|Nelson]]'s sense.  The power of these theories for developing mathematics is studied in [[Bounded reverse mathematics]] as can be found in the works of [[Stephen A. Cook]] and [[Phuong The Nguyen]]. However these researches are not philosophies of mathematics but rather the study of restricted forms of reasoning similar to [[Reverse Mathematics]].

In various branches of [[mathematics]], a useful construction is often viewed as the “most efficient solution” to a certain problem.  The definition of a '''universal property''' uses the language of [[category theory]] to make this notion precise and to study it abstractly.

This article gives a general treatment of universal properties. To understand the concept, it is useful to study several examples first, of which there are many: all [[free object]]s, [[direct product]] and [[direct sum]], [[free group]], [[free lattice]], [[Grothendieck group]], [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]], [[product topology]], [[Stone–Čech compactification]], [[tensor product]], [[inverse limit]] and [[direct limit]], [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and [[cokernel]], [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]], [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] and [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]].

== Motivation ==

Before giving a formal definition of universal properties, we offer some motivation for studying such constructions.

* The concrete details of a given construction may be messy, but if the construction satisfies a universal property, one can forget all those details: all there is to know about the construct is already contained in the universal property. Proofs often become short and elegant if the universal property is used rather than the concrete details. For example, the [[tensor algebra]] of a [[vector space]] is slightly painful to actually construct, but using its universal property makes it much easier to deal with.
* Universal properties define objects uniquely up to a unique [[isomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), Proposition 1.6, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one strategy to prove that two objects are isomorphic is to show that they satisfy the same universal property.
* Universal constructions are functorial in nature: if one can carry out the construction for every object in a category ''C'' then one obtains a [[functor]] on ''C''. Furthermore, this functor is a [[adjoint functors|right or left adjoint]] to the functor ''U'' used in the definition of the universal property.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Polcino &amp; Sehgal (2002), p. 133. exercise 1, about the universal property of [[group ring]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Universal properties occur everywhere in mathematics. By understanding their abstract properties, one obtains information about all these constructions and can avoid repeating the same analysis for each individual instance.

==Formal definition==

Suppose that ''U'': ''D'' → ''C'' is a [[functor]] from a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''D'' to a category ''C'', and let ''X'' be an object of ''C''.  Consider the following [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] (opposite) notions:

{{anchor|Initial morphism}}
An '''initial morphism''' from ''X'' to ''U'' is an [[initial object]] in the [[Comma category|category &lt;math&gt;(X \downarrow U)&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from ''X'' to ''U'']].  In other words, it consists of a pair (''A'', ''Φ'') where ''A'' is an object of ''D'' and ''Φ'': ''X'' → ''U''(''A'') is a morphism in ''C'', such that the following '''initial property''' is satisfied:
*Whenever ''Y'' is an object of ''D'' and ''f'': ''X'' → ''U''(''Y'') is a morphism in ''C'', then there exists a ''unique'' morphism ''g'': ''A'' → ''Y'' such that the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
[[File:UniversalProperty-03.svg|center|An initial morphism from X to U|200px]]

{{anchor|Terminal morphism}}
A '''terminal morphism''' from ''U'' to ''X'' is a [[terminal object]] in the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;(U \downarrow X)&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from ''U'' to ''X''.  In other words, it consists of a pair (''A'', ''Φ'') where ''A'' is an object of ''D'' and ''Φ'': ''U''(''A'') → ''X'' is a morphism in ''C'', such that the following '''terminal property''' is satisfied:
*Whenever ''Y'' is an object of ''D'' and ''f'': ''U''(''Y'') → ''X'' is a morphism in ''C'', then there exists a ''unique'' morphism ''g'': ''Y'' → ''A'' such that the following diagram commutes:
[[File:UniversalProperty-04.svg|center|A terminal morphism from U to X|200px]]

The term '''universal morphism'''&lt;ref&gt;It is also called a universal arrow; for example in {{harv|Mac Lane|1998|loc=Ch. III, § 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers either to an initial morphism or a terminal morphism, and the term '''universal property''' refers either to an initial property or a terminal property.  In each definition, the existence of the morphism ''g'' intuitively expresses the fact that (''A'', ''Φ'') is "general enough", while the uniqueness of the morphism ensures that (''A'', ''Φ'') is "not too general".

==Duality==

Since the notions of ''initial'' and ''terminal'' are dual, it is often enough to discuss only one of them, and simply reverse arrows in ''C'' for the dual discussion.  Alternatively, the word ''universal'' is often used in place of both words.

Note: some authors may call only one of these constructions a ''universal morphism'' and the other one a ''co-universal morphism''. Which is which depends on the author, although in order to be consistent with the naming of [[Limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]] the latter construction should be named universal and the former couniversal. This article uses the unambiguous terminology of initial and terminal objects.

==Examples==

Below are a few examples, to highlight the general idea. The reader can construct numerous other examples by consulting the articles mentioned in the introduction.

===Tensor algebras===

Let ''C'' be the [[category of vector spaces]] '''''K''-Vect''' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' and let ''D'' be the category of [[algebra over a field|algebras]] '''''K''-Alg''' over ''K'' (assumed to be [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra|associative]]). Let
:''U'' : '''''K''-Alg''' &amp;rarr; '''''K''-Vect'''
be the [[forgetful functor]] which assigns to each algebra its underlying vector space.

Given any [[vector space]] ''V'' over ''K'' we can construct the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') of ''V''. The tensor algebra is characterized by the fact:
:“Any linear map from ''V'' to an algebra ''A'' can be uniquely extended to an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''T''(''V'') to ''A''.”
This statement is an initial property of the tensor algebra since it expresses the fact that the pair (''T''(''V''), ''i''), where ''i'' : ''V'' → ''U''(''T''(''V'')) is the inclusion map, is an initial morphism from the vector space ''V'' to the functor ''U''.

Since this construction works for any vector space ''V'', we conclude that ''T'' is a functor from '''''K''-Vect''' to '''''K''-Alg'''.  This means that ''T'' is ''left adjoint'' to the forgetful functor ''U'' (see the section below on [[#Relation to adjoint functors|relation to adjoint functors]]).

===Products===

A [[categorical product]] can be characterized by a terminal property. For concreteness, one may consider the [[Cartesian product]] in '''Set''', the [[direct product]] in '''Grp''', or the [[product topology]] in '''Top''', where products exist.

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be objects of a category ''D''. The product of ''X'' and ''Y'' is an object ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' together with two morphisms
:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X''
:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''
such that for any other object ''Z'' of ''D'' and morphisms ''f'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' and ''g'' : ''Z'' → ''Y'' there exists a unique morphism ''h'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' such that ''f'' = π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∘''h'' and ''g'' = π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∘''h''.

To understand this characterization as a terminal property we take the category ''C'' to be the [[product category]] ''D'' &amp;times; ''D'' and define the [[diagonal functor]]
:Δ : ''D'' &amp;rarr; ''D'' &amp;times; ''D''
by Δ(''X'') = (''X'', ''X'') and Δ(''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'') = (''f'', ''f''). Then (''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'', (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) is a terminal morphism from Δ to the object (''X'', ''Y'') of ''D'' &amp;times; ''D'': If (''f'', ''g'') is any morphism from (''Z'', ''Z'') to (''X'', ''Y''), then it must equal a morphism Δ(''h'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'') = (''h'', ''h'') from Δ(''Z'') = (''Z'', ''Z'') to Δ(''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'') = (''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'',''X'' &amp;times; ''Y''), followed by (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Limits and colimits===

Categorical products are a particular kind of [[limit (category theory)|limit]] in category theory. One can generalize the above example to arbitrary limits and colimits.

Let ''J'' and ''C'' be categories with ''J'' a [[small category|small]] [[index category]] and let ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; be the corresponding [[functor category]]. The ''[[diagonal functor]]''
:Δ : ''C'' → ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;
is the functor that maps each object ''N'' in ''C'' to the constant functor Δ(''N''): ''J'' → ''C'' to ''N'' (i.e. Δ(''N'')(''X'') = ''N'' for each ''X'' in ''J'').

Given a functor ''F'' : ''J'' → ''C'' (thought of as an object in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;), the ''limit'' of ''F'', if it exists, is nothing but a terminal morphism from Δ to ''F''. Dually, the ''colimit'' of ''F'' is an initial morphism from ''F'' to Δ.

==Properties==

===Existence and uniqueness===

Defining a quantity does not guarantee its existence. Given a functor ''U'' and an object ''X'' as above, there may or may not exist an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''U''.  If, however, an initial morphism (''A'', φ) does exist then it is essentially unique. Specifically, it is unique [[up to]] a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]]: if (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;) is another such pair, then there exists a unique isomorphism ''k'': ''A'' → ''A''&amp;prime; such that φ&amp;prime; = ''U''(''k'')φ. This is easily seen by substituting (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;) for (''Y'', ''f'') in the definition of the initial property.

It is the pair (''A'', φ) which is essentially unique in this fashion. The object ''A'' itself is only unique up to isomorphism. Indeed, if (''A'', φ) is an initial morphism and ''k'': ''A'' → ''A''&amp;prime; is any isomorphism then the pair (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;), where φ&amp;prime; = ''U''(''k'')φ, is also an initial morphism.

===Equivalent formulations===

The definition of a universal morphism can be rephrased in a variety of ways. Let ''U'' be a functor from ''D'' to ''C'', and let ''X'' be an object of ''C''. Then the following statements are equivalent:
* (''A'', φ) is an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''U''
* (''A'', φ) is an [[initial object]] of the [[comma category]] (''X'' ↓ ''U'')
* (''A'', φ) is a [[representable functor|representation]] of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''U''&amp;mdash;)

The dual statements are also equivalent:
* (''A'', φ) is a terminal morphism from ''U'' to ''X''
* (''A'', φ) is a [[terminal object]] of the comma category (''U'' ↓ ''X'')
* (''A'', φ) is a representation of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U''&amp;mdash;, ''X'')

===Relation to adjoint functors===

Suppose (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''U'' and (''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''U''. By the initial property, given any morphism ''h'': ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; there exists a unique morphism ''g'': ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that the following diagram commutes:
[[File:UniversalProperty-05.svg|center|200px]]

If ''every'' object ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'' admits an initial morphism to ''U'', then the assignment &lt;math&gt;X_i \mapsto A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h \mapsto g&lt;/math&gt; defines a functor ''V'' from ''C'' to ''D''. The maps φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then define a [[natural transformation]] from 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; (the identity functor on ''C'') to ''UV''. The functors (''V'', ''U'') are then a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s, with ''V'' left-adjoint to ''U'' and ''U'' right-adjoint to ''V''.

Similar statements apply to the dual situation of terminal morphisms from ''U''. If such morphisms exist for every ''X'' in ''C'' one obtains a functor ''V'': ''C'' → ''D'' which is right-adjoint to ''U'' (so ''U'' is left-adjoint to ''V'').

Indeed, all pairs of adjoint functors arise from universal constructions in this manner. Let ''F'' and ''G'' be a pair of adjoint functors with unit η and co-unit ε (see the article on [[adjoint functors]] for the definitions). Then we have a universal morphism for each object in ''C'' and ''D'':
*For each object ''X'' in ''C'', (''F''(''X''), η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''G''. That is, for all ''f'': ''X'' → ''G''(''Y'') there exists a unique ''g'': ''F''(''X'') → ''Y'' for which the following diagrams commute.
*For each object ''Y'' in ''D'', (''G''(''Y''), ε&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a terminal morphism from ''F'' to ''Y''. That is, for all ''g'': ''F''(''X'') → ''Y'' there exists a unique ''f'': ''X'' → ''G''(''Y'') for which the following diagrams commute.

[[File:AdjointFunctors2.svg|center|Universal properties of a pair of adjoint functors|300px]]

Universal constructions are more general than adjoint functor pairs: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of ''C'' (equivalently, every object of ''D'').

== History ==
Universal properties of various topological constructions were presented by [[Pierre Samuel]] in 1948. They were later used extensively by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]. The closely related concept of adjoint functors was introduced independently by [[Daniel Kan]] in 1958.

'''''Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays''''' (Academic Press, 1982) by [[Elwyn R. Berlekamp]], [[John H. Conway]], and [[Richard K. Guy]] is a compendium of information on [[mathematical games]].  It was first published in 1982 in two volumes.

The first volume introduces [[combinatorial game theory]] and its foundation in the [[surreal numbers]]; [[partizan game|partizan]] and [[impartial game]]s; [[Sprague–Grundy theory]] and [[misère game]]s. The second volume applies the theorems of the first volume to many games, including [[nim]], [[sprouts (game)|sprouts]], [[dots and boxes]], [[Sylver coinage]], [[philosopher's football]], [[fox and geese]]. A final section on puzzles analyzes the [[Soma cube]], [[Rubik's Cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's game of life]].

A republication of the work by A K Peters splits the content into four volumes.

[[File:Johann Martin Zacharias Dase Eduard Kaiser.jpg|thumb|200px|Zacharias Dase, by [[Eduard Kaiser]], 1850]]

'''Johann Martin Zacharias Dase''' (June 23, 1824, [[Hamburg]] – September 11, 1861, Hamburg) was a German [[mental calculator]].&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''Calculating Prodigies'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended schools in Hamburg from a very early age, but later admitted that his instruction had little influence on him. He used to spend a lot of time playing [[dominoes]], and suggested that this played a significant role in developing his calculating skills. Dase suffered from [[epilepsy]] from early childhood throughout his life.

At age 15 he began to travel extensively, giving exhibitions in Germany, Austria and England. Among his most impressive feats, he multiplied 79532853 &amp;times; 93758479 in 54 seconds. He multiplied two 20-digit numbers in 6 minutes; two 40-digit numbers in 40 minutes; and two 100-digit numbers in 8 hours 45 minutes. The famous mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] commented that   someone skilled in calculation could have done the 100-digit calculation in about half that time with pencil and paper.

These exhibitions however did not earn him enough money, so he tried to find other employments. In 1844 he obtained a position in the Railway Department of Vienna, but this didn't last long since in 1845 he was reported in Mannheim and in 1846 in Berlin.

In 1844, Dase calculated [[&amp;pi;]] to 200 decimal places over the course of approximately two months, a record for the time, from the [[Machin-like formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan \frac{1}{2} + \arctan \frac{1}{5} + \arctan \frac{1}{8}.&lt;/math&gt;

He also calculated a 7-digit [[logarithm table]] and extended a table of [[integer factorization]]s from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000.

Dase had very little knowledge of mathematical theory. The mathematician [[Julius Petersen]] tried to teach him some of [[Euclid]]'s theorems, but gave up the task once he realized that their comprehension was beyond Dase's capabilities.&lt;ref&gt; Preston, Richard, 2008, '''Panic in Level 4''', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gauss however was very impressed with his calculating skill, and he recommended that the ''Hamburg Academy of Sciences'' should allow Dase to do mathematical work on a full-time basis, but Dase died shortly thereafter.

The book "[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]" by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] mentions his calculating abilities. "... he also had an uncanny sense of quantity. That is, he could just 'tell', without counting, how many sheep were in a field, or words in a sentence, and so forth, up to about 30."
