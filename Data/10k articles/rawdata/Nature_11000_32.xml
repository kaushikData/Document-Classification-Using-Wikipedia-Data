'''{{mp|(471240) 2011 BT|15}}''', provisional designation {{mp|2011 BT|15}}, is a stony, sub-kilometer sized [[asteroid]] and [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It had been one of the objects with the highest [[Impact event|impact threat]] on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]].&lt;ref name="risk-table" /&gt;

== Discovery ==

It was discovered on 24 January 2011, by a team of astronomers at [[Pan-STARRS]], the ''Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System'' at [[Haleakala Observatory]] on Hawaii, United States. The discovery was made using a 1.8-meter [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope]]. At the time of discovery, the object had an [[apparent magnitude]] of 22.&lt;ref name="MPC-471240" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPEC2011-B43"/&gt;

== Orbit ==

Before the 2013 recovery it had an observation arc of 41 days with an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|uncertainty parameter]] of 7. Due to [[precovery]] images from 2007 it now has an observation arc of more than 5 years.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It makes close approaches to Earth and Mars.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;

On 28 December 2013, it passed {{convert |0.03222 |AU| km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt; The December 2013 passage was studied by the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone Deep Space Network]] and further refined the orbit.&lt;ref name="Goldstone-sch"/&gt;

=== Impact risk ===

While listed on the Sentry Risk Table, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed a 1 in 71,000 chance that the asteroid could [[Impact event|impact]] Earth on 5 January 2080.&lt;ref name="JPL-ImpactRisk" /&gt;

In 2013 it had the 5th highest [[Impact event|impact threat]] on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]].&lt;ref name="risk-table" /&gt; It was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 17 June 2013.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt;

With a 2080 [[Palermo Technical Scale]] of −3.58,&lt;ref name="JPL-ImpactRisk" /&gt; the odds of impact by {{mp|2011 BT|15}} in 2080 were about 3800 times less&lt;ref name=math /&gt; than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.&lt;ref name="palermo" /&gt; [[JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System|JPL Horizons]] shows that the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] pass will be on 17 January 2080 at a distance of {{convert|0.125|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=Horizons /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

This near-Earth object is characterized as a common, stony [[S-type asteroid]] by the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' (CALL).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Fast rotator ===

In January 2014, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2011 BT|15}} was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer [[Brian D. Warner|Brian Warner]] at the CS3-Palmer Divide Station ({{small|[[IAU code#U82|U82]]}}) in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined [[rotation period]] of 0.109138 hours (393 seconds) with a brightness amplitude of 0.61 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}).&lt;ref name="Warner-2014i" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the CALL and JPL's impact-risk table, this near-Earth object measures 136 and 150 meters, respectively.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JPL-ImpactRisk" /&gt; For its size estimate, CALL uses a standard for stony asteroids of 0.20 with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 21.7.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

As of 2017, this [[minor planet]] remains unnamed.&lt;ref name="MPC-471240" /&gt;

It was notable as the first such body to be observed and tracked prior to reaching Earth.&lt;ref name="Roylance2008" /&gt; The process of detecting and tracking a [[near-Earth object]], an effort sometimes referred to as [[Spaceguard]], was put to the test. In total, 586 astrometric and almost as many photometric observations were performed by 27 amateur and professional observers in less than 19 hours and reported to the [[Minor Planet Center]], which in eleven hours issued 25 Minor Planet Electronic Circulars with new orbit solutions as observations poured in. On October 7, 01:49 UTC,&lt;ref name="jplneo"/&gt; the asteroid entered the shadow of the Earth, which made further observations impossible.

Impact predictions were performed by [[University of Pisa]]'s CLOMON 2 semi-automatic monitoring system&lt;ref&gt;

Samples of the Almahata Sitta meteorite were sent for analysis to a consortium of researchers led by Jenniskens, the Almahata Sitta consortium, including [[NASA Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]] in [[California]], the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], and [[Fordham University]] in [[New York City]]. The first sample measured was an anomalous ultra-fine-grained porous [[Conglomerate (geology)|polymict]] [[ureilite]] [[achondrite]], with large [[Carbonaceous chondrite|carbonaceous grains]]. Reflectance spectra of the meteorite, combined with the astronomical observations, identified asteroid 2008 TC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as an [[F-type asteroid]] class. These fragile anomalous dark carbon-rich [[ureilite]]s are now firmly linked to the group of F-class asteroids.&lt;ref name="Jenniskens2009" /&gt; [[Amino acids]] have been found on the meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Amplitude adjusting''' (also referred to as '''Amplitude control''') enables the power control of electric loads, which are operated with AC voltage. A representative application is the heating control of industrial high temperature furnaces.

== Functionality ==

[[Image:Sinuslevel-gb.gif|300px|thumb|The sinus oscillation does not change.]]
Contrary to the conventional [[phase angle]] or [[full wave control]], 
during amplitude control only the [[Amplitude]] of the sinusoidal supply current is changed. The level of the amplitude only depends on the consumed power. The sinus oscillation does not change.

Because current and voltage are in phase, only real power is taken from the mains for amplitude control. So the current consumption from the mains is considerably lower than the current consumption in case of phase-angle operation.

== Advantages ==

The continuous current flow causes a mild operation of the used heater elements and consequently significant longer lifetimes are realized. Depending on the ambient conditions the lifetime can be twice as long. 

Especially the surface damage of the heater elements at thresholds can be reduced.

The amplitude control eliminates the [[flicker effect]]s and harmonics, as usual for Thyristor units, so that the standard specifications according to [[European Standard|EN]]&amp;nbsp;61000-3-2 and EN&amp;nbsp;61000-3-3 are observed.

[[Reactive power compensation]] is not required, reducing equipment costs.

== Applications ==

Sinus units or IGBT power converters for power control of:
* Resistance heatings
* [[Silicon carbide]] (SC) - heater elements
* [[Molybdenum disilicide]] (MoSi2) - heater elements
* Infralight radiators

== Literature ==

* Manfred Schleicher, Winfried Schneider: ''Electronic power units''.&lt;BR&gt; {{ISBN|3-935742-05-3}}, {{ISBN|978-3-935742-05-4}}  ([http://www.literaturfas620en.jumo.info/ Download as PDF])

'''Aurora''' ({{IPA-la|au̯ˈroːra|lang}}) is the [[Latin]] word for [[dawn]], and the [[goddess]] of dawn in [[Roman mythology]] and Latin poetry.
Like [[Greek mythology|Greek]] ''[[Eos]]'' and [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic]] ''[[Ushas]]'', ''Aurora'' continues the name of an earlier [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] dawn goddess, ''[[Hausos]]''.

==Roman mythology==
In [[Roman mythology]], Aurora renews herself every morning and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the sun. Her parentage was flexible: for [[Ovid]], she could equally be ''Pallantis'', signifying the daughter of [[Pallas (Titan)|Pallas]],&lt;ref&gt;"When Pallantis next gleams in heaven and stars flee..." (Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' iv. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; or the daughter of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fasti'' v.159; also [[Hyginus]], Preface to ''[[Fabulae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; She has two siblings, a brother ([[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the sun) and a sister ([[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the moon). Roman writers rarely imitated Hesiod and later Greek poets by naming Aurora as the mother of the [[Anemoi]] (the Winds), who were the offspring of [[Astraeus]], the father of the stars.

Aurora appears most often in sexual poetry with one of her mortal lovers. A myth taken from the Greek by Roman poets tells that one of her lovers was the prince of [[Troy]], [[Tithonus]]. Tithonus was a mortal, and would therefore age and die. Wanting to be with her lover for all eternity, Aurora asked [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to grant [[immortality]] to Tithonus. Jupiter granted her wish, but she failed to ask for eternal youth to accompany his immortality, and he became forever old.  Aurora turned him into a [[cicada]].

==Usage in literature and music==
[[Image:Aurora Taking Leave of Tithonus.jpg|thumb|''Aurora Taking Leave of [[Tithonus]]''&lt;br/&gt;1704, by [[Francesco Solimena]]]]
[[File:Guercino 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Aurora'', by [[Guercino]], 1621-23: the ceiling fresco in the [[Casino di Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi|Casino Ludovisi]], Rome, is a classic example of [[Baroque illusionistic painting]]]]
From [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'':
:''Now when [[Eos|Dawn]] in robe of [[saffron (color)|saffron]] was hastening from the streams of [[Oceanus|Okeanos]], to bring light to mortals and immortals, [[Thetis]] reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her.'' (19.1)

:''But soon as early Dawn appeared, the [[rose (color)|rosy]]-fingered, then gathered the folk about the [[pyre]] of glorious [[Hector]].'' (24.776)

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (I.i), Montague says of his lovesick son [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]]
:''But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
:''Should in the furthest east begin to draw
:''The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
:''Away from the light steals home my heavy son...

In traditional Irish folk songs, such as "Lord Courtown"
:"One day I was a-musing down by the Courtown banks
:"The sun shone bright and clearly, bold Neptune played a prank...
:"There was Flora at the helm and Aurora to the stern
:"And all their gallant fine seamen, their course for to steer on.

In "On Imagination," by Phillis Wheatley

:"From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise, 
:"Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,
:"While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies.

In the poem "Tithonus" by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], Aurora is described thus:
:''Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals
:''From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,''
:''And bosom beating with a heart renewed.''
:''Thy cheek begins to redden through the gloom,
:''Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,
:''Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team
:''Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,
:''And shake the darkness from their loosened manes,
:''And beat the twilight into flakes of a fire''&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Harris, ''Tennyson and personification: the rhetoric of 'Tithonus' '', 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In singer-songwriter [[Björk]]'s ''[[Vespertine]]'' track, Aurora is described as:
:''Aurora
:''Goddess sparkle
:''A mountain shade suggests your shape

:''I tumble down on my knees
:''Fill my mouth with snow
:''The way it melts
:''I wish to melt into you

The post-punk rock band [[The Sexual Side Effects]]'s track "Aurora" alludes to the goddess:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
:''Aurora
:''Save me from the fallen shadows
:''Pull me out of my dream
:''Aurora
:''Wade me through the phantom shallows
:''Shelter me from the screams

In Chapter 8 of [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', Madame Beck fires her old Governess first thing in the morning and is described by the narrator, Lucy Snowe: ''All this, I say, was done between the moment of Madame Beck's issuing like Aurora from her chamber, and that in which she coolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10980">[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|thumb|right|A [[retention pond]] for treatment of [[urban runoff]] (stormwater).]]
'''Best management practices''' ('''BMPs''') is a term used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe a type of [[water pollution]] control.  Historically the term has referred to auxiliary pollution controls in the fields of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] control and [[sewage treatment| municipal sewage]] control, while in [[stormwater]] management (both urban and rural) and [[wetland]] management, BMPs may refer to a principal control or treatment technique as well.

==Terminology==
Beginning in the 20th century, designers of industrial and municipal sewage pollution controls typically utilized [[sewage treatment|engineered systems]] (e.g. [[Trickling filter|filters]], [[clarifier]]s, [[Bioreactor|biological reactors]]) to provide the central components of pollution control systems, and used the term "BMPs" to describe the supporting functions for these systems, such as operator training and equipment maintenance.

'''Stormwater management,''' as a specialized area within the field of [[environmental engineering]], emerged later in the 20th century, and some practitioners have used the term '''BMP''' to describe both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. [[retention basin|retention ponds]]) to treat polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. minimizing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides). Other practitioners prefer to use the term '''Stormwater control measure''', due to the varied definitions of the term "BMP" and its use in non-stormwater practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/7 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=5. Stormwater Management Approaches |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Clean Water Act References to "BMP" ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] referred to '''BMP'''  in several sections of the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) but did not define the term.
*The 1977 CWA used the term in describing the areawide waste treatment planning program&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. Sections 208 (b), (i) and (j), {{USC|33|1288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in procedures for controlling [[toxic]] [[water pollution|pollutants]] associated with industrial discharges.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(e), {{USC|33|1314(e)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|"Section 404" program]], which covers dredge and fill permits, refers to BMPs in one of the enforcement exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 404(f), {{USC|33|1344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*References to stormwater BMPs first appear in the 1987 amendment to the CWA in describing the Nonpoint Source Management Demonstration Program.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. CWA sec. 319(a),(b),(h),(l), &amp; (m), {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another stormwater BMP reference was added in 2001 with the authorization for a Wet Weather Watershed Pilot Project program.&lt;ref&gt;Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000, December 21, 2000. Added by the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A–225), as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Pub.L. 106–554 (114 Stat. 2763). Amended CWA sec.121(a)(2), {{USC|33|1274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPA definitions ==
In implementing the CWA, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined '''BMP''' in the federal wastewater permit regulations, initially to refer to auxiliary procedures for industrial wastewater controls.  
:...schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States, BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|122|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the Agency added a reference to stormwater management BMPs.
:...each NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable... (k) Best management practices (BMPs)  to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: ... (2) Authorized under section 402(p) of the CWA for the control of storm water discharges...&lt;ref&gt;EPA. {{CodeFedReg|40|122|44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial wastewater BMPs ==
Industrial wastewater BMPs are considered an adjunct to engineered [[sewage treatment|treatment]] systems. Typical BMPs include operator training, maintenance practices, and spill control procedures for treatment chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite report |date=July 1994 |title=Best Management Practices and Spill Response: Guidance Document |url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f7457ac3-7967-49c9-94dd-7986cb6624da/resource/6b40c069-d846-4fa2-a98b-bfd060a7ab3a/download/best-management-practices-spill-response-guidance-document.pdf |publisher=Alberta Environmental Protection |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many BMPs available which are specific to particular industrial processes, for example:
* source reduction practices in metal finishing industries (e.g. substituting less toxic [[solvent]]s or using water-based cleaners);
* in the [[chemical industry]], capturing equipment washdown waters for recycle/reuse at various process stages;
* in the [[paper industry]], using [[process control]] monitoring to optimize [[bleaching]] processes, and reduce the overall amount of bleach used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1993 |title=Guidance Manual for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP) |chapter=Ch. 3. Industry-Specific Best Management Practices |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0274.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-B-93-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stormwater management BMPs ==
[[Stormwater]] management BMPs are control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[urban runoff]] caused through changes to [[land use]]. Generally BMPs focus on [[water quality]] problems caused by increased [[impervious surface]]s from [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/5 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=3. Hydrologic, Geomorphic, and Biological Effects of Urbanization on Watersheds |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs are designed to reduce stormwater volume, peak flows, and/or [[nonpoint source pollution]] through [[evapotranspiration]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[detention basin|detention]], and filtration or biological and chemical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Debo |first1=Thomas N. |last2=Reese |first2=Andrew J. |authorlink= |title=Municipal Stormwater Management |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=1-56670-584-3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs also can improve receiving-water quality by extending the duration of outflows in comparison to inflow duration (known as  hydrograph extension), which dilutes the stormwater discharged into a larger volume of upstream flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author-last1=Granato |author-first1=G.E. |date=2014 |title=Statistics for stochastic modeling of volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment by structural stormwater runoff best management practices (BMPs) |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5037/ |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |id=Scientific Investigations Report 2014–5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater BMPs can be classified as "structural" (i.e., devices installed or constructed on a site) or "non-structural" (procedures, such as modified landscaping practices or street sweeping). There are a variety of BMPs available; selection typically depends on site characteristics and pollutant removal objectives. EPA has published a series of stormwater BMP fact sheets for use by local governments, builders and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater |title=National Menu of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Stormwater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater management BMPs can be also categorized into four basic types:
# Storage practices: ponds; recovery; [[Green infrastructure|green infrastructure design]]. 
# Vegetative practices: [[Buffer zone|buffers]]; channels; [[green roof]]s; wetlands; functional art;{{explain|date=November 2018}} stormwater wetland park design; wetland park engineering &amp; design. 
# Filtration/Infiltration practices: filtering; [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; [[Rain garden|rain gardens]]; [[Permeable paving|porous pavement]]; civic infrastructure and design; functional stormwater design.

A '''bioassay''' is an analytical method to determine concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=W.

It is also used to assess the environmental impact and safety of new technologies and facilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Principle ==
Bioassay is a biochemical test to estimate the relative potency of a sample compound to a standard compound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"/&gt; Typical bioassay involves a ''stimulus'' (ex. drugs) applied to a ''subject'' (ex. animals, tissues, plants) and a ''response'' (ex. death) of the subject is triggered and measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The intensity of stimulus is varied by doses and depending on this intensity of stimulus, a change/response will be followed by a subject.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
The first uses of bioassay dates back to as early as the late 19th century, when the foundation of bioassays was laid down by a German physician, Paul Ehrlich.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He introduced the concept of standardization by the reactions of living matter.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Noordwijk|first=Jacobus|title=Bioassays in whole animals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0731708589800779|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|volume=7|issue=2|pages=139–145|doi=10.1016/0731-7085(89)80077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design and Analysis for Bioassays|last=Saha|first=G. M|date=29 November 2002|publisher=Indian Statistical Institute|year=|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=61–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bioassay on diphtheria antitoxin was the first bioassay to receive recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9682930|title=Analysis of foods and beverages : modern techniques|date=1984|publisher=Academic Press|others=Charalambous, George, 1922-1994.|isbn=0121691608|location=Orlando|oclc=9682930}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of bioassay was able to disocover that administration of gradually increasing dose of diphteria in animals stimulated production of antiserum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=F&amp;egrave;lix|last2=Rosich|first2=Laia|date=2008|title=The Contributions of Paul Ehrlich to Pharmacology: A Tribute on the Occasion of the Centenary of His Nobel Prize|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/149583|journal=Pharmacology|language=english|volume=82|issue=3|pages=171–179|doi=10.1159/000149583|issn=0031-7012|pmc=2790789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the early bioassays consisted of using animals to test carcinogenicity of chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beyer|first=L. A.|last2=Beck|first2=B. D.|last3=Lewandowski|first3=T. A.|date=2011-04-01|title=Historical perspective on the use of animal bioassays to predict carcinogenicity: Evolution in design and recognition of utility|url=https://doi.org/10.3109/10408444.2010.541222|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=321–338|doi=10.3109/10408444.2010.541222|issn=1040-8444}}&lt;/ref&gt; One well known example is a "canary in the coal mine" experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ei.cornell.edu/toxicology/bioassays/Uses.html|title=Environmental Inquiry - How Are Bioassays Used in the Real World?|website=ei.cornell.edu|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test for methane, miners would take methane-sensitive canaries to coal mines to ensure safe air. In 1915, [[Yamagiwa Katsusaburō|Yamaigiwa Katsusaburo]] and Koichi Ichikawa tested the carcinogenicity of coal tar using inner surface of rabbit's ears.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Through 1940s and 1960s, animal bioassay was primarily used to test for toxicity and safety of drugs, food additives and pesticides.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In late 1960s and 1970s, reliance on bioassay increased as the public concern for occupational and environmental hazards increased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While before this health risks of certain chemicals such as pesticide was tested in animal bioassay, it was still rare and testing was not seen often.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications ==

=== Direct assay ===
- The stimulus/standard sufficiently produces measurable and specific response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response must be clear, easily recognized, and directly measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantitative response ===
- The relationship between the dose and the response is first ascertained.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Then the dose corresponding to a given response is obtained from the relation for each preparation separately.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantal response ===
- The assay involves 'all or none' response (ex. life or death).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response is produced by threshold effect.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) ===
- quantitative analytical method that measures absorbance of color change from antigen-antibody reaction (ex. Direct, indirect, sandwich, competitive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Suleyman|title=A short history, principles, and types of ELISA, and our laboratory experience with peptide/protein analyses using ELISA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019697811500131X|journal=Peptides|volume=72|pages=4–15|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2015.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELISA is used to measure variety of substances in human body from cortisol levels for stress to glucose level for diabetes.

=== Home pregnancy test ===
Home pregnancy test involves ELISA to detect the increase of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897825792|title=Bioanalytical chemistry.|others=Manz, A.

A '''cable landing point''' is the location where a submarine or other underwater cable makes landfall.  The term is most often used for the landfall points of [[submarine communications cable|submarine telecommunications cables]] and [[submarine power cable]]s.  The landing will either be direct (in the case of a point-to-point cable system) or via a branch from a main cable using a [[submarine branching unit]]. The branch can be many kilometres long.

[[File:Submarine Landed in BD.JPG|thumb|200px|A landing point of [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] on [[Cox's Bazar]] in [[Bangladesh]]]]

==Selection criteria==

Cable landing points are usually carefully chosen to be in areas:

# that have little marine traffic to minimise the risk of cables being damaged by ship anchors and trawler operations;
# with gently sloping, sandy or silty sea-floors so that the cable can be buried to minimise the chance of damage;
# without strong currents that would uncover buried cables and potentially move cables.

Such locations are rare, and will usually be the shared landfall point for several cable systems. 

==Associated facilities==

Frequently, there will be a nearby cable landing station, or cable termination station, which may well be shared between multiple cable systems, but in some cases, the cable may be laid many miles inland before reaching its termination point.

A '''cable landing station''' may or may not be required, depending on whether, for example, the submarine cable requires power in order to provide power to submarine repeaters or amplifiers. The voltages applied to the cables can be high&amp;mdash;3,000 to 4,000 volts for a typical trans-Atlantic telecommunications cable system, and 1,000 volts for a cross-channel telecommunications cable system. Submarine power cables can operate at many kilovolts: for example, the [[Fenno-Skan]] power cable operates [[High-voltage direct current|at 400 kV DC]].

A '''cable termination station''' is the point at which the submarine cable connects into the land-based infrastructure or network. A cable termination station may be the same facility as the cable landing station, or may be many miles away. The termination station will usually be the point where high-capacity 'backhaul' land-based network connects to areas of high demand, which are usually centres of high population density, rather than the usually remote locations of cable landing points/landing stations/termination stations.  A good example of this is the [[Telstra Endeavour|Endeavour cable system]] which connects Australia to Hawaii. The cable landing point in Sydney is [[Tamarama, New South Wales|Tamarama Beach]], some distance from the cable termination station in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. 

For power cables the term cable termination station is not strictly determined. It is either the point where the underwater cable ends and where the overhead powerline starts or if the whole line is implemented as cable, the first cable sleeve on the land. However one can also say that the substation or HVDC static inverter plant, where the connection to the grid is made describe as cable termination station. However, this station can be far away from the coast.

'''Carding''' is a mechanical process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibres to produce a continuous web or [[sliver (textiles)|sliver]] suitable for subsequent processing.&lt;ref name="Yilmaz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Nasire Deniz|author2=Powell|year=2005|title=The Technology of Terry Towel production|journal=Journal of Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management|publisher=North Carolina Stare University|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://www.tx.ncsu.edu/jtatm/volume4issue4/Articles/Yilmaz/Yilmaz_full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by passing the fibers between differentially moving surfaces covered with card clothing. It breaks up locks and unorganised clumps of fibre and then aligns the individual fibers to be parallel with each other. In preparing wool fibre for spinning, carding is the step that comes after teasing.&lt;ref name=PWH&gt;{{cite web |title=Preparing Wool for Handspinning |url=http://www.lahottee.info/E_FiberPreparation.php |website=La Hottée |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the Latin ''carduus'' meaning thistle or [[Dipsacus|teasel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carding}}&lt;/ref&gt; as dried vegetable teasels were first used to comb the raw wool. 

==Overview==
These ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre: [[Cotton mill|Cotton]], [[Batting (material)|batting]], [[felt]], [[woollen]] or [[worsted]] yarn, etc. Carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different [[colour]]s. When blending, the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix. Commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Common to all carders is card clothing.  Card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded. The shape, length, diameter, and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used. A later version of the card clothing product developed during the latter half of the 19th century and found only on commercial carding machines, whereby a single piece of [[Serration|serrated]] wire was wrapped around a roller, became known as metallic card clothing.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Carding machines are known as cards. Fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning.

==History==
[[File:Dhunuri Cotton-Carder India 1774-1781.jpg|right|thumb|A "Cotton carder". An old engraving copied from artist [[Pierre Sonnerat]]'s 1782 illustration]]

Science historian [[Joseph Needham]] ascribes the invention of bow-instruments used in textile technology to India.&lt;ref name=Baber1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from India (2nd century CE).&lt;ref name=Baber1/&gt; These carding devices, called ''kaman'' (bow) and ''dhunaki'', would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string.&lt;ref name=Baber1/&gt;

At the turn of the eighteenth century, wool in England was being carded using pairs of hand cards, it was a two-stage process: 'working' with the cards opposed and 'stripping' where they are in parallel.{{sfn|Richards|1972|p=73}}

In 1748 [[Lewis Paul]] of [[Birmingham]], England, invented two hand driven carding machines. The first used a coat of wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals. This failed. On the second, a coat of wire slips was placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder.{{sfn|Richards|1972|p=73}}
[[Daniel Bourn]] obtained a similar patent in the same year, and probably used it in his spinning mill at [[Leominster]], but this burnt down in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] and [[Samuel Crompton]].  Arkwright's second patent (of 1775) for his carding machine was subsequently declared invalid (1785) because it lacked originality.&lt;ref&gt;

From the 1780s, the carding machines were set up in mills in the north of England and mid-Wales. Priority was given to cotton but woollen fibres were being carded in Yorkshire in 1780. With woollen, two carding machines were used: the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres, the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web.{{sfn|Richards|1972|p=74}}  The first in Wales was in a factory at [[Dolobran]] near [[Meifod]] in 1789.  These carding mills produced yarn particularly for the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[flannel]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1838, the [[River Spen|Spen Valley]], centred on [[Cleckheaton]] had at least 11 card clothing factories and by 1893, it was generally accepted as the card cloth capital of the world, though by 2008 only two manufacturers of metallic and flexible card clothing remained in England, Garnett Wire Ltd. dating back to 1851 and Joseph Sellers &amp; Son Ltd established in 1840.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Baird from Scotland took carding to [[Leicester, Massachusetts]] in the 1780s. In the 1890s, the town produced one-third of all hand and machine cards in North America.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} John and Arthur Slater, from Saddleworth went over to work with Slater in 1793.{{sfn|Richards|1972|p=74}}

A 1780s scribbling mill would be driven by a water wheel. There were 170 scribbling mills around Leeds at that time. Each scribbler would require {{convert|15 |-|45|hp}} to operate. Modern machines are driven by belting from an electric motor or an overhead shaft via two pulleys.{{sfn|Richards|1972|p=74}}

'''Carding''': the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand ([[sliver (textiles)|sliver]] or [[tow]]) at the conclusion of this stage.
::''The cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres&lt;!--presumably English sp, from the British publisher, in quotation--&gt; nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered with small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=66,67}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of willowing, lapping, carding and drawing. In '''willowing''' the fibers are loosened. In '''lapping'''  the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres; '''Carding''' itself is the combing of the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, it can then be optionally combed, is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn.

[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Pentinadora.jpg|thumb|upright|A Combing machine]]
In '''drawing''' a '''drawing frame''' combines 4 slivers into one. Repeated drawing increases the quality of the sliver allowing for finer counts to be spun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each sliver will have thin and thick spots, and by combining several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. Since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres, directly after being combined the slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. The rovings are collected in a drum and proceed to the '''slubbing frame''' which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. '''Intermediate Frames''' are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the '''roving frames''' reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carders used currently in woollen mills differ very little from machines used 20 to 50 years ago, and in some cases, the machines are from that era.

Machine carders vary in size from the one that easily fits on the kitchen table, to the carder that takes up a full room [http://frysingerreunion.org/1/new_england/sturbridge47.jpg].

A carder that takes up a full room works very similarly, the main difference being that the fibre goes through many more drums often with intervening cross laying to even out the load on the subsequent cards, which normally get finer as the fibre progresses through the system.

When the fibre comes off the drum, it is in the form of a bat – a flat, orderly mass of fibres. If a small drum carder is being used, the bat is the length of the circumference of the big drum and is often the finished product. A big drum carder, though, will then take that bat and turn it into roving, by stretching it thinner and thinner, until it is the desired thickness (often rovings are the thickness of a wrist). (A rolag differs from a roving because it is not a continuous strand, and because the fibres end up going across instead of along the strand.) Cotton fibres are fed into the machine, picked up and brushed onto flats when carded.

Some hand-spinners have a small drum carder at home especially for the purpose of mixing together the different coloured fibre that are bought already carded.

==Hand carding==
Predating mechanised weaving, [[Weaving#The role of the weaver| hand loom weaving]] was a cottage industry that used the same processes but on a smaller scale. These skills have survived as an artisan craft in less developed societies- and as [[Weaving#Craft Weavers|art form and hobby]] in advanced societies.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, Volume 1 | isbn = 978-0-19-518948-3 | first = Gordon | last = Campbell | publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hand carders===
[[File:Rolag.jpg|thumb|300px|Creating a [[rolag]] using hand cards]]
[[File:Rhof-kardierenSpinnenStricken.ogv|200px|thumb|Irreler Bauerntradition shows carding, spinning and knitting in the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]].]]
Hand cards are typically square or rectangular paddles manufactured in a variety of sizes from {{convert|2|x|2|in|cm}} to {{convert|4|x|8|in|cm}}. The working face of each paddle can be flat or cylindrically curved and wears the card cloth. Small cards, called flick cards, are used to flick the ends of a lock of fibre, or to tease out some strands for spinning off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matherne|first=Patrick|title=What is Carding|url=http://www.fromsheeptoshawl.com/2012/fiber/what-is-carding/|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pair of cards is used to brush the wool between them until the fibres are more or less aligned in the same direction. The aligned fibre is then peeled from the card as a [[rolag]]. Carding is an activity normally done outside or over a drop cloth, depending on the wool's cleanliness. Rolag is peeled from the card.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} &lt;!-- If the wool contains a lot of vegetable matter, much of it will fall out during the carding process, which is the reason for a drop cloth. If the carding is being done to mix two pre-carded fibers, a drop cloth is not generally necessary.

To card, the person carding sits with a card in each hand. The card in the non-dominant hand (left for most people) rests on a leg. A small amount of fiber is placed on this card and the other card is pulled through the fibre. The moving card separates, straightens, and aligns the fibres. Vegetable matter falls out as the fibres are aligned. Catching too many fibres makes it hard to pull the cards apart. This step, repeated many times, transfers small amounts of the wool to the moving card. Once all the wool has been transferred, the cards are swapped hand-for-hand and the process repeated until all of the fibre is sufficiently aligned and satisfactorily free of debris at which time a rolag is peeled from the card.--&gt;
[[File:Quilt making 04.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A carding machine in [[Haikou]], Hainan Province, China]]
This product (rovings, rolags, and batts) can be used for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]].

Carding of wool can either be done "in the grease" or not, depending on the type of machine and on the spinner's preference. "In the grease" means that the [[lanolin]] that naturally comes with the wool has not been washed out, leaving the wool with a slightly greasy feel. The large drum carders do not tend to get along well with lanolin, so most commercial worsted and woollen mills wash the wool before carding. Hand carders (and small drum carders too, though the directions may not recommend it) can be used to card lanolin rich wool.
===Drum carders===
[[File:Carding llama hair.jpg|thumb|200px|Carding [[Llama]] hair with a hand-cranked drum carder]]

The simplest machine carder is the drum carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked but some are powered by an electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with card clothing. The licker-in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in.  This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum's card cloth. Fibre is added until the storage drum's card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.

Some drum carders have a soft-bristled brush attachment that presses the fibre into the storage drum. This attachment serves to condense the fibres already in the card cloth and adds a small amount of additional straightening to the condensed fibre.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card. These carders do not store fibre in the card cloth as the drum carder does but, rather, fibre passes through the workings of the carder for storage or for additional processing by other machines.

A typical cottage carder has a single large drum (the swift) accompanied by a pair of in-feed rollers (nippers), one or more pairs of worker and stripper rollers, a fancy, and a [[Doffing cylinder|doffer]]. In-feed to the carder is usually accomplished by hand or by conveyor belt and often the output of the cottage carder is stored as a batt or further processed into [[roving]] and wound into bumps with an accessory bump winder. The cottage carder in the [[:Image:Pat Green Jumbo Exotic Carder.jpg|image below]] supports both outputs.

Raw fibre, placed on the in-feed table or conveyor is moved to the nippers which restrain and meter the fiber onto the swift. As they are transferred to the swift, many of the fibres are straightened and laid into the swift's card cloth. These fibres will be carried past the worker / stripper rollers to the fancy.

As the swift carries the fibres forward, from the nippers, those fibres that are not yet straightened are picked up by a worker and carried over the top to its paired stripper. Relative to the surface speed of the swift, the worker turns quite slowly. This has the effect of reversing the fibre. The stripper, which turns at a higher speed than the worker, pulls fibres from the worker and passes them to the swift. The stripper's relative surface speed is slower than the swift's so the swift pulls the fibres from the stripper for additional straightening.

Straightened fibres are carried by the swift to the fancy. The fancy's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer. The fancy and the swift are the only rollers in the carding process that actually touch.

The slowly turning doffer removes the fibres from the swift and carries them to the fly comb where they are stripped from the doffer. A fine web of more or less parallel fibre, a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder's rollers, exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''Communal roosting''' is an animal behavior where a group of individuals, typically of the same species, congregate in an area for a few hours based on an external signal and will return to the same site with the reappearance of the signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communal life: Honest signaling and the recruitment center hypothesis|last = Richner|first = Heinz|date = March 1996|journal = Behavioral Ecology|doi = 10.1093/beheco/7.1.115|pmid = |last2 = Heeb|first2 = Phillip |volume=7 |pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental signals are often responsible for this grouping, including nightfall, high tide, or rainfall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The distinction between communal roosting and [[cooperative breeding]] is the absence of chicks in communal roosts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While communal roosting is generally observed in birds, the behavior has also been seen in bats, primates, and insects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The evolution of communal roosting in birds: origin and secondary losses|last = Beauchamp|first = Guy|date = 1999|journal = Behavioral Ecology|doi = 10.1093/beheco/10.6.675|pmid = |volume=10|issue = 6|pages=675–687}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of these roosts can measure in the thousands to millions of individuals, especially among avian species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ornitologia.org/mm/file/queoferim/divulgacio/publicacions/rco/28_28_33.pdf|title = The use of digital photography in censuses of large concentrations of passerines: the case of a winter starling roost-site|last = Pérez-García|first = Juan|date = 2012|journal = Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many benefits associated with communal roosting including: increased [[foraging]] ability, decreased [[Endotherm|thermoregulatory demands]], decreased [[predation]], and increased [[Biological specificity#Conspecific|conspecific]] interactions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Year-round used large communal roosts of Black-billed Magpie Pica pica in an urban habitat|last = Ientile|first = Renzo|date = 2014|journal = Avocetta|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many proposed evolutionary concepts for how communal roosting evolved, no specific hypothesis is currently supported by the scientific community as a whole.

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Information centre hypothesis}}
One of the adaptive explanations for communal roosting is the hypothesis that individuals are benefited by the exchange of information at communal roosts. This idea is known as the  [[information center hypothesis]] (ICH)  and proposed by Peter Ward and [[Amotz Zahavi]] in 1973 states that bird assemblages such as communal roosts act as information hubs for distributing knowledge about food source location. When food patch knowledge is unevenly distributed amongst certain flock members, the other "clueless" flock members can follow and join these knowledgeable members to find good feeding locations. To quote Ward and Zahavi on the evolutionary reasons as to how communal roosts came about, "...communal roosts, breeding  colonies and certain other bird assemblages have been evolved primarily for the efficient exploitation of  unevenly-distributed  food sources by  serving as ' information-centres.' "&lt;ref name="WZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Peter|last2=Zahavi|first2=Amotz|year=1973|title=The importance of certain assemblages of birds as "Information -Centres" for food finding|url=|journal=Ibis|volume=115|issue=4|pages=517–534|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919x.1973.tb01990.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The two strategies hypothesis ===
[[File:Communal Roosting Under the Two Strategies Hypothesis.png|thumb|A stylized example of a communal roost under the two strategies hypothesis, with the more dominant individuals occupying the higher and safer roosts.]]The two strategies hypothesis was put forth by Patrick Weatherhead in 1983 as an alternative to the then popular information center hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that different individuals join and participate in communal roosts for different reasons that are based primarily on their social status. Unlike the ICH, not all individuals will join a roost in order to increase their foraging capabilities. This hypothesis explains that while roosts initially evolved due to information sharing among older and more experienced foragers, this evolution was aided by the benefits that more experienced foragers gained due to the fact that as better forages they acquired a status of high rank within the roost. As dominant individuals, they are able to obtain the safest roosts, typically those highest in the tree or closest to the center of the roost. In these roosts, the less dominant and unsuccessful foragers act as a physical predation buffer for the dominant individuals. This is similar to the [[selfish herd theory]], which states that individuals within herds will utilize conspecifics as physical barriers from predation. The younger and less dominant individuals will still join the roost because they gain some safety from predation through the [[Anti-predator adaptation|dilution effect]], as well as the ability to learn from the more experienced foragers that are already in the roost.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2461125|title = Two Principal Strategies in Avian Communal Roosts|last = Weatherhead|first = Patrick|date = February 1983|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/284053|pmid = |pages =237–247|volume=121|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the two strategies hypothesis has been shown in studies of roosting rooks (''[[Rook (bird)|Corvus frugilegus]]''). A 1977 study of roosting rooks by Ian Swingland showed that an inherent hierarchy exists within rook communal roosts. In this hierarchy, the most dominant individuals have been shown to routinely occupy the roosts highest in the tree, and while they pay a cost (increased energy use to keep warm) they are safer from terrestrial predators.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social and spatial organization of winter communal roosting in Rooks (Corvus frugilegus)|last = Swingland|first = Ian R.|date = August 1977|journal = Journal of Zoology|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04167.x|pmid = |pages =509–528|volume=182|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this enforced hierarchy, lower ranking rooks remained with the roost, indicating that they still received some benefit from their participation in the roost.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt; When weather conditions worsened, the more dominant rooks forced the younger and less dominant out of their roosts. Swingland proposed that the risk of predation at lower roosts was outweighed by the gains in reduced thermal demands.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Similar support for the two strategies hypothesis has also been found in red-winged blackbird roosts. In this species the more dominant males will regularly inhabit roosts in thicker brush, where they are better hidden from predators than the less dominant individuals, that are forced to roost at the edge of the brush.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherhead, Patrick J., and Drew J. Hoysak. "Dominance structuring of a red-winged blackbird roost." ''The Auk'' (1984): 551-555.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TSH makes several assumptions that must be met in order for the theory to work. The first major assumption is that within communal roosts there are certain roosts that possess safer or more beneficial qualities than other roosts. The second assumption is that the more dominant individuals will be capable of securing these roosts, and finally dominance rank must be a reliable indicator of foraging ability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The recruitment center hypothesis (RCH) ===
Proposed by Heinz Richner and Phillip Heeb in 1996, the recruitment center hypothesis (RCH) explains the evolution of communal roosting as a result of [[Foraging|group foraging]]. The RCH also explains behaviors seen at communal roosts such as: the passing of information, aerial displays, and the presence or lack of calls by leaders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This hypothesis assumes:
* Patchy feeding area: Food is not evenly distributed across an area but grouped into patches
* Short-lasting: Patches are not present for an extended period of time
* Relatively abundant: There are many patches with relatively equal amounts of food present in each&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
These factors decrease relative food competition since control over a food source by an individual is not correlated to the duration or richness of said source.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The passing of information acts to create a foraging group. Group foraging decreases predation and increases relative feeding time at the cost of sharing a food source. The decrease in predation is due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation|dilution factor]] and an early warning system created by having multiple animals alert. Increases in relative feeding are explained by decreasing time spent watching for predators and social learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recruiting new members to food patches benefits successful foragers by increasing relative numbers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the addition of new members to a group the benefits of group foraging increase until the group size is larger than the food source is able to support. Less successful foragers benefit by gaining knowledge of where food sources are located.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aerial displays are used to recruit individuals to participate in group foraging. However, not all birds display since not all birds are members in a group or are part of a group that is seeking participants. In the presence of patchy resources, Richner and Heeb propose the simplest manner would be to form a communal roost and recruit participants there.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, recruitment to foraging groups explains the presence of these communal roosts.

Support for the RCH has been shown in ravens (''[[Raven|Covus corax]]''). Reviewing a previous study by [[John Marzluff]], Bernd Heinrich, and Colleen Marzluff, Etienne Danchin and Heinz Richner demonstrate that the collected data proves the RCH instead of the Information Center Hypothesis supported by Marzluff, et al. Both knowledgeable and naïve ("clueless") birds are shown to make up the roosts and leave them at the same time, with the naïve birds being led to the food sources. Aerial demonstrations were shown to peak around the same time as the discovery of a new food source.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237135235|title = Viable and unviable hypotheses for the evolution of raven roosts|last = Danchin|first = Etienne|date = 2001|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Richner|first2 = Heinz|volume = 61|pages=F7–F11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities were made up of non-breeders which forage in patchily distributed food environments, following the assumptions made by Richner and Heeb.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At this point in time there has been no additional scientific evidence excluding RCH or any evidence of overwhelming support. What is overlooked by RCH is that information may also be passed within the communal roost which increases and solidifies the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can information sharing explain recruitment to food from communal roosts?|url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/42|journal = Behavioral Ecology|date = 2002-01-01|issn = 1045-2249|pages = 42–51|volume = 13|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/beheco/13.1.42|first = Sasha R. X.|last = Dall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==

Birds in a communal roost can reduce the impact of wind and cold weather by sharing body heat through huddling, which reduces the overall energy demand of thermoregulation. A study by Guy Beauchamp explained that black-billed magpies (''[[Black-billed magpie|Pica hudsonia]]'') often formed the largest roosts during the winter. The magpies tend to react very slowly at low body temperatures, leaving them vulnerable to predators. Communal roosting in this case would improve their reactivity by sharing body heat, allowing them to detect and respond to predators much more quickly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A large roost with many members can visually detect predators easier, allowing individuals to respond and alert others quicker to threats.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individual risk is also lowered due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation#Dilution effect|dilution effect]], which states that an individual in a large group will have a low probability of being preyed upon. Similar to the [[Selfish herd theory|selfish-herd theory]], communal roosts have demonstrated a hierarchy of sorts where older members and better foragers nest in the interior of the group, decreasing their exposure to predators. Younger birds and less able foragers located on the outskirts still demonstrate some safety from predation due to the dilution effect.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

According to the ICH, successful foragers share knowledge of favorable foraging sites with unsuccessful foragers at a communal roost, making it energetically advantageous for individuals to communally roost and forage more easily. Additionally with a greater number of individuals at a roost, the searching range of a roost will increase and improve the probability of finding favorable foraging sites.&lt;ref name="WZ" /&gt;

There are also potentially improved mating opportunities, as demonstrated by red-billed choughs (''[[Red-billed chough|Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax]])'', which have a portion of a communal roost dedicated to individuals that lack mates and territories.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;

== Potential costs ==

It is costly for territorial species to physically travel to and from roosts, and in leaving their territories they open themselves up to takeovers. Communal roosts may draw the attention of potential predators, as the roost becomes audibly and visibly more conspicuous due to the number of members. There is also a decrease in the local food supply as a greater number of members results in competition for food.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A large number of roost members can also increases the exposure to droppings, causing plumage to deteriorate and leaving birds vulnerable to dying from exposure as droppings reduce the ability of feathers to shed water.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

[[File:Corvus frugilegus sundown.JPG|thumb|203x203px|Rooks forming a nocturnal roost in Hungary]]
[[File:Djocoe oujheas ås vatches ciprès did lon.jpg|thumb|Western Cattle Egret night roosting in Morocco]]Communal roosting has been observed in numerous avian species. As previously mentioned, rooks (''[[Rook (bird)|Corvus frugilegus]]'') are known to form large nocturnal roosts, these roosts can contain anywhere from a few hundred to over a thousand individuals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coombs | first1 = C.

Studies have shown that communal roosting behavior is mediated by light intensity, which is correlated with sunset, where rooks will return to the roost when the ambient light has sufficiently dimmed.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swingland | first1 = Ian R | year = 1976 | title = The influence of light intensity on the roosting times of the Rook (Corvus frugilegus) | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(76)80109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acorn woodpeckers (''[[Acorn woodpecker|Melanerpes formicivorus]]'') are known to form communal roosts during the winter months. In these roosts two to three individuals will share a cavity during the winter. Within these tree cavities woodpeckers share their body heat with each other and therefore decrease the thermoregulatory demands on the individuals within the roost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plessis | last2 = Morné | first2 = A. | last3 = Weathers | first3 = Wesley W. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = Walter D. | year = 1994| title = Energetic benefits of communal roosting by acorn woodpeckers during the nonbreeding season | url = | journal = Condor | volume = 1994 | issue = 3| pages = 631–637 | doi=10.2307/1369466| jstor = 1369466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small scale communal roosting during the winter months has also been observed in Green Woodhoopoes ([[Green wood hoopoe|Phoeniculus purpureus]]).

Tree swallows ([[Tree swallow|''Tachycineta bicolor'']]) located in southeastern Louisiana are known to form nocturnal communal roosts and have been shown to exhibit high roost fidelity, with individuals often returning to the same roost they had occupied on the previous night. Research has shown that swallows form communal roosts due to the combined factors of conspecific attraction, where individual swallows are likely to aggregate around other swallows of the same species, and roost fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laughlin | first1 = A.

Red-billed choughs ([[Red-billed chough|''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'']]) roost in what has been classified as either a main roost or a sub roost. Main roosts are constantly in use, whereas the sub roosts are used irregularly by individuals lacking both a mate and territory. These sub roosts are believed to help improve the ability of non-breeding choughs to find a mate and increase their territory ranges.&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Guillermo | last2 = Tella | first2 = Jose L. | year = 1999 | title = Temporal, spatial and social segregation of red-billed choughs between two types of communal roost: a role for mating and territory acquisition | url = | journal = The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 1219–1227 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1103| pmid = 10373254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspecies roosts have been observed between different bird species. In San Blas, Mexico, the great egret (''[[Great egret|Ardea alba]]''), the little blue heron (''[[Little blue heron|Egretta caerulea]]''), the tricolored heron (''[[Tricolored heron|Egretta tricolor]]''), and the snowy egret (''[[Snowy egret|Egretta thula]]'') are known to form large communal roosts. It has been shown that the snowy egret determines the general location of the roost due to the fact that the other three species rely on it for its abilities to find food sources. In these roosts there is often a hierarchical system, where the more dominant species (in this case the snowy egret) will typically occupy the more desirable higher perches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burger | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Intraspecific and interspecific interactions at a mixed species roost of ciconiiformes in San Blas, Mexico | url = | journal = Biology of Behaviour | volume = 1977 | issue = | pages = 309–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interspecies roosts have also been observed among other avian species.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Joanna.

=== Insects ===
[[File:Zebra Butterflies 14.jpg|thumb|Zebra Longwing butterflies (''[[Heliconius charithonia|Heliconius charitonius]]'') sleeping in a nocturnal communal roost. |197x197px]]Communal roosting has also been well documented among insects, particularly butterflies. The passion-vine butterfly (''[[Heliconius erato]])'' is known to form nocturnal roosts, typically comprising four individuals. It is believed that these roosts deter potential predators due to the fact that predators attack roosts less often than they do individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finkbeiner, Susan D., Adriana D. Briscoe, and Robert D. Reed. "The benefit of being a social butterfly: communal roosting deters predation." ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences'' 2012; 279(1739): 2769–2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal roosting behavior has also been observed in the neotropical zebra longwing butterfly (''[[Heliconius charithonia|Heliconius charitonius]]'') in the La Cinchona region of Costa Rica. A study of this roost showed that individuals vary in their roost fidelity, and that they tend to form smaller sub roosts. The same study observed that in this region communal roosting can be mediated by heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Young, Allen M., and Mary Ellen Carolan. "Daily instability of communal roosting in the neotropical butterfly Heliconius charitonius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae)." ''Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society''(1976): 346-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal roosting has also been observed in south Peruvian tiger beetles of the subfamily ''[[Tiger beetle|Cicindelidae]]''. These species of tiger beetle have been observed to form communal roosts comprising anywhere from two to nine individuals at night and disbanding during the day. It is hypothesized that these beetles roost high in the treetops in order to avoid ground-based predators.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, David L., and Joseph J. Anderson. "Perching heights and nocturnal communal roosts of some tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) in southeastern Peru." ''Biotropica'' (1985): 126-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammals ===
While there are few observations of communal roosting mammals, the trait has been seen in several species of bats. The little brown bat (''[[Little brown bat|Myotis lucifugus]]'') is known to participate in communal roosts of up to thirty seven during cold nights in order to decrease thermoregulatory demands, with the roost disbanding at daybreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barclay | first1 = Robert MR | year = 1982 | title = Night roosting behavior of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus | url = | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 464–474 | doi=10.2307/1380444| jstor = 1380444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other species of bats, including the hoary bat (''[[Hoary bat|Lasiurus cinereu]]s'') and the big brown bat (''[[Big brown bat|Eptesicus fuscus]]'') have also been observed to roost communally in maternal colonies in order to reduce the thermoregulatory demands on both the lactating mothers and juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klug | first1 = Brandon J. | last2 = Barclay | first2 = Robert MR | year = 2013 | title = Thermoregulation during reproduction in the solitary, foliage-roosting hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) | url = | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 94 | issue = 2| pages = 477–487 | doi=10.1644/12-mamm-a-178.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agosta | first1 = Salvatore J | year = 2002 | title = Habitat use, diet and roost selection by the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in North America: a case for conserving an abundant species | url = | journal = Mammal Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 179–198 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2002.00103.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crater Lake features two small islands. [[Wizard Island]], located near the western shore of the lake, is a [[cinder cone]] approximately 316 acres (128 ha) in size. [[Phantom Ship (island)|Phantom Ship]], a natural rock pillar, is located near the southern shore.

While having no indigenous fish population, the lake was stocked from 1888 to 1941 with a variety of fish. Since then, several species have formed self-sustaining populations.&lt;ref&gt;

== Location ==
Crater Lake is in [[Klamath County, Oregon|Klamath County]], approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} northwest of the county seat of [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]], and about {{convert|80|mi|km}} northeast of the city of [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]].&lt;ref name="us-park-service-directions"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/crla/planyourvisit/directions.htm|title=Crater Lake National Park: Directions|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1853, [[John Wesley Hillman]] became the first non-Native American explorer to report sighting the lake he named the "Deep Blue Lake."  The lake was renamed at least three times, as Blue Lake, Lake Majesty, and finally Crater Lake.&lt;ref&gt;

When considering the mean, or average depth of lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest lake in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world. Crater Lake Institute Director and [[Limnology|limnologist]] Owen Hoffman states "Crater Lake is the deepest, when compared on the basis of average depth among lakes whose basins are entirely above [[sea level]]. The average depths of Lakes [[Lake Baikal|Baikal]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] are deeper than Crater Lake; however, both have basins that extend below sea level."&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crater Lake, On Average, Is Deepest Lake in North America|date=2007-11-14|publisher=National Parks Traveler|first1=Kurt|last1=Repanshek|first2=Owen|last2=Hoffman|format=see story comments as well|url=http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2007/11/crater-lake-average-deepest-lake-north-america|accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
{{Main|Mount Mazama}}
[[Image:Geologic map of Crater Lake floor.png|thumb|right|260px|Geologic map of the lake floor]]

Mount Mazama, part of the [[Cascade Range]] [[volcanic arc]], was built up mostly of [[andesite]], [[dacite]], and [[rhyodacite]] over a period of at least 400,000 years. The caldera was created in a massive [[volcanic eruption]] between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago that led to the subsidence of Mount Mazama. About {{convert|50|km3|mi3|sp=us}} of rhyodacite was erupted in this event. Since that time, all eruptions on Mazama have been confined to the caldera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/CraterLake/description_crater_lake.html|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|work=Cascades Volcano Observatory|title=Mount Mazama Volcano and Crater Lake Caldera, Oregon|first=Lyn|last=Topinka|date=2008-04-18|accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jewell and McRae, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;

Lava eruptions later created a central platform, [[Wizard Island]], Merriam Cone, and other, smaller volcanic features, including a rhyodacite dome that was eventually created atop the central platform. Sediments and [[landslide]] debris also covered the caldera floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Charles R. Bacon|first=Charles R|last=Bacon|author2=James V. Gardner |author3=Larry A. Mayer |author4=Mark W. Buktenica |author5=Peter Dartnell |author6=David W. Ramsey |author7=Joel E. Robinson |year=2002|title=Morphology, volcanism, and mass wasting in Crater Lake, Oregon|url=http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/114/6/675.short|journal=[[Geological Society of America Bulletin]]|volume=114|pages=675–692|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114&lt;0675:MVAMWI&gt;2.0.CO;2|issue=6|bibcode=2002GSAB..114..675B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the caldera cooled, allowing rain and snow to accumulate and form a lake. Landslides from the caldera rim thereafter formed debris fans and [[turbidite]] sediments on the lake bed. [[Fumarole]]s and [[hot spring]]s remained common and active during this period. Also after some time, the slopes of the lake's caldera rim more or less stabilized, streams restored a radial drainage pattern on the mountain, and dense forests began to revegetate the barren landscape. It is estimated that about 720 years was required to fill the lake to its present depth of {{convert|594|m|ft}}. Much of this occurred during a period when the prevailing climate was less moist than at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Manuel|last=Nathenson|author2=Charles R. Bacon |author3=David W. Ramsey |year=2007|title=Subaqueous geology and a filling model for Crater Lake, Oregon|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=574|pages=13–27|doi=10.1007/s10750-006-0343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hydrothermal activity remains along the lake floor, suggesting that at some time in the future, Mazama may erupt once again.&lt;ref&gt;

== Climate ==
Crater Lake features a [[subalpine climate]], with the rare dry-summer type ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]] ''Dsc'') owing to its high elevation and – like all of Oregon – the strong summer influence of the [[North Pacific High]]. In the summer, the weather is mild and dry, but in the winter is cold and the powerful influence of the [[Aleutian Low]] allows for enormous snowfalls averaging {{convert|505|in|m|2}} per year and maximum snow cover averaging {{convert|139|in|m|2|disp=or|sp=us}}. This snow does not usually melt until mid-July, and allows for substantial glaciers on adjacent mountains.

Due to several unique factors, mainly that the lake has no inlets or [[tributaries]], the waters of Crater Lake are some of the purest in the world because of the absence of pollutants. Clarity readings from a [[Secchi disk]] have consistently been in the high-30&amp;nbsp;meter to mid-20&amp;nbsp;meter (80&amp;nbsp;to 115-foot) range, which is very clear for any natural body of water. In 1997, scientists recorded a record clarity of {{convert|53.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The lake has relatively high levels of dissolved salts, total [[alkalinity]], and conductivity. The average [[pH]] has generally ranged between 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Klamath people|Klamath]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], whose oral history describes their ancestors witnessing the collapse of Mount Mazama and the formation of Crater Lake, regard the lake as an "abode to the Great Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Diller, J.S. (1898). Crater Lake, Oregon&lt;/ref&gt; Klamath oral history tells of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld [[Llao]] (a prominent feature at Crater Lake is Llao Rock). Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called ''giiwas'' in the [[Klamath language]].&lt;ref name="giiwas" /&gt; The Klamath people used Crater Lake in [[vision quest]]s, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers.

'''''Creatures 2''''' is the second game in the [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]] [[artificial life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]], and the sequel to 1996 game ''[[Creatures (artificial life series)|Creatures]]''. It features three species: the cute, dependent [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Norns]], the cantankerous [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Grendel]]s and the industrious [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Ettins]]. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in.  The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures' development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak.

Many new gameplay features included in Creatures 2 not present in the original game include a new [[physics]] model and a global weather system, along with brand new applets and a world twice the size of the Creatures 1 world.

The [[executable]] file for the game was in fact an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for its scripting [[Programming language|language]], thus allowing users to make total conversions or derivative works from the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

== Gameplay ==
Like the other games in the series, Creatures 2 is mostly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, allowing the player to raise Norns at their own pace. In each new world, the player begins in the [[Incubator (egg)|incubator]] cavern area. The [[hatchery]], one of the game's in-built applets, allows the player to add Norn eggs to the world, which can be hatched via the incubator. Norns may also be downloaded from the internet and imported into to use in the game.

Once Norns reach [[adolescence]] at around an hour old, they are ready to breed, and female Norns will begin an [[oestrogen]] cycle. When Norns mate, there is a long kissing sound with a pop at the end – known as a kisspop. Like real life, not all mating results in a pregnancy. The Norn reproductive process can be monitored via the Breeder's Kit.

At the beginning, the player is only able to navigate a small area of Albia. As their Norns explore the world, however, more areas will be able to visited. If a Norn falls into water and is picked up, it cannot be placed in an unvisited area.

Like the previous game, every plant, animal and insect in Albia is a separate system called an autonomous agent, or just "agent" for short. Many user-created agents have been made, which can be injected into the world using the Injector Kit applet, which also includes an analysis page giving the opportunity  to check new objects for potentially harmful contents before injecting them.

Albia, the world in which Creatures 2 is set, is a vast disc-world filled with a wide variety of flora, ranging from the Cacti that inhabit the desert to the exclusive mushroom-like Gelsemium plant that can only be found in a single cavern. Albia is also home to a substantial amount of animal life, such as [[bee]]s which pollinate [[flower]]s and create [[honey]], and Zander fish, which provide a food source for creatures near the oceans. Scattered throughout the world are various seed launchers, which can be used to replenish stocks if any life-forms become extinct.

Albia also has four seasons: [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Summer]], [[Winter]] and [[Autumn]], and boasts its very own climate, with weather such as snow mainly occurring during the colder months, and rain mostly during the Spring. The game also has an on-screen [[thermometer]], allowing the player to monitor Albia's temperature at all times.

== Development ==
Creatures 2's release was widely anticipated. It is likely that around 450,000 copies of the original Creatures had been sold by the time the game was released, and a huge following had developed behind it. The "Early Adoption Program", a promotion where 250 copies of Creatures 2 were given away prior to its official release in September 1998, was scheduled to begin in July 1998, but was pushed back as the game was not close to release quality at the point at which the EAP was scheduled to start. In the end, most received their copies several weeks after the release date.

Upon release, the game suffered from numerous flaws, such as a deficient Norn genome that lead to a condition dubbed "One Hour Stupidity Syndrome (OHSS)", which caused Norns to forgot basic survival skills such as eating and sleeping. The task of creating the new Norn genome was given to Sandra Linkletter (Slink), who was also a member of the Creatures community. During development, many problems emerged, most likely due to disagreements between Slink and the Creatures 2 team. Slink later claimed that her design had been compromised by the geneticist brought on to finish her work, Eric Goodwin, and later accused Cyberlife of deriving their update from hers.

Cyberlife later released a patch with an improved genome after several weeks had passed. Several users also created improved Norn genomes, such as the Canny Norn genome created by Chris Double and Lis Morris.

'''Dagobah''' is a star system in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. It also appears in a deleted scene from ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. [[Yoda]] went into exile on Dagobah after a [[lightsaber]] battle with [[Darth Sidious]].

The planet shown in Dagobah, in the Sluis sector, is a world of murky [[swamps]], steaming [[bayous]], and [[petrified wood|petrified forests]], resembling Earth during the [[Carboniferous]] Period.

==Film history==
In the ''Star Wars'' storyline, after the [[Great Jedi Purge]] and his subsequent failure to defeat [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]], [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]] went into voluntary exile on Dagobah. Here, Yoda lived near a cave infused with the dark side of [[the Force]], which kept him from detection by [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]].

In ''The Empire Strikes Back'', [[Luke Skywalker]] is directed by the [[The Force#Force ghost|Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to seek Yoda on Dagobah. After training with Yoda, Skywalker leaves Dagobah early to rescue his friends [[Han Solo]], [[Princess Leia]], and [[Chewbacca]], who he senses are in danger on the planet [[Bespin]]. Skywalker also briefly returns to Dagobah in ''Return of the Jedi'', in which he has a final conversation with Yoda before Yoda's death. Luke then speaks to Obi-Wan Kenobi's ghost about the conflicting stories of Luke's parentage.

''Revenge of the Sith'' did not show how Yoda came to the planet in its theatrical version; but this was portrayed in a deleted scene that [[George Lucas]] says was removed so that ''Revenge'' would not have "too many endings".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The scene of Yoda arriving on Dagobah was rumored to be reinserted into the DVD release of the film in November 2005; however, the film's theatrical cut has been transferred to DVD intact, with the "Exile to Dagobah" scene featured in the "Deleted Scenes" section on Disc II instead.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In the novel of the movie, it is stated that Yoda went to Dagobah in an escape pod launched from [[Bail Organa]]'s starcruiser.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' featured Dagobah in a sixth season episode, in which Yoda traveled to the planet as part of his own training to gain immortality through the Force.

==Expanded Universe history==
In the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]], Yoda confronted a [[Bpfassh]]i [[Dark Jedi]] on Dagobah, some years before the events in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and the cave where the Dark Jedi died became strong in the dark side of the Force. ''Star Wars Tales'' later retconned this event to take place earlier, with another Jedi of Yoda's species named Minch replacing Yoda. Dagobah was also visited by the main characters of the ''Galaxy of Fear'' series, where it was home for a time to a tribe of cannibals. During the events of ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' (for the PC), a team of [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] from the [[New Jedi Order]] visit Dagobah, to find the cave drained of its former menace.

After the events of Episode VI, the New Republic founds a military base on one of the greatest mountains of the planet, named 'Mount Yoda' after the [[Jedi Master]].&lt;ref&gt;Davids, H &amp; Davids, P., ''Star Wars: Mission From Mount Yoda'', Bantam Spectra, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethics''' or '''moral philosophy''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong [[action (philosophy)|conduct]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of ethics, along with [[aesthetics]], concern matters of [[Value (ethics)|value]], and thus comprise the branch of [[philosophy]] called [[axiology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human [[morality]] by defining concepts such as [[good and evil]], right and [[wrong]], [[virtue]] and [[vice]], [[justice]] and [[crime]]. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral [[philosophy]] also is related to the fields of [[moral psychology]], [[descriptive ethics]], and [[value theory]].

Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their [[truth value]]s (if any) can be determined
# [[Normative ethics]], concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action
# [[Applied ethics]], concerning what a person is [[obligated]] (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

==Defining ethics==
The English word "ethics" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''ēthikós'' ({{lang|el|ἠθικός}}), meaning "relating to one's character", which itself comes from the root word ''êthos'' ({{lang|el|ἦθος}}) meaning "character, moral nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon|year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was borrowed into [[Latin]] as ''ethica'' and then into French as ''éthique'', from which it was borrowed into English.

[[Rushworth Kidder]] states that "standard definitions of ''ethics'' have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living|last=Kidder|first= Rushworth|year=2003|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York|ISBN=0-688-17590-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard William Paul and [[Linda Elder]] define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|ISBN=0-944583-17-2|page=NP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' states that the word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with '[[morality]]'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder state that most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|isbn=0-944583-17-2|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''ethics'' in English refers to several things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 4, 2015|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic|title=Definition of ethic by Merriam Webster|publisher= Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can refer to [[philosophical]] ethics or moral philosophy—a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions. As the English philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: "What makes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be rationally persuasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very broad question, "how one should live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about [[ethical]] problems that is not particular to philosophy. As [[bioethicist]] Larry Churchill has written: "Ethics, understood as the capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values, is a generic human capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are We Professionals? A Critical Look at the Social Role of Bioethicists.
|journal=Daedalus|year=1999|pages=253–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also be used to describe a particular person's own [[idiosyncratic]] principles or habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |url=http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |title=Buddha and Socrates share Common ground |author=David Tanguay |publisher=Soul of Wit |archivedate=July 22, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722174808/http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: "Joe has strange ethics."

==Meta-ethics==
{{Main|Meta-ethics}}
Meta-ethics is the branch of philosophical ethics that asks how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |title=What is ethics? |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028131348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethical question pertaining to a particular practical situation—such as, "Should I eat this particular piece of chocolate cake?"—cannot be a meta-ethical question (rather, this is an applied ethical question). A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, "Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?" is a meta-ethical question.

Meta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].

Studies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.

The [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative ethics==
{{Main|Normative ethics}}
[[Normative ethics|Normative]] ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.

At the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].

===Virtue ethics===
{{main|Virtue ethics}}
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]
[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469–399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

[[Aristotle]] (384–323&amp;nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed "virtuous". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.

Aristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.

====Stoicism====
{{main|Stoicism}}
[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]
The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The "unconquerable will" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not "lose" their life, but instead "return", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|38–41}}

====Contemporary virtue ethics====
Modern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Anscombe argues that consequentialist and deontological ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in divine law. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to "universal standards", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S. S. De De Vries|author2=Professor Pan Suk Kim|title=Value and Virtue in Public Administration: A Comparative Perspective|date=October 28, 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-35709-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who wrote the book ''[[After Virtue]]'', was a key contributor and proponent of modern virtue ethics, although some claim that MacIntyre supports a relativistic account of virtue based on [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]], not objective standards.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]], a contemporary virtue ethicist, objects to MacIntyre's relativism, among that of others, and responds to relativist objections to form an objective account in her work "Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nussbaum's accusation of relativism appears to be a misreading. In ''Whose Justice, Whose Rationality?'', MacIntyre's ambition of taking a rational path beyond relativism was quite clear when he stated "rival claims made by different traditions […] are to be evaluated […] without relativism" (p.&amp;nbsp;354) because indeed "rational debate between and rational choice among rival traditions is possible” (p.&amp;nbsp;352). ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century''&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;John Newton, Ph.D., ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century'' (2000). {{ISBN|0-9673705-7-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; blended the Eastern virtue ethics and the Western virtue ethics, with some modifications to suit the 21st Century, and formed a part of contemporary virtue ethics.&lt;ref name="ethics" /&gt;

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]] posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [[pleasure]] and minimizing [[suffering|pain]]. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Cyrenaic hedonism====
Founded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die." Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Epicureanism====
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
Epicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] "...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

===State consequentialism===
{{Main|State consequentialism}}
[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.&lt;ref name=readings/&gt; The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as "a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are&amp;nbsp;... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]|year=1999|last=Loewe|first=Michael|last2=Shaughnessy|first2=Edward L.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-47030-8|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Mozi]]'s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing, and the "order" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite book|title= Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|year=2011|last=Van Norden|first=Bryan W. |publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-60384-468-0|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth&amp;nbsp;... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically."&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; The Mohists believed that morality is based on "promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven". In contrast to Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield|author2=William Edelglass|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F06FKmKKIXwC&amp;pg=PA62|date=June 9, 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=62|quote=The goods that serve as criteria of morality are collective or public, in contrast, for instance, to individual happiness or well-being}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism/teleology===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}
{{See also|Ethical egoism}}
Consequentialism refers to moral theories that hold the consequences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action (or create a structure for judgment, see [[#Rule consequentialism|rule consequentialism]]). Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''"The ends justify the means"''.

The term "consequentialism" was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M. Anscombe|title= Modern Moral Philosophy|journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]|volume=33|pages=1–19 |url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|doi=10.1017/S0031819100037943 |year=1958|author=Anscombe, G. E. M.|publisher=1958|issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory.

The defining feature of consequentialist moral theories is the weight given to the consequences in evaluating the rightness and wrongness of actions.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|authorlink=J._L._Mackie|origyear=1977|title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-013558-8|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequentialist theories, the consequences of an action or rule generally outweigh other considerations. Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:
* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?
* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?
* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?

One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral "pleasure". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]
Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as "happiness", "welfare", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

In ''A Fragment on Government'' Bentham says 'it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong' and describes this as a fundamental [[axiom]]. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' he talks of 'the principle of utility' but later prefers "the greatest happiness principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentham |first= Jeremy|title=The Works of Jeremy Bentham: Published under the Superintendence of His Executor, John Bowring.

Utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book|title= Utilitarianism|year=1998|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2|url= http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy proponents of utilitarianism are neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], author of ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], author of, amongst other works, ''[[Practical Ethics]]''.

The major division within utilitarianism is between ''[[act utilitarianism]]'' and ''[[rule utilitarianism]]''. In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon University"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed "middle ground" between these two types is [[Two-level utilitarianism]], where rules are applied in ordinary circumstances, but with an allowance to choose actions outside of such rules when unusual situations call for it.

===Deontology===
&lt;!-- Section linked from "Categorical imperative" --&gt;
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

Deontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δέον}}, ''deon'', "obligation, duty"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself. Under deontology, an act may be considered right even if the act produces a bad consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Robert G. 1967. 'Deontological Ethics'. In Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: [[Collier Macmillan]]: 343.&lt;/ref&gt; if it follows the ''rule'' or moral law.  According to the deontological view, people have a ''duty'' to act in a way that does those things that are inherently good as acts ("truth-telling" for example), or follow an objectively obligatory rule (as in [[rule utilitarianism]]).

Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. [[Greenwood Press]]: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''deon'').&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1780. 'Preface'. In ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''. Translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives (expressed as maxims) of the person who carries out the action. Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way, one must act from duty, begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself, and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. 'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is 'good in itself' when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and 'good without qualification' when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], perseverance and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, they make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic ethics===
{{Main|Pragmatic ethics}}
Associated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over attempts to account for consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile attempts, if social reform is provided for).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last= Lafollette|series=Blackwell Philosophy Guides|edition=1|url=http://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/pragmati.htm |date=February 2000|title=The Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory|isbn=978-0-631-20119-9 | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics of care===
{{Main|Ethics of care}}
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as consequentialist theories (e.g. utilitarianism) and deontological theories (e.g., Kantian ethics) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values that—proponents of care ethics contend—are absent in such traditional models of ethics. These values include the importance of empathetic relationships and compassion.

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially assigned to women, and consequently devalued. They write, “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength,” that should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role ethics===
{{main|Role ethics}}
Role ethics is an ethical theory based on [[family]] roles.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Roger T. Ames |author=Roger T.

Ames]] and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." Morality is determined through a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. Confucian roles are not [[rationalism|rational]], and originate through the ''xin'', or human emotions.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

===Anarchist ethics===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] ethics is an ethical theory based on the studies of anarchist thinkers. The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist, and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Starting from the premise that the goal of ethical philosophy should be to help humans adapt and thrive in evolutionary terms, Kropotkin's ethical framework uses biology and anthropology as a basis – in order to scientifically establish what will best enable a given social order to thrive biologically and socially – and advocates certain behavioural practices to enhance humanity's capacity for freedom and well-being, namely practices which emphasise solidarity, equality, and justice.

Kropotkin argues that ethics itself is evolutionary, and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through cultural history, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of morality. The origin of ethical feeling in both animals and humans can be found, he claims, in the natural fact of "sociality" (mutualistic symbiosis), which humans can then combine with the instinct for justice (i.e. equality) and then with the practice of reason to construct a non-supernatural and anarchistic system of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf "Ethics: Origin and Development" by Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality at the core of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html "Anarchist morality", chapter VI, Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Postmodern ethics===
{{Main|Postmodernism}}
{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}
The 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.

[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, at least in part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that "there is no outside-text/non-text" ("''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''" is often mistranslated as "there is nothing outside the text"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.

Post-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.

David Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the "ethical turn" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the "obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;103).

Hoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as "not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless"(2004, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Hoy concludes that
{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}

==Applied ethics==
{{Main|Applied ethics}}
Applied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].

===Specific questions===
Applied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: "Is getting an abortion immoral?" "Is euthanasia immoral?" "Is affirmative action right or wrong?" "What are human rights, and how do we determine them?" "Do animals have rights as well?" and "Do individuals have the right of self-determination?"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

A more specific question could be: "If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration—in fact, no common assumptions of all participants—so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, "Is lying always wrong?" and, "If not, when is it permissible?" is prior to any etiquette.

People, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a "yes or no", "right or wrong" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.

===Particular fields of application===
====Bioethics====
{{Main|Bioethics}}
{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}
Bioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|"the ethics of the ordinary"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.

Bioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics |accessdate=December 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins, e.g. "three parent baby, where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.

I.|year=2012|title=Synthetic Biology|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location =New Jersey|isbn=978-1-84816-862-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, new bioethics also need to address life at its core. For example, [[biotic ethics]] value organic gene/protein life itself and seek to propagate it.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title=Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space|journal=[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]|volume=23|issue=8|pages=433–440|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x|pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such life-centered principles, ethics may secure a cosmological future for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title= Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future|publisher=[[Legacy Books]] (www.amazon.com)|location=Washington D.

====Business ethics====
{{Main|Business ethics}}
Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment, including fields like [[medical ethics]]. Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, A. A., &amp; Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, "Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'—as there once was a feudal system—which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&amp;nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&amp;nbsp;... They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners&amp;nbsp;... but all society." p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=C. |first2=M. |last2=Parker |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CSKX2HdnikC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=For Business Ethics: A Critical Text |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-31135-7 |display-authors=etal |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=ferrell|first=o.c|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9781305500846|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Machine ethics====
{{Main|Machine ethics}}
In ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'', Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that issues in [[machine ethics]] will likely drive advancement in understanding of human ethics by forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation.&lt;ref name=Wallach2008&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wendell |last1=Wallach|first2=Colin|last2=Allen|date=November 2008|title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong|isbn=978-0-19-537404-9|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=USA|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to actually program a machine or artificial agent to behave as though instilled with a sense of ethics requires new specificity in our normative theories, especially regarding aspects customarily considered common-sense. For example, machines, unlike humans, can support a wide selection of [[List of machine learning algorithms|learning algorithms]], and controversy has arisen over the relative ethical merits of these options. This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.

====Military ethics====
{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}

Military ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics. However individual countries and traditions have different fields of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emmanuel|last=Goffi|authorlink=Emmanuel Goffi|year=2011|title=Les Armée Françaises Face à la Morale|trans-title=The French Army Facing Morale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpyjGdEsCA4C|language=fr|location=France|publisher=L'Harmattan|isbn=978-2296542495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military ethics involves multiple subareas, including the following among others:
# what, if any, should be the laws of war.
# justification for the initiation of military force.
# decisions about who may be targeted in warfare.
# decisions on choice of weaponry, and what collateral effects such weaponry may have.
# standards for handling military prisoners.
# methods of dealing with violations of the laws of war.

====Political ethics====
{{main|Political ethics}}
Political ethics (also known as political morality or public ethics) is the practice of making moral judgements about political action and political agents.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. "Political Ethics". ''International Encyclopedia of Ethics'', ed. Hugh LaFollette (Blackwell Publishing, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public sector ethics====
{{main|Public sector ethics}}
Public sector ethics is a set of principles that guide public officials in their service to their constituents, including their decision-making on behalf of their constituents.  Fundamental to the concept of public sector ethics is the notion that decisions and actions are based on what best serves the public's interests, as opposed to the official's personal interests (including financial interests) or self-serving political interests.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, work of Institute for Local Government, at [http://www.ca-ilg.org/trust www.ca-ilg.org/trust].&lt;/ref&gt;

To follow these principles, authors must verify that the publication does not contain [[plagiarism]] or [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Neil|title=Publication ethics|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|date=October 2009|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1011–1013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x/full|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a way to avoid misconduct in research these principles can also apply to experiments that are referenced or analyzed in publications by ensuring the data is recorded honestly and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=E|last2=Fiack|first2=S|last3=Graf|first3=C|last4=Robinson|first4=A|last5=Rowlands|first5=I|title=Science journal editors' views on publication ethics: results of an international survey|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=31 March 2009|volume=35|issue=6|pages=348–353|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/35/6/348.short|doi=10.1136/jme.2008.028324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is the failure to give credit to another author’s work or ideas, when it is used in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scollon|first1=Ron|title=Plagiarism|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=9|pages=188–190|jstor=43102462|doi=10.1525/jlin.1999.9.1-2.188|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the obligation of the editor of the journal to ensure the article does not contain any plagiarism before it is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Williams|first2=Peter|title=Why and how do journals retract articles? An analysis of Medline retractions 1988—2008|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=September 2011|volume=37|issue=9|pages=567–570|jstor=23034717|doi=10.1136/jme.2010.040964}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a publication that has already been published is proven to contain plagiarism, the editor of the journal can retract the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanjeev|first1=Handa|title=Plagiarism and publication ethics: Dos and don'ts|journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology|date=2008|volume=74|issue=4|pages=301–303|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=4;spage=301;epage=303;aulast=Handa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication bias occurs when the publication is one-sided or "[[prejudiced]] against results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigelman|first1=Lee|title=Publication Bias Reconsidered|journal=Political Analysis|date=2000|volume=8|issue=2|pages=201–210|jstor=25791607|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a029813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In best practice, an author should try to include information from all parties involved, or affected by the topic. If an author is prejudiced against certain results, than it can "lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Jamie L.|last2=Sutton|first2=Alex J.|last3=Jones|first3=David R.|last4=Abrams|first4=Keith R.|last5=Rushton|first5=Lesley|last6=Moreno|first6=Santiago G.|title=Assessing publication bias in meta-analysis in the presence of between-study heterogeneity|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (Statistics in Society)|date=July 2010|volume=173|issue=3|pages=575–591|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985x.2009.00629.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misconduct in research can occur when an experimenter falsifies results.&lt;ref name="j25175246"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Richard|title=Misconduct in Research: Editors Respond: The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Is Formed|journal=British Medical Journal|date=July 26, 1997|volume=315|issue=7102|pages=201–202|jstor=25175246|doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7102.201|pmc=2127155|pmid=9253258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falsely recorded information occurs when the researcher "fakes" information or data, which was not used when conducting the actual experiment.&lt;ref name="j25175246"/&gt; By faking the data, the researcher can alter the results from the experiment to better fit the hypothesis they originally predicted. When conducting medical research, it is important to honor the healthcare rights of a patient by protecting their [[anonymity]] in the publication.&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"/&gt;
''Respect for autonomy'' is the principle that decision-making should allow individuals to be autonomous; they should be able to make decisions that apply to their own lives. This means that individuals should have control of their lives.
''Justice'' is the principle that decision-makers must focus on actions that are fair to those affected. Ethical decisions need to be consistent with the ethical theory. There are cases where the management has made decisions that seem to be unfair to the employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders (Solomon, 1992, pp49). Such decisions are unethical.

====Relational ethics====
Relational ethics are related to an [[ethics of care]].&lt;ref name="GILLIGAN2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Gilligan|title=In a Different Voice|date=June 30, 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03761-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63}} They are used in qualitative research, especially ethnography and autoethnography. Researchers who employ relational ethics value and respect the connection between themselves and the people they study, and "...between researchers and the communities in which they live and work." (Ellis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = C | year = 2007 | title = Telling secrets, revealing lives: Relational ethics in research with intimate others | url = | journal = Qualitative Inquiry | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 3–29 | doi=10.1177/1077800406294947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics also help researchers understand difficult issues such as conducting research on intimate others that have died and developing friendships with their participants.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1986). ''Fisher folk. Two communities on Chesapeake Bay.'' Lexington: [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1995).''Final negotiations: A story of love, loss, and chronic illness.'' Philadelphia: [[Temple University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics in close personal relationships form a central concept of [[Ivan Böszörményi-Nagy#Contextual therapy|contextual therapy]].

====Animal ethics====
{{Main|Animal ethics}}
Animal ethics is a term used in academia to describe human-animal relationships and how animals ought to be treated. The subject matter includes [[animal rights]], [[animal welfare]], [[animal law]], [[speciesism]], [[animal cognition]], [[wildlife conservation]], the moral status of nonhuman animals, the concept of nonhuman [[personhood]], [[Anthropocentrism|human exceptionalism]], the history of animal use, and theories of [[justice]].

==Moral psychology==
{{Main|Moral psychology}}
'''Moral psychology''' is a field of study that began as an issue in [[philosophy]] and that is now properly considered part of the discipline of [[psychology]].  Some use the term "moral psychology" relatively narrowly to refer to the study of [[moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Lapsley (2006) and "moral psychology" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics and psychology (and [[philosophy of mind]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Doris &amp; Stich (2008) and Wallace (2007). Wallace writes: "Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions" (p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are [[moral responsibility]], moral development, [[moral character]] (especially as related to [[virtue ethics]]), [[altruism]], [[psychological egoism]], [[moral luck]], and moral disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary ethics===
{{Main|Evolutionary ethics}}
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
Evolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]] or [[sociobiology]], with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |title=Evolutionary Ethics |author=Doris Schroeder |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007081051/http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |archivedate=October 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive ethics==
{{Main|Descriptive ethics}}
Descriptive ethics is on the less philosophical end of the spectrum since it seeks to gather particular information about how people live and draw general conclusions based on observed patterns. Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical—such as, "Is ethical knowledge possible?"—are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating "bottom up" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:
* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics—and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.
* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] ("Miss Manners"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.
* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing "right versus right", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.
* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing. This is a major concern of sociology, [[political science]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hary Gunarto]], Ethical Issues in Cyberspace and IT Society, Symposium on Whither The Age of Uncertainty, APU Univ., [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440840_Ethical_Issues_in_Cyberspace_and_IT_Society paper],  Jan. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4206">{{Geology to Paleobiology}}
In the [[stratigraphy]] sub-discipline of [[geology]], a '''Global Standard Stratigraphic Age''', abbreviated '''GSSA''', is a chronological reference point and criterion in the [[geologic record]] used to define the boundaries (an internationally sanctioned [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] point) between different geological [[Geologic period|periods]], [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]s or [[Age (geology)|ages]] on the overall [[geologic time scale]] in a [[stratigraphy|chronostratigraphically]] useful rock layer. A worldwide multidisciplinary effort has been ongoing since 1974 to define such important metrics. The points and strata need be widespread and contain an identifiable sequence of layers or other unambiguous marker (identifiable or quantifiable) attributes.

GSSAs, and the generally more recent and preferred benchmark [[GSSP]]s are defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) under the auspices of their parent organization, the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS), and are used primarily for time dating of rock layers older than 630 [[Megaannum|million years ago]], lacking a good [[fossil record]]. The ICS first attempts to meet the standards of the GSSPs (see below) and if those fail, usually have enough information to make a preliminary selection of several competing GSSA prospects or proposals.

The [[geologic record]] becomes spotty prior to about 542 million years ago. This is because the Earth's crust in geological time scales is constantly being recycled by [[tectonic]] and weathering forces, and older rocks and especially readily accessible exposed [[stratum|strata]] that can act as a time calibration are rare.

For more recent periods, a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP), largely based on [[paleontology]] and improved methods of fossil dating, is used to define such boundaries.  In contrast to GSSAs, GSSPs are based on important events and transitions within a particular stratigraphic section.  In older sections, there is insufficient fossil record or well preserved sections to identify the key events necessary for a GSSP, so GSSAs are defined based on fixed dates and selected criteria.

The '''International Association of Cryospheric Sciences''', or '''IACS''', is the eighth association of the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG). It was launched by the IUGG Council on 2007-07-04, developing from the International Commission of Snow and Ice of the [[International Association of Hydrological Sciences]] (IAHS) via the transitional Union Commission for the Cryospheric Sciences (UCCS).&lt;ref name="iugg_iacs_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iugg.org/associations/iacs.php|accessdate=2012-11-05|title=International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics: International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formation of this new Association is recognition of the importance of the [[cryosphere]] in the study of [[Earth System Science]], and particularly at a time of significant global change. Accordingly, [[cryospheric sciences]] is an [[umbrella term]] for the study of the [[cryosphere]] (not unlike [[atmospheric sciences]], encompassing [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], and [[aeronomy]]); as an interdisciplinary [[Earth science]], many disciplines contribute to it, most notably [[geology]], [[hydrology]], and [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]]; in this sense, it is comparable to [[glaciology]]. IACS has historic connections going back to the establishment of the Commission Internationale des Glaciers (International Glacier Commission) in 1894.

The broad objectives of IACS are:&lt;ref name="iugg_iacs_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iacs_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryosphericsciences.org/|accessdate=2012-11-05|title=International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* to promote studies of the cryosphere;
* to encourage research on cryospheric sciences through collaboration;
* to foster discussion and publication of results of cryospheric research;
* to promote education about the cryosphere;
* to facilitate standardisation of cryospheric measurements; and
* to promote the science of Permanent Services under IACS responsibility
(at present IACS has responsibility within the International Council of Science for the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS)).

IACS is structured around a number of disciplinary Divisions. Currently these are:&lt;ref name="iugg_iacs_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iacs_2010"/&gt;

* Snow and Avalanches;
* Glaciers and Ice Sheets;
* Sea Ice, Lake and River Ice;
* Cryosphere, Atmosphere and Climate;
* Planetary and other Ices of the Solar System.

A number of working groups under these Divisions address scientific problems of the cryosphere that are timely and well constrained.  Recent examples include a working group on "Intercomparison of Forest Snow Process Models", and working groups that have developed a new "International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground" and a new "Glossary of Mass Balance and Related Terms".

'''JJ Electronic, s.r.o''' is one of the world's remaining producers of [[vacuum tube]]s. They are based in [[Čadca]], in the [[Kysuce]] region of [[Slovakia]].
Most of the products that JJ offers are audio [[preamplifier]] tubes, and tubes for audio power amplifiers. These vacuum tubes are mainly used for guitar and hi-fi amplifiers. Technically, the vacuum tubes produced by JJ Electronic are mainly low-noise [[triode]]s, [[beam tetrode]]s and power [[pentode]]s. Double [[diode]] vacuum tubes for AC-to-DC [[rectifier]]s are also produced. JJ also produces [[electrolytic capacitor]]s for higher voltage purposes, generally for use in audio amplifiers. JJ also manufactures their own line of high-end audio amplifiers and guitar amplifiers. 
In 2015, the company sales amounted to EUR 8.5 million and net income came to EUR 3.8 million. Most of the products are exported to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="JJ Electronic, s.r.o. Annual Report 2015"/&gt;

== History ==

Before 1989, [[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|TESLA]] was the main Czechoslovak producer of electron tubes. While TESLA vacuum tubes were exported all over the world, and were known for their quality, the company did not survive the change of economic system after 1989 in combination with the downturn in the vacuum tube market. JJ Electronic was founded in 1993, using the old TESLA machines for the manufacture of vacuum tubes. Eventually, JJ Electronic started to produce their own line of vacuum tubes and electrolytic capacitors, being mainly targeted at high-end audiophile and guitar amplifier applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">A '''Janus molecule''' (or Janus-faced molecule) is a molecule which can represent both beneficial and toxic effects.  Examples are [[nitric oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Calabrese, Cesare Mancuso, Menotti Calvani, Enrico Rizzarelli, D. Allan Butterfield &amp; Anna Maria Giuffrida Stella.  [http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v8/n10/abs/nrn2214.html Nitric oxide in the central nervous system: neuroprotection versus neurotoxicity].  Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8, 766-775 (October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;A RECEPTOR-MEDIATED PATHWAY FOR CHOLESTEROL HOMEOSTASIS, Nobel lecture, December 9, 1985 by Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein: http://nobelprize.virtual.museum/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1985/brown-goldstein-lecture.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of cholesterol, the property that makes cholesterol useful in cell membranes, namely its absolute insolubility in water, also makes it lethal. When cholesterol accumulates in the wrong place, for example within the wall of an artery, it cannot be readily mobilized, and its presence eventually leads to the development of an atherosclerotic plaque.
Janus-faced molecules are widely spread in our biology, but often their mechanism of action is difficult to blend in existing therapies on pathogenetic and mechanistic explanations. Therefore, both in academia as well as in pharmaceutical industry people shy away from digging too deep, as Janus-faced molecules act based on the context in which these molecules operate.

==Background and education==

Born in 1945, in [[Prestatyn]], in what was then the [[Flintshire (historic)|historic county of Flintshire]] ({{lang-cy|Sir y Fflint}}) until re-organisation made it part of [[Clwyd]] and then [[Denbighshire]]; Jonathan Elphick was raised in [[North Wales]], surrounded by a mountainous and beautiful mosaic of [[habitats]]: including traditional mixed farmland, woods, rivers, lakes, hills and coastlines.&lt;ref name="Surfbirds.com"/&gt; He spent the first four years of his life in [[Rhyl]], then moved to [[Dyserth]], where he attended Ysgol Hiraddug, [[Dyserth]], moving on to [[St Asaph]]'s [[Grammar School]] and ultimately [[University College, Swansea]] (1964–1968), one of the four colleges comprising the [[University of Wales]].

Birdlife in North Wales in the early 1950s was relatively unaffected by agricultural developments and other changes, that proved to be major factors in the decline of many [[List of British birds|British birds]].

Inspired by, among others, the writings of [[Bruce Campbell (ornithologist)|Bruce Campbell]] one of the foremost ornithologists of the day, Elphick's journey through ornithological literature began with the paperback ''Bird Watching for Beginners'' and ''Campbell's Birds in Colour''. Migrating from the ''Bird Recognition'' paperback guides (by the ornithologist [[James Fisher (naturalist)|James Fisher]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''WATCHING BIRDS'', Fisher. J. pub. in London by Collins 1941&lt;/ref&gt;) he came under the influence of the [[Nature Conservancy]] warden at [[Newborough Warren]] National [[Nature Reserve]], on the [[Isle of Anglesey]], Peter Hope-Jones.  In 1969 Elphick gained a BSc. degree in [[Zoology]] and secured a job as a [[Natural history]] editor, working as an in-house editor for various publishers including [[Dorling Kindersley]],&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Mammal'' by Dorling Kindersley. Publishing Staff, Smithsonian Institution, David Burnie, Jonathan Elphick, Steve Parker, Christopher Norris&lt;/ref&gt; eventually going freelance and specialising in [[Birds]].

==Themes and interests==

Elphick worked for five years as researcher on the best-selling book ''Birds Britannica'', written by [[Mark Cocker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Birds Britannica'', Cocker M. pub by Chatto &amp; Windus, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He specialises in the cultural history of birds and our changing attitudes to them. His work encompasses a variety of aspects that interest him, including practical field [[ornithology]], [[biological]] research, the history of natural history, as well as ornithological art, all of which inform his personal reaction to birds. Elphick is a keen [[conservation movement|conservationist]] who has travelled extensively to both study and make people aware of the importance of the [[Conservation movement]] at home and abroad.

===Art and ornithology===

The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London is the repository for some half a million works on paper and one million books, which are the sources for some exceptionally beautiful and important images of birds. Many are from rare sources. Elphick's work is a selection of art works from this archive, including the work of artists such as [[John James Audubon]], along with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Exploration|explorers]], who catalogued the world's [[Bird|avifauna]] before the age of photography.  It documents the work of many [[natural history]] artists, such as [[John Gould]], [[William MacGillivray]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]]. The text interweaves ornithological science, art history, biography, travel and other aspects of the subject to paint a picture of the artists and the birds they painted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhmshop.co.uk/art-history/birds-the-art-of-ornithology/product.html Natural History Museum, Art and History Section]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latest work==

Elphick's latest work, undertaken with the photographer [[David Tipling]], and due to be published later this year, is ''GREAT BIRDS: 200 Star Species of Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;''GREAT BIRDS: 200 Star Species of Britain'', Elphick.J and Tipling.D, pub. Duncan Baird Publishers, London 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds and People===

Elphick is part of a team of naturalists and authors, including the British wildlife photographer [[David Tipling]] and the naturalist and author [[Mark Cocker]], undertaking the [[Birds and People]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdsandpeople.org  Birds and People website]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Birds and People]]'' is a ten-year-long, groundbreaking collaboration between the publishers [[Random House]] and [[BirdLife International]], to survey and document worldwide, the cultural significance of birds. The ''Birds and People'' project involves an open [[internet forum]], for individuals worldwide to document their reflections, experiences and stories about bird.. The final book is intended as a global chorus on the relationship between human beings and birds.

A '''knee''', or '''river knee''', is a bend in a [[river]] changing its course significantly within a short distance to a different direction (in an angle of around 90 degrees). It is different from a [[riverbend (disambiguation)|riverbend]] which is a single isolated bend, and from a [[meander]] which consists of several bends in a sinuous course, both without changing the river's main course. In European history, many river knees have proven to be strategically favorable locations to found cities.

Many rivers have significant bends due to geological reasons:

* the [[Rhine knee]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], the river's most significant knee - other knees appear in German cities [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]
* the Danube knee in [[Vác]], [[Hungary]]
* the Volga knee at [[Volgograd]], [[Russia]]
* the Rhône knee at [[Martigny]], [[Switzerland]]
* the Petitcodiac knee at [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]], locally known as ''Le Coude'', in English erroneously called "the Bend"

Furthermore, some riverbends are called "knees" although they are actually single bends or a part of meanders:

* the "Vltava knee" in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]
* the "Elbe knee" at [[Königstein Fortress]], [[Germany]]
* the "Rhine knee" at [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]] (see also [[:de:Rheinkniebrücke]])

The '''Ladinian''' is a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] and [[age (geology)|age]] in the [[Middle Triassic]] [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] or [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. It spans the time between {{Period start|Ladinian}} [[annum|Ma]] and ~237 Ma (million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale&lt;/ref&gt; The Ladinian was preceded by the [[Anisian]] and succeeded by the [[Carnian]] (part of the [[Late Triassic|Upper or Late Triassic]]).&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed [[geologic timescale]] see Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ladinian is coeval with the [[Falangian]] [[China|Chinese]] regional stage.

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Ladinian was established by Austrian geologist [[Alexander Bittner]] in 1892. Its name comes from the [[Ladin language|Ladin people]] that live in the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Alps]] (in the [[Dolomites]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]).

The base of the Ladinian stage is defined as the place in the stratigraphic record where the [[ammonite]] species ''[[Eoprotrachyceras|Eoprotrachyceras curionii]]'' first appears or the first appearance of the conodont ''[[Budurovignathus praehungaricus]]''. The global reference profile for the base (the [[GSSP]]) is at an [[outcrop]] in the [[river bed]] of the [[Caffaro (river)|Caffaro]] river at [[Bagolino]], in the [[province of Brescia]], northern [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;The GSSP was established by Brack ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the Ladinian (the base of the Carnian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species ''[[Daxatina|Daxatina canadensis]]''.

The Ladinian is sometimes subdivided into two subages or substages, the Fassanian (early or lower) and the Longobardian (late or upper). The Ladinian contains four ammonite biozones, which are evenly distributed among the two substages:
*zone of ''[[Frechites|Frechites regoledanus]]''
*zone of ''[[Protrachyceras|Protrachyceras archelaus]]''
*zone of ''Protrachyceras gredleri''
*zone of ''Eoprotrachyceras curionii''

==Palaeontology==
Many Ladinian and Carnian vertebrates have been discovered in the paleorrota in [[Brazil]]: [[Rhynchosaur]]s, [[Thecodontia|thecodonts]], [[exaeretodont]]s, ''[[Staurikosaurus]]'', ''[[Guaibasaurus]]'', ''[[Saturnalia tupiniquim]]'', ''[[Sacisaurus]]'', ''[[Unaysaurus]]'', and many others. Paleorrota lies within the [[Santa Maria Formation]] and the [[Caturrita Formation]].

Vertebrates of Ladinian age include:
*''[[Spondylosoma]]''
*[[Dicynodonts]]

'''Lawsone''' ('''2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone'''), also known as  '''hennotannic acid''', is a red-orange [[dye]] present in the leaves of the [[henna]] plant (''[[Lawsonia inermis]]'') as well as in the flower of [[water hyacinth]] (''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | first = A. C. | last = Dweck | title = Natural ingredients for colouring and styling | journal = International Journal of Cosmetic Science | year = 2002 | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 287–302 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2494.2002.00148.x | pmid = 18498522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have used henna extracts containing lawsone as hair and skin [[dyes]] for more than 5000 years. Lawsone reacts chemically with the protein [[keratin]] in skin and hair, in a process known as [[Michael addition]], resulting in a strong permanent stain that lasts until the skin or hair is shed. The darker colored ink is due to more lawsone-keratin interactions occurring, which evidently break down as the concentration of lawsone decreases and the tattoo fades. &lt;ref&gt;Jordão, A.; Vargas, M.; Pinto, A.; da Silva, F.; Ferreira, V. Lawsone in organic synthesis. RSC Adv. 2015, 5, 67909-67943.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawsone strongly absorbs [[UV light]], and aqueous extracts can be effective [[sunless tanning]] and [[sunscreen]]s. Chemically, lawsone is similar to [[juglone]], which is found in walnuts.

Lawsone isolation from ''Lawsonia Inermis'' can be difficult due to its easily biodegradeable nature. Isolation involves four steps:
# extraction with an extraction solution, usually NaOH
# column filtration using a macroporous adsorption resin
# a rinse with ethanol to remove impurities, and finally
# freeze the product to isolate the lawsone powder, usually a yellow colored dust.&lt;ref&gt;Shuang, S.; Lei, Q.; Ting, Y.; Qifu, Y. Method for preparing lawsone from lawsonia inermis China Patent CN 103848732A, June 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the rinse, the lawsone will be the bottom as it has such a high density and the chlorophyll molecules will all be on the top of the mixture.&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, F.; Multari, G.; Giambenedetti, M.; Federici, E. Chemical fingerprinting of Lawsonia inermis L. using HPLC, HPTLC, and densitometry. Phytochem. Anal. 2008, 19, 550-559.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawsone is hypothesized to undergo a reaction similar to Strecker synthesis in reactions with amino acids.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jelly, R.; Lewis, S. W.;Lennard, C.; Lim, K. F.; Almog, J. Lawsone: a novel reagent for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper surfaces. Chem.Commun. 2008, 3513-3515&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has been conducted on lawsone's potential applications in the forensic science field. Since lawsone shows many similarities with [[ninhydrin]], the current reagent for latent fingerprint development, studies have been conducted to see if lawsone can be used in this field. As of now the research is inconclusive, but optimistic. Lawsone non-specifically targets primary amino acids, and displays photoluminescence with forensic light sources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has a characteristic purple/brown coloration as opposed to the purple/blue associated with ninhydrin.&lt;ref&gt;Jelly, R.; Lewis, S. W.; Lennard, C.; Lim, K. F.; Almog, J. Lawsone: a novel reagent for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper surfaces. Chem. Commun. 2008, 3513-3515.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lawsone shows promise as a reagent for fingerprint detection because of its photoluminescence maximized at 640nm, which is high enough that it avoids background interference common for ninhydrin.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, P.; Farrugia, K. An investigation into the enhancement of fingermarks in blood on paper with [[genipin]] and lawsone. Sci. Justice 2013, 53, 315-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narnian creatures''' are any non-human inhabitants of Narnia, the fantasy world created by [[C. S. Lewis]] as a setting for his ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. This is a series of commentaries on the creatures of Narnia. Entries include information on physical, habitual, and behavioural elements of the creatures, as well as noting any important members of the species. Each commentary draws on specific references and citations from the books and officially sanctioned Disney films. Many animals that are found in our world are also present in Narnia, and some species include talking variations. At the birth of Narnia, [[Aslan]] the lion stares at certain animals and breathes upon them. This enabled them to think and talk in a manner similar to humans, and also altered their size [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]]. Smaller talking beasts – such as rodents, birds and small mammals – are generally larger than their non-talking counterparts, whereas larger talking beasts are generally smaller than average{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. There is never any mention of talking fish or insects, although there are Naiads, or water-spirits. Lewis freely drew on various sources for inspiration; the creatures contained in this list include many from classical mythology and English folklore.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p. 209 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

To reference two or more books:

([[The Lion,'''Terri'''''' the Witch and the Wardrobe|LWW]], [[Prince Caspian|PC]], [[The Horse and His Boy|HHB]])

--&gt;

==A==
* '''[[Albatross]]''' - [[Aslan]] is shown as taking the form of an albatross in [[Voyage of the Dawn Treader]].

* '''[[Ape]]''' - Apes are among the cleverest of talking beasts. As in our world, their diet seems to consist primarily of fruit and nuts [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. There are evil apes present among the horde of the [[White Witch]] at the sacrifice of [[Aslan]] [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. Also an ape named Shift was a ringleader in the Tashlan conspiracy. [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. It wasn't explained by C.S. Lewis on what type of apes appeared in his stories, though the live-action movies featured [[gorilla]]s during the First Battle of Beruna and Pauline Baynes' illustrations depict Shift as a [[chimpanzee]].

==B==
* '''[[Badger]]''' - Talking badgers are intelligent, kind, and steadfast. They side with Aslan and his followers whenever battle erupts. One of the badgers, Trufflehunter, has "a curiously earthy, husky voice". He refuses to wear armour, claiming instead that he can protect himself with his claws and teeth [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].

* '''[[Bat]]''' - Giant bats are present among the horde of the [[White Witch]] at the sacrifice of [[Aslan]] [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]].

* '''[[Bear]]''' - Talking bears are large, gentle, childlike creatures. A bear is traditionally one of the Marshals of the Lists. They are depicted as strong but gentle creatures, who pass their time napping and eating honey. One prominent family of bears are the Bulgy Bears, the elder of which is known to suck his paw at inopportune moments. At one point a non-talking grey bear is killed for its meat, and is referred to by the name [[Brown bear|Bruin]] (literally meaning "brown"), the time-honored poetic title for a bear [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]]. In the 2005 film, a pair of polar bears pull the White Witch's chariot into battle with black bears fighting for Aslan. In the 2008 film, brown bears fight for Prince Caspian.

* '''[[Beaver]]''' - Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are among the rebels who fight against the [[White Witch]] [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. It is they who explain the plight of Narnia to the Pevensies and first help them escape the Witch's minions. In [[Prince Caspian]] it is told that beavers had become extinct in Narnia, and this is attributed to the White Witch having exterminated them; however, in [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|LWW]] there had been no mention of her having a specific animosity to beavers, beyond her general attitude to the various creatures opposing her, and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver had survived her downfall. The town of Beaversdam sits where the dam of Mr. and Mrs. Beaver was once situated [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].

* '''Birds of the morning''' - Large white birds that fly from the sun and present fire-berries to a retired Star named Ramandu in ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]''.

* '''Black [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]]''' - (See: [[#D|Dwarf]])

* '''[[Wild boar|Boar]]''' - Talking boars are fierce fighters, and use their tusks to gash enemies. A loyal boar is among the Narnian fighters in ''[[The Last Battle]]''. Boars are also seen fighting on the side of Aslan's forces in both movie adaptations.

* '''[[Boggart|Boggle]]''' - Boggles are followers of the [[White Witch]] [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. According to ''A Guide to Narnia'',&lt;ref name=Sammons&gt;A Guide to Narnia by Martha C Sammons, published 1979 by Hodder Christian Paperbacks, {{ISBN|0-340-24800-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "boggle" is another name for a [[Hobgoblin]]. In the 2005 film, they are portrayed as fat and brown-skinned [[goblin]]-like creatures with pig-like noses.

==C==
* '''[[Cat]]''' - Cats are aloof, cunning, graceful creatures. A "cat-a-mountain" (or [[wildcat]]) is one of the creatures turned into stone by the White Witch [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. Aslan was a cat who comforted Shasta among the house of the dead [[The Horse and his Boy|HHB]]. One talking cat named Ginger is in league with the evil Calormenes and Shift the ape (who had the Narnians and the Calormenes believe that Aslan and Tash are one being). When Tash arrives to take Rishda Tarkaan, Ginger is so terrified by the dark god that he loses his power of speech [[The Last Battle|(LB)]].

* '''[[Cattle]]''' - Bulls are shown several times in the course of the series. In LWW they are shown fighting for [[Aslan]], but in LB a bull is shown fighting against Tirian. No cows are shown in the series.

* '''[[Centaur]]''' - The [[Narnian Centaurs|centaurs]] of [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] are noble beings and are one of the most loyal creatures to [[Aslan]] and to Narnia. They have the head, torso, and arms of a human but have the lower body of a horse joining at the human's waist. Their horse bodies are generally chestnut colored with human hair and beards of various colors. They are highly skilled in [[astronomy]] and [[divination]], being able to read the stars and tell of future events. They are also proficient [[warrior]]s and healers. It is said in Narnia that no one ever laughed at a centaur and that no one who valued his life would ever saddle a one (if offered the opportunity). They also have two stomachs—a human stomach and a horse stomach—which means they eat large quantities of both human and equine food. In the animated adaption of ''The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe'', they are portrayed as having blonde hair and clean-shaven faces or black haired and full bearded, with brown horse bodies. In the ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (TV serial)|BBC adaptation]]'', they are not seen in "The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe" episodes, though a statue of a centaur could be seen near the [[White Witch]]'s throne. In the "Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader" episodes, Glenstorm is portrayed as having a white horse body and golden-brown hair and beard. A centaur appears again in several scenes in "The Silver Chair" episodes, again having a white horse body but has white hair and beard. In the 2005 film ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'', many centaurs are portrayed and they are seen throughout Aslan's camp and in the battle. Their leader is General [[Oreius]], who has black fleece and hair. They use a variety of swords and lances in battle. Female centaurs are portrayed as members of [[Peter Pevensie|Peter Pevensie's]] army, being positioned alongside the dwarfs as [[Archery|archers]]. They appear again in the 2008 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'', which depicts entire families of centaurs including centaur children. The centaurs of Narnia are based on the centaur [[Chiron]] who unlike the other centaurs was a noble, wise, and powerful being.

* '''Cruel''' - Cruels are followers of The White Witch. They were not further described [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]].

==D==
* '''[[Deer]]''' - (See [[#S|Stag]])

* '''[[Dog]]''' - The talking dogs of Narnia are intelligent creatures, although they retain much of their canine behaviour. For instance, one group of dogs is described as putting "their front paws on the shoulders of the humans and licking their faces". Dogs consider it a great offense to be called a "boy" or especially a "girl" by another dog. This is considered to be the same sort of insult as a human calling another human a "dog" [[The Last Battle|(LB)]], and as a veiled reference to the English insult "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]".

* '''[[Donkey]]''' - Lewis portrays donkeys as kind but foolish beasts. Only one donkey named Puzzle is ever mentioned by name in the novels. He is a talking donkey who is tricked by Shift the ape and plays a key role in [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. Although no other donkeys are mentioned by name, they do make occasional appearances such as when [[Silenus]] is seen riding upon a donkey during the Bacchanalia [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]], and when prince Rabadash is cursed to turn into one by Aslan in [[A Horse and His Boy|(HHB)]].

* '''[[Dragon]]''' - Dragons are scaly fire-breathing creatures with bat-like wings. They exist throughout various regions of the Narnian world. A dragon is recorded as having once lived on an island in the Eastern Sea where he guarded a hoard of treasure. It is possible for a person to turn into a dragon by sleeping on this pile of treasure [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|(VDT)]]. In the [[Underland (Narnia)|Underland]]s, there are "dozens of strange animals lying on the turf, either dead or asleep, Jill could not tell which. These were mostly of a dragonish or bat-like sort" [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]]. At the end of time in ''[[The Last Battle]]'', these creatures wake and begin "crawling and sliding down into Narnia" appearing as "great dragons and giant lizards". The dragons, salamanders, and featherless birds with bat-like wings uprooted the trees until they grew old and died. Dragons are generally sapient beings even though they cannot talk, for it is possible for a human to communicate with them [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]]. There is also a stone statue of what appears to be a dragon in the courtyard of The White Witch [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. (See also [[#S|Salamander]])

* '''[[Dryad]]''' - (See [[#N|Nymph]])

* '''Duffer or Dufflepud''' - (See [[#M|Monopod]])

* '''[[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]]''' - Dwarfs, or "The Sons of Earth" exist in Narnia in two separate varieties: Black Dwarfs and Red Dwarfs. Black Dwarfs are so called for their dark beards that are "as thick and hard as horsehair", while Red Dwarfs have hair "rather like a Fox's" [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]. In Narnia, dwarfs are around {{convert|3|ft|m}} tall. Throughout the books, the Black Dwarfs tend to side with the White Witch while the Red Dwarfs usually side with [[Aslan]]. An example of this is shown in ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' where a Black Dwarf, Nikabrik, defends the White Witch, saying that she is "not an enemy to the Dwarfs [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]", while Trumpkin, a Red Dwarf, is loyal to the King. [[Prince Caspian]]'s tutor, Doctor Cornelius, is said to be descended from Dwarfs and humans (in the 2008 film, he specifies that his mother was a Black Dwarf). There are also "evil dwarfs" present among the witch's horde at the sacrifice of Aslan [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]] Their appearance and loyalties aside, the Red and Black Dwarfs seem to be otherwise similar. Dwarfs live in small, tight knit communities. There is never any mention of female dwarfs in the books, although it is possible for there to be females of dwarfish descent, as the males are said to occasionally mingle and reproduce with human women. However, female dwarfs are depicted in [[Walt Disney Pictures]] films, and feature prominently in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]]''. There is also a deleted scene in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' where, while walking through Jadis's courtyard, Edmund glimpses a statue of a female dwarf in the arms of her husband. Dwarfs are prolific smiths, miners, and carpenters. In battle, they are renowned archers and can march all day and all night without becoming tired [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. Late in the series the distinction between Black and Red Dwarfs begins to fade as they become increasingly uninterested in the dealings of men. Eventually nearly all of the Dwarfs adopt the mantra "the Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs" and kill anybody who crosses their path, be they good or evil. They are the only creatures to completely reject Aslan's return and thus become blinded to the paradise that Narnia has become [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. In Narnia the plural for Dwarf is "dwarfs" rather than "dwarves". In the original illustrations by Pauline Baynes, dwarfs were drawn very traditionally, with long beards, pointed caps, etc. while in more recent illustrations their appearance has varied.''

==E==
* '''[[Eagle]]''' - Eagles are quick, keen hunters. Lewis writes that it is "a treat to watch their grace and ease", and that they have strange voices [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. One notable eagle is Far-sight. Eagles also rescue [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]].

* '''Earthmen''' - Earthmen are the [[gnome]]-like natives of [[Bism]], a land which lies far beneath the surface of the Narnian earth. In ''[[The Silver Chair]]'', the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]] places the Earthmen under an enchantment and forces them to dig a tunnel to the surface of Narnia in preparation for her invasion. They seem to take this duty very seriously, for when [[Eustace Scrubb|Eustace]] and [[Jill Pole|Jill]] encounter them they "all carried three-pronged spears in their hands, and all were dreadfully pale, and all stood as still as statues." However, despite such uniform behaviour they vary greatly in appearance. Lewis states that they are "of all sizes, from little gnomes barely a foot high to stately figures taller than men." Later he remarks that "some had tails and others not, some wore great beards and others had very round, smooth faces, big as pumpkins. There were long, pointed noses, and long, soft noses like small trunks, and great blobby noses. Several had single horns in the middle of their foreheads". [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]].

* '''[[Ifrit|Efreet]]''' - are briefly mentioned in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]].

* '''[[Elephant]]''' - The elephants are among the largest animals in Narnia. The talking elephants shrink noticeably however when Aslan creates the talking beasts. The first elephant is present at the First Council of Narnia and his wife vainly takes great pride in the length of her trunk [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]].

* '''[[Jötunn|Ettin]]''' - Ettins are followers of the [[White Witch]] [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. They are described to be a type of giant that has either two heads or four arms, but never both. It seems this connection may be shared in Narnia, as they lend their name to the Giant-inhabited land of Ettinsmoor [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]]. (See [[#G|Giant]])

==F==
* '''[[Fairy]]''' - Lore often portrayed Fairies as tiny specks of light with the ability to change their appearance. A common superstitious belief in the Middle Ages said that Fairies would sometimes secretly replace a human child with one of their own so that it could be nourished by a human mother. Mentioned in "The Magician's Nephew."

* '''[[Falcon]]''' - Lucy mentions how the Pevensies used falcons during their hunting parties back when they were kings and queens [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|(VDT)]].

* '''[[Faun]]''' - Fauns, or the son of woods, are woodland creatures with the legs of a goat and the upper body of a human. They characteristically have curly hair, glossy black hair and fur, small horns resembling those of a goat, and long tails. They enjoy dancing and playing music, and their faces are simultaneously "mournful and merry". One faun, [[Mr Tumnus]] is the first character [[Lucy Pevensie]] meets when she enters Narnia. Dryads frequently join in their dances, while Naiads and Satyrs join in occasionally. In classical mythology of the sort that Lewis employs, there are never female fauns. Male fauns typically reproduce with nymphs, or sometimes, human women, although it is unknown if this point is shared in Narnia [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. In the 2005 film, their fur and hair is brown or blondish instead of black, they have slender goat legs, and have regular goat tails instead of long tails. In the [[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|2008 movie]], faun children can be seen during the Old Narnians' parade through the Telmarine village.

* '''[[Fish]]''' - The fish that inhabit the Narnian waterways are wide and varied, but are known to include earthly fish including [[trout]] [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]] as well species indigenous to Narnia such as [[#P|pavenders]]. In the books it is not specified whether or not there are talking fish in Narnia, although none are ever mentioned.

* '''[[Fox]]''' - Foxes are sly, intelligent creatures. A fox is present at the Christmas party where the [[White Witch]] turns the merry-makers into stone [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. Another fox bites the Giant Wimbleweather when he treads on its tail [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]. A fox called Slinkey joins the Calormene side in the last battle. [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]. In the film version of [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]], a fox (voiced by [[Rupert Everett]]) saves the Pevensies by helping them escape from the White Witch's secret police and is the same fox whom the White Witch later turns to stone.

==G==
* '''[[Ghoul]]''' - Ghouls are followers of The White Witch [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. They live in [[Calormen]] as well as Narnia, where they are known to live among graves, such as the Tombs of the Ancient Kings [[The Horse and his Boy|(HHB)]]. They are included in the 2005 film where they are portrayed as pale [[goblin]]-like creatures, with slit-nostrils, and long, skeletal arms and legs, and are sometimes confused with goblins and boggles.

* '''[[Giant]]''' - Giants are tall, ugly, and often dim-witted creatures. There is a clear distinction between the giants of Narnia itself and those living outside it, mainly to its north. Narnian giants tend to be good-natured, such as the Buffins, who are "one of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia." [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. Notable Giants include Rumblebuffin [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]], Wimbleweather [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]], and Stonefoot [[The Last Battle|(LB)]], all of whom fight on the side of the Pevensies in their respective battles. When Prince [[Rilian]] went missing, there were "good giants" among the Narnians who were lost trying to find him. Conversely, the many Giants who live in the lands that lie North of Narnia are far more negative characters. The Giants of Ettinsmoor, directly north of the Narnian border, are moronic, disorganized, fight each other with stone hammers, and speak an incomprehensible language with long strings of syllables (they seem the only ones not to speak what is an otherwise universally spoken language in the Narnian world). Further north are the wicked Giants of Harfang [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]] who are better organized and speak comprehensibly but for whom humans (and talking animals) are often a source of amusement, entertainment, or occasionally sources of food. Harfang seems a remnant of an ancient big City of Giants, of which only ruins are left and whose King at one time had pretensions of universal power. The northern Giants occasionally invade Narnia - especially in periods when civil strife among the Narnians gives the Giants a feeling that their neighbor is in a weak condition. Both High King Peter and King Caspian X had to confront such incursions by Giants, in the aftermath of the respective wars in which they gained their power. A two-headed Giant named Pire is turned into a mountain as mentioned in [[The Horse and his Boy]]. (See also [[#E|Ettin]], [[#O|Ogre]])

* '''[[God]]''' - There are several sorts of "gods" that appear and are mentioned in the Chronicles. There are the wild people of Narnia, such as the nymphs, satyrs, fauns, and centaurs, the male Dryads and Naiads are called wood gods and river gods respectively, though these sorts of "gods" are not worshipped as deities and are probably not immortal. There are also gods such as Bacchus, Silenus, Pomona, and the maenads, though these too, are also not worshipped. Then there are the gods of the Calormene pantheon, such as Tash, Azaroth, and Zardeenah, though only Tash has appeared in living form, but is proven to be a demon, and the rest may simply be mythical or abstract entities worshipped in Calormen. Then there is Aslan himself; though he is never referred to as a "god", he is hailed and revered as such and has proven to be immortal and is the creator of the Narnian universe itself. It is noted that Aslan is the son of the Emperor Over-the-Sea (from beyond the sea who live in the east). However, Lewis probably meant Aslan as a reference to [[Jesus Christ]] and the Emperor Over-the-Sea being the [[Christian God]] himself.

* '''[[Gnome]]''' - (See [[#E|Earthmen]])

* '''[[Griffin|Gryphon]]''' - Gryphons are winged creatures that are brown in appearance. They have head and wings of an [[eagle]] (with curved beaks) and the body of a lion. They are seen in the movies as followers of Aslan and helping him in battle in both "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" and "Prince Caspian."

* '''[[Gull]]''' - Mentioned in [[Prince Caspian|PC]]. Not known if they can talk.

==H==
* '''[[Hag]]''' - Hags are followers of The White Witch who help bind [[Aslan]] to the Stone Table in [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]. They appear extremely loyal to the Witch as one Hag later attempts to bring back the ghost of the Witch through sorcery. She is described as having a "shrill, whining voice", and calls herself a "poor old woman". Her nose and chin stick out "like a pair of nut-crackers", and she has dirty grey hair [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]. The old hag appears in [[Prince Caspian]] and with her evil sidekick a Werewolf. She and her bloodthirsty friend try to bring the [[White Witch]] back to life through black magic. Fortunately their plan is ruined when King Peter and his crew arrive and kill them both with Trumpkin behead her. In the Disney films, they are bird-faced humanoids with talons. They are portrayed by [[Barbara Kellerman]] (in the BBC version) and [[Klara Issova]] (in the Disney version).

* '''[[Half-breed|Half-Breed]]''' - Half-Breeds are beings that have been born from parents who are not of the same species. The sons and daughters of King Frank and Queen Helen married Dryads and Naiads and had children with them, from these came the Archenlanders and later the Calormenes. Jadis and her race were said to be descendents from the unions of Giants and Jinn. During the reign of Miraz and the Telmarines, dwarfs disguised themselves as humans and interbred with humans, and from these unions came the Half-Dwarfs, including Dr. Cornelius and Caspian's nurse. Prince Rilian, and his descendents, are part-Star, since Prince Rillian's mother, Caspian's wife, was the daughter of the Star Ramandu.

* '''[[Hamadryad]]''' - (See [[#N|Nymph]])

* '''[[Hare]]''' - One of the Old Narnians Caspian is first introduced to is a hare called Camillo. [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]. Jewel the unicorn tells Jill about the legendary Hare Moonwood of old. [[The Last Battle|(LB)]].

* '''[[Hedgehog]]''' - Hedgehogs are members of Caspian's army in [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} One of the creatures Caspian is introduced to when he meets the Old Narnians is a hedgehog called Hogglestock. [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]] One of the first creatures Shasta meets in Narnia is a rather slow-witted hedgehog. [[The Horse and his Boy|(HHB)]].

* '''Horror '''- Creatures on the Witch's side present at the Stone Table when Aslan is to be bound. No further explanation is given on their description.

* '''[[Horse]]''' - Both speechless and talking horses exist in Narnia. While the speechless variety are often used as mounts and pack animals, a talking horse will only allow itself to be ridden during desperate times, such as war. The Calormenes sometimes capture Narnian foals who consequently grow up in Calormen and live there in slavery. Bree and Hwin manage to escape. In the Battle of Anvard, the soldiers that fought the Calormen army rode talking horses and non-talking horses [[The Horse and his Boy|(HHB)]]. When the Calormenes invade Narnia, they force grown talking horses to work for them. In the 2005 film, Edmund rides a talking horse named Phillip.

* '''[[Human]]''' - Humans are often seen as inhabitants of Earth. There were occasions throughout the series of children visiting Narnia. Narnia also has different kinds of humans.
** '''Archenlander''' - A race of humans that reside in Archenland.
** '''Calormene''' - A race of humans that resie in Calormen. The Calormen were mostly dark-skinned where the men were mostly bearded. The Calormenes have often made plans to invade Narnia and Archenland.
** '''Telmarine''' - The Telmarines are a race of humans that originally came to Earth. They were originally a group of [[Piracy|pirates]] who intermarried with women from islands in the Pacific and found an island with a cave that had an entrance to Narnian world. The pirates found the land of Telmar uninhabited, the original colony of Calormenes having been turned into dumb beasts by Aslan for their behaviour and destroyed each other. The Telmarines prospered for years until a famine struck their land. The Telmarines led by Caspian I then took over parts of Narnia for years. Caspian X (the son of the usurped Caspian IX) and the Pevensie children were able to defeat Miraz' forces and liberate Narnia. Some of the Telmarines chose to return to Earth while others chose to remain in Narnia.

==I==
* '''[[Incubus]]''' - Incubi are followers of the [[White Witch]] [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. In folklore, they are lusty male demons who cause nightmares and assume the form of handsome men and seduce women in their sleep. Their female counterparts are called [[Succubus|Succubi]].

* '''[[Insect]]s''' - [[Bee]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[Butterfly|butterflies]] are each mentioned throughout the series.

==J==
* '''[[Jackal]]''' - Jackals are a variety of wild dogs. They are mentioned as living near the Tombs of the ancient Kings, near Tashbaan [[The Horse and his Boy|(HHB)]].

* '''[[Western jackdaw|Jackdaw]]''' - A jackdaw is a type of bird in northern Europe and Asia, related to the crow. They were also one of the first animals to be created by Aslan. It was a jackdaw that made the first joke in Narnia, to which [[Aslan]] replies: "You have not made the first joke; you have only been the first joke." [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]] Some sources say that this first jackdaw was named Joke.

* '''[[Jinn]]''' - Jinn are the descendants of Lilith who possessed both innate magical abilities, very high intellect and uncommon physical beauty. Residing on the world of Charn, they interbred with giants and from these unions came the race of Jinn/Giants of Charn whom Jadis is descended from.

==K==
* '''[[Kangaroo]]''' -  A kangaroo is one of the stone statues in the castle of the [[White Witch]] [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]].

* '''[[Kingfisher]]''' - A kingfisher is mentioned in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]].

* '''[[Kraken]]''' - In [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|(VDT)]], the Kraken is said to be one of the three most dangerous sea creatures in [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. The other two dangerous sea creatures are the [[squid]]s and the [[sea serpent]]s where all three of them are feared by the Sea People.

==L==
* '''[[Sheep|Lamb]]''' - At one point, [[Aslan]] symbolically transforms into a lamb [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|(VDT)]]. Another lamb asks some searching questions of Shift the Ape in [[The Last Battle]].

* '''[[Leopard]]''' - Leopards are ferocious though honourable creatures. It is they who are entrusted with bearing Aslan's crown and sceptre in [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]. The Southern Cat Battalion, by some sources, was Queen Susan's royal guard during the Golden Age. In the 2005 film, Susan was crowned "Queen Susan the Gentle of the Radiant Southern Sun," and thus the Battalion was named after her title.

* '''[[Lion]]''' - Talking lions are among the most respected creatures in all Narnia. [[Aslan]], the creator and ruler of Narnia, is a lion. At one point, a talking lion becomes boastful when Aslan refers to the two of them as "us lions" after it was restored from its petrified state. [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. It is mentioned that some Narnian hunters seek out non-talking lions, presumably for sport [[The Last Battle|(TLB)]].

==M==
* '''Man-Headed Bull''' - There is a follower of Aslan who is described as a "bull with a man's head". With a "great bellowing voice" it openly defies the [[White Witch]]'s claim that [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]]'s blood is her property.  This reverse version of the classical [[Minotaur]] stands in contrast to Lewis's Minotaurs, who follow the White Witch [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. The Man-Headed Bull is not mentioned in subsequent books and in television and film adaptations. It appears only in the [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film)|1979 animated film]]. This creature is similar in appearance to the [[Kudan (yōkai)|Kudan]].

* '''Marsh-wiggles'''{{Anchor|Marsh-wiggles}} - Marsh-wiggles are a race of [[frog]]-like [[humanoid]]s that inhabit the marshes of northern Narnia, south of the [[River Shribble]]. They are described as having large ears and green-grey [[dreadlocks]]. They have strong leathery skin and very long limbs attached to short torsos. Both their hands and their feet are webbed, as it says in ''[[The Silver Chair]]'', "like a [[duck]]'s". Internally, they are evidently significantly different from [[human]]s, although the difference is not specified. For instance, when [[Puddleglum]]'s hand was chewed by Golg (one of the [[#E|Earthmen]]), it is not nearly as damaged as it would have been if Puddleglum had been a human. Marsh-wiggles are known for their pessimistic and depressed outlook on life. They live in large [[wigwam]]s usually set apart from one another, as Marsh-wiggles like their privacy. They are not a very technologically advanced race, but they do possess both bows and swords. Marsh-wiggles fish for food. They usually catch and consume a creature known as a mudfish, but are very fond of [[eel]]s when they can get them. The tobacco that they use gives off smoke that is heavier than air. It is said that they mix the tobacco with mud. They also consume a strong, unnamed [[alcohol|alcoholic beverage]]. Marsh-wiggles do most of the work relating to water and fish in Narnia. [[Jill Pole]] and [[Eustace Scrubb]] are ferried across the [[Fords of Beruna]] by a marsh-wiggle. Marsh-wiggles also help dock ships at [[Cair Paravel]]. The only Marsh-wiggle named in the series is [[Puddleglum]] who appears in ''The Silver Chair''.&lt;ref&gt;The now defunct American [[folk-rock]] band, [[The Marshwiggles]] (of whom [[David Wolfenberger]] was a founding member) took their name from this [[Narnia (world)|Narnian]] character.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "marsh-wiggle" may be derived from "Marshwiggle Way", a footpath near [[Grosvenor Grammar School]] in [[Knock, Belfast|Knock]] in East Belfast, which Lewis may have known as a child.  

* '''[[Maenad]]''' - (See [[#N|Nymph]])

* '''Merpeople''' - Merpeople are half human and half fish. They sing at the coronation of the four Pevensie children [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. Merpeople can thus breathe both air and water, unlike the more human but completely aquatic [[#S|Sea People]]. In the 2005 Disney film, they are shown to have long, blueish, silvery tails with pinkish fins. An illustration by Pauline Bayes shows them as blonde-haired men and women, with rosy pale skin and green tails and fins, adorned with seaweed and pearls and carrying tridents.

* '''[[Minotaur]]''' - Minotaurs have the head of a bull and the body of a man. They are followers of the White Witch, and are present both at Aslan's death and at the ensuing battle [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]. In the movies, they are more bull-like with bull legs, tails and body fur. In the film, the general of the White Witch's army is a minotaur called Otmin. In the 2008 adaption of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]]'', Minotaurs join the Old Narnians in fighting the Telmarines. In the old animated version, they fought for Aslan despite the White Witch mentioning that she had Minotaur minions.

* '''[[Mole (animal)|Mole]]''' - The talking moles of Narnia are excellent tunnelers and gardeners. During the reign of the Pevensie children, the chief mole, Lilygloves, plants an apple orchard which the Pevensies partake of when they return hundreds of years later. In ''[[Prince Caspian]]'', the moles are keen to propose digging trenches. Later in the same book, Clodsley Shovel and his moles dig up turf for the treepeople to eat.

* '''[[Monopod (creature)|Monopod]]''' (also called '''Dufflepud''') - Monopods are a variety of one-legged [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]]. Lewis specifies that this leg is directly under their torso and "not to one side like the leg of a one-legged man". Their feet are described as "enormous... with the toes curling up a little". They occasionally use their foot as a boat and row themselves around with paddles. They were once normal dwarfs ruled by the fallen star [[Coriakin]]. However, they rejected him in favor of their Chief and were transformed into their present state as punishment. They are not as clever as the other dwarfs and follow the word of their Chief to the letter. [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|(VDT)]].

* '''[[Mouse]]''' - Unlike the other talking animals, mice did not gain the gift of speech during Narnia's creation. Instead they were given it as a gift for their kindness, after a group of them chewed Aslan free from his bonds as he lay dead on the Stone Table. The talking mice, including [[Reepicheep]] and Peepiceek, are larger than normal mice. They are loyal, brave, and noble creatures, and excellent with swords [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].

==N==
* '''[[Naiad]]''' - (See [[#N|Nymph]])

* '''[[Nymph]]''' - Nymphs are nature spirits that live in the trees and waters. They are capable of leaving their tree or watery domains and assuming a physical body resembling human form. They are so spiritually tied to their places of nature that, if it is destroyed, the nymph bound to that place dies with it. Nymphs are originally from classical mythology, and although there are no male nymphs in mythology, Lewis does mention male wood gods and river gods as being related to nymphs in his books. Wood nymphs and water nymphs were present at Aslan's camp playing harps upon the arrival of the Pevensies and the Beavers.
** '''[[Dryad]]s''' - Dryads are tree nymphs that are capable of leaving their trees and assuming a physical body similar to human form. Each individual dryad is bound to a specific tree and if that tree dies, its dryad will die as well. Dryads are fond of dancing and often dance with fauns. They are described as having heads crowned with leaves, wearing garments matching the colors of their specific trees and as having their trees' physical characteristics (i.e. pale, slender birch girls; queenly, graceful beeches; melancholy elms). In addition to dryads, hamadryads, silvans and tree people are also mentioned, but it is unknown if they are a separate species of nymph or if they are just synonymous titles for dryads. [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]], [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]], [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]], [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]], and [[The Last Battle|(LB)]].
** '''[[Hamadryad]]s''' - Hamadryads are tree nymphs similar to dryads, but the books do not establish whether they are a separate kind of tree spirit or simply dryads with a synonymous nickname. In Greek tales, they are sometimes described as the nymphs of oak trees, or as dryads who simply live in their trees, but are unable to leave, or as the dryads who die with their trees. [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].
** '''Sylvans''' - Sylvans are tree spirits, although Lewis does not tell the reader whether they are a separate kind of tree spirit or if they are simply dryads with a synonymous nickname. Silvan means "related to trees".
** '''Wood gods''' - Wood gods are male tree spirits. They inhabit and are spiritually tied to trees like, oaks, elms, hollies, and rowans. Like the wood nymphs, they are capable of leaving their trees and assuming physical bodies or using their trees as their bodies. They also are spiritually bound to their trees, and die if their trees are cut down. [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]], [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]], and [[The Last Battle|(LB)]]
** '''[[Trees in mythology|Tree People]]''' - Tree People are wood gods and goddesses who use their trees as their physical bodies. Lewis doesn't specify whether they are the same as any of the other spirits or a unique species. They are described as beautiful giants and giantesses who have branch-like hair and fingers. They have roots for feet and wade in the earth like humans do in water. A whole swarm of trees dance sleepily around Lucy and Aslan when they are reunited, and even aid the Old Narnian army in defeating the Telmarines. During the Hundred Years' Winter, many tree spirits turned evil and joined the White Witch's side; however, generations later, they aid the Old Narnian army in defeating the Telmarines. Lewis states that tree people usually eat a variety of soils, such as loam or bits of silver sand and the like [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].
** '''[[Naiad]]s''' - Naiads are nymphs of the rivers, wells, and streams. They can leave their watery domains and assume physical bodies resembling human form. When a stone bridge is built over a river, the naiads in it will become imprisoned in the river. They have been known to dance with fauns and dryads occasionally. Four river nymphs are mentioned as being train bearers for Queen Helen. Although no specific description is given, Pauline Baynes does draw them as pretty women wearing gowns in various shades of blue and sometimes wearing rushes on their heads like the river gods. They were omitted from the first two films, but are portrayed in the 2010 film. They take the place of the Sea People and are portrayed as having bodies made entirely out of water, and were intended to have legs, but were given tails like fish or dolphins instead when diving over the waves. [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]], [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]], and [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].
** '''[[Potamoi|River Gods]]''' - River Gods are male water spirits. As their name states, they only inhabit rivers while water nymphs may inhabit other bodies of water also. One River God is mentioned rising out of the Great River of Narnia with his nymph daughters, and other river gods are mentioned as becoming husbands to the daughters of King Frank and Queen Helen. Another River God is mentioned lifting his head from the river with the river nymphs upon hearing Aslan's roar. He appears again and asks Aslan to "loose his chains," i.e. destroy the bridge that crosses his river at Beruna [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]] [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]]. In the 2008 film of [[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]], the river god is digitally portrayed as a giant man made entirely out of water with hair and beard made of foam, who rushes at the Telmarines, creating tidal waves and even destroying the bridge. In an illustration in [[Prince Caspian]], the River God is depicted as a giant man with his head crowned with rushes, and covered with swampy muck and moss; however, the River God in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' is depicted as a normal-sized, elderly man, his head still crowned with rushes, but dressed in a blue robe and a green cloak.
** '''[[Maenad]]s''' - The Maenads are followers of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], and are described as "wild, madcap young girls". They are physically identical to human girls, and are not proper nymphs, such as Dryads and Naiads. They were omitted from the 2008 film. [[Prince Caspian|(PC)]].
** '''[[Silenus]]''' - Silenus is the tutor of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and part of his entourage, depicted as a portly drunk riding a donkey. In classical mythology, Silenus is one of the Sileni, represented as fat men or as part men, part donkeys similar to Fauns. Silenus was omitted from the 2008 film.
** '''People of the Toadstools''' - The People of the Toadstools are followers of the [[White Witch]]. No physical description is ever given of them. In illustrations of the battle and Aslan's sacrifice, they are drawn as large toadstools that have roots that are used as limbs. [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|(LWW)]]
** '''Nymphs of Poisonous Plants''' - The nymphs of poisonous plants are mentioned as followers of The White Witch during Aslan's sacrifice at the Stone Table.

* '''[[Owl]]''' - An owl is present at the first Council of Narnia [[The Magician's Nephew|(MN)]].

==P==
* '''[[Black panther|Panther]]''' - Panthers are mentioned as troops in the Narnian army during the siege at Anvard [[The Horse and His Boy|(HHB)]]. A panther also is mentioned in aiding the dwarfs and moles in getting Eustace, Jill, Puddleglum, Rilian, and the horses out from underground [[The Silver Chair|(SC)]]. A black panther is shown fighting with Prince Caspian in the [[Disney]] adaption of the book.

* '''Pavender''' - A pavender is a small, rainbow-colored fish native to Narnia. The Pevensie children catch and eat pavenders on the island of [[Cair Paravel]] in ''[[Prince Caspian]]''.

They are ruled by their king whom Lucy briefly glimpses while aboard the Dawn Treader. He and his knights ride large sea horses as mounts. Sea People often fear krakens, sea serpents, and squids.

It came up on what they first took to be a huge neck, but as more and more of it emerged everyone knew that this was not its neck but its body ...

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Pinguicula'' species}}
:''This article is a list of the butterworts, the species of the genus [[Pinguicula]].  For general information on butterworts, please see the [[Pinguicula|main article on Pinguicula]].''

The genus ''[[Pinguicula]]'' contains the 83 species of butterworts, belonging to the bladderwort family ([[Lentibulariaceae]]).  It has a natural distribution across most of the Northern Hemisphere, though over half of the species are concentrated in Mexico and Central America. [[Siegfried Jost Casper]] [[systematics|systematically]] divided them into three [[subgenus|subgenera]] with 15 [[Section (botany)|sections]]. Subsequent [[phylogenetic]] research showed that many of these groupings are [[polyphyletic]], but they are used below.

The seismic velocities very near the surface ({{nowrap|≲ 220±30 km}}) are markedly lower than at greater depths, demarking the LVZ.]]

The '''low-velocity zone''' (LVZ) occurs close to the boundary between the [[lithosphere]] and the [[asthenosphere]] in the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It is characterized by unusually low [[S-wave|seismic shear wave]] velocity compared to the surrounding depth intervals.  This range of depths also corresponds to anomalously high electrical conductivity.It is present between about 80 and 300&amp;nbsp;km depth. This appears to be universally present for S waves, but may be absent in certain regions for P waves.&lt;ref name=Stixrude&gt;

{{cite journal|title=Mineralogy and elasticity of the oceanic upper mantle: Origin of the low-velocity zone |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=110 |page=B03204 |url=http://supercronopio.es.ucl.ac.uk/~crlb/RESEARCH/PAPERS/StixrudeCLB05a.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830060832/http://supercronopio.es.ucl.ac.uk/~crlb/RESEARCH/PAPERS/StixrudeCLB05a.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-30 |doi=10.1029/2004JB002965 |date=2005 |author1=L Stixrude |author2=C Lithgow-Bertolloni |lastauthoramp=yes |bibcode=2005JGRB..11003204S }}

&lt;/ref&gt; A second low-velocity zone (not generally referred to as the LVZ, but as [[Ultra low velocity zone|ULVZ]]) has been detected in a thin ≈50&amp;nbsp;km layer at the [[core-mantle boundary]].&lt;ref name=Rost&gt;

{{cite book |title=Superplumes: beyond plate tectonics |author=EJ Garnero, MS Thorne, A McNamara &amp; S Rost |editor1=David A Yuen |editor2=Shigenori Maruyama |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BnTZbh6FJMC&amp;pg=PA139 |page=139 |chapter=Chapter 6: Fine-scale ultra-low-velocity zone layering at the core-mantle boundary and superplumes |isbn=1-4020-5749-0 |date=2007 |publisher=Springer}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  These LVZs may have important implications for plate tectonics and the origin of the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=Stixrude/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

The LVZ has been interpreted to indicate the presence of a significant degree of [[partial melting]], and alternatively as a natural consequence of a thermal boundary layer and the effects of pressure and temperature on the elastic wave velocity of mantle components in the solid state.&lt;ref name=Stixrude/&gt; In any event, a very limited amount of melt (about 1%) is needed to produce these effects. Water in this layer can lower the melting point, and may play an important part in its composition.&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;

{{cite book |title=Global tectonics |author1=Philip Kearey |author2=Keith A. Klepeis |author3=Frederick J. Vine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYqZntfg25UC&amp;pg=PA32 |page=32 |isbn=1-4051-0777-4 |date=2009 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |edition=3rd}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Venus&gt;
It is hypothesized that the absence of plate tectonics on the planet [[Venus]] is due to the absence of water in its crust and upper mantle. Cooling occurs largely through [[mantle plume]]s. See {{cite book |title=Plates, plumes, and paradigms; ''Volume 388 of Special papers'' |author=Gillian R. Foulger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z74GC0rA5kC&amp;pg=PA857 |page=857 |isbn=0-8137-2388-4 |date=2005 |publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification==
The existence of the low-velocity zone was first proposed from the observation of slower than expected seismic wave arrivals from [[earthquake]]s in 1959 by [[Beno Gutenberg]].&lt;ref name="Bruno"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutenberg|first=B.|title=Physics of the Earth's Interior|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=New York|date=1959|pages=240|isbn=0-12-310650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that between 1° to 15° from the epicenter the longitudinal arrivals showed an exponential decrease in amplitude after which they showed a sudden large increase. The presence of a low-velocity layer that defocussed the seismic energy, followed by a high velocity gradient that concentrated it, provided an explanation for these observations.&lt;ref name="Don"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=D.L.|title=Theory of the Earth|publisher=[[Blackwell Scientific Publications]]|location=Boston|date=1989|chapter=3. The Crust and Upper Mantle|url=http://caltechbook.library.caltech.edu/14/4/TOE03.pdf|accessdate=2010-02-20|isbn=0-521-84959-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:S-wave velocity.PNG|250px|thumb|Velocity of seismic ''S''-waves in the Earth near the surface in three tectonic provinces: TNA= Tectonic North America SNA= Shield North America &amp; ATL = North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=Anderson1&gt;

Figure patterned after {{cite book |title=New theory of the earth |author=Don L Anderson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KB3KsIPa94sC&amp;pg=PA102 |page=102, Figure 8.6 |isbn=0-521-84959-4 |date=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}; Original figure attributed to Grand &amp; Helmberger (1984)

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The LVZ shows a reduction in velocity of about 3&amp;ndash;6% with the effect being more pronounced with [[S-wave]]s compared to [[P-wave]]s.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=G.C.|author2=Mussett A.E. |title=The inaccessible earth|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|pages=235|isbn=978-0-04-550028-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5QVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=asthenosphere+%22low-velocity+zone%22&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=asthenosphere%20%22low-velocity%20zone%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-02-20|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is evident from the figure, the reduction and depth over which reduction occurs varies with the choice of tectonic province, that is, regions differ in their seismic characteristics. Following the drop, the base of the zone is marked by an increase in velocity, but it has not been possible to decide whether this transition is sharp or gradual. This lower boundary, found beneath the continental lithosphere and oceanic lithosphere away from [[mid-ocean ridges]], is sometimes referred to as the [[Lehmann discontinuity]] and occurs at about 220±30&amp;nbsp;km depth. The interval also shows a reduction in Q, the seismic quality factor (representing a relatively high degree of seismic attenuation), and a relatively high [[electrical conductivity]].

The LVZ is present at the base of the lithosphere except in areas of thick continental shield where no velocity anomaly is apparent.

==Interpretation==
The interpretation of these observations is complicated by the effects of seismic anisotropy, which may greatly reduce the actual scale of the velocity anomaly.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; However, because of the reductions in Q and electrical [[resistivity]] in the LVZ, it is generally interpreted as a zone in which there is a small degree of partial melting. For this to occur at the depths where the LVZ is observed, small amounts of water and/or carbon dioxide must be present to depress the melting point of the silicate minerals. Only 0.05&amp;ndash;0.1 % water would be sufficient to cause the 1% of melting necessary to produce the observed changes in physical properties. The lack of LVZ beneath continental shields is explained by the much lower geothermal gradient, preventing any degree of partial melting.&lt;ref name="Condie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condie|first=K.C.|title=Plate tectonics and crustal evolution|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|date=1997|pages=282|isbn=978-0-7506-3386-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrA6OQzsvgC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=mantle+%22low-velocity+zone%22++anisotropy&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=mantle%20%22low-velocity%20zone%22%20%20anisotropy&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">'''Mechanical vapor recompression''' (MVR) is an [[energy recovery]] process where energy is added to low-pressure [[vapor]] (usually [[water vapor]]) by [[Gas compressor|compressing it]]. The result is a smaller volume of vapor at a higher temperature and pressure, which can be used to do useful work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/steam11_waste_steam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spilling.info/applications-steam/steam-compression.html&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the compressed vapor can be used to heat the mother liquor to produce the low pressure vapor.

==Applications==
===Current===
Mechanical vapor recompression is used chiefly in industrial processes such as [[Vapor-compression evaporation|evaporation and distillation]]. Heat from the condenser, which would otherwise be lost, can be recovered and used in the evaporation process.

===Past===
MVR was used in the [[Cristiani compressed steam system]] for [[locomotive]] transmission. Although it was technically feasible, it failed to become popular because of its complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/compsteam/compsteam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) are:

*[[Multiple-effect evaporator|Multiple effect evaporation]] (MEE)

*[[Vapor-compression evaporation|Thermal vapor recompression]] (TVR) (also known as thermocompression)

A combination of the three methods may be used depending on the process.  For instance, a 3-effect evaporator circuit may be installed using MVR to transfer heat.

Its results suggest that certain common indoor plants may provide a natural way of removing [[toxic]] agents such as [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[trichloroethylene]] from the air, helping neutralize the effects of [[sick building syndrome]].

As well as absorbing [[carbon dioxide]] and releasing [[oxygen]], as all [[plant]]s do, these plants also eliminate significant amounts of [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[trichloroethylene]]. The second and third lists are from [[Bill Wolverton|B. C. Wolverton's]] book&lt;ref name="Wolverton1996"&gt;Wolverton, B. C. (1996) ''How to Grow Fresh Air''.

NASA researchers suggest efficient air cleaning is accomplished with at least one plant per 100 square feet of home or office space {{Citation needed|reason=This study concerned plants in sealed chambers, not an analog for the typical home or office.|date=August 2018}}.

'''Nano-suction''' is a technology that uses [[vacuum]], negative [[Pressure#Fluid pressure|fluid pressure]] and millions of nano-sized suction cups to securely adhere any object to a flat non-porous [[surface area|surface]]. When the nano-suction object is pressed against a flat surface, millions of miniature [[suction cup]]s create a large vacuum, generating a strong [[Suction|suction force]] that can hold a tremendous amount of weight. The nature of the technology allows easy removal without residue, and makes it reusable.

==Applications==
There have been a wide range of applications of nano-suction technology, also known as "anti-gravity", ranging from hooks, frames, mirrors, notepad organisers, mobile phone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/turn-iphone-mirror-bottle-opener-154315345.html|title="Turn your iPhone into a mirror, bottle opener, and more with Megaverse" |publisher=[[Yahoo!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">The '''Netherlands fallacy''' refers to an error  [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and his co-authors claim others make in assuming that the [[environmental impact]]s of the [[Netherlands]] and other rich nations are contained within their national borders.

[[Ecologist]]s since the late 20th century have analyzed the ecological sink status and sink capacities of poor nations. As [[Industrial pollution|polluting industries]] migrate from rich to poor nations, the national [[ecological footprint]] of rich nations shrinks, whereas the international ecological footprint may increase or also decrease. The nature of the [[fallacy]] is to ignore increasing environmental damage in many [[developing nations]] and in [[international waters]] attributable to the imported goods or changes in the economy of such nations directly due to [[developed nations]].

Such an approach may lead to incorrect assertions such as the environmental impact of a particular developed country is reducing, when a holistic, international approach suggests the opposite.  This may in turn support over-optimistic predictions toward the improvement of global environmental conditions.{{sfn|Ehrlich|Ehrlich|1990|pp=[https://web.archive.org/web/20060706131457/http://www.2think.org/tpe.shtml 39], 269}}

{{paleogene}}
The '''Paleocene''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|p|æ|l|i|ə|ˌ|s|iː|n|,_|ˈ|p|æ|-|,_|-|l|i|oʊ|-}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editors=Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''Palaeocene''', the "old recent", is a geological [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] that lasted from about {{ma|Paleocene|Eocene|million years ago}}. It is the first epoch of the [[Paleogene]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] in the modern [[Cenozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]]. As with many [[geologic timescale|geologic periods]], the [[Stratum|strata]] that define the epoch's beginning and end are well identified, but the exact ages remain uncertain.

The Paleocene Epoch is bracketed by two major events in Earth's history. It started with the mass [[extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]], known as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary]]. This was a time marked by the demise of non-avian [[dinosaur]]s, giant [[marine reptiles]] and much other [[fauna]] and [[flora]]. The die-off of the dinosaurs left unfilled ecological niches worldwide. The Paleocene ended with the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], a geologically brief (~0.2 million year) interval characterized by extreme changes in climate and carbon cycling.

The name "Paleocene" comes from [[Ancient Greek]] and refers to the "old(er)" ({{lang|grc|παλαιός}}, ''palaios'') "new" ({{lang|grc|καινός}}, ''kainos'') fauna that arose during the epoch.&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleocene|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Paleocene&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries and subdivisions==
The K–Pg boundary that marks the separation between Cretaceous and Paleocene is visible in the geological record of much of the Earth by a discontinuity in the fossil fauna and high [[iridium]] levels. There is also fossil evidence of abrupt changes in [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]. There is some evidence that a substantial but very short-lived climatic change may have happened in the very early decades of the Paleocene. There are several theories about the cause of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|K–Pg extinction event]], with most evidence supporting the impact of a 10&amp;nbsp;km [[diameter]] [[asteroid]] forming the buried [[Chicxulub crater]] on the coast of [[Yucatan]], [[Mexico]].

The end of the Paleocene (≈55.8 Ma) was also marked by a time of major change, one of the most significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Gavin A. Schmidt and Drew T. Shindell|title=Atmospheric composition, radiative forcing, and climate change as a consequence of a massive methane release from gas hydrates|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=18|issue=1|year=2003|url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2003/2003_Schmidt_Shindell.pdf|format=PDF|bibcode=2003PalOc..18.1004S|doi=10.1029/2002PA000757}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the extinction of numerous deep-sea benthic [[foraminifera]] and a major turnover in mammals on land.

The Paleocene is divided into three [[stage (geology)|stages]], the [[Danian]], the [[Selandian]] and the [[Thanetian]], as shown in the table above.  Additionally, the Paleocene is divided into six [[Mammal Paleogene zones]].

==Climate==
The early Paleocene was cooler and drier than the preceding Cretaceous, though temperatures rose sharply during the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. The climate became warm and humid worldwide towards the Eocene boundary, with subtropical vegetation growing in [[Greenland]] and [[Patagonia]], crocodilians swimming off the coast of Greenland, and early primates evolving in the tropical palm forests of northern [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/0301/warm/index.html |title=Science Notes 2003: |publisher=Scicom.ucsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's poles were cool and temperate; [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and southern [[South America]] were warm and temperate; equatorial areas had tropical climates; and north and south of the [[equator]]ial areas, climates were hot and arid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotese.com/paleocen.htm |title= Paleocene Climate |publisher=[[PaleoMap Project]] |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  not dissimilar to today's global desert belts around 30 degrees northern and southern latitude.

==Paleogeography==
In many ways, the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [[continent]]s continued to drift toward their present positions. [[Supercontinent]] [[Laurasia]] had not yet separated into three continents - [[Europe]] and [[Greenland]] were still connected, [[North America]] and [[Asia]] were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.&lt;ref name="Hooker"&gt;Hooker, J.J., "Tertiary to Present: Paleocene", pp. 459-465, Vol. 5. of Selley, Richard C., L. Robin McCocks, and Ian R. Plimer, Encyclopedia of Geology, Oxford: Elsevier Limited, 2005. {{ISBN|0-12-636380-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laramide orogeny]] of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch.

South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [[Neogene]]); the components of the former southern supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]] continued to split apart, with [[Africa]], South America, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north towards Europe, slowly closing the [[Tethys Ocean]], and [[India]] began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [[Himalayas]].

The inland seas in North America ([[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe had receded by the beginning of the Paleocene, making way for new land-based flora and fauna.

===Oceans===
Warm seas circulated throughout the world, including the poles. The earliest Paleocene featured a low diversity and abundance of marine life, but this trend reversed later in the epoch.&lt;ref name="Hooker"/&gt; Tropical conditions gave rise to abundant marine life, including [[coral reef]]s. With the demise of marine [[reptile]]s at the end of the Cretaceous, [[shark]]s became the top predators. At the end of the Cretaceous, the [[ammonites]] and many species of [[foraminifera]] became extinct.

Marine fauna also came to resemble modern fauna, with only the marine [[mammal]]s and the [[Carcharhinid]] sharks missing.

==Flora==
Terrestrial Paleocene strata immediately overlying the K–Pg boundary is in places marked by a "[[fern]] spike": a bed especially rich in fern [[fossil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vajda |first=Vivi |title=Global Disruption of Vegetation at the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary – A Comparison Between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere Palynological Signals |accessdate= 2006-07-15 |url= http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2004AM/finalprogram/abstract_81135.htm |publisher=Gsa.confex.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferns are often the first species to colonize areas damaged by [[forest fires]]; thus the fern spike may indicate post-[[Chicxulub crater]] devastation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phillip |last=Bigelow |title=The K–T boundary In The Hell Creek Formation |accessdate=2006-07-15 |url=http://www.scn.org/~bh162/k-t_boundary.html |publisher=Scn.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712181722/http://www.scn.org/~bh162/k-t_boundary.html |archivedate=2006-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the Paleocene is marked by the development of modern plant species. [[Cactus|Cacti]] and [[palm tree]]s appeared. Paleocene and later plant fossils are generally attributed to modern [[Genus|genera]] or to closely related taxa.

The warm temperatures worldwide gave rise to thick tropical, sub-tropical and deciduous forest cover around the globe (the first recognizably modern [[rainforest]]s) with ice-free polar regions covered with coniferous and deciduous trees.&lt;ref name="Hooker"/&gt; With no large [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]] dinosaurs to thin them, Paleocene forests were probably denser than those of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, ed., ''The Book of Life'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]), first seen in the Cretaceous, continued to develop and proliferate, and along with them coevolved the insects that fed on these plants and pollinated them.

==Fauna==

===Mammals===

[[Mammals]] had first appeared in the [[Late Triassic]], evolving from advanced [[cynodont]]s, and developed alongside the dinosaurs, exploiting [[ecological niches]] untouched by the larger and more famous [[Mesozoic]] animals: in the insect-rich forest underbrush and high up in the trees. These smaller mammals (as well as [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, and [[insect]]s) survived the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous which wiped out the [[dinosaurs|non-avian dinosaurs]], and mammals diversified and spread throughout the world.

While early mammals were small nocturnal animals that mostly ate soft plant material and small animals such as insects, the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs and the beginning of the Paleocene saw mammals growing bigger and occupying a wider variety of [[ecological niche]]s. Ten million years after the death of the non-avian dinosaurs, the world was filled with rodent-like mammals, medium-sized mammals scavenging in forests, and large herbivorous and carnivorous mammals hunting other mammals, birds, and reptiles.

Fossil evidence from the Paleocene is scarce, and there is relatively little known about mammals of the time. Because of their small size (constant until late in the epoch) early mammal bones are not well preserved in the fossil record, and most of what we know comes from fossil teeth (a much tougher substance), and only a few skeletons.&lt;ref name="Hooker"/&gt;

The [[brain to body mass ratio]]s of these archaic mammals were quite low.&lt;ref&gt;Kazlev, M. Alan (2002) "[http://palaeos.com/cenozoic/paleocene/paleocene.htm The Paleocene"]. ''Palaeos Cenozoic''. Retrieved April 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals of the Paleocene include:
* [[Monotreme]]s: The [[Ornithorhynchidae|ornithorhynchid]] ''[[Obdurodon sudamericanum]]'', in the family that includes the [[platypus]], is the only monotreme known from the Paleocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Musser |first1=A. M. |year=2003 |title=Review of the monotreme fossil record and comparison of palaeontological and molecular data |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |volume=136 |pages=927–942 |doi= 10.1016/s1095-6433(03)00275-7|url=http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:1073/SOURCE01 |accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupials]]: modern [[kangaroo]]s are marsupials, characterized by giving birth to embryonic young, who crawl into the mother's pouch and suckle until they are developed. The Bolivian ''[[Pucadelphys andinus]]'' and the North American ''[[Peradectes]]'' are two Paleocene examples.
* [[Multituberculates]]: the only major branch of mammals to become extinct since the K–Pg boundary, this rodent-like grouping includes the Paleocene ''[[Ptilodus]]''.
* [[Placentalia|Placentals]]: this grouping of mammals became the most diverse and the most successful. Members include [[primates]], [[plesiadapid]]s, [[proboscideans]], and hoofed ungulates, including the [[condylarth]]s and the carnivorous [[mesonychid]]s.

===Reptiles===
[[File:Asiatosuchus.jpg|thumb|left|Section of an ''[[Asiatosuchus]]'' jaw]]
Because of the climatic conditions of the Paleocene, [[reptiles]] were more widely distributed over the globe than at present. Among the [[sub-tropical]] reptiles found in North America during this epoch are [[champsosaur]]s (fully aquatic reptiles), [[crocodilia]], soft-shelled [[turtle]]s, palaeophid [[snakes]], [[Varanidae|varanid lizards]], and ''[[Protochelydra zangerli]] '' (similar to modern [[Chelydridae|snapping turtles]]).

Examples of champsosaurs of the Paleocene include ''[[Champsosaurus]] gigas'', the largest champsosaur ever discovered. This creature was unusual among Paleocene non-squamate reptiles in that ''C. gigas'' became larger than its known [[Mesozoic]] ancestors: ''C. gigas'' is more than twice the length of the largest Cretaceous specimens (3 meters versus 1.5 meters). Another genus, ''[[Simoedosaurus]]'', was similarly large; it appears rather suddenly in the fossil record, as its closest relatives occurred in the [[Early Cretaceous]]. Reptiles as a whole decreased in size after the K–Pg event. Champsosaurs declined towards the end of the Paleocene and became extinct during the [[Miocene]].

[[File:Wannaganosuchus.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Wannaganosuchus]]'', a [[crocodilian]] from the Paleocene.]]

Examples of Paleocene crocodylians are ''[[Borealosuchus]]'' (formerly ''[[Leidyosuchus]]'') ''formidabilis'', the [[apex predator]] and the largest animal of the [[Wannagan Creek]] fauna, and the [[alligatorid]] ''[[Wannaganosuchus]]''.

Non-avian dinosaurs may have survived to some extent into the early Danian stage of the Paleocene Epoch circa 64.5 Mya. The controversial evidence for such is a hadrosaur leg bone found from Paleocene strata in [[New Mexico]];&lt;ref name="Fassett"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3139.pdf|title=Compelling new evidence for Paleocene dinosaurs in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone, San Juan Basin, New Mexico and Colorado, USA|author=Fassett, JE, Lucas, SG, Zielinski, RA, and Budahn, JR|year=2001|journal=Catastrophic events and mass extinctions, Lunar and Planetary Contribution|volume=1053|pages=45–46|accessdate=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such stray late forms may be [[Fossil#Derived|derived fossils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=RM|title=No Paleocene dinosaurs in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003RM/finalprogram/abstract_47695.htm|journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|volume=35|issue=5|page=15|year=2003|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of snakes, such as ''[[Titanoboa]]'' and ''[[Gigantophis]]'', grew to over 6 meters long.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268334013_First_report_of_the_giant_snake_Gigantophis_Madtsoiidae_from_the_Paleocene_of_Pakistan_paleobiogeographic_implications&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
[[Image:Gastornis.jpg|thumb|right|140px|''[[Gastornis]]'']]

Birds began to re-diversify during the epoch, occupying new niches. Genetic studies suggest that nearly all modern bird clades can trace their origin to this epoch, with [[Neornithes]] having undergone an extremely fast, "star-like" radiation of species in the early Palaeocene in response to the vacancy of niches left by the [[KT event]].&lt;ref&gt;Linnéa Smeds, Hans Ellegren, [http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002224 The Dynamics of Incomplete Lineage Sorting across the Ancient Adaptive Radiation of Neoavian Birds]&lt;/ref&gt;

Large flightless birds have been found in late Paleocene deposits, including the omnivorous ''[[Gastornis]]'' in Europe and carnivorous [[Phorusrhacidae|terror birds]] in South America, the latter of which survived until the [[Pleistocene]].

In the late Paleocene, early owl types appeared, such as ''[[Ogygoptynx]]'' in the [[United States]] and ''[[Berruornis]]'' in [[France]].

'''Polyaniline nanofibers''' are a high aspect form of [[polyaniline]], a [[polymer]] consisting of [[aniline]] monomers, which appears as discrete long threads with an average diameter between 30&amp;nbsp;nm and 100&amp;nbsp;nm. Polyaniline is one of the oldest known [[conducting polymers]], being known for over 150 years.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, D.; Huang, J.; Kaner, R.B.; ''Acc. Chem. Res.'', '''2009''', 42 (1), 135–145([https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ar800080n])&lt;/ref&gt; Polyaniline [[nanofibers]] are often studied for their potential to enhance the properties of polyaniline or have additional beneficial properties due to the addition of a [[nanostructure]] to the polymer.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; Properties that make polyaniline useful can be seen in the nanofiber form as well, such as facile synthesis, environmental stability, and simple [[acid (chemistry)|acid]]/[[base (chemistry)|base]] [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]]/dedoping chemistry. These and other properties have led to the formation of various applications for polyaniline nanofibers as [[actuators]], [[Non-volatile memory|memory devices]], and [[sensors]].

==Synthesis==
[[File:Polyaniline synthesis.jpg|thumb|Polymerization pathways of polyaniline and polyaniline nanofibers, as well as the doped/dedoped oxidation/reduction chemistry that can occur.]]

Methods for the [[polymerization]] of polyaniline nanofibers seen in literature primarily include [redox|chemical oxidative] polymerization, [[interfacial polymerization|interfacial synthesis]], and "rapid mixing" methods.&lt;ref name="Kavitha"&gt;Kavitha, B.; kumar, K.S.; Narsimlu, N.; ''Indian J. Pure Appl. Phys.'', '''2013''', 51 (3), 207-209([http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/16068])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang4"&gt;Huang, J.; Kaner, R.B.; ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', '''2004''', 126 (3), 851–855([https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja0371754])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang5"&gt;Huang, J.; Virji, S.; Weiller, B.H.; Kaner, R.B.; ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', '''2003''', 125 (2), 314–315([https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja028371y])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang6"&gt;Huang, J.; ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', '''2006''', 78 (1), 15-27([https://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac200678010015])&lt;/ref&gt; Other less common methods include [[nanofiber seeding]], [[electrosynthesis]], [[electrospinning]], and preforming polymerization in dilute aniline solutions.&lt;ref name="Chiou"&gt;Chiou, N.R.; Epstein, A.J.; ''Adv. Mater.'', '''2005''', 17, 1679-1683([https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.200401000])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical oxidative polymerization ===
Chemical oxidative polymerization is a traditional and commonly used method for the polymerization of aniline in large quantities.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; When aniline is mixed with an oxidant in an acidic solution, polymerization will occur. The most important parameter to be controlled in this method for the synthesis of polyaniline nanofibers is the domination of [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] nucleation over heterogeneous [[nucleation]]. Homogeneous nucleation describes when the nuclei are formed spontaneously in solution while heterogeneous nucleation describes when the nuclei are grown on other species. In the early stages of this polymerization, only nanofibers are formed since there are no heteronuclei available for heterogeneous nucleation. However, if the reaction is left uncontrolled, heterogeneous nucleation will begin to dominate as the polyaniline will preferentially grow on existing particles, leading to irreversible agglomeration. The reaction can be made to favor homogeneous nucleation throughout by increasing reaction speed, temperature of the reaction, and allowing the reaction to proceed without stirring.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

[[File:Hetero vs homo nucleation of polyaniline.png|thumb|Route I shows the heterogeneous nucleation route, where the nanofibers are formed, followed by secondary growth on the wires which cause agglomeration. Route II shows the homogeneous nucleation route, where only nanofibers are formed.]]

The diameter of the polyaniline nanofibers can be controlled with this method through choice of acid. [[Hydrochloric acid]] produces nanofibers with a diameter of about 30&amp;nbsp;nm, while [[camphorsulfonic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]] produce a diameter of 50&amp;nbsp;nm and 120&amp;nbsp;nm respectively.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; Under normal synthetic methods polyaniline derivatives, such as ones that are [[alkyl]] and [[fluoro]] substituted, do not exhibit a well-defined fibrous shape, however, in the presence of an aniline [[oligomer]] nanofibers of certain derivatives can be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; While the most common oxidant is [[ammonium peroxydisulfate]] (APS), various others can be used. One study shows the use of potassium biiodate (KH(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as an oxidant, claiming it to lead to polyaniline nanofibers that are longer, have higher [[crystallinity]], and have higher [[electrical conductivity]].&lt;ref name="Rahy"&gt;Rahy, A.; Yang, D.J.; ''Mater. Lett.'', '''2008''', 62, 4311-4314([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2008.06.057])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interfacial synthesis ===

In interfacial synthesis, the polymerization happens at the interface between an [[aqueous]] and an [[Organic compound|organic]] layer.&lt;ref name="Huang4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang6" /&gt; A typical reaction involves an aqueous solution of acid and oxidant and an organic layer of aniline together. This creates the reactive interface for polymerization to occur. As polymerization proceeds, the polyaniline nanofibers will diffuse into the water layer, leaving the reactive interface. This prevents overgrowth onto the existing wires, allowing for homogeneous nucleation to continue occurring. Conditions in the interfacial synthesis can be tuned, such as the type of acid used as well as the oxidant used.

=== Rapid mixing reactions ===
Polyaniline nanofibers can also be synthesized through "rapid mixing" reactions.&lt;ref name="Huang6" /&gt; This method attempts to prevent overgrowth that would compromise the nanofiber nature of the polymer by stopping the polymerization immediately after nanofibers have been formed. This is achieved by the rapid mixing of the monomer, aniline, and an initiator solution. At the start of the reaction, the initiator is consumed rapidly and completely depleted when the nanofibers are formed. Without initiator remaining, the synthesis of polyaniline is halted.

==Applications==

=== Monolithic actuators ===
Polyaniline nanofibers have been used in the creation of [[Monolithic system|monolithic]] actuators.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;Baker, C.O.; Shedd, B.; Innis, P.C.; Whitten, P.G.; Spinks, G.M.; Wallace, G.G.; Kaner, R.B.; ''Adv. Mater.'', '''2008''', 20, 155-158([https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.200602864])&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used in this application due to their ability to be flash-welded.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; When exposed to [[light]], polyaniline converts the absorbed energy directly into heat. In a polyaniline film, the heat is dispersed throughout the polymer. In polyaniline nanofibers, however, the heat is trapped within the individual fibers. Therefore, if the intensity of the light is great enough, it will cause the temperature of the nanofibers to rise rapidly, which causes them to weld together or burn. With a moderate flash intensity, the nanofibers will melt rapidly to form a smooth film. Using mask, welds in specific patterns can be made using this technique. In a thick enough sample of nanofibers, only the side exposed to the flash will be welded, creating an asymmetric film where one side remains intact as nanofibers while the other side is effectively [[Cross-link|crosslinked]] due to welding. These asymmetric films demonstrate rapid reversible actuation in the presence of acids and bases, in the form of bending and curling. The advantages polyaniline nanofiber asymmetric films have over other actuators include the ease of synthesis, large degree of bending, patternability, and no delamination. These actuators could be used in the development of microtweezers, microvalves, artificial muscles, chemical sensors, and patterned actuator structures.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

=== Digital memory devices ===
Research has shown that polyaniline nanofibers can also be used to create nonvolatile plastic digital memory devices when decorated with various [[metal]], such as [[gold]], [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref name="Tseng"&gt;Tseng, R.J.; Huang, J.; Ouyang, J.; Kaner, R.B.; Yang, Y.; ''Nano Lett.'', '''2005''', 5 (6), 1077–1080([https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl050587l])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold nanoparticles]] are grown inside dedoped polyaniline nanofibers using a redox reaction. A plastic composite film is placed between two electrodes, and an external bias is used to program ON-OFF states. The switching mechanism is thought to be caused through an interaction between the polyaniline nanofibers and the gold nanoparticles, where charge is transferred to the gold nanoparticles from the polyaniline nanofibers due to an induced [[electric field]]. Switching between the ON-OFF states has shown to be rapid, with times of less than 25ns. The retention time of these simple devices are on the order of days after [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[Read-write memory|write-read-erase]] cycles have been demonstrated.

=== Chemical sensing applications ===
Polyaniline nanofibers have been shown to be incredibly successful as [[chemical sensors]], as they perform better than conventional polyaniline films in numerous tests.&lt;ref name="Virji"&gt;Virji, S.; Huang, J.; Kaner, R.B.; Weiller, B.H.; ''Nano Lett.'', '''2004''', 4 (3), 491–496([https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl035122e])&lt;/ref&gt; This performance difference has been attributed to their high [[surface area]], [[porosity]], and small diameters which enhance diffusion of materials through the nanofibers. Polyaniline nanofiber sensors function through a change in [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. The polyaniline nanofiber film is placed on an [[electrode]], where a [[Electric current|current]] flows through. The resistance of the electrode changes when the target interacts with the film, which allows the target to be detected.

One study proposes the creation of [[hydrogen]] gas sensors using polyaniline nanofibers.&lt;ref name="Sadek"&gt;Sadek, A.Z.; Wlodarski, W.; Kalantar-Zadeh, K.; Baker, C.; Kaner, R.B.; ''Sens. Actuators A'', '''2007''', 139, 53-57([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2006.11.033])&lt;/ref&gt; It shows that both doped and dedoped polyaniline nanofibers can be used for detection of hydrogen gas through resistance changes, but the dedoped nanofibers were more stable and had better reproducibility.

Another study shows the potential of polyaniline nanofibers as [[Nitrogen dioxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas sensors.&lt;ref name="Yan"&gt;Yan, X.B.; Han, Z.J.; Yang, Y.; Tay, B.K.; ''Sens. Actuators B'', '''2007''', 123, 107-113([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2006.07.031])&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas acts as a strong oxidizing agent to the emeraldine form of polyaniline nanofibers, which causes resistance changes greater than three orders of magnitude at 100 ppm.

Sensing targets can be expanded through adding materials to the polyaniline nanofibers. One study proposes polyaniline nanofiber composites with metal salts for the detection of [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref name="Virji14"&gt;Virji, S.; Fowler, J.D.; Baker, C.O.; Huang, J.; Kaner, R.B.; Weiller, B.H.; ''Small'', '''2005''', 1 (6), 624-627([https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.200400155])&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid that is dangerous at low ppm, but polyaniline nanofibers can only give a robust response to strong acids. Metal salts can react with hydrogen sulfate to form a metal sulfide precipitate and a strong acid. By combining metal salts and polyaniline nanofibers, detection of hydrogen sulfide can be performed.

Another study decorated polyaniline nanofibers with gold nanoparticles to detect volatile [[sulfur]] compounds in expired [[human]] breath.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;Liu, C.; Hayashi, K.; Toko, K.; Sens. Actuators B, 2012, 161, 504-509([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.10.068])&lt;/ref&gt; These sensors can potentially be used in various breath analyses and also in disease diagnosis for [[diseases]] with malodor biomarker gases.

[[Humidity]] sensors have also been prepared using polyaniline nanofibers.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;Lin, Q.; Li, Y.; Yang, M.; Sens. Actuators B, 2012, 161, 967-972([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.11.074])&lt;/ref&gt; These sensors were prepared through electrospinning of a [[N,N-dimethylformamide]] solution of polyaniline nanofibers, [[Polyvinyl butyral|poly(vinyl butyral)]] (PVB), and [[poly(ethylene oxide)]] (PEO). These sensors were shown to have high [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], with resistance changes of three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the sensors showed good sensing linearity, fast response, small hysterics, and good repeatability.

The '''Proto-Tethys Ocean''' was an ancient [[ocean]] that existed from the latest [[Ediacaran]] to the [[Carboniferous]] (550–330 [[Megaannum|Ma]]).

==History of concept==
The name "Proto-Tethys" have been used inconsistently for several concepts for a supposed predecessor of the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a palaeocean that separated the margins of [[Gondwana]], often referred to as peri-Gondwana, from various continents and Gondwana-derived continental fragments from Precambrian times and onwards.
According to {{Harvnb|von Raumer|Stampfli|2008}}, after the [[Cadomian Orogeny|Cadomian orogenic events]] 550 Ma, the Proto-Tethys Ocean formed the eastern part of an oceanic domain (of which the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]] and [[Tornquist Sea|Tornquist]] oceans formed the western parts) which subducted under the northern margins of [[Gondwana]].  In this model the Proto-Tethys separated the [[North China (continent)|North China]] and [[Baltica]] continents from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|von Raumer|Stampfli|2008|loc=Introduction, p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Early Ordovician 500-480 Ma, the Proto-Tethys was subducted under Cadomia as a result of the [[Chamrousse]] [[back-arc basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|von Raumer|Stampfli|2008|loc=Fig. 7a-c}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2009}} used the name 'Ran Ocean' for a similar concept, the Cambrian-Ordovician ocean that separated Baltica from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berra|Angiolini|2014|loc=Cambrian (late Cambrian, about 500 Ma), p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other geologists dispute the existence of such an ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Catalán|Fernández-Suárez|Jenner|Belousova|2004|loc=Fig. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palaeozoic evolution==
The ocean formed when [[Pannotia]] disintegrated, [[Proto-Laurasia]] (Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia) rifted away from a supercontinent that would become [[Gondwana]].  Proto-Tethys formed between these two supercontinents.  The ocean was bordered by [[Panthalassic Ocean]] to the north, separating it from Panthalassa by [[island arcs]] and [[Kazakhstania]].  The Proto-Tethys expanded during the [[Cambrian]].  The ocean was at its widest during the Late [[Ordovician]] to Middle [[Silurian]].  The ocean was situated between the [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] to the west, and [[Gondwana]] to the east.  The ocean began to shrink during the Late Silurian, when [[North China (continent)|North China]], and [[South China (continent)|South China]] moved away from Gondwana and headed north.  In the late [[Devonian]], the microcontinent of [[Kazakhstania]] collided with Siberia, shrinking the ocean even more.  The ocean closed when the North China [[craton]] collided with Siberia-Kazakstania continent in the [[Carboniferous]], while the Paleo-Tethys Ocean expanded.

In November 1979 the vehicle began shedding, eventually losing 50 pieces of traceable [[space debris|debris]]. The reasons were unknown, but the cause could have been a collision. Although the main body remains in place, radioactive material may have been released. Later research, published in 2008 and based on Haystack data, suggests that there are another 60 or more pieces of debris of size &lt;10&amp;nbsp;cm &lt;ref&gt;

{{asof|2010}}, more than 30 small fission power system nuclear reactors have been sent into space in Soviet [[RORSAT]] satellites; also, over 40 [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s have been used globally (principally US and USSR) on space missions.&lt;ref name="nasa/doe2010"&gt;

==Construction and operation==
The SNAP-10A has three major components&amp;nbsp;– a compact nuclear reactor, the reactor reflector and control system, a heat transfer and power conversion system.

The reactor measures 39.62&amp;nbsp;cm (15.6&amp;nbsp;in) long, 22.4&amp;nbsp;cm (8.8&amp;nbsp;in) diameter and holds 37 fuel rods containing [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] as uranium-zirconium-hydride fuel.&lt;ref name="ans"/&gt; The SNAP-10A reactor was designed for a thermal power output of 30&amp;nbsp;kW and unshielded weighs {{convert|650|lb|abbr=on}}. The reactor can be identified at the top of the SNAP-10A unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Voss | first = Susan | title = SNAP Reactor Overview | publisher = U.S. Air Force Weapons Laboratory |place= Kirtland AFB, New Mexico | date = August 1984 | pages = | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a146831.pdf | id = AFWL-TN-84-14 | accessdate = 2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectors were arranged around the outside of the reactor to provide the means to control the reactor. The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a retaining band anchored by an [[Pyrotechnic fastener|explosive bolt]]. When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down.

The [[eutectic]] sodium-potassium ([[NaK]]) alloy was used as a coolant in the SNAP-10A. The NaK was circulated through the core and thermoelectric converters by a [[Electromagnetic pump|liquid metal direct current conduction-type]] pump. The thermoelectric converters (identified as the long white "apron") are doped silicon germanium materials, thermally coupled, but electrically isolated from the NaK heat transfer medium. The temperature difference between the NaK on one side of the thermoelectric converter and the cold of space on the other created an electric potential and usable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmidt | first = G.L. | title = SNAP 10A Test Program | publisher = Rockwell International, Canoga Park, California | date = September 1988 | pages = | url = | id = DCN: SP-100-XT-0002 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
The SNAP reactor program necessitated a safety program and led to the inception of the Aerospace Nuclear Safety Program. The program was established to evaluate the nuclear hazards associated with the construction, launch, operation and disposal of SNAP systems and to develop designs to assure their radiological safety.

[[Atomics International]] had primary responsibility for safety, while [[Sandia National Laboratories]] was responsible for the Aerospace Safety Independent Review and conducted many of the safety tests. Before launch was permitted, proof had to be obtained that under all circumstances the launch of the reactor would not pose a serious threat.

A variety of tests were successfully completed and several videos of the development and tests are available for viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ETEC - Videos |url=https://www.etec.energy.gov/Library/Video/Video_index.php |accessdate= 12 January 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204230330/http://www.etec.energy.gov/Library/Video/Video_index.html |archivedate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Idaho National Laboratory]] conducted three destructive tests of SNAP nuclear reactors at [[Test Area North]] prior to the launch of SNAP-10A.&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple17&gt;{{cite book

==Development==
[[Atomics International]], then a division of [[North American Aviation]] was the prime contractor for the SNAP-10A development. Most of the systems development and reactor testing was conducted at the [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]], Ventura County, California using a number of specialized facilities.  A [[United States Department of Energy]] video depicting the development and fabrication of the SNAP-10A is available.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='SNAPSHOT,' A period video depicting the development and fabrication of the SNAP 10A |url= http://etec.energy.gov/Library/Video/SNAP_Videos/SNAP_Shot.html |accessdate= 12 January 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205122935/http://www.etec.energy.gov/Library/Video/SNAP_Videos/SNAP_Shot.html |archivedate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also developed and tested other compact nuclear reactors including the SNAP Experimental Reactor (SER), SNAP-2, SNAP-8 Developmental Reactor (SNAP8-DR) and SNAP-8 Experimental Reactor (SNAP-8ER) units at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. Atomics International also built and operated the [[Sodium Reactor Experiment]], the first U.S. nuclear power plant to supply electricity to a public power system.

The testing and development involving radioactive materials caused environmental contamination at the former Atomics International Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) facilities. The [[United States Department of Energy]] is responsible for the identification and cleanup of the radioactive contamination. (The SSFL was also used for the unrelated testing and development of rocket engines by [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] primarily for [[NASA]].)

{{Mesopotamian myth (7)}}

'''Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D)''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s dated to between 2100 and 2000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].

==Compilation==

The myth was discovered on the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], catalogue of the [[Babylonia]]n section (CBS), tablet number 11065 from their excavations at the temple library at [[Nippur]]. This was translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as ''"Sumerian religious texts"'' in ''"[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]"'', number three, entitled '''"Hymn to [[Dungi]]"''' (Dungi was later renamed to [[Shulgi]]). The tablet is {{convert|7|in|cm}} by {{convert|5.4|in|cm}} by {{convert|1.6|in|cm}} at its thickest point.&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton noted that similar hymns were published by [[Stephen Herbert Langdon]] and  introduced into [[Sumerian religion]] at the time of the [[Third dynasty of Ur]] onwards. He dates the tablet to the reign of Shulgi, saying ''"The script of our tablets shows that this copy was made during the time of the First Dynasty of Babylon, but that does not preclude an earlier date for the composition of the original."''&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt; Further tablets were used by Jacob Klein to expand and translate the myth again in 1981. He used several other tablets from the University Museum in Pennsylvania including CBS 8289. He also included translations from tablets in the Nippur collection of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of the Ancient Orient]] in [[Istanbul]], catalogue number 4571. He also used tabled 5379 from the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Jacob, Three Shulgi Hymns. Sumerian Royal Hymns Glorifying King Shulgi of Ur. Bar Ilan University Press: Ramat-Gan, 1981: 50-123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

In the story, Shulgi is praised and compared to all manner of animals and wondrous things such as a [[tree]].

{{cquote|''"You are as strong as an ildag tree planted by the side of a [[watercourse]]. You are a sweet sight, like a fertile mec tree laden with colourful fruit. You are cherished by Ninegala, like a date palm of holy [[Dilmun]]. You have a pleasant shade, like a sappy [[Cedrus|cedar]] growing amid the cypresses.''"&lt;ref name="ESCTL"&gt;[http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr24204.htm ETCSL Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D) - Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925021207/http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr24204.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His interactions and relationships with a large number of the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of Sumerian gods are described along with victories in foreign lands and description of the royal [[barge]].

{{cquote|''"Imbued with terrible splendour on the Exalted [[River]], it was adorned with holy horns, and its [[gold]]en [[Sheep|ram]] symbol gleamed in the open air. Its [[bitumen]] was the ... bitumen of Enki provided generously by the abzu; its cabin was a palace. It was decorated with [[stars]] like the sky. Its holy ...''"&lt;ref name="ESCTL"/&gt;}}

==Discussion==

[[Samuel Noah Kramer]] suggests that Shulgi hymns speaking about the achievements of the king focussed on the two areas of social behaviour and religion. He is both shown to be concerned for [[social justice]], law and equity along with being faithful in his priestly rites and interaction with the gods. He notes ''"uppermost in their minds was the [[Ekur]], the holy temple of Nippur where virtually every king in the hymnal repertoire brought gifts, offerings, and sacrifices to [[Enlil]]."''&lt;ref name="Kramer1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=In the World of Sumer: An Autobiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KliA7MjJEDQC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=1 November 1988|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-2121-8|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SLOSHSAT-FLEVO''' ('''Sloshsat Facility for Liquid Experimentation and Verification in Orbit''') is a [[microsatellite]] launched to investigate the dynamics of fluids in microgravity. '''FLEVO''' stands for Facility for Liquid Experimentation and Verification in Orbit. Multiple sensors were used to monitor the behavior of water in an instrumented tank and how [[sloshing]] affects the attitude control of launchers and space vehicles.&lt;ref name=ESAHome&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloshsat FLEVO |url=http://www.esa.int/export/esaMI/Launchers_Home/SEMNFZ0XDYD_0.html |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate=20 November 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318162339/http://www.esa.int/export/esaMI/Launchers_Home/SEMNFZ0XDYD_0.html |archivedate=March 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is a joint program between [[ESA]], the [[Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes]], and the [[Israel Space Agency]].&lt;ref name=ISAHome&gt;{{cite web|title=SLOSHSAT|url=http://most.gov.il/English/space/projects/Pages/SLOSHSAT.aspx|publisher=The Israel Space Agency|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary contractor is the [[National Aerospace Laboratory]] providing the spacecraft structure and power systems. The ejection system and ground support equipment were contracted by NEWTEC. The ISA was responsible for supplying the [[reaction control system|sub-propulsion system]] which was built and assembled by [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|Rafael]].

==Spacecraft==

The spacecraft itself is a 90-cm cube [[microsatellite]] covered by solar cells and fitted with 12 small thrusters.

==Launch==
Originally Sloshsat-FLEVO was to be launched from the Space Shuttle and use the shuttle as a data relay, but after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] the satellite was modified to be launched on board the Ariene qualification flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/sloshsat-flevo.htm |title=Sloshsat-FLEVO |website=space.skyrocket.de }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The satellite was launched from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] launch site at [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] on 12 February 2005.

==Experiment==
The SLOSHSAT-FLEVO is the first satellite entirely dedicated to liquid research in space. The satellite was equipped with an 87-litre cylindrical tank containing 33.5 litres of [[de-ionised water]]. 270 sensors were placed on the tank's walls to measure the [[slosh dynamics|sloshing behavior]] by calculating the thickness of the water. Three accelerometers and a fibre-optic gyroscope were used to measure the motion of the spacecraft. An array of temperature, pressure and fluid velocity sensors were also installed on the craft.&lt;ref name=ESAHome /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISAHome /&gt;

After depletion of the propellants and completion of the experiment, the satellite was turned off. ESA estimate that without active debris removal the orbit would decay by 2335.

[[File:Observatory Gully with Blair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Iain Cameron and Dr Blair Fyffe at the Observatory Gully patch on [[Ben Nevis]], 23 August 2008. Photo by Mark Atkinson]]
Long-lying '''snow patches in Scotland''' have been noted from at least the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Ken Crocket, ''Ben Nevis – Scotland’s highest mountain'', {{ISBN|0-907521-16-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[snow patch]]es on [[Ben Nevis]] being observed well into summer and autumn. Indeed, the summit observatory, which operated from 1883 to 1904, reported that snow survived on the north-east cliffs through more years than it vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Moran, ''Scotland’s Winter Mountains'', {{ISBN|0-7153-0794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, additional and methodical field study on the subject has been carried out by others, most notably by ecologist [[Dr Adam Watson]]. Most of this work concentrated on the mountains of north-east Scotland (in particular, the [[Cairngorms]]), but more recent observations by him and others has shed light on various locations throughout Scotland where long-lying snow persists. The available information systematically gathered by observers over the last 50 years or so, and greatly increased since the 1990s, has built up a level of knowledge that points to Scotland’s snow patches being now amongst the best documented in the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

== General locations ==
[[File:Aonach Mor Protalus.jpg|thumb|right|Aonach Mòr's protalus snow-patch on 1 October 2007. This patch sits on solid bedrock and melts more quickly than other patches because of water running underneath]]
There are many locations on the [[Mountains and hills of Scotland|Scottish mountains]] where snow lies regularly into July, August and even September, but the two main areas where snow virtually always lies longer than anywhere else are the Cairngorms and the Lochaber mountains. These areas contain all of Scotland's mountains in excess of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0}}, including [[Ben Nevis]].

In some years snow can persist all summer, in some locations lasting through to the next winter. In 2015 some 73 patches were still present in late November at a time when the next winter's snows had started accumulating. The last time so many patches had survived all year was 1994.&lt;ref name=bbcsnownovember&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKenzie|first1=Stephen|title=Most snow patches counted in Scotland's hills since 1994|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-34941899|website=BBC News|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other locations where snow has been known to survive:
* 1. [[Creag Meagaidh]] hills, survived in 1994 and 2015
* 2. [[Glen Affric]]/[[Strathfarrar]] hills, usually melts mid/late August but survivals have been noted on [[Sgurr na Lapaich]], [[An Riabhachan]] and [[Toll Creagach]] as recently as 2015.
* 3. [[Ben Wyvis]], normally melts July/August, though survival has been noted (A Watson)
* 4. [[Grey Corries]], normally survives until July/August, has survived at least once on [[Stob Coire Easain]] (A Watson)&lt;ref name=snowbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Adam|title=A Snow Book, Northern Scotland|year=2011|publisher=Paragon Publishing|isbn=|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPsiZMM1w38C&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=fjeq4wDH2-&amp;dq=%22grey%20corries%22%20snow&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22grey%20corries%22%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 on Stob Coire an Laoigh.
* 5. Ben Alder range. Snow has survived at Geal-Charn on multiple occasions, most recently in 2015.

==The Cairngorms==
[[File:Garbh Choire Mor 8th August 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Scotland's most durable snow patch, Garbh Choire Mòr, [[Braeriach]], 8 August 2008]]
As well as containing five of Scotland's highest mountains,&lt;ref name="walkhighlands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/munros-height|title=Munros by Altitude|publisher=walkhighlands.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cairngorms are the range where snow persists longest, and in more locations, than anywhere else in the UK. [[Ben Macdui]], [[Cairn Gorm]] and [[Braeriach]] all contain long-lying patches that have been observed for many years.

On Ben Macdui, snow has been known to persist at a few locations from one winter to the next,&lt;ref&gt;Royal Meteorological Society "Weather" October 2002, vol. 57; Adam Watson, Richard W. Davison &amp; John Pottie&lt;/ref&gt; but the location where more survivals have been noted than any other is {{gbmapping|NH994010}}, close to the Garbh Uisge Beag, which drains into [[Loch A'an|Loch Avon]]. This patch sits at an altitude of {{convert|1060|m|ft|0}}.

Lying at the north-eastern shoulder of [[Cairn Gorm]] is [http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCP&amp;cp=57.121612~-3.633728&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=19&amp;tilt=-24.4163795723387&amp;dir=249.457705178056&amp;alt=1231.63546927739&amp;cam=57.122276~-3.630469&amp;scene=-1&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;encType=1 Ciste Mhearad]. This hollow contains a patch which, hitherto, was known to persist through many years, but has done so only once (in 2015) since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Royal Meteorological Society "Weather" September 2016, vol. 71; Cameron et al&lt;/ref&gt; Observations in 2007 and 2008 revealed that September was the month when final melting occurred for this patch.&lt;ref name="winterhighland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winterhighland.info/forum/read.php?2,91416,page=10|title=:: Winterhighland :: Scottish Snow &amp;amp; Mountain Sports :: Attention all Walkers!  2008 Snow Patch Season|publisher=winterhighland.info|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sits at an altitude of {{convert|1095|m|ft|0}} and is located at approximately {{gbmapping|NJ011046}}.

Braeriach's Garbh Choire Mòr is the place which contains Britain's most persistent snow beds. Snow has been absent from this corrie just six times in the last century: 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006 &amp; 2017.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-41346118&lt;/ref&gt;  Sitting at an altitude of about {{convert|1140|m|ft|0}}, these patches are located around {{gbmapping|NN940980}}; the two most long-lasting patches are known as "the Pinnacles" and "the Sphinx" after the rock climbs lying above them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/07/weather ''Guardian'' interview with Dr Adam Watson] Accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Garbh Choire Mòr (as well as Coire an Lochain in the northern corries) may have contained a glacier as recently as the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison S., Rowan, A.V., Glasser, N.F., Knight, J., Plummer, M.A. and Mills, S.C. (2014): Little Ice Age glaciers in Britain: Glacier–climate modelling in the Cairngorm Mountains. The Holocene 24 (2), 135-140. doi:10.1177/0959683613516170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkbride, M., Everest, J., Benn, D., Gheorghiu, D. and Dawson, A. (2014) Late-Holocene and Younger Dryas glaciers in the northern Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland. The Holocene 24 (2), 141-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the Cairngorms and surrounding mountains of north-east Scotland had 55 surviving patches, an exceptional number.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Ben Nevis range ==
[[File:Aonach Beag 8.9.08.jpg|thumb|right|Low-lying patch on [[Aonach Beag]], 8 September 2008]]
As well as containing Scotland's highest mountain ([[Ben Nevis]]), [[Aonach Mòr]], [[Aonach Beag]] and [[Càrn Mòr Dearg]] make up the other three mountains in excess of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0}}  in this area.

As already noted, Ben Nevis has long been known to hold snow late into the year. However, historical reports from the 19th century and early 20th century of snow being ever present on the mountain are virtually impossible to substantiate, so must remain speculative. Nevertheless, what is certainly true is that snow often persists from one winter to the next. Analysis of Ben Nevis's snow is not as comprehensive as that of the Cairngorms, but recent observations show that Ben Nevis has been snow-free only once since 2006 (in 2017). The largest patch, at Observatory Gully, sits at an altitude of around {{convert|1130|m|ft|0}}. The slightly lower patch at Point 5 gully has also been known to survive from one winter to the next.

Aonach Mòr has a corrie known to hold snow from one year to the next: Coire an Lochain. One of these patches, sitting behind a [[protalus rampart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fettes.com/cairngorms/protalus%20rampart.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105093938/http://www.fettes.com/Cairngorms/protalus%20rampart.htm |archivedate=5 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }} protalus rampart&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes survives longer than the patch slightly higher up against the tall cliffs.

Below the cliffs of the north-east ridge on Aonach Beag there is a relatively little known snow-patch which, despite its low altitude (approximately {{convert|955|m|ft|0}} ), has been Scotland's largest at the time of the arrival of the lasting new winter snows of 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Meteorological Society "Weather" May 2008 vol. 63, no. 5; Adam Watson, David Duncan, Iain Cameron &amp; John Pottie&lt;/ref&gt;  This patch does not appear in known literature on the subject and this suggests that it is very much under-recorded, which may be because it cannot readily be seen, even from the top of Aonach Mòr or Aonach Beag.

'''''The Ornithology of Australia''''' comprises three volumes (of an uncompleted set) of [[lithography|lithographed]], hand-coloured, illustrations of Australian [[bird]]s with accompanying text. It was authored by [[Silvester Diggles]] of Brisbane and was originally issued in 21 parts, each part containing six plates (126 plates in all) with short descriptive [[letterpress]], in imperial [[quarto]] format, with the leaves of the plates 39&amp;nbsp;cm in height. The parts were printed for the author by T.P. Pugh.&lt;ref name=NLA&gt;NLA online catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, between 1863 and 1875, Diggles, with his niece Rowena Birkett who hand-coloured each plate, produced 325 plates illustrating some 600 Australian birds.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;Marks (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 Diggles produced what was essentially a two-volume second edition of the previously published work, using 123 of the same plates and renamed ''Companion to Gould's Handbook, or, Synopsis of the birds of Australia, containing nearly one-third of the whole, or about 220 examples, for the most part from the original drawings'', though the spine title was simply ''Diggles' Ornithology''. Volume 1 had 59 plates, volume 2 had 64, printed by Thorne &amp; Greenwell of Brisbane.&lt;ref name=NLA /&gt; The title referred to [[John Gould]]'s 1865 book ''[[Handbook to the Birds of Australia]]''.

Diggles lacked the funds to continue publishing the series of lithographs. From 1875 his health began to deteriorate, and he died in 1880. His manuscript and original plates, including those unpublished, were later acquired from Diggles’ son by publishing firm [[Angus &amp; Robertson]] which presented them to the [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Whittell (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990 a facsimile edition of ''The Ornithology of Australia'', volume 1, parts 1–7, was published by State Publishing South Australia ({{ISBN|0-7243-6556-7}}).

==Hollow Earth==
{{Main|Hollow Earth}}
The idea of a so-called "[[Hollow Earth]]", once popular in fantasy adventure literature, is that the planet [[Earth]] has a hollow interior and an inner surface habitable by human beings.  Although the scientific community has made clear that this is [[pseudoscience]], the idea nevertheless is a less popular feature of many [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories and of some [[conspiracy theories]].

==In science fiction==
The most famous example of a hollow-Earth fantasy is [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 science-fiction novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', which has been adapted many times as a feature film and for television.

The 2003 film ''[[The Core]]'', loosely based on the novel ''[[Core (novel)|Core]]'', tells the story of a team that has to drill to the center of the Earth and detonate a series of nuclear explosions in order to restart the rotation of Earth's core. The drilling equipment, dubbed ''Virgil'', includes a powerful, snake-like laser drill, a small nuclear reactor for power, a shell (of "[[unobtainium]]", a fictional material) to protect against intense heat and pressure (and generate energy to drive the engine), a powerful [[X-ray vision|x-ray camera]] for viewing outside, and a system of impellers for movement and control. The only part of the Earth that turns out to be hollow is a gigantic [[geode]], and soon after the drill moves through it, the hole it created fills with magma.

The 1986 animated television show [[Inhumanoids]] featured regular visits to the Inner Core in most of its 13 episodes. Each of the three villainous creatures theoretically ruled over certain layers of the inner earth, and their evil schemes were thwarted by the human Earth Corps, who often allied with various races of subterranean beings equally threatened by the Inhumanoids.

During season 3 of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]], the [[Technodrome]] is located at the Earth's core, and transport modules are used to drill up to the streets. This season also features the episode "Turtles at the Earth's Core", where a dinosaur lives in a deep cave, and a crystal of energy that works like the [[Sun]] to keep the dinosaurs alive.
As [[Krang]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] steal the crystal to power the Technodrome, the trouble begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/turtles-at-the-earths-core-67177/|title=Turtles at the Earth's Core|publisher=[[TV.com]]|date=1 November 1989|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Rosa]]'s 1995 ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' story ''[[The Universal Solvent (comics)|The Universal Solvent]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Solvent|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+94066|website=coa.inducks.org|ref=Inducks}}&lt;/ref&gt; imagines a way to travel to the planet's core using 1950s technology, although this would be impossible in reality. The fictional solvent referred to in the story's title has the power to condense everything except diamonds into a kind of super-dense dust. The solvent is accidentally spilled and, as it dissolves everything in its path, it bores a cylindrical shaft into the center of the planet. As part of a recovery effort, a makeshift platform is constructed that descends into the shaft in [[free fall]], automatically deploying an electric motor and wheels as it approaches [[Weightlessness#Zero gravity|zero gravity]], then using rocket engines to enable it to ascend again to the Earth's surface. The author Rosa describes this fantasy journey in great detail: the supposed structure of the Earth is illustrated, and the shaft is kept in a [[vacuum]] to protect against the lethal several thousand kilometers of atmosphere that it would otherwise be exposed to. The ducks must wear [[space suit]]s and go without food for several days, and they are not entirely certain that the super-dense [[heat shield]] will hold. The author maintains continuity with [[Carl Barks]], explaining that the earthquakes in the story are created by spherical Fermies and Terries.

In [[Tales to Astonish]] #2 (1959) "I Fell to the Center of the Earth", an archaeologist named Dr. Burke who is on an expedition to Asia travels to the center of the Earth (and also, as he later finds out, backwards in time)--and encounters [[neanderthals]] and [[dinosaurs]].

In the [[Doctor Who]] episode, ''[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]'', a Racnoss warship is found at the center of the planet.

[[Image:Elementary Two Phase Alternator.jpg|thumb|400px|A simplified diagram of a two-phase alternator&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1253 from the 1917 Hawkins Electrical Guide&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Two-phase electrical power''' was an early 20th-century [[polyphase system|polyphase]] [[alternating current]] electric power distribution system. Two circuits were used, with voltage [[phase (waves)|phase]]s differing by one-quarter of a cycle, 90°. Usually circuits used four wires, two for each phase. Less frequently, three wires were used, with a common wire with a larger-diameter conductor. Some early two-phase [[electric generator|generators]] had two complete rotor and field assemblies, with windings physically offset to provide two-phase power. The generators at [[Niagara Falls]] installed in 1895 were the largest generators in the world at that time and were two-phase machines. [[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] systems eventually replaced the original two-phase power systems for power transmission and utilization.  There remain few two-phase distribution systems, with examples in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; many buildings in Center City are permanently wired for two-phase&lt;ref&gt;Company advertising services for two-phase: http://www.phillyfacility.com/two_phase.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Al Williams ''A Tale of Two Phases and Tech Inertia'': https://hackaday.com/2018/03/15/a-tale-of-two-phases-and-tech-inertia/&lt;/ref&gt;
==Comparison with single-phase power==
The advantage of two-phase electrical power over [[single-phase electric power|single-phase]] was that it allowed for simple, self-starting electric motors. In the early days of [[electrical engineering]], it was easier to analyze and design two-phase systems where the phases were completely separated.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Blalock "The first polyphase system: a look back at two-phase power for AC distribution", in ''IEEE Power and Energy Magazine'', March–April 2004, {{ISSN|1540-7977}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the invention of the method of [[symmetrical components]] in 1918 that polyphase power systems had a convenient mathematical tool for describing unbalanced load cases. The revolving magnetic field produced with a two-phase system allowed electric motors to provide [[torque]] from zero motor speed, which was not possible with a single-phase [[induction motor]] (without an additional starting means.) Induction motors designed for two-phase operation use a similar winding configuration as [[Electric motor#Single-phase AC induction motors|capacitor start]] single-phase motors (however, in a two-phase induction motor, the impedances of the two windings are identical, whereas in a single-phase induction motor, the impedances can be, and usually are, quite different, to reduce cost without sacrificing starting performance; indeed, some single-phase capacitor start/capacitor run induction motors have superior starting characteristics when compared to two- or three-phase induction motors.)

==Comparison with three-phase power==
[[Three-phase electric power]] requires less conductor mass for the same voltage and overall amount of power, compared with a two-phase four-wire circuit of the same carrying capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electricans' Handbook'', Eleventh Edition, McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} page 3–10, figure 3–23&lt;/ref&gt; It has replaced two-phase power for commercial distribution of electrical energy, but two-phase circuits are still found in certain control systems. These power pulsations tend to cause increased mechanical noise in transformer and motor laminations due to [[magnetostriction]] and torsional vibration in generator and motor drive shafts.

Two-phase circuits typically use two separate pairs of current-carrying conductors. Alternatively, three wires may be used, but the common conductor carries the vector sum of the phase currents, which requires a larger conductor. Three-phase can share conductors so that the three phases can be carried on three conductors of the same size. In electrical power distribution, a requirement of only three conductors, rather than four, represented a considerable distribution-wire cost savings due to the expense of conductors and installation.

Two-phase power can be derived from a three-phase source using two [[transformer]]s in a [[Scott connection]]: One transformer primary is connected across two phases of the supply. The second transformer is connected to a center-tap of the first transformer, and is wound for 86.6% of the phase-to-phase voltage on the three-phase system. The secondaries of the transformers will have two phases 90 degrees apart in time, and a balanced two-phase load will be evenly balanced over the three supply phases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39457">[[File:50Hz60Hz.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The waveform of 230 volt, 50 Hz compared with 110 V, 60 Hz]]
The '''utility frequency''', '''(power) line frequency''' ([[American English]]) or '''mains frequency''' ([[British English]]) is the nominal [[frequency]] of the oscillations of [[alternating current]] (AC) in an [[electric power grid]] transmitted from a [[power station]] to the [[end-user]]. In large parts of the world this is 50&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], although in the [[Americas]] and parts of [[Asia]] it is typically 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. Current usage by country or region is given in the list of [[mains power around the world]].

During the development of commercial electric power systems in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many different frequencies (and voltages) had been used. Large investment in equipment at one frequency made standardization a slow process. However, as of the turn of the 21st century, places that now use the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz frequency tend to use 220–240&amp;nbsp;[[voltage|V]], and those that now use 60&amp;nbsp;Hz tend to use 100–127&amp;nbsp;V. Both frequencies coexist today (Japan uses both) with no great technical reason to prefer one over the other&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Monteith , C.F. Wagner (ed), ''Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book 4th Edition'', Westinghouse Electric Corporation 1950, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; and no apparent desire for complete worldwide standardization.

Unless specified by the manufacturer to operate on both 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, appliances may not operate efficiently or even safely if used on anything other than the intended frequency.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In practice, the exact frequency of the grid varies around the nominal frequency, reducing when the grid is heavily loaded, and speeding up when lightly loaded. However, most utilities will adjust the frequency of the grid over the course of the day to ensure a constant number of cycles occur. This is used by some clocks to accurately maintain their time.

==Operating factors==
Several factors influence the choice of frequency in an AC system.&lt;ref name=LAMME18&gt;B. G. Lamme, ''The Technical Story of the Frequencies'', Transactions AIEE January 1918, reprinted in the Baltimore Amateur Radio Club newsletter ''The Modulator'' January -March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting, motors, transformers, generators and transmission lines all have characteristics which depend on the power frequency. All of these factors interact and make selection of a power frequency a matter of considerable importance. The best frequency is a compromise among contradictory requirements.

In the late 19th century, designers would pick a relatively high frequency for systems featuring [[transformer]]s and arc lights, so as to economize on transformer materials, but would pick a lower frequency for systems with long transmission lines or feeding primarily motor loads or [[rotary converter]]s for producing [[direct current]]. When large central generating stations became practical, the choice of frequency was made based on the nature of the intended load. Eventually improvements in machine design allowed a single frequency to be used both for lighting and motor loads. A unified system improved the economics of electricity production, since system load was more uniform during the course of a day.

===Lighting===
The first applications of commercial electric power were [[incandescent light]]ing and [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]-type [[electric motor]]s. Both devices operate well on DC, but DC could not be easily changed in voltage, and was generally only produced at the required utilization voltage.

If an incandescent lamp is operated on a low-frequency current, the filament cools on each half-cycle of the alternating current, leading to perceptible change in brightness and ''flicker'' of the lamps; the effect is more pronounced with [[arc lamp]]s, and the later [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-vapor]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] lamps. Open arc lamps made an audible buzz on alternating current, leading to experiments with high-frequency alternators to raise the sound above the range of human hearing.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Rotating machines===
[[Commutator (electric)|Commutator]]-type motors do not operate well on high-frequency AC, because the rapid changes of current are opposed by the [[inductance]] of the motor field. Though commutator-type [[Electric motor#Universal motor|''universal'']] motors are common in AC household appliances and power tools, they are small motors, less than 1&amp;nbsp;kW. The [[induction motor]] was found to work well on frequencies around 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, but with the materials available in the 1890s would not work well at a frequency of, say, 133&amp;nbsp;Hz. There is a fixed relationship between the number of magnetic poles in the induction motor field, the frequency of the alternating current, and the rotation speed; so, a given standard speed limits the choice of frequency (and the reverse). Once AC [[electric motor]]s became common, it was important to standardize frequency for compatibility with the customer's equipment.

Generators operated by slow-speed reciprocating engines will produce lower frequencies, for a given number of poles, than those operated by, for example, a high-speed steam [[turbine]]. For very slow prime mover speeds, it would be costly to build a generator with enough poles to provide a high AC frequency. As well, synchronizing two generators to the same speed was found to be easier at lower speeds. While belt drives were common as a way to increase speed of slow engines, in very large ratings (thousands of kilowatts) these were expensive, inefficient and unreliable.  After about 1906, generators driven directly by [[steam turbine]]s favored higher frequencies. The steadier rotation speed of high-speed machines allowed for satisfactory operation of [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]]s in rotary converters.&lt;ref name=LAMME18/&gt;
The synchronous speed N in RPM is calculated using the formula,
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac {120f}{P} \,&lt;/math&gt;
where f is the frequency in Hertz and P is the number of poles.

Direct-current power was not entirely displaced by alternating current and was useful in railway and electrochemical processes. Prior to the development of [[mercury arc valve]] [[rectifier]]s, rotary converters were used to produce DC power from AC. Like other commutator-type machines, these worked better with lower frequencies.

===Transmission and transformers===
With AC, [[transformer]]s can be used to step down high transmission voltages to lower customer utilization voltage. The transformer is effectively a voltage conversion device with no moving parts and requiring little maintenance. The use of AC eliminated the need for spinning DC voltage conversion motor-generators that require regular maintenance and monitoring.

Since, for a given power level, the dimensions of a transformer are roughly inversely proportional to frequency, a system with many transformers would be more economical at a higher frequency.

[[Electric power transmission]] over long lines favors lower frequencies. The effects of the distributed capacitance and inductance of the line are less at low frequency.

Generators can only be interconnected to operate in parallel if they are of the same frequency and wave-shape. By standardizing the frequency used, generators in a geographic area can be interconnected in a [[power transmission|grid]], providing reliability and cost savings.

==History==
{{See also|War of Currents}}
[[File:Power Grid of Japan.svg|right|thumb|Japan's utility frequencies are {{nowrap|50 Hz}} and {{nowrap|60 Hz}}]]
Many different power frequencies were used in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fractional [[Hertz|Hz]] frequencies originated in the 19th century practice that gave frequencies in terms of alternations per minute, instead of alternations (cycles) per second. For example, a machine which produced 8,000 alternations per minute is operating at 133⅓ cycles per second.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very early isolated AC generating schemes used arbitrary frequencies based on convenience for [[steam engine]], [[water turbine]] and [[electrical generator]] design. Frequencies between 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz and 133⅓&amp;nbsp;Hz were used on different systems. For example, the city of Coventry, England, in 1895 had a unique 87&amp;nbsp;Hz single-phase distribution system that was in use until 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Woodward ,''City of Coventry Single and Two Phase Generation and Distribution'', retrieved from http://www.iee.org/OnComms/pn/History/HistoryWk_Single_&amp;_2_phase.pdf October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of frequencies grew out of the rapid development of electrical machines in the period 1880 through 1900.

In the early incandescent lighting period, single-phase AC was common and typical generators were 8-pole machines operated at 2,000&amp;nbsp;RPM, giving a frequency of 133 hertz.

Though many theories exist, and quite a few entertaining [[urban legend]]s, there is little certitude in the details of the history of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz vs. 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The German company [[AEG]] (descended from a company founded by Edison in Germany) built the first German generating facility to run at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. At the time, AEG had a virtual [[monopoly]] and their standard spread to the rest of Europe. After observing flicker of lamps operated by the 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power transmitted by the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition – 1891|Lauffen-Frankfurt link]] in 1891, AEG raised their standard frequency to 50&amp;nbsp;Hz in 1891.&lt;ref name=OWEN97/&gt;

[[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] decided to standardize on a higher frequency to permit operation of both electric lighting and induction motors on the same generating system. Although 50&amp;nbsp;Hz was suitable for both, in 1890 Westinghouse considered that existing arc-lighting equipment operated slightly better on 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, and so that frequency was chosen.&lt;ref name=OWEN97&gt;{{Cite web | last = Owen | first = Edward | title = The Origins of 60-Hz as a Power Frequency | work = Industry Applications Magazine | publisher = IEEE | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | date = 1997-11-01 | pages = 8, 10, 12-14 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel3/2943/13663/00628099.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of Tesla's induction motor, licensed by Westinghouse in 1888, required a lower frequency than the 133&amp;nbsp;Hz common for lighting systems at that time.{{verification needed|date=March 2017}} In 1893 General Electric Corporation, which was affiliated with AEG in Germany, built a generating project at [[Mill Creek, California]] using 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, but changed to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz a year later to maintain market share with the Westinghouse standard.

===25 Hz origins===
The first generators at the [[Niagara Falls]] project, built by Westinghouse in 1895, were 25&amp;nbsp;Hz, because the turbine speed had already been set before [[alternating current]] power transmission had been definitively selected. Westinghouse would have selected a low frequency of 30&amp;nbsp;Hz to drive motor loads, but the turbines for the project had already been specified at 250&amp;nbsp;RPM. The machines could have been made to deliver 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz power suitable for heavy commutator-type motors, but the Westinghouse company objected that this would be undesirable for lighting and suggested 33⅓&amp;nbsp;Hz. Eventually a compromise of 25&amp;nbsp;Hz, with 12-pole 250&amp;nbsp;RPM generators, was chosen.&lt;ref name=LAMME18/&gt; Because the Niagara project was so influential on electric power systems design, 25&amp;nbsp;Hz prevailed as the North American standard for low-frequency AC.

===40 Hz origins===
A [[General Electric]] study concluded that 40&amp;nbsp;Hz would have been a good compromise between lighting, motor, and transmission needs, given the materials and equipment available in the first quarter of the 20th century. Several 40&amp;nbsp;Hz systems were built. The [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891|Lauffen-Frankfurt demonstration]] used 40&amp;nbsp;Hz to transmit power 175&amp;nbsp;km in 1891. A large interconnected 40&amp;nbsp;Hz network existed in north-east England (the [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company]], NESCO) until the advent of the [[National Grid (UK)]] in the late 1920s, and projects in Italy used 42&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas P. Hughes]], ''Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society 1880–1930'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore 1983 {{ISBN|0-8018-2873-2}} pgs. 282-283&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest continuously operating commercial [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power station in the United States, [[Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant]], still produces electric power at 40&amp;nbsp;Hz and supplies power to the local 60&amp;nbsp;Hz transmission system through [[frequency changer]]s. Industrial plants and mines in North America and Australia sometimes were built with 40&amp;nbsp;Hz electrical systems which were maintained until too uneconomic to continue. Although frequencies near 40&amp;nbsp;Hz found much commercial use, these were bypassed by standardized frequencies of 25, 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz preferred by higher volume equipment manufacturers.

The [[Ganz Works|Ganz Company]] of Hungary had standardized on 5000 alternations per minute (41{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;Hz) for their products, so Ganz clients had 41{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;Hz systems that in some cases ran for many years.&lt;ref name=Neidhofer11&gt;Gerhard Neidhofer ''50-Hz frequency: how the standard emerged from a European jungle'', ''IEEE Power and Energy Magazine'', July/August 2011 pp. 66-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standardization===
In the early days of electrification, so many frequencies were used that no one value prevailed (London in 1918 had ten different frequencies). As the 20th century continued, more power was produced at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (North America) or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (Europe and most of Asia). Standardization allowed international trade in electrical equipment. Much later, the use of standard frequencies allowed interconnection of power grids. It wasn't until after World War II with the advent of affordable electrical consumer goods that more uniform standards were enacted.

In the United Kingdom, a standard frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz was declared as early as 1904, but significant development continued at other frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;The Electricity Council, ''Electricity Supply in the United Kingdom: A Chronology from the beginnings of the industry to 31 December 1985 Fourth Edition'', {{ISBN|0-85188-105-X}}, page 41&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] starting in 1926 compelled the standardization of frequencies among the many interconnected electrical service providers. The 50&amp;nbsp;Hz standard was completely established only after [[World War II]].

By about 1900, European manufacturers had mostly standardized on 50&amp;nbsp;Hz for new installations. The German [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|Verband der Elektrotechnik]] (VDE), in the first standard for electrical machines and transformers in 1902, recommended 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz as standard frequencies. VDE did not see much application of 25&amp;nbsp;Hz, and dropped it from the 1914 edition of the standard. Remnant installations at other frequencies persisted until well after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Neidhofer11/&gt;

Because of the cost of conversion, some parts of the distribution system may continue to operate on original frequencies even after a new frequency is chosen. 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power was used in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], the northern United States, and for [[railway electrification]]. In the 1950s, many 25&amp;nbsp;Hz systems, from the generators right through to household appliances, were converted and standardized. Until 2009, some 25&amp;nbsp;Hz generators were still in existence at the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations|Sir Adam Beck 1]] (these were retrofitted to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) and the [[Rankine power station|Rankine]] generating stations (until its 2009 closure) near [[Niagara Falls]] to provide power for large industrial customers who did not want to replace existing equipment; and some 25&amp;nbsp;Hz motors and a 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power station exist in New Orleans for floodwater pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dotd.louisiana.gov/press/pressrelease.asp?nRelease=513|title=LaDOTD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[15 kV AC railway electrification|15&amp;nbsp;kV&amp;nbsp;AC]] rail networks, used in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], still operate at 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz or 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz.

In some cases, where most load was to be railway or motor loads, it was considered economic to generate power at 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and install [[rotary converter]]s for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Insull, ''Central-Station Electric Service'', private printing, Chicago 1915, available on the Internet Archive,page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Converters for production of DC from alternating current were available in larger sizes and were more efficient at 25&amp;nbsp;Hz compared with 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. Remnant fragments of older systems may be tied to the standard frequency system via a rotary converter or [[static inverter]] frequency changer. These allow energy to be interchanged between two power networks at different frequencies, but the systems are large, costly, and waste some energy in operation.

Rotating-machine frequency changers used to convert between 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems were awkward to design; a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz machine with 24 poles would turn at the same speed as a 25&amp;nbsp;Hz machine with 10 poles, making the machines large, slow-speed and expensive. A ratio of 60/30 would have simplified these designs, but the installed base at 25&amp;nbsp;Hz was too large to be economically opposed.

In the United States, [[Southern California Edison]] had standardized on 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Central Station Engineers of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, '' Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book'', 4th Ed., Westinghouse Electric Corporation, East Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, 1950, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Southern California operated on 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and did not completely change frequency of their generators and customer equipment to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz until around 1948. Some projects by the Au Sable Electric Company used 30&amp;nbsp;Hz at transmission voltages up to 110,000 volts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes as above&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially in Brazil, electric machinery were imported from Europe and United States, implying the country had both 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz standards according to each region. In 1938, the federal government made a law, ''Decreto-Lei 852'', intended to bring the whole country under 50&amp;nbsp;Hz within eight years. The law didn't work, and in the early 1960s it was decided that Brazil would be unified under 60&amp;nbsp;Hz standard, because most developed and industrialized areas used 60&amp;nbsp;Hz; and a new law ''Lei 4.454'' was declared in 1964. Brazil underwent a frequency conversion program to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz that was not completed until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osetoreletrico.com.br/web/component/content/article/58-artigos-e-materias-relacionadas/244-padroes-brasileiros.html|title=Padrões brasileiros|author=Atitude Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, areas operating on 50&amp;nbsp;Hz grid were converted during the 1970s, uniting the country under 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfe.gob.mx/es/LaEmpresa/queescfe/CFEylaelectricidadenMéxico/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the western part of the country (Nagoya and west) uses 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and the eastern part (Tokyo and east) uses 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. This originates in the first purchases of generators from AEG in 1895, installed for Tokyo, and General Electric in 1896, installed in Osaka. The boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back [[high voltage direct current|HVDC]] substations which convert the frequency; these are [[Shin Shinano]], [[Sakuma Dam#HVDC Back-to-Back Station|Sakuma Dam]], [[Minami-Fukumitsu]], and the [[Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter]].

Even by the middle of the 20th century, utility frequencies were still not entirely standardized at the now-common 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. In 1946, a reference manual for designers of radio equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=H.T.

Many of these regions also had 50 cycle, 60 cycle or direct current supplies.

Other power frequencies are still used. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway use [[traction power network]]s for railways, distributing single-phase AC at 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz or 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A frequency of 25&amp;nbsp;Hz is used for the Austrian [[Mariazell Railway]], as well as [[Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system|Amtrak]] and [[SEPTA's 25 Hz traction power system|SEPTA]]'s traction power systems in the United States. Other AC railway systems are energized at the local commercial power frequency, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Traction power may be derived from commercial power supplies by frequency converters, or in some cases may be produced by dedicated [[traction powerstation]]s. In the 19th Century, frequencies as low as 8&amp;nbsp;Hz were contemplated for operation of electric railways with commutator motors.&lt;ref name=LAMME18/&gt;
Some outlets in trains carry the correct voltage, but using the original train network frequency like 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz or 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz.

== 400 Hz ==
Power frequencies as high as 400&amp;nbsp;Hz are used in aircraft, spacecraft, submarines, server rooms for [[Computer power supply|computer power]],&lt;ref&gt;Formerly, [[IBM]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computer systems also used 415&amp;nbsp;Hz power systems within a computer room. Robert B. Hickey,''Electrical engineer's portable handbook'', page 401&lt;/ref&gt; military equipment, and hand-held machine tools.   Such high frequencies cannot be economically transmitted long distances; the increased frequency greatly increases series impedance due to the inductance of transmission lines, making power transmission difficult. Consequently,  400&amp;nbsp;Hz power systems are usually confined to a building or vehicle.

[[Transformer]]s, for example, can be made smaller because the magnetic core can be much smaller for the same power level. Induction motors turn at a speed proportional to frequency, so a  high frequency power supply allows more power to be obtained for the same motor volume and mass. Transformers and motors for 400&amp;nbsp;Hz are much smaller and lighter than at 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, which is an advantage in aircraft and ships. A United States military standard [[MIL-STD-704]] exists for aircraft use of 400&amp;nbsp;Hz power.

==Stability==

===Time error correction (TEC)===
{{anchor|Long-term stability and clock synchronization}}
Regulation of power system frequency for timekeeping accuracy was not commonplace until after 1926 with [[Laurens Hammond]]'s invention of the [[electric clock]] driven by a [[synchronous motor]]. During the 1920s, Hammond gave away hundreds of such clocks to power station owners in the U.S. and Canada as incentive to maintain a steady 60-cycle frequency, thus rendering his inexpensive clock uniquely practical in any business or home in North America. Developed in 1933, The [[Hammond Organ]] uses a synchronous AC clock motor to maintain correct speed of its internal 'tone wheel' generator, thus keeping all notes pitch perfect, based on power-line frequency stability.

Today, AC-power network operators regulate the daily average frequency so that clocks stay within a few seconds of correct time. In practice the nominal frequency is raised or lowered by a specific percentage to maintain synchronization. Over the course of a day, the average frequency is maintained at the nominal value within a few hundred parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald G. |last1=Fink |authorlink1=Donald G. Fink |first2=H.

The target frequency is then adjusted by up to ±0.01&amp;nbsp;Hz (±0.02%) from 50&amp;nbsp;Hz as needed, to ensure a long-term frequency average of exactly 50&amp;nbsp;Hz × 60&amp;nbsp;[[second|s]]/[[minute|min]] × 60&amp;nbsp;min/[[hour|h]] × 24&amp;nbsp;h/[[day|d]] = {{val|4,320,000}} cycles per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/entsoe/Operation_Handbook/Policy_1_final.pdf Entsoe Load Frequency Control and Performance, chapter D].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation|North America]], whenever the error exceeds 10 seconds for the east, 3 seconds for Texas, or 2 seconds for the west, a correction of ±0.02&amp;nbsp;Hz (0.033%) is applied. Time error corrections start and end either on the hour or on the half-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naesb.org/pdf2/weq_bklet_011505_tec_mc.pdf|title=Manual Time Error Correction|author=|date=|website=naesb.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.com/files/BAL-004-0.pdf Time Error Correction].&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts to remove the TEC in North America are described at [[electric clock]].

Real-time frequency meters for power generation in the United Kingdom are available online – an official National Grid one, and an unofficial one maintained by Dynamic Demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://extranet.nationalgrid.com/Realtime/Home/Frequency60Mins |title=National Grid: Real Time Frequency Data – Last 60 Minutes |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dynamicdemand.co.uk/grid.htm |title=Dynamic Demand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency and load===
The primary reason for accurate frequency control is to allow the flow of alternating current power from multiple generators through the network to be controlled. The trend in system frequency is a measure of mismatch between demand and generation, and is a necessary parameter for load control in interconnected systems.

Frequency of the system will vary as load and generation change. Increasing the mechanical input power to any individual synchronous generator will not greatly affect the overall system frequency, but will produce more electric power from that unit. During a severe overload caused by tripping or failure of generators or transmission lines the power system frequency will decline, due to an imbalance of load versus generation. Loss of an interconnection while exporting power (relative to system total generation) will cause system frequency to increase upstream of the loss, but may cause a collapse downstream of the loss, as generation is now not keeping pace with consumption. [[Automatic generation control]] (AGC) is used to maintain scheduled frequency and interchange power flows. Control systems in power stations detect changes in the network-wide frequency and adjust mechanical power input to generators back to their target frequency. This counteracting usually takes a few tens of seconds due to the large rotating masses involved (although the large masses serve to limit the magnitude of short-term disturbances in the first place). Temporary frequency changes are an unavoidable consequence of changing demand. Exceptional or rapidly changing mains frequency is often a sign that an electricity distribution network is operating near its capacity limits, dramatic examples of which can sometimes be observed shortly before major outages. Large generating stations including [[solar farm]]s can reduce their average output and use the headroom between operating load and maximum capacity to assist in providing grid regulation; response of solar inverters is faster than generators, because they have no rotating mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/PV-Plants-Can-Rival-Frequency-Response-Services-From-Natural-Gas-Peakers |title=First Solar Proves That PV Plants Can Rival Frequency Response Services From Natural Gas Peakers|publisher= |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caiso.com/Documents/UsingRenewablesToOperateLowCarbonGrid-FAQ.pdf|title=USING RENEWABLES TO OPERATE A LOW-CARBON GRID|author=|date=|website=caiso.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As variable resources such as solar and wind replace traditional generation and the inertia they provided, algorithms have had to become more sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pjm.com/~/media/committees-groups/task-forces/rmistf/20160323/20160323-item-05-regulation-study.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy storage, such as batteries, are fulfilling the regulation role to an expanding degree as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesignArticles/ArticleID/11627/Battery-Storage-A-Clean-Alternative-for-Frequency-Regulation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequency [[protective relay]]s on the power system network sense the decline of frequency and automatically initiate [[load shedding]] or tripping of interconnection lines, to preserve the operation of at least part of the network. Small frequency deviations (i.e.- 0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz on a 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz network) will result in automatic load shedding or other control actions to restore system frequency.

Smaller power systems, not extensively interconnected with many generators and loads, will not maintain frequency with the same degree of accuracy. Where system frequency is not tightly regulated during heavy load periods, the system operators may allow system frequency to rise during periods of light load, to maintain a daily average frequency of acceptable accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'',McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, pp. 16–15 thought 16-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Kimbark|Edward Wilson Kimbark]] ''Power System Stability Vol. 1'', John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1948 pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Portable generators, not connected to a utility system, need not tightly regulate their frequency, because typical loads are insensitive to small frequency deviations.

=== Load-frequency control ===
Load-frequency control (LFC) is a type of [[PID controller#Integral term|integral control]] that restores the system frequency and power flows to adjacent areas back to their values before a change in load. The power transfer between different areas of a system is known as "net tie-line power".

The general control algorithm for LFC was developed by [[Nathan Cohn]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, N.  ''Control of Generation and Power Flow on Interconnected Systems.''  New York: Wiley.  1971&lt;/ref&gt;  The algorithm involves defining the term "area control error" (ACE), which is the sum of the net tie-line power error and the product of the frequency error with a frequency bias constant.  When the area control error is reduced to zero, the control algorithm has returned the frequency and tie-line power errors to zero.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Duncan J. et al.  ''Power System Analysis and Design.'' 5th Edition.  Cengage Learning.  2012.  pp. 663-664.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audible noise and interference==
AC-powered appliances can give off a characteristic hum, often called "[[mains hum]]", at the multiples of the frequencies of AC power that they use (see [[Magnetostriction]]). It is usually produced by motor and transformer core laminations vibrating in time with the magnetic field. This hum can also appear in audio systems, where the power supply filter or signal shielding of an amplifier is not adequate.

Most countries chose their [[television]] [[vertical synchronization]] rate to approximate the local mains supply frequency. This helped to prevent power line hum and magnetic interference from causing visible beat frequencies in the displayed picture of analogue receivers.

Another use of this side effect has resulted in its use as a forensic tool. When a recording is made that captures audio near an AC appliance or socket, the hum is also inadvertently recorded. The peaks of the hum repeat every AC cycle (every {{#expr: (1000/50) round 2}}&amp;nbsp;ms for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, or every {{#expr: (1000/60) round 2}}&amp;nbsp;ms for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC). Any edit of the audio that is not a multiplication of the time between the peaks will distort the regularity, introducing a [[phase shift]]. A [[continuous wavelet transform]] analysis will show discontinuities that may tell if the audio has been cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20629671|title=The hum that helps to fight crime|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
