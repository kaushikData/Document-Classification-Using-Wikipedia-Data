The '''2009 Triton Oil scandal''' involved the unauthorized release of [[oil]] by [[Kenya Pipeline Company]] (KPC) without informing financiers. The scandal became public in January 2009.

The release of the oil occurred in 2008 when Triton Oil Company was allowed by KPC to withdraw oil amounting to [[Kenyan shilling|Kshs]] 7.6 billion or ([[US dollar|US$]]98.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;PWC [https://www.scribd.com/doc/26046750/Triton-Oil-Scandal-Report "Triton Oil Scandal Report"],'Scribd', 2010-01-29. Retrieved on 2010-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The company collapsed shortly afterward, withdrawing the oil and selling it to the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/-/2558/512818/-/rliqydz/-/index.html "KACC asked to probe $98.7 million Triton oil theft at Kenya Pipeline"], The East African, January 10, 2009. Accessed 2009-05-13.  [https://www.webcitation.org/5j5NF8EZt Archived] 2009-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Triton Oil was owned by [[Yagnesh Devani]]. Kenya has issued a warrant to arrest him, but as of January 2010 he was at large and believed to be in hiding abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, January 2, 2009: [No end to Triton saga one year on http://www.nation.co.ke/business/news/-/1006/834932/-/hejqv2z/-/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afghans in the Netherlands'''  form one of Europe's larger [[Afghan diaspora]] communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;{{harvnb|Hessels|Wassie|2003|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
[[Afghan refugees]] began flowing into the Netherlands in the late 1980s, fleeing violence in their homeland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{harvnb|Feldmann|Bensing|de Ruijter|Boeije|2007|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade up to 2002, the Netherlands was the second-most popular destination in Europe for Afghan asylum-seekers, behind Germany; they made up more than 20% of the total of roughly 170,000 applications for asylum filed by Afghans in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; The Dutch government settled them in a variety of areas with the policy aim of preventing the formation of large immigrant communities in the cities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; 

As a result of the increasing inflow of asylum-seekers, the Dutch government set up a war crimes investigation unit in the late 1990s; the first refugees they charged with war crimes were [[Heshamuddin Hesam]] and [[Habibulla Jalalzoy]], both former members of the Afghan intelligence service [[KHAD]] during the 1980s [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]. Their presence, when it became known, evoked a great deal of unrest and fear among the Netherlands' Afghan community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The New York Times|last=Simons|first=Marlise|date=2005-09-29|accessdate=2009-06-03|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/international/europe/29court.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=dutch%20afghan%20generals&amp;st=cse|title=2 Afghans Face Dutch War-Crimes Charges From 80's Soviet Era}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charged with [[prisoner abuse|abusing prisoners]] in a 2005 trial, they received sentences of 12 and 9 years in prison, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Netherlands: Prison for Afghan War Crimes|last=Simons|first=Marlise|periodical=The New York Times|date=2005-10-15|accessdate=2009-06-03|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/15/world/world-briefing-europe-the-netherlands-prison-for-afghan-war-crimes.html?sq=Jalalzoy&amp;scp=2&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Netherlands signed a voluntary repatriation agreement with the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]] and the transitional government of Afghanistan, recognising the right of Afghan refugees in the Netherlands to return to Afghanistan and establishing procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNHCR|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2007, only 800 had returned; most refugees feel that public safety, women's rights, and educational conditions in Afghanistan are insufficient. Young people who choose to return may also encounter language difficulties, as they exhibit [[language shift]] towards Dutch and away from Dari.&lt;ref name="RadioNetherlands"&gt;{{citation|title=Afghans in the Netherlands|last=Sujan|first=Dheera|periodical=Radio Netherlands|date=2007-11-08|accessdate=2009-06-03|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/radioprogrammes/earthbeat/071108-afghan-netherlands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614160814/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/radioprogrammes/earthbeat/071108-afghan-netherlands|archivedate=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic characteristics==
{{asof|2011}}, statistics of the Dutch [[Statistics Netherlands|Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] with regards to people of Afghan origin showed:
*31,823	persons of first-generation background (17,238 men, 14,585 women)
*8,241 persons of second-generation background (4,244 men, 3,997 women), of which:
**361 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (185 men, 176 women)
**7,880 persons with both parents born outside the Netherlands (4,059 men, 3,821 women)
For a total of 40,064 persons (21,482 men, 18,582 women). This represented more than eight times the 1996 total of 4,916 persons. The proportion of persons of second-generation background increased from 7.7% to 21% over the same period; the rest of the growth was due to immigration. 2010 was the first year since 2003 that population growth by immigration exceeded population growth by natural increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CBS|2011}}; the year 1996 is earliest for which data is available online&lt;/ref&gt; As with other migrant ethnic groups, their age structure is skewed towards young people&amp;mdash;90% are younger than 45, a similar proportion to [[Turks in the Netherlands|Turkish]], [[Iranians in the Netherlands|Iranian]], and [[Somalis in the Netherlands|Somali migrants]], but much higher than the equivalent figure of 60% in the native Dutch population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessels|Wassie|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and community==
Afghan migrants to the Netherlands have founded roughly 130 different associations, mostly aimed at maintaining Afghan culture in the Netherlands and providing charitable assistance&amp;mdash;especially materials like blankets, food, and furniture&amp;mdash;to people and non-governmental organisations in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="RadioNetherlands"/&gt; Afghans form a relatively heterogeneous group both socially and ethnically, with representation of speakers of various [[languages of Afghanistan]] and representatives of various political factions in Afghanistan ranging from communists to democrats and Islamic activists; within organisations, most prefer to work with people of a similar background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessels|Wassie|2003|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
Stress-related illnesses are common among migrants of Afghan background, due to a variety of causes including war, separation from relatives, and uncertainty about their future due to economic and residency permission issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessels|Wassie|2003|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the health care systems of Afghanistan and the Netherlands have proven confusing to some refugees. The [[general practitioner]] plays a far more important role in the Dutch system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Feldmann|Bensing|de Ruijter|Boeije|2007|p=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in the Afghan system, patients often bypass their family doctor&amp;mdash;or in rural areas, village herbalist&amp;mdash;to consult specialists in urban areas directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldmann|Bensing|de Ruijter|Boeije|2007|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistrust of Dutch doctors is common, possibly stemming from Afghans migrants' general feeling of social exclusion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19510">A growing number of film festivals are held in the Middle East to showcase films from the region as well as international standouts.&lt;ref&gt;Jaafar, Ali, [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008038/ Film festivals bloom in Middle East], ''Variety'', 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, institutions and organizations in other parts of the world are increasingly honoring the new generation of filmmakers in the Middle East with '''Arab film festivals'''.

Though burgeoning Arab filmmakers still struggle with constrained funding and a lack of established distribution channels, artists are beginning to produce more and more commercially viable films.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfbusiness.com/2012/12/waiting-for-the-rise-of-the-arab-film-industry/#.URmGf46hZaE&lt;/ref&gt;  Films featured at festivals both in the Middle East and around the world run the gamut from films about war, identity, political or social issues to romantic comedies and thrillers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/world/middleeast/arab-filmmakers-seek-commercial-success.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Goals of festival organizers are largely to provide an alternative portrayal of Arabs to that in mainstream global media in order to promote understanding and dialogue between the Arab world and the West. In addition, festivals work to support Arab filmmakers in the Middle East and elsewhere by providing a platform for them to screen and promote their cinematic achievements to broad audiences.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia"&gt;http://www.varietyarabia.com/en/print.aspx?sid=c34c335b-5b8e-4636-9166-34ec0b3ca62a&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab film festivals in the Middle East ==

=== Egypt ===

The '''[[Cairo International Film Festival]]''' is a world-class annual film festival in Cairo, Egypt. Established in 1976, it was the first film festival to be held in the Arab world and is the only international competitive feature film festival in the Middle East and Africa recognized by the [[FIAPF]]. The festival has awarded many Egyptian and internationally renowned actors, actresses and directors. Special awards, such as the Best Arab Film Award, are bestowed upon the most exceptional regional films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciff.org.eg/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the '''[[Alexandria International Film Festival]]''', Egypt's second largest film festival, is held every September in local theaters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-east/egypt/alexandria/review-470391.html&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics (EAFWC), the festival promotes film culture and aims to bolster relations among international filmmakers and the Mediterranean in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulletfilm.com/festival/alexandria-international-film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrating its 10th edition in 2017 is the '''[[Cairo International Women's Film Festival]]'''. From its earliest edition, Entre Cineastas, to the Caravan of Arab and Latin American Women's Films, CIWFF has developed and expanded over the years. The festival aims at introducing films made by female filmmakers from around the world and serving as a meeting point for them and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/188201/Arts--Culture/Film/INTERVIEW-Filmmaker-Amal-Ramsis-on-the-th-Cairo-In.aspx |title=INTERVIEW: Filmmaker Amal Ramsis on the 9th Cairo Int'l Women's Film Festival |website=english.ahram.org.eg |date=2016-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chosen solely by public vote, one film is presented with the Audience Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/aboutus/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jordan ===

Founded in 2004, the '''[[Jordan Short Film Festival]]''' is managed by the [[Amman Filmmakers Cooperative]], a film collective based in Amman, Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ammanfilmmakers.alif.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625100608/http://ammanfilmmakers.alif.com/ |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a week-long event, the festival organizers promote independent cinema with screenings throughout the year and have launched two main competitions: the International short film competition and the Arab short film competition. Notably, the festival was suspended in 2011 as an act of protest against the killing of peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring. In a statement, the JSFF founder and director noted that "it would be misleading and dishonest to pretend that Jordan under such circumstances can host film festivals that can openly and freely screen films about human rights and other pressing issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordanfilmfestival.com/jsff11-suspended.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919150719/http://jordanfilmfestival.com/jsff11-suspended.html |archivedate=2013-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the '''Karama Human Rights Film Festival''' was conceived and organized by Ma3mal 612 (Think Factory), a collective of avante-garde artists and filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Ma3mal612]&lt;/ref&gt; Karama, which means dignity, promotes cinema that explores human rights issues and opens democratic dialogue about human rights between and among local and international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karamafestival.org/new/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202081048/http://karamafestival.org/new/ |archivedate=2014-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuwait ===
The [http://www.thegreencaravan.com Green Caravan Film Festival], in its 5th year now, is the Middle East's premiere film festival dedicated to the niche market of environmental films. It began in Kuwait in 2009, and from 2010 added Dubai-based screenings to its programming, and plans to add more Gulf cities to its venue locations in the future.

The '''Kuwait Young Film Festival,''' an offshoot of the Kuwait International Film Festival, aims to provide talented youth in Kuwait and elsewhere with an avenue to display their work and compete for awards. Participants must be in school and under 30 years old in order to enter their work. The festival includes film screenings, workshops and social gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuwaitfilmfest.com/thefestival.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816193518/http://www.kuwaitfilmfest.com/thefestival.html |archivedate=2013-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now in its second year, the '''Kuwait International Film Retreat''' is a three-day mini film festival with short and feature film screenings, workshops, social gatherings and an awards ceremony showcasing the best short films in competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kuwaitfilmretreat.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Now in its sixteenth year, the '''Beirut International Film Festival''' is Lebanon's oldest and most prestigious film festival. The annual competition includes categories for feature films, short films and documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[Beirut International Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have seen smaller and more intimate editions of the festival due to the uncertain political climate in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/beirut-international-film-festival-444918&lt;/ref&gt;
"Tripoli Film Festival - Lebanon" has been launched in 2013, it is an international cinematic competition organized yearly during spring, and covering features, shorts, animation and documentaries.

=== Morocco ===

The '''[[International Film Festival of Marrakech]]''', an annual event dedicated to Moroccan and foreign feature and short films, has been held at the end of every year for the past twelve years. His Royal Highness Prince Moulay Rachid presides over the event, which always attracts a bevy of stars. In addition to a grand prize, awards are also given out for best actor, best actress, best short film and jury favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427103821/http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/ |archivedate=2011-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oman ===

The '''Muscat International Film Festival,''' now in its eighth year, showcases films and filmmakers from more than 90 countries.

=== Saudi Arabia ===

Movie theaters have been banned in Saudi Arabia since the 1980s. As such, no film festivals take place within the country. However, a handful of notable Saudi filmmakers exists and in 2012 the first female Saudi filmmaker released the first critically acclaimed feature film filmed entirely in Saudi Arabi, [[Wadjda]], at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://artsfreedom.org/?p=1235&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syria ===

Established in 1979, the '''[[Damascus International Film Festival]]''' is a biannual film festival hosted by the government of Syria. The festival was established by the late Syrian film director Muhammad Shahin and alternates with the [[Carthage Film Festival]] in Tunisia. Since 2011, however, the film festival has been cancelled until further notice due to the crisis in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dp-news.com/en/detail.aspx?articleid=97070&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Arab Emirates ===

The now defunct '''[[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]]''' was created in 2007 and presented works by Arab filmmakers in competition alongside those by major talents of world cinema. It was presented each October, the festival curated "exceptional programs to engage and educate the local community, inspire filmmakers and nurture the growth of the regional film industry."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/&lt;/ref&gt; It was unfortunately brought to a close after eight editions in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/abu-dhabi-film-festival-scrapped-after-eight-editions-1201489683/|title=Abu Dhabi Film Festival Scrapped After Eight Editions|first=Nick|last=Vivarelli|date=7 May 2015|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The '''[[Dubai International Film Festival]]''', was held each December since 2004, showcases new and exciting cinema from the Middle East, Asia, Africa and beyond. It is the oldest film festival in the Persian Gulf region and aims to promote better cultural understanding through achievements in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dubaifilmfest.com/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409140242/http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/en/ |archivedate=2013-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIFF has also pioneered several industry initiatives within its Dubai Film Market, which runs concurrently with the festival and is designed to help support and develop the Arab cinema industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dubaifilmfest.com/en/industry/dubai-film-market/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504161024/http://dubaifilmfest.com/en/industry/dubai-film-market/ |archivedate=2013-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2018 festival was officially cancelled and the management announced that it would return in 2019 with a "new approach". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dubai-film-festival-2018-edition-officially-canceled-1103774|title=Dubai Film Festival 2018 Edition Officially Canceled|first=Alex|last=Ritman|date=18 April 2018|work= The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''[[Gulf Film Festival]]''' took place annually in Dubai. Held in April, the festival presented the best in cinema from the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulffilmfest.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Festival organizers recently announced the formation of the Gulf Film Market, an initiative aimed at developing local and regional film culture through mentoring and social networks. The market will also help create more opportunities for Gulf filmmakers in training, development, production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://5.153.12.16/portal/en/news/551077{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was 'postponed' in 2014 and it never returned. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/life-style/celebrity/gulf-film-festival-postponed-1.1312407|title=Gulf Film Festival ‘postponed'|date=1 April 2014|work=Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Tropfest Arabia''', a short film festival, debuted in 2011 in Abu Dhabi. The festival aims to support emerging talent that might otherwise be excluded from the region’s film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;http://tropfest.com/arabia-en/&lt;/ref&gt; Tropfest Arabia is a part of [[Tropfest]], the largest short film festival in the world and what many consider the first truly global festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://tropfest.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab film festivals abroad ==

A large and growing number of Arab film festivals take place outside of the Middle East. These festivals play a key role in increasing access to and interest in Arab cinema outside of the Arab world.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia" /&gt; They are also important for Arab diasporas eager to stay in touch with the cultural scene of their homelands.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia" /&gt;

Established in California in 1996, the [[Arab Film Festival]] is the largest independent annual exhibition of Arab films in the United States. It is regarded as one of the most important Arab film festivals outside of the Arab world. The official mission of the festival is to "enhance public understanding of Arab culture and to provide alternative representations of Arabs that contradict the stereotypical images frequently encountered in the American mass media." The festival shows films from and about the Arab world in order to furnish audiences with realistic images of Arab culture, art, history, people and politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://arabfilmfestival.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[:es:Festival Internacional de Cine Euro-Árabe AMAL|Amal Euroarab Film Festival]]''' was born in 2003 in [[:es:Santiago de Compostela|Santiago de Compostela]], Spain. It is developed by [http://www.fundacionaraguaney.org/ Araguaney-Bridge between Cultures Foundation] and directed by Ghaleb Jaber Martínez. Amal means "hope" in Arab language, the hope that Arab world needs more than ever. [http://www.festivalamal.es/ Amal Festival] seeks to promote the development of co-productions between Galicia and Spain and Arab countries, building cross-cultural bridges.

The '''London Middle East &amp; North Africa Film Festival''', created in 2011, provides an annual platform for filmmakers to showcase their work and reach audiences who might not otherwise get the opportunity to view cinema from the region, stimulating cross-cultural dialogue, connection and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;http://menafilmfest.com/#/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in London, the annual '''London Palestine Film Festival''' was established in 1998, making it the UK's longest-running festival specialising in film from and upon any region of the Arab world. Providing a platform for international as well as Palestinian film, the festival takes place in Spring and is managed by UK-based non-profit the '''Palestine Film Foundation'''. It combines screenings, artists' talks, and panel discussions, with art exhibitions, conferences, and book launches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palestinefilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Middle Eastern Film Festival NYC''', produced by Media Space NYC, aims to entertain and enlighten moviegoers with both short and feature-length films about topics related to the Middle East. It is an offshoot and new medium incarnation of the very successful Noor Play Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middleeasternfilmfestivalnyc.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sofia Middle East &amp; North Africa Region Film Festival''' is an annual Arab/Islamic event in the Balkans, presenting films from the Middle East and North Africa to a Bulgarian audience. Since its inception in 2009, the festival has screened more than 120 titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.menarfest.com/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malmö Arab Film Festival]] (MAFF)''', founded in 2011 has rapidly grown to be one of the major yearly manifestations of Arab film outside the Arab World. The founder, Mouhamad Keblawi, is also managing director. Thirteen prices are awarded yearly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malmoarabfilmfestival.se&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a number of Arab film festivals abroad focus specifically on the issue of Palestine. Events such as the '''Boston Palestine Film Festival''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonpalestinefilmfest.org/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Toronto Palestine Film Festival''',&lt;ref&gt;http://tpff.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Houston Palestine Film Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpff.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Chicago Palestine Film Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;http://palestinefilmfest.com/&lt;/ref&gt; bring Palestinian and Palestine-related cinema, narratives and culture to a dispersed audience.

== LatinAmerica ==

1.1 [http://www.cinefertil.org/latinarab/ LatinArab International Film Festival]

The Latin Arab International Film Festival has been held yearly for the last seven years in the City of Buenos Aires. The only festival of its kind in the American continent, it has grown into a platform where to meet and promote Arab cinema and where to build a bridge and bring together the Latin American and Arab cultures, as they have so much in common. The festival's venues are public theatres Cine.Ar and el cultural San Martín and the Alliance Francaise. 
At the same time, LatinArab's industry Forum (The Latin Arab Co-Production Forum), held within the frame of the Mar del Plata International Film Festival, aims at potentiating both regions' film industries with the conception of films carried out as co-productions. [http://www.cinefertil.org/latinarab/]

== Notable films ==

Arab film festivals sometimes serve as forums for political and cultural statements. In 2003, for instance, Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Hagar presented his controversial ''Girls' Love'', the story of a love affair between an Egyptian man and a Jewish woman.

More recently, films screened and/or competing at the festivals have reflected the Arab Spring. The 2012 Dubai International Film Festival showcased Hinde Boujemaa’s ''It was Better Tomorrow'', in which a homeless woman and her son live hand to mouth, squatting in apartments left empty by fleeing multinationals. Another documentary, ''True Story of Love, Life Death and Sometimes Revolution'' by Nidal Hassan, gathers the views and testimonies of Syrian women during the Syrian revolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://dubaifilmfest.com/en/news/article/15-powerful-muhr-arab-documentaries-explore-womens-lives-and-society-post-a/year/2012{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4400">The '''Astronomical Society of Australia''' ('''ASA''') is the professional body representing [[astronomer]]s in [[Australia]]. Established in 1966, it is [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Membership of the ASA is open to people "capable of contributing to the advancement of astronomy or a closely related field". This means that the members are mainly active professional astronomers and [[postgraduate students]]. Some retired astronomers and distinguished [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] are also members, and several organisations are corporate members of the Society. The ASA currently has around 600 members. It publishes a peer-reviewed journal, ''Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia''.

==History==
At its establishment in 1966, notable astronomer [[Ben Gascoigne]] was its first Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;Frame &amp; Faulkner, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Society currently has four topical interest groups:

* the Australian National Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (ANITA), a virtual institute which aims to raise the profile of Australian theoretical astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian National Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics|url=http://asa.astronomy.org.au/ANITA/|publisher=The Astronomical Society of Australia Inc|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bulgarians}}
The '''Banat Bulgarians''' ([[Banat Bulgarian language|Banat Bulgarian]]: ''Palćene'' or ''Banátsći balgare''; common {{lang-bg|Банатски българи}}, {{lang|bg-Latn|Banatski balgari}}; {{lang-ro|Bulgari bănățeni}}; {{lang-sr|Банатски Бугари}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|Banatski Bugari}}) are a distinct [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] minority group which settled in the 18th century in the region of the [[Banat]], which was then ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] and after [[World War I]] was divided between [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Hungary]]. Unlike most other Bulgarians, they are [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] by confession and stem from groups of [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] and Roman Catholics from modern northern and northwestern [[Bulgaria]].

Banat Bulgarians speak a distinctive codified form of the Eastern Bulgarian [[vernacular]] with much [[lexicon|lexical]] influence from the other languages of the Banat. Although strongly acculturated to the [[Pannonian Basin|Pannonian]] region (remote from Bulgaria's mainland), they have preserved their Bulgarian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magyar bolgárok?

Since the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878, many returned to Bulgaria and founded new villages there.

== Population ==
The official Romanian census{{when|date=February 2015}} states that 6,468 people of Bulgarian origin inhabit the Romanian part of the Banat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1832&amp;judet_id=0&amp;localitate_id=0 |title=Structura etno-demografică pe arii geografice: Reguine: Vest |language=Romanian |accessdate=2007-03-29 |publisher=Centrul de Resurse pentru Diversitate Etnoculturală }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Demographics of Serbia|Serbian census of 2002]] recognized 1,658 Bulgarians in [[Vojvodina]], the autonomous province that covers the Serbian part of the Banat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/zip/esn31.pdf |format=PDF |title=Final results of the Census 2002: Population by national or ethnic groups, gender and age groups in the Republic of Serbia, by municipalities |date=24 December 2002 |publisher=Republic of Serbia: Republic Statistical Office |page=2 |issn=0353-9555 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian researchers estimate that 12,000 Banat Bulgarians live in Romania and 3,000 in Serbia.&lt;ref name="ivanova"/&gt;

The earliest and most important centres of the Banat Bulgarian population are the villages of [[Dudeştii Vechi]] (''Stár Bišnov'') and [[Vinga]], both today in [[Romania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://knigite.abv.bg/banat/banat.html |last=Караджова |first=Светлана |title=Банатските българи днес&amp;nbsp;–  историята на едно завръщане |language=Bulgarian |date=28 November 1998 |location=София |accessdate=2007-03-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070226202916/http://knigite.abv.bg/banat/banat.html |archivedate = February 26, 2007|deadurl=yes |isbn=0-03-095496-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but notable communities also exist in Romania in [[Denta|Breştea]] (''Bréšća''), [[Dudeştii Vechi|Colonia Bulgară]] (''Telepa'') and [[Denta]] (''Dénta''),&lt;ref name=cedimese&gt;{{cite journal |title=Catholics of Bulgaria |url=http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-catholics.PDF |format=PDF|journal=Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe&amp;nbsp;–  Southeast Europe |last=Kojnova |first=Marija }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cities of [[Timişoara]] (''Timišvár'') and [[Sânnicolau Mare]] (''Smikluš''), as well as in Serbia in the villages of [[Ivanovo (Serbia)|Ivanovo]], [[Konak (Serbia)|Konak]] (''Kanak''), [[Jaša Tomić (place)|Jaša Tomić]] (''Modoš''), and [[Skorenovac]] (''Gjurgevo'').&lt;ref name=nyagulov-p23&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bulgaria, returning Banat Bulgarians populated the villages of [[Asenovo, Pleven Province|Asenovo]], [[Bardarski Geran]], [[Dragomirovo, Veliko Tarnovo Province|Dragomirovo]], [[Gostilya]], and [[Bregare]],&lt;ref name=cedimese/&gt; among others, in some of which they coexist or coexisted with [[Banat Swabians]], other Bulgarian Roman Catholics, and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical population ===
According to various censuses and estimates, not always accurate, the number of the Banat Bulgarians varied as

== History ==

=== Origin and migration north of the Danube ===
The Bulgarian Roman Catholic community in the north-western [[ore]]-mining town of [[Chiprovtsi]] and surrounding villages was possibly established in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Germans in Bulgaria|"Saxon" miners]],&lt;ref name=chipro&gt;{{cite book |last=Чолов |first=Петър |url=http://knigite.abv.bg/chipr/index.html |title=Чипровското въстание 1688 г. |year=1988 |publisher=Народна просвета |location=София |language=Bulgarian |isbn=0-393-04744-X |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401230404/http://knigite.abv.bg/chipr/index.html |archivedate=2007-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later migrated elsewhere or were assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Албанци в Източните Балкани |last=Гюзелев |first=Боян |publisher=IMIR |location=София |year=2004 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-8872-45-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1688, the members of the community organized the unsuccessful [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule of Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=cedimese/&gt;&lt;ref name=chipro/&gt; The uprising was suppressed&lt;ref name=cedime&gt;{{cite journal |title=Catholics of Bulgaria |url=http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-catholics.PDF |format=PDF|journal=Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe&amp;nbsp;— Southeast Europe |last=Kojnova |first=Marija }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to organizational flaws and the halting of the [[Austria]]n offensive against the Ottomans. Around 300 families of the surviving Catholics fled north of the [[Danube]] to [[Oltenia]], initially settling in [[Craiova]], [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]], and other cities, where their existing rights were confirmed by [[Wallachia]]n [[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]]. Some moved to south-western [[Transylvania]], founding colonies in [[Vinţu de Jos]] (1700) and [[Deva, Romania|Deva]] (1714) and receiving privileges such as [[civil rights]] and [[tax exemption]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivanciov, ''Istorijata i tradicijite na balgarskotu malcinstvu ud Rumanija''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oltenia was occupied by [[Austria]] in 1718, the status of the Bulgarians in the region improved again, as an imperial decree of 1727 allowed them the same privileges as their colonies in Transylvania. This attracted another wave of migration of Bulgarian Catholics, about 300 families from the formerly Paulician villages of central northern Bulgaria. They settled in Craiova between 1726 and 1730, but did not receive the same rights as the colonists from Chiprovtsi.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Habsburg]]s were forced to withdraw from Oltenia in 1737 in the wake of a new war with the Ottoman Empire. The Bulgarians fled from this new Ottoman occupation and settled in the Austrian-ruled Banat to the northwest. The Austrian authorities&lt;ref&gt;Милетич, ''Изследвания за българите в Седмиградско и Банат'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; allowed them to found the villages of Stár Bišnov in 1738 and Vinga (or Theresiopolis) in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;According to the earliest entries in the local birth and wedding records. {{cite book|title=История на банатските българи|chapter=Заселването в Банат|chapterurl=http://knigite.abv.bg/banat/6.html#4|url=http://knigite.abv.bg/banat/ronkov.html|first=Яку|last=Ронков|year=1938|publisher=Библиотека "Банатски български гласник"|language=Bulgarian|location=Тимишоара|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226202723/http://knigite.abv.bg/banat/ronkov.html|archivedate=2007-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1744, a decree of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] again confirmed their privileges received in Oltenia.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austrian and Hungarian rule ===
[[File:Star beshenov cyrkva.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The Roman Catholic Church in [[Dudeştii Vechi]], [[Romania]]]]

Around a hundred Paulicians from the region of [[Svishtov]] and [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] migrated to the Banat from 1753 to 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=История на България, том 4: Българският народ под османско владичество (от XV до началото на XVIII в.) |year=1983 |location=София |oclc=58609593 |last=Гандев |first=Христо |publisher=Издателство на БАН |language=Bulgarian |page=249 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The existing Bulgarian population quickly spread throughout the region from the late 18th to the second quarter of the 19th century. They settled in around 20 villages and towns in search of better economic conditions, specifically their need for arable land. Such colonies include those in Modoš (1779), [[Konak, Sečanj|Konak]] and [[Stari Lec]] (1820), [[Belo Blato]] (1885), Bréšća, Dénta, and [[Banatski Dvor]] (1842), Telepa (1846), Gjurgevo (1866), and Ivanovo (1867).&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivanovo serbia 1.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The Roman Catholic Church in [[Ivanovo (Serbia)|Ivanovo]], [[Serbia]]]]
After they settled, the Banat Bulgarians began to take care of their [[education]] and [[religion]]. The [[Neo-baroque|Neo-Baroque]] [[church (building)|church]] in Stár Bišnov was built in 1804 and the imposing [[Neo-Gothic]] church in Vinga in 1892. Until 1863, Banat Bulgarians held [[liturgy|liturgies]] in [[Latin]] and "Illyric". Illyric was a strain of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] which had spread in the communities before they migrated to the Banat. However, with their cultural revival in the mid-19th century, their vernacular was gradually introduced in the church. The revival also led to the release of their first [[printing|printed]] book, ''Manachija kathehismus za katolicsanske Paulichiane'', in 1851. "Illyric" was also substituted with Banat Bulgarian in education in 1860 (officially in 1864). In 1866, Jozu Rill codified the dialect with his essay ''Bálgarskotu pravopisanj''.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 27-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Ausgleich]] of 1867, the Hungarian authorities gradually intensified the [[Magyarization]] of the Banat. Until [[World War I]], they imposed [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as the main language of education.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interwar Romanian and Serbian Banat ===
After [[World War I]], [[Austria-Hungary]] was dissolved and Banat was divided between Romania and Serbia. Most Banat Bulgarians became citizens of the [[Kingdom of Romania]], but many fell inside the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

In [[Greater Romania]], the Banat Bulgarians' identity was distinguished in censuses and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The main language of education was changed to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and the Bulgarian schools were nationalized. A Romanian geography book of 1931 describes the Bulgarians in the county of Timiș-Torontal as "foreigners", and their national dress as "not as beautiful" as the Romanian one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nisipeanu |first=I. |author2=T. Geantă, L. Ciobanu |title=Geografia judeţului Timiş-Torontal pentru clasa II primară |location=Bucharest |year=1931 |pages=72–74 |language=Romanian }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general the Banat Bulgarians were more favourably treated than the larger Eastern Orthodox Bulgarian minority in interwar Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Yugoslavia denied the existence of any Bulgarian minority, whether in the [[Vardar Banovina]], the [[Western Outlands]], or the Banat. Official post-World War I statistics provide no data about the number of the Banat Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with the Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, the Banat Bulgarians were treated better by the Yugoslav authorities,&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Serbo-Croatian]] was the only language of education.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Banat Bulgarians in Romania entered a period of cultural revival led by figures such as Ivan Fermendžin, Anton Lebanov, and Karol Telbis (Telbizov).&lt;ref name=koledarov&gt;{{cite journal |title=Духовният живот на българите в Банатско |first=Петър |last=Коледаров |language=Bulgarian |journal=Славянска Беседа |url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/banat/duh.html |year=1938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These new cultural leaders emphasized the Bulgarian identity at the expense of the identification as Paulicians and Roman Catholics, establishing contacts with the Bulgarian government and other Bulgarian communities in Romania, particularly that in [[Dobruja]]. The organs of this revival were the newspaper ''Banatsći balgarsći glasnić'' (''Banat Bulgarian Voice''),&lt;ref name=koledarov/&gt; issued between 1935 and 1943, and the annual ''Banatsći balgarsći kalendar'' (''Banat Bulgarian Calendar''), issued from 1936 to 1940. There was a plan to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the settlement in the Banat which was the most significant manifestation by Banat Bulgarians in that period. It was partially spoiled by the Romanian authorities, but still attracted much attention among intellectuals in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, "Ново етно-културно възраждане в Банат", ''Банатските българи'', pp. 141-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian Agrarian Party, a section of the [[National Peasants' Party]], was founded in 1936 on the initiative of Karol Telbizov and Dr. Karol Manjov of Stár Bišnov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Banatsći balgarsći glasnić ''(5)'' |date=2 February 1936 |language=Banat Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Petar Telbisz as its chairman,&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bulgarian National Society in the Banat, also headed by Telbisz, was established in 1939.

Bulgaria and Yugoslavia improved their relations in the 1930s, leading to indirect recognition of the Banat Bulgarian minority by the Yugoslav government. Still, the Banat Bulgarian revival was much less perceivable in the Serbian Banat. The Banat Bulgarian population in Yugoslavia was only partially affected by the work of Telbizov, Lebanov, and the other cultural workers in the Romanian Banat.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 196-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emigration to Hungary, the United States and Bulgaria ===
Some Banat Bulgarians migrated again, mainly to Hungary and the [[United States]]. According to Bulgarian data from 1942, 10,000 Banat Bulgarians lived in Hungary, mainly in the major cities, but this number is most likely overestimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Нация и политика |chapter=Банатци |year=1936 |last=Динчев |first=Х. |language=Bulgarian |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Banat Bulgarian community in Hungary include several deputies to the [[National Assembly of Hungary|National Assembly]], such as Petar Dobroslav, whose son László Dobroslav (László Bolgár) was a diplomat, and Georgi Velčov.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Interwar period]], the Banat Bulgarian communities in Romania were among those experiencing the greatest emigration to the USA, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; An organized Bulgarian community was established in [[Lone Wolf, Oklahoma]], where the Banat Bulgarians were mostly farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=История на българската емиграция в Северна Америка |last=Трайков |first=Веселин |year=1993 |location=Sofia |language=Bulgarian |pages=35, 55, 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of Banat Bulgarians returned to Bulgaria, beginning in the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref name=cedimese/&gt; They founded several villages in [[Pleven Province]], [[Vratsa Province]] and [[Veliko Tarnovo Province]] and received privileges, as per the law of 1880, for the settlement of unpopulated lands. They introduced superior agricultural technologies to the country and fully applied their farming experience. Their religious life was partly determined by the clashes between the dominant Eastern Orthodoxy and the minority Catholicism, and cultural conflicts with other Roman Catholic communities which they lived with in several villages, such as the Banat Swabians and the Bulgarian Paulicians from [[Ilfov]].&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, "Банатските българи в България", ''Банатските българи'', pp. 87-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II and later ===
[[File:Banat Bulgarians in Bulgaria.png|left|frame|Location of the main Banat Bulgarian villages in Bulgaria]]
On the eve of [[World War II]], the authoritarian regime of [[Carol II of Romania]] and the [[fascism|fascist]] government under [[Ion Antonescu]] widely discriminated against the Bulgarian minority in the Romanian Banat. Bulgarians were often deprived of property and land, subjected to anti-Bulgarian propaganda, and their villages had to shelter Romanian and [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] refugees from [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Southern Dobruja]].&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 252-258.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Banat in Europa.png|right|thumb|200px|Location of Banat in Europe]]

In May 1941, the Bulgarians in the Romanian Banat contributed to the release of ethnic Bulgarian prisoners of war from the [[Yugoslav Army]], captured by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]], from a camp near Timișoara. Communicating with the Bulgarian state, Banat Bulgarian leaders headed by Anton Lebanov negotiated the prisoners' release and transportation to Bulgaria, after the example of the release of captured Hungarian soldiers from the Yugoslav Army. They temporarily accommodated these Bulgarians from [[Vardar Macedonia]] and the Serbian Banat and provided them with food until they could be taken to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 263-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian Banat was conquered by [[Nazi Germany]] on 12 April 1941, and was occupied for much of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1942, the German authorities allowed Bulgarian minority classes to be created in the Serbian schools in Ivanovo, Skorenovac, Konak, Belo Blato, and Jaša Tomić.&lt;ref&gt;ЦДА, ф. 166к, оп. 1, а.е. 503, л. 130-130а.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sudden change in the war and German withdrawal from the Banat forced education in Bulgarian to be discontinued after the 1943–44 school year.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Banat Bulgarians in Romania and Yugoslavia were ruled by [[communism|communist]] regimes. In the Romanian Banat, some were deported in the [[Bărăgan deportations]] in 1951, but most of those were allowed to return in 1956–57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deportarea în Baragan 1951–1956. Scurtă istorie a deportăţilor din Dudeşti vechi |location=Timişoara |year=1992 |last=Mirciov |first=R. |language=Romanian }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bulgarian school was founded in Dudeștii Vechi in 1948, and in Vinga in 1949. Others followed in Breștea, Colonia Bulgară, and Denta, but these were briefly closed or united with the Romanian schools after 1952, and Bulgarian remained an optional subject.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 294-295, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Romania]] of 1991 allowed Bulgarians in the Romanian Banat parliamentary representation through the minority party of the [[Romanian ethnic minorities parties|Bulgarian Union of the Banat&amp;nbsp;— Romania]] (''Balgarskotu družstvu ud Banát&amp;nbsp;— Rumanija''), led formerly by Karol-Matej Ivánčov and as of 2008 by Nikola Mirkovič,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nasaglas.link.ro/NasaGlas200801.pdf |format=PDF |title=Deputáta Nikola Mirkovič ij bil izbrán predsedátel na B.D.B.-R |issue=1 |year=2008 |language=Banat Bulgarian |journal=Náša glás |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910002759/http://www.nasaglas.link.ro/NasaGlas200801.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bulgarian remained an optional subject in the schools.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 305-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-war Yugoslavia, the existence of a Banat Bulgarian minority was formally recognized, but they were not given the same rights as the [[Western Outlands|larger Bulgarian minority in eastern Serbia]]. Unlike other minorities in Vojvodina, they were not allowed education in their mother tongue, only Serbo-Croatian.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 312-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{South Slavic languages sidebar}}
{{main article|Banat Bulgarian language}}

The vernacular of the Bulgarians of Banat can be classified as a [[Paulician dialect]] of the Eastern Bulgarian group. A typical feature is the "ы" (*y) vowel, which can either take an etymological place or replace "i".&lt;ref name=ivanova/&gt; Other characteristic phonological features are the "ê" (wide "e") reflex of the [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[yat]] and the reduction of "o" into "u" and sometimes "e" into "i": ''puljé'' instead of ''pole'' ("field"), ''sélu'' instead of ''selo'' ("village"), ''ugništi'' instead of ''ognište'' ("fireplace").&lt;ref name=ivanova/&gt; Another characteristic feature is the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of final consonants, which is typical for other [[Slavic languages]], but found only in non-standard dialects in Bulgarian (Bulgarian ''den'' ("day") sounds like and is written as ''denj'').&lt;ref name=stoykov&gt;Стойков, ''Банатски говор''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexically, the language has borrowed many words from languages such as [[German language|German]] (such as ''drot'' from ''Draht'', "wire"; ''gáng'' from ''Gang'', "anteroom, corridor"), Hungarian (''vilánj'' from ''villany'', "electricity"; ''mozi'', "cinema"), Serbo-Croatian (''stvár'' from ''stvar'', "item, matter"; ''ráčun'' from ''račun'', "account"), and Romanian (''šedinca'' from ''ședință'', "conference")&lt;ref&gt;Etymology from Gaberoff Koral German Dictionary (German), [http://dict.sztaki.hu/english-hungarian MTA SZTAKI] (Hungarian), [http://www.krstarica.com/dictionary Serbian-English Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006220820/http://www.krstarica.com/dictionary/ |date=2009-10-06 }} (Serbo-Croatian) and [http://www.dictionare.com/english/dictionary.htm Dictionare.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028033725/http://www.dictionare.com/english/dictionary.htm |date=2010-10-28 }} (Romanian).&lt;/ref&gt; due to the close contacts with the other peoples of the multiethnical Banat and the religious ties with other Roman Catholic peoples. Banat Bulgarian also has some older loanwords from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]&lt;ref name=nyagulov-p27&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greek language|Greek]], which it shares with other Bulgarian dialects (e.g. ''hirgjén'' from Turkish ''ergen'', "unmarried man, bachelor"; ''trandáfer'' from Greek τριαντάφυλλο ''  triantafyllo'', "rose").&lt;ref&gt;See ''Sveta ud pukraj námu'' posts [http://starbisnov.blogspot.com/2007/03/127.html #127] and [http://starbisnov.blogspot.com/2007/03/128.html #128] for the words in use. Etymology from [http://www.seslisozluk.com Seslisozluk.com] (Turkish) and [http://www.kypros.org/cgi-bin/lexicon Kypros.org Lexicon] (Greek).&lt;/ref&gt; Loanwords constitute around 20% of the Banat Bulgarian vocabulary.&lt;ref name=stoykov/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyagulov-p27/&gt; The names of some Banat Bulgarians are also influenced by Hungarian names, as the [[Hungarian name|Hungarian (eastern) name order]] is sometimes used ([[family name]] followed by [[given name]]) and the female ending "-a" is often dropped from family names. Thus, ''Marija Velčova'' would become ''Velčov Marija''.&lt;ref&gt;For another example, see ''[http://nasaglas.link.ro/2007/NG200705.pdf Náša glás] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225173131/http://nasaglas.link.ro/2007/NG200705.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }}'' of 1 March 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides loanwords, the lexis of Banat Bulgarian has also acquired [[calque]]s and [[neologism]]s, such as ''svetica'' ("icon", formerly used ''ikona'' and influenced by German ''Heiligenbild''), ''zarno'' ("bullet", from the word meaning "grain"), ''oganbalváč'' ("volcano", literally "fire belcher"), and ''predhurta'' ("foreword").&lt;ref name=stoykov/&gt;

The Banat Bulgarian language uses its own script, largely based on the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] version of the [[Latin alphabet]] ([[Gaj's Latin Alphabet]]), and preserves many features that are archaic in the language spoken in Bulgaria.  The language was codified as early as 1866 and is used in literature and press, which distinguishes it from plain dialects.&lt;ref name=stoykov/&gt;

== Culture ==
Banat Bulgarians have engaged in literary activity since they settled in the Banat. Their earliest preserved literary work is the historical record ''Historia Domus'' (''Historia Parochiae Oppidi Ó-Bessenyö, in Diocesi Czanadiensi, Comitatu Torontalensi''), written in Latin in the 1740s. The codification of the Banat Bulgarian vernacular in 1866 enabled the release of a number of school books and the translation of several important religious works in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', pp. 32-37.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a literary revival in the 1930s, centred around the ''Banatsći balgarsći glasnić'' newspaper. Today, the Bulgarian Union of the Banat&amp;nbsp;–  Romania issues the biweekly newspaper ''Náša glás'' and the monthly magazine ''Literaturna miselj''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Периодични издания и електронни медии на българските общности в чужбина |publisher=Агенция за българите в чужбина |language=Bulgarian |url=http://www.aba.government.bg/bg/pages/Registry/izdaniya.html |accessdate=2007-04-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325002542/http://www.aba.government.bg/bg/pages/Registry/izdaniya.html |archivedate = March 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the Banat Bulgarians is classed as a separate branch of Bulgarian folk music, with several verbal and musical peculiarities. While the typically Bulgarian [[bar (music)|bars]] have been preserved, a number of melodies display Romanian, Serbian, and Hungarian influences, and the specific [[Koledari (orthodox carolers)|Bulgarian Christmas carols]] have been superseded by urban-type songs. Roman Catholicism has exerted considerable influence, eliminating certain types of songs and replacing them with others.&lt;ref name=kaufman&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Северозападна България: Общности, Традиции, Идентичност.

The women's national costume of the Banat Bulgarians has two varieties. The costume of Vinga is reminiscent of those of sub-Balkan cities in Bulgaria; the one of Stár Bišnov is characteristic of northwestern Bulgaria. The Vinga costume has been particularly influenced by the dress of Hungarians and Germans, but the Stár Bišnov costume has remained more conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Народната носия на банатските българи |last=Телбизова |first=М |author2=К.

==International Migratory Bird Day==
[[File:IMBD Theme Art 2014.jpg|thumbnail|International Migratory Bird Day poster 2014]]
'''International Migratory Bird Day''' is a conservation initiative that brings awareness on conserving migratory birds and their habitats throughout the Western Hemisphere. This program is dedicated to international conservation efforts and environmental education in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Originated by the [[Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center]], it is now coordinated by Environment for the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Environment for the Americas- home of International Migratory Bird Day. Website: birdday.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.migratorybirdday.org]&lt;/sup&gt;

[http://www.migratorybirdday.org International Migratory Bird Day] (IMBD) officially takes place on the second Saturday in May in the U.S. and Canada and on the second Saturday of October in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean each year. Recognizing that this date does not work well for all places or for the migratory birds themselves- sites host these programs at their convenience throughout the year.

This program engages the general public to care about maintaining healthy bird populations and protecting breeding, non-breeding, and stop over habitats used by migratory birds. International Migratory Bird Day programs often are [[Science education|informal science education]] or [[Informal learning|informal science learning]] activities such as bird walks, art competitions, nature based festivals, and presentations. These programs take place in a variety of settings such as zoos, aquariums, protected lands, biospheres, museums, and schools.

Every year International Migratory Bird Day has a new conservation theme with corresponding artwork, educational materials, and activities.

== World Migratory Bird Day ==
In 2006, the [[United Nations]] established '''World Migratory Bird Day''' to be held on the second weekend of May every year. The event was founded as an effort of the UN's [[Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds]] to raise awareness of the migratory linkages between regions of the globe. World Migratory Bird Day events have been held in 118 nations. Each year, the United Nations announces a uniting theme for official events. &lt;ref&gt;{{Official website|http://www.worldmigratorybirdday.org/|World Migratory Bird Day official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Bird Day''' is an annual holiday with half a million adherents who celebrate through [[birdwatching]], studying birds,  and other bird-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2009/01/10/life/doc4966c593226b3955622644.txt TimesHerald.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426171920/http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2009/01/10/life/doc4966c593226b3955622644.txt |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bird [[adoption]] is a particularly important National Bird Day activity.&lt;ref name="petdish"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Eckstein |first=Sandra |url=http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/01/11/petdish.html |title=AJC.com |publisher=AJC.com |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the newspaper ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', many bird enthusiasts celebrate by adopting birds&lt;ref name=petdish/&gt; and by educating future bird owners about the special issues involved with taking care of birds, including their "screaming, biting, constant cleanups, the need for daily interaction and a varied diet". The Avian Welfare Coalition’s National Bird Day campaign aims to improve the welfare of parrots and other birds by discouraging their purchase as pets, and encouraging the support of wild bird habitat conservation programs and captive bird rescue organizations and sanctuaries. National Bird Day takes place every year on January 5&lt;!-- semiannually, with Bird Day 2009 occurring on January 5--&gt;.&lt;ref name="nationalbirdday"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalbirdday.com/ |title=NationalBirdDay.com |publisher=NationalBirdDay.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bird Day (United Kingdom)==

Since 1979, bird lovers in the United Kingdom have taken part in the annual Big Garden Birdwatch. In the annual event coordinated by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], up to half a million people spend an hour counting birds. In 2009 the Big Garden Birdwatch was referred to as "Bird Day" ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/uk/Happy-30th-bird-day-and.4900955.jp |title=Scotsman.com |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= January 22, 2009|accessdate=September 8, 2010 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8862">[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-01817A, v. Rundstedt, v. Fritsch, v. Blomberg.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Left to right: General Gerd von Rundstedt, General Werner von Fritsch and Colonel General Werner von Blomberg; [[Neue Wache]], Berlin, 1934]]
The '''Blomberg–Fritsch affair''', also known as the '''Blomberg–Fritsch crisis''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Blomberg–Fritsch–Krise''), was two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the [[German Armed Forces]] (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') to dictator [[Adolf Hitler]].  As documented in the [[Hossbach Memorandum]], Hitler had been dissatisfied with the two high-ranking military officials concerned, [[Werner von Blomberg]] and [[Werner von Fritsch]], and he regarded them as too hesitant towards the war preparations that he was demanding. Hitler took further advantage of the situation by replacing several generals and ministers with men more loyal to him.

Hitler took personal command of the armed forces through the new ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW) after the defeat outside Moscow in  December 1941 and appointed himself as commander of the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) after [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] was relieved and transferred to the leadership reserve ([[Führerreserve]]). Hitler then began participating at OKW, where Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] never dared to oppose him.

==Blomberg marriage==
The Blomberg–Fritsch affair began soon after the marriage on 12 January 1938 of the War Minister [[Werner von Blomberg]] to Erna Gruhn, when the Berlin police discovered she had a long criminal record and had posed for pornographic photographs. According to testimony given much later, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], information received by the Police Commissioner within days also indicated that 'Marshal von Blomberg's wife had been a previously convicted prostitute who had been registered as a prostitute in the files of seven large German cities; she was in the Berlin criminal files.... She had also been sentenced by the Berlin courts for distributing indecent pictures'.&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/04-25-46.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to a person with such a criminal record violated the standard of conduct expected of officers, as defined by Blomberg himself, and came as a shock to Hitler, as [[Luftwaffe]] chief [[Hermann Göring]] had been Blomberg's best man, and Hitler himself had served as a witness at the wedding. Hitler and Göring saw the development as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg.&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, Robert, ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich'', Yale University Press, 2011, p. 116, {{ISBN|978-0-300-11575-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler ordered Blomberg to have the marriage annulled to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army. Blomberg refused to annul the marriage but after Göring threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge, he resigned from his posts on 27 January 1938.

==Fritsch affair==
The events surrounding Blomberg's marriage inspired Hermann Göring and [[Heinrich Himmler]] to arrange a similar affair for Commander-in-Chief [[Werner von Fritsch]]. Göring did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior. Himmler wanted to weaken the ''Wehrmacht'' and its mainly-aristocratic generals to strengthen his ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', as a competitor to the regular German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]''). In 1936, [[Reinhard Heydrich]] had prepared a file on Fritsch that had allegations of [[homosexuality]] and had passed the information on to Hitler, but Hitler had rejected it and ordered Heydrich to destroy the file. However, Heydrich did not do so.&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Heydrich resurrected the old file on Fritsch, who was again accused of being a [[homosexual]] by Himmler and his ''Schutzstaffel'' (SS.&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich'', pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Fritsch had been encouraged by General [[Ludwig Beck]] to carry out a military ''putsch'' against the Hitler regime but that he declined and resigned on 4 February 1938, to be replaced by [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], whom Fritsch had recommended for the post.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, ''Nemesis'', p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganisation of army==
Hitler used the situation to transfer the duties of the Ministry of War (''[[Reichskriegsministerium]]'') to a new organisation, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'', or OKW), and [[Wilhelm Keitel]], who became the new head of the OKW on 4 February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Keitel, according to his memoirs, had met Hitler on 26 January 1938 to discuss Blomberg's successor. At the meeting, Keitel records that Hitler showed him the indictment against Fritsch under [[Paragraph 175|Paragraph 175 of the penal code]] and explained that despite his efforts to suppress the matter, it had now come to a head. See Irving, ''In the Service of the Reich'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; That weakened the traditional Army High Command (''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'', or OKH), which was now subordinated to the OKW.

Hitler took further advantage of the situation by replacing several generals and ministers with men even more loyal to him and took more effective ''de facto'' control of the ''Wehrmacht'', which ''de jure'', he already commanded. Some senior officers of the ''Wehrmacht'' protested against the changes, most notably Colonel General [[Ludwig Beck]], who circulated a petition signed by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Disapproval of charges against Fritsch==
Soon it became known that the charges against Fritsch were false. The information in the file was, in fact, about a ''Rittmeister'' (cavalry captain), called Achim von Frisch. Himmler and Heydrich still pursued the case, conveniently discovering an individual, called Hans Schmidt, to serve as a witness in support of the charge. The ''Wehrmacht'' demanded a court of honour of officers to examine the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, as it had come to be known. The proceedings were presided over by Hermann Göring. Schmidt claimed to recognise Fritsch as an officer whom he had witnessed in a homosexual act in a public lavatory with a man, known in translation as "Bavarian Joe".&lt;ref&gt;Gisevius, Hans, ''To the Bitter End'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schmidt was exposed as a notorious criminal whose Berlin gang had specialized in the blackmail of homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the German officer corps were appalled at the mistreatment of Fritsch, and at the next meeting, Himmler, Göring and even Hitler might have come under pressure from them, as the case against Fritsch was seen as weak.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Harold Charles, ''Hitler and His Generals: The Hidden Crisis, January–June 1938'', University of Minnesota Press, 1974, p. 248. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-0649-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful annexation (''[[Anschluss]]'') of [[Austria]] shortly thereafter, however, silenced the critics. Colonel General Beck resigned on 18 August 1938 and Colonel General von Rundstedt obtained permission to retire in October 1938.

After Schmidt withdrew his accusation against Fritsch, Schmidt was murdered. Fritsch was formally acquitted on 18 March, but the damage to his name had been done, and he was never reinstated as Commander-in-Chief. Although the army demanded his rehabilitation and restoration to his former command, Hitler would only name him honorary colonel of an artillery regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hargreaves|title=Blitzkrieg Unleashed: The German Invasion of Poland, 1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTW_dftTTUcC&amp;pg=PA245|year=2008|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-0724-4|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just after the German invasion of Poland, Fritsch was inspecting front-line troops when he was shot in the leg and died. Some believed that he had been seeking his own death.

Bound by their personal oath to Hitler (the ''[[Reichswehreid]]'' of 1934, ordered by Blomberg), many members of the ''Wehrmacht'' never acted on their feelings of displeasure on that event. Thereafter, the army was more or less a reliable instrument for Hitler until the [[20th July plot]].

'''Compound empowerment''' refers to the way in which public [[infrastructure]] is used to radically increase the accumulation of private wealth. The term denotes how common wealth—tax supported resources such as public education, financial and legal infrastructure, etc. -- is translated into private or corporate profit. While wealth might be generated in part by intangible or personal qualities such as [[intelligence]] or a strong [[work ethic]], this wealth is ''compounded'' by ''empowering'' structures such as access to stable markets, consistent law enforcement, and the use of resources held in common, such as public roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/50617/?page=1 AlterNet: Progressive Taxation: Some Hidden Truths&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the wealth of an individual or corporation, the more they use common wealth in order to increase and sustain their earnings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionnorthprogressives.com/?page_id=10 Chuck Watts, Representative » 3. Progressive Principles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private wealth and common wealth==

The concept of compound empowerment stresses the degree to which the acquisition of great private wealth depends upon common structures. For example, while a wealthy individual such as [[Bill Gates]] might owe his status as the world's richest man largely to his intelligence and innovation, his ability to earn and maintain his fortune was and is compounded by public resources held in common. According to theorists such as [[George Lakoff]], the prominent cognitive [[linguist]] and founder of the non-partisan think tank the [[Rockridge Institute]], Bill Gates "built his company with many employees educated in public schools and universities. Tax-funded research helped develop computer science and the Internet. Trade laws negotiated and enforced by the government protect his ability to sell his products abroad. These are but a few of the ways in which Mr. Gates' accumulation of wealth was empowered by the common wealth and by taxation."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/lakoff progressive-taxation-some-hidden-truths&lt;/ref&gt;

The inextricability of private wealth and public resources was influentially formulated by the political philosopher [[John Rawls]], who argued that wealth is arbitrary from a moral point of view, as those factors that enable the accumulation of wealth in a society are largely contingent—that is, are the outcome of luck more than of morally relevant activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view docId=ft767nb4br&amp;chunk.id=d0e2123&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e2003&amp;brand=eschol 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-bad-luck/ Justice and Bad Luck (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compound empowerment and fair taxation==

Compound empowerment has been evoked to justify progressive taxation and other policies which stress the fundamental fairness of taxing wealthy individuals and corporations in a manner commensurate with their earnings. Because private capital is compounded by infrastructural resources held in common, supporters of progressive taxation argue that rich individuals and businesses should be called upon to support the infrastructures that enable the acquisition and maintenance of their wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=125&amp;subsecID=163&amp;contentID=1398 PPI: Why Fairness Matters: Progressive Versus Flat Taxes by Robert J. Shapiro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Since a poor individual uses compound empowerment to a far lesser degree than wealthy individuals, it follows that the former would pay a smaller portion of taxes than the latter. Advocates of [[tax cuts]] or other policies that mitigate the taxation of the wealthy tend to argue that progressive taxation "punishes" the rich for their superior performance in the market. The concept of compound empowerment, on the other hand, argues that, having generated their wealth in part through public structures, fairness demands an equitable return to those structures through graduated taxation.

The '''Croats of Serbia''' ({{lang-sh|Hrvati u Srbiji}}, Хрвати у Србији) are the recognized [[Croat]] national minority in [[Serbia]], a status they received in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rs.mvp.hr/?mh=335&amp;mv=1934&amp;id=1890 | title=Hrvatska manjina u Republici Srbiji | work=rs.mvp.hr | publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (Croatia)|Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Republic of Croatia]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2011 census, there were 57,900 Croats in Serbia or 0.8% of the region's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptId=1216|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416163334/http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptId=1216|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 April 2013|title=Official Census 2011 Results|publisher=Republički zavod za statistiku|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 47,033 lived in [[Vojvodina]], where they formed the fourth largest ethnic group, representing 2.8% of the population. A further 7,752 lived in the national capital [[Belgrade]], with the remaining 3,115 in the rest of the country.

[[Croatian language|Croatian]] is listed as one of the six official languages of Vojvodina, autonomous province located in the northern part of the country which traditionally fosters multilingualism, [[multiculturalism]] and multiconfessionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vojvodina.gov.rs/en/autonomous-province-vojvodina|title=Government of Vojvodina|work=vojvodina.gov.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people of Croat ethnic descent have held high positions in Serbia, succh as Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Speaker of the National Assembly.

==History==

During the 15th century, [[Croats]] mostly lived in the [[Syrmia]] region. It is estimated that they were a majority in 76 out of 801 villages that existed in the present-day territory of Vojvodina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtafki.hu/konyvtar/kiadv/etnika/ethnicMAP/005_session_e.html Károly Kocsis, Saša Kicošev: Changing ethnic patterns on the present territory of Vojvodina]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 17th century, [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bunjevci]] from [[Dalmatia]] migrated to Vojvodina, where [[Šokci]] had already been living. According to some opinions, Šokci might be descendants of medieval [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population of [[Vojvodina]] where their ancestors might lived since the 8th century. According to other opinions, medieval Slavs of Vojvodina mainly spoke [[ikavian]] dialect. Between 1689, when the Habsburg Monarchy conquered parts of Vojvodina, and the end of the 19th century, a small number of Croats from [[Croatia]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} also migrated to the region.

Before the 20th century, most of the Bunjevac and Šokac populations living in Habsburg Monarchy haven't been nationally awakened yet. Some of their leaders (like [[Ivan Antunović]], [[Blaško Rajić]], [[Petar Pekić]], Pajo Kujundžić, Mijo Mandić, Lajčo Budanović, Stipan Vojnić Tunić, Vranje Sudarević, etc.) worked hardly to awake their Croatian or Yugoslav national feelings.

[[File:Novi Sad, Petrovaradin, kostel svatého Jurija, deska krále Tomislava.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Commemorative plaque in [[Petrovaradin]], suburb of Novi Sad ("To Tomislav, first Croatian king. Citizens of Petrovaradin.")]]

According to 1851 data, it is estimated that the population of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]], the historical province that was predecessor of present-day Vojvodina, included, among other ethnic groups, 62,936 Bunjevci and Šokci and 2,860 Croats.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Dušan J. Popović, Srbi u Vojvodini, knjiga 3, Novi Sad, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}} Subsequent statistical estimations from the second half of the 19th century (conducted during Austro-Hungarian period) counted Bunjevci and Šokci as "others" and presented them separately from Croats (in 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, 70,000 Bunjevci were categorized as "others").&lt;ref name="Lončarević"&gt;Juraj Lončarević: Hrvati u Mađarskoj i Trianonski ugovor, Školske novine, Zagreb, 1993, {{ISBN|953-160-004-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910 [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] census also showed large differences in the numbers of those who considered themselves Bunjevci and Šokci, and those who considered themselves Croats. According to the census, in the city of [[Subotica]] there were only 39 citizens who declared Croatian as their native language, while 33,390 citizens were listed as speakers of "other languages" (most of them declared Bunjevac as their native language).&lt;ref name="talmamedia.com"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121216114127/http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=B%E1cs-Bodrog] &lt;/ref&gt; In the city of [[Sombor]], 83 citizens declared Croatian language, while 6,289 citizens were listed as speakers of "other languages" (mostly Bunjevac).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=B%E1cs-Bodrog |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-20 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216114127/http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=B%E1cs-Bodrog |archive-date=2012-12-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the municipality of [[Apatin]], 44 citizens declared Croatian and 7,191 declared "other languages" (mostly Bunjevac, Šokac and Gypsy).&lt;ref name="talmamedia.com"/&gt; {{Dead link|date=December 2013}}

In [[Syrmia]], which was then part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], according to the 1910 census results&lt;ref&gt;A magyar szent korona országainak 1910. évi népszámlálása; Budapest 1912&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croats]] were a relative or absolute majority in [[Gibarac]] (843 Croats or 86.46% out of total population), [[Kukujevci]] (1,775 or 77.61%), [[Novi Slankamen]] (2,450 or 59.22%), [[Petrovaradin]] (3,266 or 57.02%), [[Stari Slankamen]] (466 or 48.19%), [[Hrtkovci]] (1,144 or 45.43% ) and [[Morović]] (966 or 41.67%). Other places which had a significant minority of Croats included [[Novi Banovci]] (37.70%), [[Golubinci]] (36.86%), [[Sremska Kamenica]] (36.41%), [[Sot (Šid)|Sot]] (33.01%), [[Sremska Mitrovica]] (30.32%), [[Sremski Karlovci]] (29.94%) and [[Ljuba]] (29.86%).

In 1925, [[Bunjevac-Šokac Party]] and Pučka kasina organized in [[Subotica]] the 1000th anniversary celebration of the establishment of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], when in 925 [[Tomislav of Croatia]] became first king of the Croatian Kingdom. On the King Tomislav Square in [[Subotica]] a memorial plaque was unveiled with the inscription "The memorial plaque of millennium of Croatian Kingdom 925-1925. Set by Bunjevci Croats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=81814 Mario Bara: Hrvatska seljačka stranka u narodnom preporodu bačkih Hrvata (The Croatian Pesants Party in the national movement of Bačka Croats), p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Subotica, memorial plaques of [[Tomislav of Croatia|King Tomislav]] were also revealed in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and [[Petrovaradin]].

In 1990s, during the [[Croatian War of Independence|war in Croatia]], members of Serbian Radical Party organized and participated in the expulsion of the Croats in some places in Vojvodina. The President of the [[Serbian Radical Party]], [[Vojislav Šešelj]] is indicted for participation in these events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ses-ii030115e.htm Vojislav Seselj indictment]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some estimations, the number of Croats which have left Serbia under political pressure of the Milošević's regime might be between 20,000 and 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvpei.hr/hmiu/tekst.asp?q=hnm007 Hrvatska nacionalna manjina u Srbiji] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311170041/http://www.mvpei.hr/hmiu/tekst.asp?q=hnm007 |date=March 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The number of Croats in Serbia was somewhat larger in previous censuses that were conducted between 1948 and 1991. However, the real number of declared Croats in the time when these censuses were conducted may have been smaller because the communist authorities counted those citizens who declared themselves [[Bunjevci]] or [[Šokci]] as ''Croats''. Today, most members of the Šokci community consider themselves Croats, while large part of the Bunjevci population see themselves as members of the distinct Bunjevci ethnicity, while smaller part sees themselves as Croats.

[[Image:Sonta, Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Saint Lawrence the Martyr Catholic Church in [[Sonta]]]]
The largest recorded number of Croats in a census was in 1961 when there were 196,409 Croats (including Bunjevci and Šokci) in the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] (around 2.57% of the total population of Serbia at the time). Since 1961 census, the [[Croats|Croat]] population in Serbia is in a constant decrease. This is caused by various reasons, including economic emigration, and ethnic tensions of the [[Yugoslav wars]] during the 1990s, more specifically the 1991-1995 [[War in Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [https://archive.is/20120802231303/http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=48&amp;tx_comments_pi1%5Bpage%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=95003&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=150&amp;cHash=16d368452b Pismo prognanih Hrvata Josipoviću]&lt;/ref&gt; During this war-time period, Croats in Serbia were under pressure from the [[Serbian Radical Party]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/42/t42-2.htm July 13, 1992 Vreme News Digest Agency No 42, Hrtkovci, The Moving Out Continues, by Jasmina Teodosijevic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199707/70726-006-trae-beo.htm Serbia Facing Chauvinism Again, Awakening of rats]&lt;/ref&gt; and some Serb [[refugees]] from [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to move to Croatia.

==Politics==
The Croats of Serbia are politically represented by several political parties, including: [[Democratic League of Croats in Vojvodina]], [[Demokratska zajednica Hrvata]] (''Democratic Union of Croats''), [[Hrvatska bunjevačko-šokačka stranka]] (''Croatian Bunjevac-Šokac Party''), [[Hrvatski narodni savez]] (''Croatian national alliance'') and [[Hrvatska srijemska inicijativa]] (''Croatian Syrmian Initiative'').

The [[Croat National Council]] is, according to its Statute, a body of self-government of Croat minority in Serbia. On 11 June 2005 the Council adopted the [[coat of arms of Croatia|historical coat of arms of Croatia]], a [[checkerboard]] consisting of 13 red and 12 white fields (the difference with the Croatian coat of arms being the crown on top).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hnv.org.rs/obiljezja.php {{Language icon|hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms of Croats of Serbia is one of the symbols of the Croatian minority in Serbia. The coat of arms of Croats of Serbia is actually the [[coat of arms of Croatia|historical coat of arms of Croatia]]. It is a [[checkerboard]] ({{lang-hr|Šahovnica}}) that consists of 13 red and 12 white fields. The difference between this coat of arms and the coat of arms of Croatia is in the crown on top, which this coat of arms does not have, but the coat of arms of Croatia has.&lt;ref name="hnv"&gt;http://www.hnv.org.rs/obiljezja.php {{Language icon|hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated on the center of [[flag of Croats of Serbia]].

'''Djiboutians''' are the citizens of [[Djibouti]]. The country is mainly composed of two ethnic groups, namely the Somali and the Afar. It has many languages though [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Afar language|Afar]] are the most widely spoken ones, [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] serve as the official languages.

Djibouti has a population of about {{UN_Population|Djibouti}} inhabitants.{{UN_Population|ref}} It is a [[multiethnic]] country. The local population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century, increasing from about 83,000 in 1960 to around 846,000 by 2016. The two largest ethnic groups are the [[Somalis|Somali]] (60%) and the [[Afar people|Afar]] (35%). The [[Somali clan]] component is mainly composed of the [[Issa (clan)|Issas]] sub-clan of the larger [[Dir (clan)|Dir]], with smaller [[Gadabuursi]] Dir and [[Isaaq]]. The remaining 5% of Djibouti's population primarily consists of Yemeni [[Arab]]s, Ethiopians and Europeans (French and Italians). Approximately 76% of local residents are urban dwellers; the remainder are [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]].&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

After the [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] in 1991, many of Djiboutians emigrated abroad. Most reside in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and the [[Middle East]].

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Djibouti}}
[[File:Djibwomglopul.jpeg|thumb|Djiboutian women in common attire (2010).]]
Djiboutians culture is primarily rooted in Somali and Afar traditions. They speak different languages [[Cushitic languages]], which are part of the larger Afro-Asiatic (Hamito-Semitic) language family, however, have a way of life same: authentic legendary warriors, they are nomadic [[pastoralists]]. However, the population tends to settle because today more than half of its citizens live in the capital and the towns and villages of the interior. Poetry traditionally recited in the villages by special readers called gabaye was a way of recording the community's history and customs, as well as current events.

===Cuisine===
{{Culture of Djibouti}}
{{main|Djiboutian cuisine}}

[[Djiboutian cuisine]] is a mixture of [[Somali cuisine|Somali]], [[Afar people|Afar]], [[Yemeni cuisine|Yemeni]], and [[French cuisine]], with some additional [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] (especially [[Indian cuisine|Indian]]) culinary influences. Local dishes are commonly prepared using a lot of Middle Eastern spices, ranging from [[saffron]] to [[cinnamon]]. Spicy dishes come in many variations, from the traditional ''Fah-fah'' or "''Soupe Djiboutienne''" (spicy boiled beef soup), to the ''yetakelt wet'' (spicy mixed vegetable stew). ''Xalwo'' (pronounced "halwo") or [[halva]] is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions. Halva is made from [[sugar]], [[corn starch]], [[cardamom]] powder, [[nutmeg]] powder and [[ghee]]. [[Peanut]]s are sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.&lt;ref&gt;Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79&lt;/ref&gt; After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[incense]] (''cuunsi'') or [[frankincense]] (''lubaan''), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Djibouti}}

Djiboutian music has Somali and Afar roots, Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. That is, they only use five [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale such as the [[major scale]]. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, [[Sudan]] or the [[Arabian Peninsula]], but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Traditional Afar music resembles the folk music of other parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] such as [[Music of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]; it also contains elements of [[Arabic music]]. The history of Djibouti is recorded in the poetry and songs of its nomadic people, and goes back thousands of years to a time when the peoples of Djibouti traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]] and [[China]]. Afar oral literature is also quite musical. Popular Djiboutian musicians include [[Nima Djama]], [[Abdo Xamar Qoodh]], [[Mohamed Ali Fourchette]], [[Abdallah Lee]], [[Said Xamar Qoodh]] and [[Xabiiba Cabdilaahi]].

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Djibouti}}

Storytelling is an ancient custom in Djiboutian culture. Love of cinema is but a modern, visual incarnation and continuation of this well-established tradition. The earliest forms of public film display in Djibouti were in [[French language|French]]. In the 1920s, the first local movie theaters opened, during a time when [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]] was growing in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Observatoire Culturel ACP: RAPPORT FINAL REPUBLIQUE DE DJIBOUTI | author =M. Guedi Ali Omar| accessdate = 2016-07-13| url = http://www.acpculturesplus.eu/sites/default/files/2015/04/01/djibouti_-_rapport_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film theaters became a place where local residents could watch movies in a relaxed atmosphere. With the development of the local film industry, additional theaters were launched. Among these establishments was the ''Eden'' in 1934, ''Olympia'' in 1939, ''Le Paris'' in 1965, and ''Al Hilal'' in 1975.

During the 1970s, the capital city had five movie theaters, with one in each district. A few local attempts at film making were also concurrently carried out with the participation of local actors. One of these was ''Burta Djinka'', a film in [[Somali language|Somali]] directed by G. Borg in 1972. Following independence in 1977, a growing number of government-owned production and distribution companies as well as actual projection theaters sprang up.

In the 1990s two of the biggest cinemas, Odeon and Olympia, closed their doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Observatoire Culturel ACP: RAPPORT FINAL REPUBLIQUE DE DJIBOUTI | author =M.

{{main|Religion in Djibouti}}
[[Islam]] entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted Muslims had sought refuge across the [[Red Sea]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] at the urging of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In 1900, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no [[Christians]] in the territories, with only about 100–300 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the [[French Somaliland]]. Islam is the driving force behind the unity of varying ethnic groups from different parts of the country, and has significantly shaped the values and traditions of Djiboutian.

'''Eleanor Jarman''' (born 1904; date of death unknown) was an [[Americans|American]] runaway, [[fugitive|fugitive from justice]], and  [[Robbery|robber]] who was jailed, [[Prison escape|escaped from jail]] in 1940, was placed on the [[FBI ten most wanted fugitives]] list, and remains [[Missing person|missing]].

==Early life and crime career==
Jarman was born to Julius and Amelia Berendt, the youngest of eight children, in [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. She married and had two children with a man called Leroy Jarman. When Jarman left the family, she moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]] and worked in odd jobs until she met [[George Dale (criminal)|George Dale]]. Dale supported her, although Jarman later claimed that she did not know Dale did it by robbery.

On August 4, 1933, Dale, Jarman and [[Leo Minneci]] tried to rob a clothing store in Chicago's far West Side. In a struggle with the shop owner, Gustav Hoeh, Jarman clawed at him, but then Dale shot him.

When the robbers drove away, several witnesses noted the [[license plate]]. That led police to Minneci, who blamed the other two, who were soon arrested. Dale blamed Minneci for the robbery. Jarman said that she did not know which one did it. She claimed she was in the back room looking for clothes.

However, witnesses described how Jarman and Dale had entered the store and claimed she had threatened the clerk. Press made her a major player in all of Dale's crimes, dubbed her "the Blond Tigress" and compared her to [[Bonnie Parker]] (of [[Bonnie and Clyde]]).

Jarman was not tried for robberies but for complicity in Hoeh's murder. Her defense attorney was A. Jefferson Schultze. The prosecuting attorney, [[Wilbur Crowley]], called for [[Capital punishment|the death penalty]].

George Dale was sentenced to die in the [[electric chair]]. As his last wish, he wrote a love letter to Jarman. Minneci and Jarman were sentenced to jail, Jarman for 199 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12388833/tiger_woman_is_given_term/|title="Tiger Woman" Is Given Term|date=1 September 1933|publisher=Hope Star|location=Hope, Arkansas|page=1|accessdate=15 July 2017|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12388433/gets_199year_term/|title=Gets 199-Year Term|date=3 September 1933|publisher=The Sunday News and Tribune|location=Jefferson City, Missouri|page=11|accessdate=15 July 2017|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the longest criminal sentences ever imposed at the time. Her children were sent to live with her older sister and her husband, Hattie and Joe Stocker, in Sioux City, Iowa.

==After imprisonment==
===A model prisoner===
For the next seven years, Jarman was a model prisoner. In 1940, according to her family, she heard that her son was about to run away, and concerned about her children, [[Prison escape|escaped the prison]] on August 8, 1940.&lt;ref name="gribben"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gribben | first = Mark | title = Eleanor Jarman Please Phone Home | work = The Malefactor's Register | date = 2006-07-28 | url = http://malefactorsregister.com/wp/eleanor-jarman-please-phone-home/ | accessdate = 2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with another inmate, Mary Foster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12388681/flees_reformatory/|title=Flees Reformatory|date=23 August 1940|publisher=The Neosho Daily News|location=Neosho, Missouri|page=2|accessdate=15 July 2017|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She apparently went to [[Sioux City, Iowa]], confirmed that her children were all right and then went underground. She was put into the [[FBI]]'s [[FBI ten most wanted fugitives|Most Wanted]] list, but was never found.

===The 1975 meeting===
Over the next 35 years, Jarman maintained surreptitious contact with her family through classified ads.&lt;ref name="gribben" /&gt; In 1975, she arranged a secret meeting with her brother and sister-in-law, Otto and Dorothy Berendt, and her son Leroy who was in his 50s at the time. During this meeting, which the family disclosed decades later, Leroy tried to persuade Jarman to give herself up. She refused, and she said she was not worried about capture, believing the authorities had long since stopped looking for her. Communications with her family through newspaper ads tapered off in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="gribben" /&gt; A 1993 petition to grant Jarman a pardon failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1993-10-07-9310070131-story.html|title=CLEMENCY BOARD DENIES HEARING FOR FUGITIVE WHO ESCAPED IN '40|last=Writer|first=John O'Brien, Tribune Staff|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jarman officially remains a fugitive, she was born in {{Start date and age|1904|df=yes|p=yes}}, so it is [[Declared death in absentia|likely that she is dead]], and that her death was recorded under an alias.

Foreign nationals have often been abducted by various militant groups who are involved in the current [[War in North-West Pakistan]] and are linked to [[terrorism in Pakistan]].

[[File:The Frith Stool, Hexham Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 647010.jpg|thumb|The Frith Stool at Hexham Abbey.|227x227px]]
Among ancient English writers, '''fridstoll''', or '''frithstow''', signified a seat, chair, or place of peace. The most famous surviving examples are in [[Beverley Minster]], which has the inscription ''Haec sedes lapidea Freedstoll dicitur'', i.e. Pacis Cathedra, ''ad quam reus fugiendo perveniens, omnimodam habet securitatem'' and in [[Hexham Abbey]] .

Also, [[frith]]-stool or frithstool, OE frithstól, frythstól, freedstool, fridstool, meaning (a). Old English only, ''A place of safety; a refuge''; (b). ''A seat, usually of stone, formerly placed near the altar in some churches, which afforded inviolable protection to those who sought privilege of sanctuary.''&lt;ref name=OEDOnlinefrith-stool&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also signified a [[palace]], which was usually a privileged place.

'''German Peruvians''' are [[Peru]]vian citizens of full or partial [[Germans|German ancestry]]. In general, the term is also applied to descendants of other [[German language|German]]-speaking immigrants, such as [[Austrians|Austrian]]s or [[Swiss]]. The phrase may refer to someone born in [[Peru]] of Austrian, German or Swiss descent or to someone who has immigrated to Peru from German speaking countries.

==History==
Since independence Germans had been immigrating to [[Lima]] on a small scale. the first wave of immigration was in 1853, organized by then-president [[Ramon Castilla]]. These immigrants established themselves in the cities of [[Tingo Maria]], [[Tarapoto]], [[Moyobamba]], and in the department of [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]]. [[:de:Kuno Damian von Schütz-Holzhausen|Baron Kuno Damian Freiherr Schutz von Holzhausen]], the leader of the immigration movement, consulted with the then [[Ministry of Foreign Relations of Peru|Peruvian Minister of Foreign Relations]], Manuel Tirado. The meeting's purpose was to colonize the central jungle to better link the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts. The colonists would end up colonizing [[Pozuzo]]. In 1854, the first immigration contract was signed between the Baron and then-[[List of Presidents of Peru|president]] [[José Rufino Echenique]]. The next year, in 1855, this contract was nullified as Echenique had been ousted and [[Ramon Castilla]] had assumed the presidency again. The Baron signed a new contract with the new president on December 6, 1855. According to the contract each colonist would be reimbursed by the government for the cost of the voyage from Europe to [[Pozuzo]], the construction of a new highway from [[Cerro de Pasco]] to [[Pozuzo]], each colonist 15 years old or older would receive 15 pesos, the distribution of {{convert|360|km2|sqmi}} land between the colonists of which they would have legal ownership, exemption for the first six months of taxes, and the responsibility to build schools, churches, and other basic needs. The government, however, required that the colonists be [[Catholic]] and workers skilled at a trade. To make this project possible the Baron was hired by the [[Government of Peru|Peruvian government]] to oversee the colonization, paying him a salary of 2,400 pesos annually. The first wave of colonists departed [[Antwerp]] in 1857 and arrived in the [[Peru]]vian port of [[Callao]] two months later. The third wave of immigrants to the jungle occurred in 1868, taking the same route as the second wave of immigrants did. In later years, the descendants of the German immigrants would go on to found new cities throughout the central jungle such as [[Oxapampa]] and [[Villa Rica District|Villa Rica]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Throughout the history of [[Peru]], particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, a substantial number of [[German people|German]] immigrants have settled in other parts of [[Peru]], primarily in [[Lima]]. Also, many of these German immigrants have [[Jewish]] heritage. A large part of Jewish Peruvians are of German descent.

'''Greek settlement in the Philippines''' is a small community of descendants of ethnic [[Greeks]] who settled the country since the [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonization of the country]].

==Overview==
According to some historical accounts, there were already Greek settlers in the country as early as the 18th century, most are [[sailors]] and [[Merchant|traders]], and [[fishermen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924070600261|title=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803; explorations by early navigators, descriptions of the islands and their peoples, their history and records of the Catholic missions, as related in contemporaneous books and manuscripts, showing the political, economic, commercial and religious conditions of those islands from their earliest relations with European nations to the beginning of the nineteenthe century;|last=Blair|first=Emma Helen|last2=Robertson|first2=James Alexander|last3=Bourne|first3=Edward Gaylord|last4=Alvarez de Abreu|first4=Antonio|date=1903-01-01|publisher=Cleveland, O., The A.H.

During the early 20th century, a number of Greek sailors and [[Greek diaspora|immigrants]] came to the country and settled. One group came to the city of Legazpi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/forum/life/adamson.html|title=Greeks in the Philippines|website=www.hri.org|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the island of [[Luzon]] who kept their Greek identities and have become distinguished [[public figure]]s and [[intellectual]]s in the country.

[[Adamson University]] in Manila was founded by a Greek immigrant, George Lucas Adamson. He also founded the first Greek Orthodox church in the Philippines, two paper mills, and a shipping company.&lt;ref name="Greeks in the Philippines"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/forum/life/adamson.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Guy, Robot'''" is the third episode of the [[Family Guy (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Family Guy]]'', and the 252nd episode overall. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 11, 2015, and is written by [[Chris Regan]] and directed by Mike Kim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20150925fox04/|title=(FG-1302) "Guy Robot"|date=September 25, 2015|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a play on the [[Will Smith]] film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', which itself is a loose adaptation of [[Isaac Asimov|Isaac Asimov's]] collection of short stories ''[[I, Robot]]''.

==Plot==
While the Griffin family watches a comedy show that [[Aziz Ansari]] is on, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is not impressed and insists he could do better. At the Chuckle Bucket Comedy Club, different acts are played like Carl doing his impression of [[Bob Belcher]] from ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and [[Sterling Archer]] from ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' (a reference to all three characters being voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]). Brian's act bombs when he tries political humor. Desperate, he reads [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]'s [[Twitter]] quips and gets big laughs from the audience. After the performance, Brian is confronted at the bar area by an angered Stewie with this causing a wedge between the two. Stewie builds a [[robot]] which he names Lyle to replace Brian, angering Brian. Stewie and Lyle spend time together like seeing ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' (which disappoints them so much that they refuse to discuss the film and sullenly turn in for the night) and disguising themselves as an adult at a [[Six Flags]] park to ride the rides.

Meanwhile, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] gets ready for bed as a drunken [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] comes in and falls asleep on her side of the bed. This leaves her sleeping on his side which has collapsed springs due to Peter's weight. The next day, Lois insists they go out to find a new mattress as they visit the Quahog Mattress Store. As the salesman proves not to be a reliable source for advice, they try out mattresses on their own. She and Peter try the Deep Slumber 3000 at the mattress store, but Lois buys it on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] when they are purchasing it, and they chase a [[delivery drone]] that's delivering it. When they try out the new mattress, Peter wants to have intercourse with Lois, but Lois suggests holding off on it for a while since they just bought the mattress, much to Peter's dismay.

Things take a disappointing turn for Stewie when Lyle becomes hugely intelligent (including creating an urban plan for a workable Palestinian state) and creates robot friends of his own named Ted R. and Ted B. since he pointedly tells Stewie that his creator is no longer smart enough to be his friend. The robots then make Stewie do humiliating things in order to join them, such as forcing him to eat and then vomit up salad dressing, and this makes Stewie miserable.

When Peter voices his annoyance of not being able to have sex with Lois to [[Glenn Quagmire]], [[Cleveland Brown]], and [[Joe Swanson]] at the Drunken Clam, Quagmire suggests finding the past mattress. They first head to an asylum to find it, but the owner checks them in by institutionalizing Peter and Cleveland, euthanizing Joe, and allowing Quagmire to make out with the female patients. Then they head to a filming site where [[List of Family Guy characters#Bruce|Bruce]] is involved in the production of a pornography film as they find that the old mattress is being used to hold all the food on it. Peter brings it back to the house, and convinces Lois to keep it since it symbolizes their marriage and they have intercourse on it.

Brian finds Stewie in a toilet, where he says one of the Teds told him that it's where a piece of crap has to live. Brian coaxes him to stop them and they reconcile. Stewie tries to short them out with lemonade. But when he is unsure about outsmarting them, Brian steps in and shorts them out with a hose.

Happy that things returned to normal, Lois and Peter find that they have severe itching and get rid of the old mattress again. When Brian asks what he did with the robots, Stewie says that he threw them to the curb. Simultaneously, Lyle, Ted R., and Ted B. are on the curb on top of Lois and Peter's old mattress. While walking Jesse, Herbert sees this. Thinking that it's a trap for pedophiles, Herbert voices his disapproval about it.

==Reception==
The episode received an audience of 2.79 million, making it the second-most watched show on Fox that night behind ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode, "[[Puffless]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunday final ratings: 'The Good Wife' and 'Last Man on Earth' adjusted up, plus final NFL numbers|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/10/13/sunday-final-ratings-oct-11-2015/477642/|last=Porter|first=Rick|accessdate=October 13, 2015|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', the total number of people speaking the [[Ho language]] was 1,040,000 as of 2001.&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hoc |title= Ho: A Language of India | accessdate= 14 October 2017 |work= Ethnologue | publisher= SIL International }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to other Austroasiatic groups in the area, the Ho report varying degrees of multilingualism, also using [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="Mohan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohan|first1=Shailendra|editor1-last=Hashnain|editor1-first=Imtiaz|editor2-last=Bagga-Gupta|editor2-first=Sangeeta|editor3-last=Mohan|editor3-first=Shailendra|title=Linguistic Identity and Language Preferences Among the Austro-Asiatic Language Speakers of Jharkhand|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9781443847162|pages=286–303|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/download/45589677/linguistic_identity_and_language_preference.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2017|chapter=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 90% of the Ho practice the indigenous religion [[Sarnaism]]. The majority of the Ho are involved in agriculture, either as land owners or laborers, while others are engaged in mining. Compared to the rest of India, the Ho have a low literacy rate and a low rate of school enrollment. The government of Jharkhand has recently approved measures to help increase enrollment and literacy among children.&lt;ref name = "indiaex" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "elib" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ndtv" /&gt;

==History==

Recent genetic studies suggest that Austroasiatic speakers in India are likely the descendants of a relatively small group of migrants from Southeast Asia who mixed extensively with local Indian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chaubey|first1=G.|last2=Metspalu|first2=M.|last3=Choi|first3=Y.|last4=Magi|first4=R.|last5=Romero|first5=I.

(2011), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21740156 ''The Austroasiatic Munda population from India and Its enigmatic origin: a HLA diversity study''].&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic evidence further suggests that the Austroasiatic ancestors of the modern people arrived in northeastern India between 4600-5800 years BP (before present) and continued migrating over the next millennium, arriving in their current locations in eastern India approximately 4000 years before present.&lt;ref&gt;Arunkumar et al.

According to historian [[Ram Sharan Sharma]] in his book [[India's Ancient Past]] mentioned that, many [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], and non-Sanskrit terms occur in the Vedic texts ascribed to 1500-500 BC.&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;Ancient History by R.S Sharma, pp 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;They indicate ideas, institutions, products, and settlements associated with peninsular and non-Vedic India. The people of this area spoke the proto-Munda language. Several terms in the Indo-Aryan languages that signify the use of cotton, navigation, digging, stick, etc. have been traced to the Munda languages by linguists. There are many Munda pockets in [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]], in which the remnants of Munda culture are strong. It is held that changes in the phonetics and vocabulary of the Vedic language can be explained as much on the basis of the Dravidian influence as that of the Munda.&lt;ref name=Sharma /&gt;

Starting from the period between the 9th and 12th centuries, copper was smelted in many parts of old Singhbhum district. It is believed that many immigrants entered [[Singhbhum (Lok Sabha constituency)|Singhbhum]] from [[Manbhum]] in the 14th century or earlier. When the Hos entered old Singhbhum, they overcame the [[Bhuiya]]s, who were then inhabitants of the forest country. In the latter half of the eighteenth century, the Hos fought several wars against the Rajas of the [[Chota Nagpur Tributary States|Chota Nagpur States]] and [[Mayurbhanj district|Mayurbhanj]] to retain their independence. As far as is known, the Muslims left them alone.&lt;ref name = "Houlton"&gt;Houlton, Sir John, ''Bihar: The Heart of India'', 1949, pp. 132, 138-139, 166-169, Orient Longmans, Kolkata.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the area was formally claimed to be a part of the [[Mughal Empire]], neither the Mughals nor the [[Marathas]], who were active in the surrounding areas during the decline of the Mughals, ventured into the area.&lt;ref name = "Prasad"&gt;Prasad, Hem Chandra. ''Bihar''. 1983/2003,  pp. 36, 67, 159, 162, 184. National Book Trust, New Delhi. {{ISBN|81-237-0151-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
      
In 1765, Chota Nagpur was ceded to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] as part of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[Bihar Province|Bihar]], and [[Orissa Province|Orissa Provinces]]. The Raja of Singhbhum asked the British Resident at [[Midnapore]] for protection in 1767, but it was not until 1820 that he acknowledged himself as a feudatory of the British. The restless Hos broke the agreement soon and took part in a fierce rebellion of 1831-33, called the Kol uprising, along with the [[Munda people|Mundas]].&lt;ref name = "Prasad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ho Tribe of Singhbhum by C.P.Singh&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate cause of the Kol uprising was the oppression of Adivsis by non-Adivasi ''thikadars'' (literally meaning contractors) or farmers of rent. The Hos and Mundas were joined by the [[Kurukh people|Kurukh]] and the houses of many ''dikku'' (non-Adivasis or outsiders) landlords were burnt and a number of people were killed.&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt; It compelled the British to recognise the need for a thorough subjugation of the Hos.&lt;ref name = "Prasad"/&gt; The uprising was suppressed with a good deal of trouble by several hundred British rroops.&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt; While local troops quelled the uprising, another group under Colonel Richards entered Singhbhum in November 1836. Within three months all the ringleaders surrendered. In 1857, the Raja of [[Porahat]] rose in rebellion and a sizeable section of the Hos joined in the revolt. Troops were sent who put an end to the disturbances by 1859.&lt;ref name = "Prasad"/&gt;

==Language==
{{main|Ho language}}
Ho people speak the [[Ho language]], an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] closely related to [[Mundari language|Mundari]] and more distantly related to languages of Southeast Asia such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Mon language|Mon]]. The Austroasiatic languages of India, including Ho, are inflected [[fusional language]]s unlike their distant relatives in Southeast Asia which are [[analytic languages]]. This difference in [[linguistic typology|typology]] is due to extensive language contact with the unrelated Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. The phonology of Ho has also been influenced by the nearby unrelated languages.&lt;ref name=Sidwell /&gt; There are at least three dialects of Ho: Lohara, [[Chaibasa]] and [[Thakurmunda]]. All dialects are mutually intelligible with approximately 92% of all Ho speakers able to understand a narrative discourse in both Chaibasa and Thakurmunda dialects.&lt;ref name=ethno /&gt; The most divergent dialects are in the extreme south and east of Ho territory.

While fewer than five percent of Ho speakers are literate in the language, Ho is typically written in [[Devanagari]], [[Latin script|Latin]], scripts. A native alphabet, called [[Warang Citi]] and invented by [[Lako Bodra]] in the 20th century, also exists.&lt;ref name=ethno /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Paul|title=(Re)inventing writing: stories and histories|page=5|url=http://www.hoffmancommapaul.com/papers/lis470/re-inventing-writing.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Ho village life revolves around five main ''parab'' or festivals. The most important festival, ''[[Mage Parab]]'', takes place in the late winter month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] and marks the completion of the agricultural cycle.&lt;ref name="Hebbar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hebbar|first1=Ritambhara|title=Homecoming: Ho Women, Work, and Land Rights in Jharkhand|journal=Sociological Bulletin|date=January 2005|volume=54|issue=1|pages=18–39|doi=10.1177/0038022920050102|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268684531|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a week-long celebration held to honor Singbonga, the creator god. Other lesser ''bonga'' ("deities") are also honored throughout the week. ''Baa Parab'', the Festival of Flowers held in mid-spring, celebrates the yearly blossoming of the sacred Sal trees. ''[[Sohrai]] or ''Gaumara'' is the most important agricultural festival, the date of which usually coincides with the nationwide festivities in the fall. It is a village wide celebration with music and dancing held in honor of the cattle used in cultivation. During the ceremonies, the cows are painted with a flour and dye mix, anointed with oil and prayed over after a black chicken is sacrificed to an image of the cattle bonga. ''Baba Hermutu'' is the ceremonial first sowing. The date is set each year in the early spring by the ''deuri'' who also officiates the three-day ceremony by praying and commencing his first sowing of the year. ''Jomnama Parab'' is held in late fall before the first harvest is eaten to thank the spirits for a trouble-free harvest.&lt;ref name="Hebbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duary|first1=Nabakumar|editor1-last=Behera|editor1-first=M.C.|title=Tribal Religion : Change and Continuity|date=2000|publisher=Vedams Ltd.|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8171696192|chapter=12. Change and continuity in Ho religion--an impact study in South Bihar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sohrai|url=http://keraientertainment.com/the-sohrai/|website=Ho Cultural Preservation Website|publisher=keraientertainment|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance is important to Adivasi culture in general and for the Ho, it is more than simply a means of entertainment. Their songs are generally accompanied by dances which change with the seasons. Songs and distinctively choreographed dance are integral parts of Ho culture and art,&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Prasad2"&gt;Prasad, Hem Chandra, ''Bihar'',  pp. 13, 34, 179, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as important parts of their traditional festivals, especially Mage Parab. Most villages have a dedicated dancing ground, called ''akhra'', usually consisting of a cleared space of hard ground under a spreading tree. Dances are organised on a staggered basis in the villages so that other villagers can participate. Traditional Ho music incorporates native instruments including a ''dama'' (drum), ''[[dholak]]'', ''dumeng'' ([[barrel drum|mandar]]), and the ''rutu'' (flute).&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt;

The Ho people brew a sort of rice-beer commonly known as ''[[diyeng]]'', otherwise also known as "handiya" in other languages. It is said to be highly refreshing and invigorating. It has great importance in religious festivals, and is also used as a good medicine for the stomach.

===Religion===
{{See also|Sarnaism}}
In the 2001 national census, 91% of the Hos declared that they professed "other religions and persuations", meaning that they do not consider themselves to belong to any of the major religious groups and follow their indigenous religious systems called "Sarna" or [[Sarnaism]].&lt;ref name = "JharkhandData"/&gt; Also known as ''sarna dhorom'' ("religion of the holy woods"), this religion plays an important part in the life of adivasi.&lt;ref name="Pal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pal|first1=T|title=Sacred Grove in Jharkhand|journal=Indian International Journal of Humanities, Arts and Social Science Research|date=December 2016|volume=I|issue=I|url=http://www.iijhassr.com/Published%20Paper/Vol-I/Issue-I/Vol-I_Issue-I_P5.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2017|issn=2456-4389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their beliefs in gods, goddesses and spirits are ingrained in them from childhood. The religion of the Hos resembles, to a great extent that of [[Santhal people|Santhals]], [[Kurukh people|Oraons]], [[Munda people|Mundas]], and other tribal people in the region. All religious rituals are performed by a village priest known as a ''deuri''. However, he is not required to propitiate malevolent spirits or deities. The spirit doctor ''deowa'' takes care of this.&lt;ref name = "Prasad"/&gt;

===Position of women===
Houlton writes, "I do not want to give the impression, by mentioning occasional divergences from the straight and narrow path, that aboriginals are immoral.  On the contrary, their standards of post-marital morality and fidelity are probably a good deal higher than in some races that claim to be more civilised. The status of women is high.  Wives are partners and companions to their husbands.  It is even whispered that hen-pecked husbands are not uncommon among the tribesmen."&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt;

There is a system of payment of bride-price amongst the Hos. The bride-price is often a status symbol and in modern times it remains not more than 101-1001 rupees. As a result, many Ho girls remain unmarried till advanced age.&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt; Among the total Ho population, females outnumber the males.&lt;ref name = "JharkhandData"/&gt;

==Economy==
Almost half the population is engaged in cultivation and another one third also work as land-less agricultural labourers.&lt;ref name = "JharkhandData"/&gt; The Hos, along with Santals, Oraons and Mundas, are comparatively more advanced, and have taken to settled cultivation as their mode of life.&lt;ref name = "Prasad2"/&gt;  
 
The discovery of [[iron ore]] in Ho territory opened the way for the first iron ore mine in India at Pansira Buru in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan, N.R., ''History of The Indian Iron and Steel Company'', 1983, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years iron ore mining spread out in the area. Many Hos are engaged in mining work but that does not add up to any sizeable percentage. However, small, well planned mining towns dotting the territory have brought the Ho people in close touch with the good and bad aspects of urbanization. Some of the prominent mining towns in the area are [[Chiria]], [[Gua, Jharkhand|Gua]], [[Noamundi]] and [[Kiriburu]].

==Forests==
[[File:Shorea robusta in Chhattisgarh.jpg|thumbnail|Sal tree]]
[[Sal tree|Sal]] (Shorea robusta) is the most important tree in the area and it seems to have a preference for the rocky soil there. Although sal is a deciduous tree and sheds its leaves in early summer, the forest undergrowth is generally evergreen, which has such trees as [[mango]]es, [[Jambul|jamun]], [[jackfruit]], and [[Guava|piar]]. Other important trees are [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], kusum, [[Wendlandia|tilai]], harin hara (Armossa rohitulea), gular (Fiscus glomerata), [[Terminalia elliptica|asan]]. The Singhbhum forests are best in the Kolhan area in the south-west of the district.&lt;ref name = "Prasad2"/&gt; The lives of Ho people have long been intertwined with sal forests and there is a strong resentment against the efforts of timber merchants to replace sal forests with teak plantations.

The reserved forests are the haunt of many animals. Wild [[elephant]]s are common in [[Saranda forest|Saranda]] (literally meaning seven hundred hills) and Porahat forests. Herds of [[Sambar Deer|sambar]] and [[chital]] roam about the forests. [[Bison]] is still found (locally extinct when a study was undertaken in 2005 by Kisor Chaudhuri FRGS). [[Tiger]]s were never numerous but they are there (locally extinct when a study was undertaken in 2005 by Kisor Chaudhuri FRGS). [[Leopard]]s are more common. The Hos are keen hunters and have practically exterminated game in Kolhan. They organise great ''battues'', in which thousands of people join. They beat their drums in a huge circle, and gradually close in over hills and across forests, driving the wild animals on to a central point, on to which lines of hunters converge until the animals are surrounded and slaughtered.&lt;ref name = "Houlton"/&gt;

==Literacy==
At the 2001 census, Hos had an overall literacy rate of 39.2% and a female literacy rate of 23.9%.&lt;ref name = "JharkhandData"/&gt; This is against the overall literacy rate of 53.56% in Jharkhand, and a women’s literacy rate of 38.87% in Jharkhand. Both are amongst the lowest [[Literacy in India|literacy rates in India]].&lt;ref&gt;Table 1.5: Ranking of States/ UTs by literacy rate among Persons, Males, Females, 2001 census, in ''India 2005'', pp. 12-13, Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to help increase the literacy rates, the government announced in 2016 that it had designed text books to teach Hindi and mathematics in Ho.&lt;ref name = "indiaex"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cm-raghubar-das-talks-about-new-jharkhand-governor-underlines-several-projects-in-santhal-pargana-region-4798328/ | title=CM Raghubar das talks about 'New Jharkhand', Governor underlines several projects in Santhal Pargana region| date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 those textbooks were made available on the central government's e-library platform.&lt;ref name= "elib"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/jharkhand-central-e-library-to-have-textbooks-in-tribal-languages/story-d4zqHbHg2ynY6VSIJWc10I.html | title=Jharkhand: Central e-library to have textbooks in tribal languages| date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 effort to help promote tribal languages Tata Steel, a private company, began teaching the Ho language on weekends to dropout schoolgirls at a "camp school" in Naomundi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/education/jharkhand-school-dropout-girls-to-get-lessons-in-ho-language/ | title=Jharkhand: School dropout girls to get lessons in Ho language| date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2016, 100 girls were enrolled in the camp school. The company has also ran private Ho language centres in East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts since 2011. Approximately 6000 people have underwent Ho language and Warang Chiti script training in these centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.avenuemail.in/region/ho-classes-launched-noamundi-camp-school/99322/ | title=Ho classes launched at Noamundi Camp School| date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the government of Jharkhand announced it would soon begin teaching five- and six-year-old primary school students in their local language in order to help reduce the high dropout rate.&lt;ref name = "ndtv"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ndtv.com/education/jharkhand-government-to-introduce-kg-education-in-25-000-primary-schools-1729487 | title=Jharkhand Government to Introduce KG Education in 25,000 Primary Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Hos, 19.7% have completed schooling and 3.1% are graduates.&lt;ref name = "JharkhandData"/&gt; The percentage of school-going children in the age group 5 –14 years was 37.6.&lt;ref name = "JharkhandData"/&gt;

'''Hokaglish''' (or '''Philippine Hybrid Hokkien'''), also known by locals as ''Sa-lam-tsam oe'' (mixed language), is an oral contact language primarily resulting among three languages: (1) [[Hokkien]], (2) [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and (3) [[English language|English]] (Other languages that have relative influence include [[Cantonese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and other local peripheral languages&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310441396_The_language_ecology_of_post-colonial_Manila_and_Hokaglish|title=The language ecology of post-colonial Manila and Hokaglish|last=Wong Gonzales|first=Wilkinson Daniel|date=16 November 2016|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=''ResearchGate''}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="researchgate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290395747_Exploring_trilingual_code-switching_The_case_of_'Hokaglish'|title=Exploring trilingual code-switching: The case of ‘Hokaglish’ (PDF Download Available)|last=Wong Gonzales|first=Wilkinson Daniel|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2016-10-24|via=''ResearchGate''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically used by Filipino-Chinese or [[Chinese Filipino]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Hokaglish is used in quite a number of domains including corporations, academic institutions, restaurants, religious institutions, phone calls, and houses.&lt;ref name="researchgate1" /&gt; Some note that this is a result of having to maintain command of all three languages in the spheres of home, school, and greater Philippine society. Although used by Chinese Filipinos in general, this form of code switching is very popular with the younger generation ([[Tsinoy]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revistas.usp.br/caligrama/article/viewFile/65395/68006|title=I "Speak Chinese" but..."

The most recent observation of Hokaglish is that the contact language is gradually becoming a normative language of its own due to peculiarities from the phonological to the syntactic and even pragmatic level. Earlier thought to be a creole,&lt;ref name="researchgate.net" /&gt; it may actually be a [[mixed language]] similar to [[Light Warlpiri]] or [[Gurindji Kriol]]. It is also considered a hybrid English or X-English, making it one of the [[Philippine English]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong Gonzales|first=Wilkinson Daniel|date=|title=Philippine Englishes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311769460_Philippine_Englishes|journal=Asian Englishes|volume=19|pages=79–95|doi=10.1080/13488678.2016.1274574|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[home front]]''' covers the activities of the civilians in a nation at war. [[World War II]] was a [[total war]]; homeland production became even more invaluable to both the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers]]. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and [[propaganda]]. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree.

All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences on the [[home front during World War I]]. Their success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. Among morale-boosting activities that also benefited combat efforts, the home front engaged in a variety of scrap drives for materials crucial to the war effort such as metal, rubber, and rags.

The major powers devoted 50–61 percent of their total GDP to munitions production. The Allies produced about three times as much in munitions as the Axis powers.

==Allies==
{{main|Allies of World War II}}
The Allies called themselves the "[[United Nations]]" (even before that organization formed in 1945), and pledged their support to the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; free access to raw materials; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as the disarmament of aggressor nations.

===Belgium===
{{main|Belgium in World War II}}
The sudden German invasion of neutral Belgium in May 1940 led in a matter of 18 days to the collapse of the Belgian army; [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold]] obtained an armistice that involved direct German military administration. The King refused the government's demand that he flee with them to Britain; he remained as a puppet ruler under German control. The Belgian bureaucracy remained in place and generally cooperated with the German rulers. Two pro-German movements, the [[Flemish National Union]] comprising Flemish (Dutch-speaking) separatists and the Walloon (French-speaking) [[Rexism|Rexists]] led by [[Léon Degrelle]] (1906–94), supported the invaders and encouraged their young men to volunteer for the German army.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conway, ''Collaboration in Belgium: Leon Degrelle and the Rexist Movement, 1940–1944'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Small but active resistance movements, largely Communist, provided intelligence to the Allies. During the [[History of the Jews in Belgium#Holocaust|Holocaust in Belgium]], the Nazis hunted down the 70,000 Jews living in Belgium, most of them refugees, and killed 29,000 of them.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Moore, "Jewish Self-Help and Rescue in the Netherlands during the Holocaust in Comparative Perspective", ''Tijdschrift voor Geschiedenis'' (2011) 124#4 pp 492–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans expected to exploit Belgium's industrial resources to support their war machine. Their policies created severe shortages for the Belgian people, but shipped out far less than Germany had expected. They set up the "Armaments Inspection Board" in 1940 to relay munitions orders to factories; the Board came under the control of the German Minister of Armaments, [[Albert Speer]] in 1943, and had offices in industrial areas that were supposed to facilitate orders for materiél, and supervise production. However, factory production fell sharply after 1942. Although collaboration with the Nazis, especially among the Flemish, was evident in 1940, it soon faded in importance. Labor strikes and systematic sabotage slowed production, as did the emigration of workers to rural areas, Allied bombing, food shortages, and worker resentment of forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;José Gotovitch, ''La Rüstungs-Inspektion Belgien'', ''Archives et Bibliothèques de Belgique'' (1969) 40#3 pp 436–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies retook all of Belgium in September 1944 as the Germans retreated. They reappeared briefly during the hard fighting of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, but were finally expelled in January 1945. The London‐based government‐in‐exile returned, but had to confront the resistance movements that demanded radical political change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schrijvers, ''Liberators: The Allies and Belgian Society, 1944–1945'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{See also|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[History of China|China]] suffered the second highest number of casualties of the entire war. Civilians in the occupied territories had to endure many large-scale massacres, including that in [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. In a few areas, Japanese forces also unleashed newly-developed biological weapons on Chinese civilians, leading to an estimated 200,000 dead.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Williams and David Wallace, ''Unit 731: Japan's Secret Biological Warfare in World War II'' (Free Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands died when Nationalist troops broke the [[levee]]s of the [[Yangtze]] to stop the Japanese advance after the loss of the Chinese capital, [[Nanjing]]. Millions more Chinese died because of famine during the war.

Japan captured major coastal cities like [[Shanghai]] early in the war, cutting the rest of China off from its chief sources of finance and industry. Millions of Chinese moved to remote regions to avoid invasion. Cities like [[Kunming]] ballooned with new arrivals. Entire factories and universities were relocated to safe areas so society could still function. Japan replied with hundreds of air raids on the new capital of [[Chongqing]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Although China received much aid from the United States, China did not have sufficient infrastructure to properly arm or even feed its military forces, let alone its civilians.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

China was divided into three zones, with the Nationalists in the southwest and the Communists led by [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao) in control of much of the northwest. Coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese, and civilians were treated harshly{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}; young men were drafted into a puppet Chinese army.

===France===
{{main|Vichy France}}{{further|German occupation of France during World War II|Italian occupation of France during World War II}}
After the stunningly quick victory in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war; part of it, with its capital in [[Vichy]], became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Kedward, ''Occupied France: Collaboration And Resistance 1940–1944'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them in [[prisoner of war]] camps inside Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. The Vichy French government cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong [[French Resistance|Resistance]] movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Cobb, ''The Resistance: The French Fight against the Nazis'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, ''France: The Dark Years, 1940–1944'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

====War wives====
The two million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Fishman, ''We Will Wait: Wives of French Prisoners of War, 1940–1945'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Pollard, ''Reign of Virtue: Mobilizing Gender in Vichy France'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, France gave women the vote and additional legal and political rights, although nothing on the scale of the enfranchisement that followed World War I.

====Food shortages of the home front====
Women suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods and the absence of the men in POW camps.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Diamond, ''Women and the Second World War in France, 1939–1948: Choices and Constraints'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The rationing system was stringent and badly mismanaged, leading to pronounced malnourishment, black markets and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about 20% of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Collingham, ''The Taste of War: World War Two and the Battle for Food'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; French farm production fell by half because of the lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so, the Germans seized half the meat and 20% of the produce.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Mouré, "Food Rationing and the Black Market in France (1940–1944)," ''French History'', June 2010, Vol. 24 Issue 2, p 272-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Supply problems quickly affected French stores, which lacked most items. The government responded by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting young people in urban areas. In shops, the queues lengthened. Some people—including German soldiers who could take advantage of arbitrary [[exchange rates]] that favored Germany—benefited from the [[black market]], where food was sold without coupons at very high prices. Farmers diverted meat to the black market, so there was much less for the open market. Counterfeit food coupons were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. Vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition were prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Mattapan. 2010. Vitamin D. Available from: {{cite web |url=http://www.mattapanchc.org/more_vitamin_d.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415074611/http://www.mattapanchc.org/more_vitamin_d.html |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advice about eating a healthier diet and home growing produce was distributed. Slogans like "Digging for Victory" and "Make Do and Mend" appeared on national posters and became a part of the war effort. The city environment made these efforts nearly negligible.&lt;ref&gt;British Library. 2005. 1900s food. Available from: http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/booksforcooks/1900s/1900sfood.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted survival. The official ration provided starvation-level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day (5400 kJ), supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.&lt;ref&gt;Mouré, "Food Rationing and the Black Market in France (1940–1944)" pp 262–282,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{see also|Dutch famine of 1944}}
The Dutch famine of 1944, known as the ''Hongerwinter'' ("Hunger winter") was a man-made famine imposed by Germany in the occupied western provinces during the winter of 1944–1945. A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm areas. A total of 4.5 million people were affected, of whom 18,000 died, despite an elaborate system of emergency soup kitchens.&lt;ref&gt;C. Banning, C. "Food Shortage and Public Health, First Half of 1945," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science Vol. 245, The Netherlands during German Occupation (May 1946), pp. 93–110 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1024809 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
{{main|Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Polish culture during World War II|Polish Underground State}}

====Food deprivation as a Nazi weapon====
The Nazi [[Hunger Plan]] was to kill the Jews of Poland quickly, and slowly to force the Poles to leave by threat of starvation, so that they could be replaced by German settlers. The Nazis coerced Poles to work in Germany by providing favorable food rations for families who had members working in the Reich. The ethnic German population in Poland (''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') were given good rations and were allowed to shop for food in special stores. The German occupiers created a draconian system of food controls, including severe penalties for the omnipresent black market. There was a sharp increase in mortality due to the general malnutrition, and a decline in birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;Lizzie Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2011) pp 180–218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rutherford, ''Prelude to the final solution''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lukas, ''The Other Holocaust''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gross]], ''Polish Society Under German Occupation''&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid 1941, the German minority in Poland received 2,613 calories (11,000 kJ) per day, while Poles received 699 and Jews in the ghetto 184.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-19-506285-4 | chapterurl = http://www.remember.org/courage/chapter6.html | chapter = Scenes of Hunger and Starvation | title = Courage Under Siege : Disease, Starvation and Death in the Warsaw Ghetto | location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1992 | first = Charles G | last = Roland | pages = 99–104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish ration fulfilled just 7.5% of their daily needs; Polish rations only 26%. Only the ration allocated to Germans provided the full required calorie intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.yadvashem.org.il/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206286.pdf | title = Odot | publisher = Yad Vashem | format = PDF | location = Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the [[Generalplan Ost]] of the Nazis, which envisioned the elimination of the Slavic population in the occupied territories and artificial famines-as proposed in the [[Hunger Plan]], were to be used.{{clarify|date=November 2016}}

====Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto: 1943====
On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, conquering it in three weeks, as the Soviets invaded the eastern areas. During the German occupation, there were two distinct civilian uprisings in Warsaw, one in 1943, the other in 1944. The first took place in a zone less than two square miles (5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in area, which the Germans had carved out of the city and called ''Ghetto Warschau''. The Germans built high walls around the ghetto, and crowded 550,000 Polish Jews into it, many from the Polish provinces. At first, people were allowed to enter and leave the ghetto, but soon its border became an "iron curtain".&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless on official business, Jews could not leave, and non-Jews, including Germans, could not enter. Entry points were guarded by German soldiers. Because of extreme conditions and hunger, mortality in the ghetto was high. In 1942, the Germans moved 400,000 ghetto residents to [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] where they were gassed on arrival. By April 19, 1943, when the Ghetto Uprising commenced, the population of the ghetto had dwindled to 60,000 individuals. In the following three weeks, virtually all died as the Germans fought and systematically destroyed the buildings in the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warsaw Uprising of 1944====
The uprising by Poles began on August 1, 1944, when the Polish underground, the "Home Army", aware that the Soviet Army had reached the eastern bank of the Vistula, sought to liberate Warsaw much as the French resistance had liberated Paris a few weeks earlier. [[Joseph Stalin]] had his own group of Communist leaders for the new Poland and did not want the Home Army or its leaders (based in London) to control Warsaw. So he halted the Soviet offensive and gave the Germans free rein to suppress it. During the ensuing 63 days, 250,000 Poles of the Home Army surrendered to the Germans. After the Germans forced all the surviving population to leave the city, Hitler ordered that any buildings left standing be dynamited – 98 percent of the buildings in Warsaw were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
During [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion of the Soviet Union]] in the early months of the war, rapid German advances almost captured the cities of [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]]. The bulk of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain crops left standing in the fields. This caused hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1,523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Ural (region)|Ural]], and [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;p.70, Bishop&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labor.

The whole of the Soviet Union become dedicated to the war effort. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food.&lt;ref&gt;John Barber and Mark Harrison, ''The Soviet Home Front, 1941–1945: a social and economic history of the USSR in World War II (1991)'' p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were nevertheless severe. World War II was especially devastating to citizens of the USSR because it was fought on Soviet territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over a million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and old people.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harrison, ''The Soviet Home Front, 1941–1945'' pp 81, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places{{clarify|date=November 2016}} during the war. Off-ration food was often so expensive that it could not add substantially to a citizen's food supply unless they were especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with any local resources they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold their surplus food at a high price; a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harrison, ''The Soviet Home Front, 1941–1945'' pp 81, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet [[nationalism]] and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied to protect their Motherland against the evils of the German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of a Communist Party propaganda campaign to mobilize religious people.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harrison, ''The Soviet Home Front, 1941–1945'' pp 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war, and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honors and money benefits if they had several children—mothers could earn around 1,300 rubles for having their fourth child and up to 5,000 rubles for their tenth.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harrison, ''The Soviet Home Front, 1941–1945'' pp 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Survival in Leningrad====
The city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during World War II. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege, which lasted from September 1941 until January 1944. Many people lost weight, and grew weaker and more vulnerable to disease. If malnutrition persisted for long enough, its effects were irreversible. People's feelings of loyalty disappeared if they got hungry enough; they would steal from their closest family members in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harrison, ''The Soviet Home Front, 1941–1945'' pp 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only some of the citizens of Leningrad survived. Only 400,000 were evacuated before the siege began; this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. Subsequently, more managed to escape; especially when the nearby [[Lake Ladoga]] froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or "road of life"—to safety.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bidlack, "Survival Strategies in Leningrad during the First Year of the Soviet-German War," in ''The People's War: Responses to World WarII in the Soviet Union,'' eds. Robert W. Thurston and Bernd Bonwetsch (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in influential political or social positions used their connections to other elites to leave Leningrad both before and after the siege began. Some factory owners even looted state funds to secure transport out of the city during the first summer of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bidlack, "Survival Strategies in Leningrad," p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The most risky means of escape, however, was to defect to the enemy and hope to avoid governmental punishment.

Most survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck: for instance by securing factory employment, because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the requirements for survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers received larger rations than other civilians, and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced vital goods. Factories also served as mutual support centers, and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horsemeat in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.&lt;ref&gt;Bidlack, "Survival Strategies in Leningrad,"  pp 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Survival opportunities open to the wider Soviet community included barter and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with civilians who had extra warm clothes to exchange. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens could keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.&lt;ref&gt;Bidlack, "Survival Strategies in Leningrad," p 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime to support themselves. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards; this could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes such as murder and [[cannibalism]] also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Bidlack, "Survival Strategies in Leningrad," p 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|United States home front during World War II|American propaganda during World War II}}
In the United States, farming and other production was increased. For example, citizens were encouraged to plant "victory gardens", personal farms that children sometimes worked on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II: Civic Responsibility|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/civic_responsibility/smithsonian_siyc_fall07.pdf|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Alecea Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the "home" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the "home front"; meanwhile the public sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of military action.&lt;ref&gt;Alecea Standlee, "Shifting Spheres: Gender, Labor and the Construction of National Identity in U.S. Propaganda during the Second World War," ''Minerva Journal of Women &amp; War'' Spring 2010, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 43–62&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Philippines====
{{main|History of the Philippines#World War II and Japanese occupation}}
The Philippines was an American possession on the way to independence (scheduled in 1946) and controlled its own internal affairs. The Japanese invaded and quickly conquered the islands in early 1942. The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the [[Philippine Executive Commission]]. They initially organized a [[Philippine Council of State|Council of State]], through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored [[Second Philippine Republic]] headed by President [[José P. Laurel]] proved to be ineffective and unpopular as Japan maintained very tight controls.&lt;ref&gt;"World War II" in Ronald E. Dolan, ed. ''Philippines: A Country Study'' (1991) [http://countrystudies.us/philippines/21.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The [[Philippine Army]], as well as remnants of the [[U.S. Army Forces Far East]] continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war. They formed an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the [[Hukbalahap]], which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Norling, ''The Intrepid Guerrillas of North Luzon'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies as well as the combined American and Filipino soldiers invaded in 1944–45; the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|battle for Manila]] was contested street by street with large numbers of civilians killed.

As in most occupied countries, crime, looting, corruption, and black markets were endemic.&lt;ref&gt;Dear and Foot, eds. ''Oxford Companion to World War II'' pp 877–79&lt;/ref&gt; With a view of building up the economic base of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], the Japanese Army envisioned using the islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they try to grow cotton in on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flock to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Francis K. Danquah, "Reports on Philippine Industrial Crops in World War II from Japan's English Language Press," ''Agricultural History'' (2005) 79#1 pp. 74–96 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3744878 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, derris for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and abaca (hemp) for rope. The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program was a failure that gave very little help to Japanese industry, and diverted resources needed for food production.&lt;ref&gt;Francis K. Danquah, "Reports on Philippine Industrial Crops in World War II from Japan's English Language Press," ''Agricultural History'' (2005) 79#1 pp. 74–96 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3744878 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; As Karnow reports, Filipinos "rapidly learned as well that 'co-prosperity' meant servitude to Japan's economic requirements." &lt;ref&gt;Stanley Karnow, ''In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines'' (1989) pp 308–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions were bad throughout the Philippines during the war. Transportation between the islands was difficult because of lack of fuel. Food was in very short supply, with sporadic famines and epidemic diseases&lt;ref&gt;Satoshi Ara, "Food supply problem in Leyte, Philippines, during the Japanese Occupation (1942–44)," ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'' (2008) 39#1 pp 59–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis K. Danquah, "Japan's Food Farming Policies in Wartime Southeast Asia: The Philippine Example, 1942–1944," ''Agricultural History'' (1990) 64#3 pp. 60–80 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3743634 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese tried to remove all Western and American cultural influences. They met fierce resistance when they tried to undermine the Catholic Church by arresting 500 Christian missionaries. The Filipinos came to feel morally superior to the brutal Japanese and rejected their advances.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo G. Parpan, "The Japanese and the Philippine Church, 1942–45," ''Philippine Studies'' (1989) 37#4 pp 451–466.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers and the media were tightly censored. The Japanese tried to reshape schools and impose the Japanese language. They formed neighborhood associations to inform on the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Victory Gosiengfiao, "The Japanese Occupation: 'The Cultural Campaign,'" ''Philippine Studies'' (1966) 14#2 pp 228–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and Commonwealth===

====Britain====
{{Main|United Kingdom home front during World War II|Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II}}

Britain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a "people's war" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Donnelly, ''Britain in the Second World War'' (1999) is a short survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angus Calder, ''The People's War: Britain, 1939–45'' (1969) is the standard scholarly history.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the military story see [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II]].

=====Munitions=====
In mid-1940, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was called on to fight the [[Battle of Britain]], but suffered serious losses. It lost 458 aircraft in France{{when|date=February 2018}}—more than current production— and was hard pressed. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimise output. They were: [[Vickers Wellington|Wellingtons]], [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley|Whitley Vs]], [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheims]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. These aircraft received extraordinary priority, which covered the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was no object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Postan (1952), Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1941, the US provided munitions through [[Lend-Lease]] that totalled $15.5 billion&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, ''British War Economy'' [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-Stats-3.html online p 353]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rationing=====
{{main|Rationing in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:War-time food and cookery demonstrations at Messrs D. R. Davies, Ironmongery Shop, Newtown (4365437196).jpg|thumb|Wartime food and cookery demonstrations, 1940.]]
[[File:WOOLMORE STREET BRITISH RESTAURANT 1942.jpg|right|thumb|A [[British Restaurant]] in London, 1942. 2000 were opened to serve low-cost basic meals.&lt;ref&gt;see "Sources for the History of London 1939–45: Rationing" [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/War/londonRation.html ''History in Focus: War'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Food, clothing, petrol, leather and other items were [[Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II|rationed]]. Perishable items such as fruit were not rationed. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew "[[victory garden]]s", and small home vegetable gardens. Many goods were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for [[nitroglycerin]] production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally sourced unrationed products than people in cities, and were more able to grow their own.

The rationing system, which was originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government's imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal "[[national loaf]]". Surveys of public opinion showed that most Britons were pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, ''The People's War: Britain, 1939–45'' (1969) pp 276–83&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Evacuation=====
From very early in the war, it was thought that the major industrial cities of Britain, especially London, would come under Luftwaffe air attack; this did happen in [[The Blitz]]. Some children were sent to Canada, the USA and Australia, and millions of children and some mothers were evacuated from London and other major cities to safer parts of the country when the war began, under government plans for the [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation of civilians]], but they often filtered back. When the Blitz bombing began on September 6, 1940, they evacuated again. The discovery of the poor health and hygiene of evacuees was a shock to many Britons, and helped prepare the way for the [[Beveridge Report]]. Children were evacuated if their parents agreed; but in some cases they had no choice. The children were only allowed to take a few things with them, including a gas mask, books, money, clothes, ration book and some small toys.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History 1914–1945'' (1965) p 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calder, ''The People's War'' (1969) pp 35–50&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Welfare state=====
{{main|Beveridge Report}}
An [[Emergency Hospital Service]] was established at the beginning of the war, in the expectation that it would be required to deal with large numbers of casualties.

A common theme called for an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Leventhal, ''Twentieth-Century Britain: an Encyclopedia'' (1995) pp 74–75, 830&lt;/ref&gt; This was set out in a famous report by [[William Beveridge]]. It recommended that the various forms of assistance that had grown up piecemeal since 1911 be rationalised. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major political parties endorsed the principles, and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel‐Smith, "The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes." ''International Social Security Review'' (1992) 45#1‐2 pp 5–16. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-246X.1992.tb00900.x/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+Saturday%2C+15+March+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2806%3A00-08%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Memory=====
The themes of equality and sacrifice were dominant during the war, and in the memory of the war. Historian Jose Harris points out that the war was seen at the time and by a generation of writers as a period of outstanding national unity and social solidarity. There was little antiwar sentiment during or after the war. Furthermore, Britain turned more toward the collective welfare state during the war, expanding it in the late 1940s and reaching a broad consensus supporting it across party lines. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, historians were exploring the subtle elements of continuing diversity and conflict in society during the war period.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "War and social history: Britain and the home front during the Second World War," ''[[Contemporary European History]]'' (1992) 1#1 pp 17–35.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at first historians emphasized that strikes became illegal in July 1940, and no trade union called one during the war. Later historians pointed to the many localised unofficial strikes, especially in coal mining, shipbuilding, the metal trades and engineering, with as many as 3.7 million man days lost in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Addison . "The Impact of the Second World War," in Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. '' A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939–2000'' (2005) pp 3–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] collected 47,000 wartime recollections and 15,000 images in 2003-6 and put them online.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/ BBC, "WW2 People's War" (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; The CD audiobook ''Home Front 1939–45'' also contains a selection of period interviews and actuality recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ltmrecordings.com/homefront1notes.html | title=Automatic Redirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{main|Canada in the World Wars and Interwar Years#World War II}}
[[File:Children collecting rubber.jpg|thumb|upright|Two boys in [[Montreal]] gather rubber for wartime salvage, 1942.]]
Canada joined the war effort on September 10, 1939; the government deliberately waited after Britain's decision to go to war, partly to demonstrate its independence from Britain and partly to give the country extra time to import arms from the United States as a non-belligerent.&lt;ref&gt;Until November 1939, the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] prohibited the export of arms from the United States to belligerents.&lt;/ref&gt; War production was ramped up quickly, and was centrally managed through the [[Department of Munitions and Supply]]. Unemployment faded away.

Canada became one of the largest trainers of pilots for the Allies through the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]]. Many Canadian men joined the war effort, so with them overseas and industries pushing to increase production, women took up positions to aid in the war effort. The hiring of men in many positions in civilian employment was effectively banned later in the war through measures taken under the ''[[National Resources Mobilization Act]]''..

Shipyards and repair facilities expanded dramatically as over a thousand warships and cargo vessels were built, along with thousands of auxiliary craft, small boats and others.&lt;ref&gt;James Pritchard, ''A Bridge of Ships: Canadian Shipbuilding during the Second World War'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada expanded food production, but shipped so much to Britain that food rationing had to be imposed. In 1942 it shipped to Britain 25 per cent of total meat production (including 75% of the bacon), 65% of the cheese and 13% of the eggs.&lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives'' Volume IV-V, November, 1943 p. 6099&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ethnic minorities from enemy countries=====
20% of Canada's population were neither of British nor French origin, and their status was of special concern. The main goal was to integrate the marginalized European ethnicities—in contrast to the First World War policy of internment camps for Ukrainians and Germans. In the case of Germany, Italy and especially Japan, the government watched minorities closely for signs of loyalty to their homelands. The fears proved groundless.&lt;ref&gt;Ivana Caccia, ''Managing the Canadian Mosaic in Wartime: Shaping Citizenship Policy, 1939–1945'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1942 [[Japanese Canadian internment|21,000 Japanese Canadians were rounded up]] and sent to internment camps that closely resembled [[Japanese American internment|similar camps in the US]], because the two governments had agreed in 1941 to coordinate their evacuation policies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Daniels, "The Decisions to Relocate the North American Japanese: Another Look," ''Pacific Historical Review,'' February 1982, Vol. 51 Issue 1, pp 71–77&lt;/ref&gt; Most had lived in British Columbia, but in 1945 they were released from detention and allowed to move anywhere in Canada ''except'' British Columbia, or they could go to Japan. Most went to the Toronto area.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Adachi, ''The Enemy that Never Was: A History of the Japanese Canadians'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia E. Roy, ''The Triumph of Citizenship: The Japanese and Chinese in Canada 1941–1967'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Women=====
[[File:Shop Stewards at Burrard Drydock.jpg|thumb|Shop stewards in the canteen of the [[Burrard Dry Dock]] in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Commencing in 1942, Burrard Dry Dock hired over 1000 women, all of whom were dismissed at the end of the war to make way for returning men.]]
Canadian women responded to urgent appeals to make do, recycle and salvage in order to come up with needed supplies. They saved fats and grease; gathered recycled goods; handed out information on the best ways to get the most out of recycled goods; and organized many other events to decrease the amount of waste. Volunteer organizations led by women also prepared packages for the military overseas and for prisoners of war in Axis countries.

With World War II came a dire need for employees in the workplace. Without women to step in, the economy would have collapsed. By autumn 1944 there were twice as many women working full-time in Canada's paid labour force as in 1939: between 1.0 and 1.2 million; and this did not include part-time workers or women working on farms."&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Roach Pierson, ''"They're Still Women After All," The Second World War and Canadian Womanhood'' (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1986) p 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Women had to take on this intensive labour and still find time to make jam, clothes, and undertake other acts of volunteering to aid the men overseas.

====Australia====
{{main|Australian home front during World War II}}
The government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Australian and American armed forces. There were a few Japanese attacks, most notably on Darwin in February 1942, along with the widespread fear in 1942, that Australia would be invaded.

[[File:Victory job (AWM ARTV00332).jpg|thumb|Australian women were encouraged to contribute to the war effort by joining one of the female branches of the armed forces or participating in the labour force.]]

Australia entered the war in 1939 and sent its forces to fight the Germans in the Middle East (where they were successful) and Singapore (where they were captured by the Japanese in 1942). By 1943, 37% of the Australian GDP was directed at the war effort. Total war expenditure came to £2,949&amp;nbsp;million between 1939 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Long, ''The Six Years War'' (1973) p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Curtin|Curtin Labor Government]] took over in October 1941, and energised the war effort, with rationing of scarce fuel, clothing and some food. When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the danger was at hand, and all women and children were evacuated from Darwin and northern Australia. The Commonwealth Government took control of all income taxation in 1942, which gave it extensive new powers and greatly reduced the states' financial autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Crowley, ed. ''A New History Of Australia'' (1977) pp 459–503&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturing grew rapidly, with the assembly of high performance guns and aircraft a specialty. The number of women working in factories rose from 171,000 to 286,000.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bolton, ''The Oxford History of Australia: Volume 5: 1942–1995. The Middle Way''  (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of tens of thousands of Americans was greeted with relief, as they could protect Australia where Britain could not. The US sent in $1.1 billion in [[Lend Lease]], and Australia returned about the same total in services, food, rents and supplies to the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Daniel Potts and A. Potts, ''Yanks Down Under, 1941–1945: The American Impact on Australia'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
New Zealand, with a population of 1.7 million, including 99,000 Maori, was highly mobilised during the war. The Labour party was in power and promoted unionisation and the welfare state. The armed forces peaked at 157,000 in September 1942; 135,000 served abroad, and 10,100 died. Agriculture expanded, sending record supplies of meat, butter and wool to Britain. When American forces arrived, they were fed as well. The nation spent £574 million on the war, of which 43% came from taxes, 41% from loans and  16% from American [[Lend Lease]]. It was an era of prosperity as the national income soared from £158 million in 1937 to £292 million in 1944. Rationing and price controls kept inflation to only 14% during 1939–45.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Yust, ''Ten Eventful Years: 1937–1946'' (1947) 3: 347–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. V. T. Baker [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Econ.html  ''War Economy'' (1965)], the official history; and Nancy M. Taylor, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c1.html ''The Home Front'' Volume I ] NZ official history (1986); [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Hom.html Volume II ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women, especially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional female jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and reversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and many women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change in gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Montgomerie, "The Limitations of Wartime Change: Women War Workers in New Zealand," ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1989) 23#1 pp 68–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the home front see Gwen Parsons, "The New Zealand Home Front during World War One and World War Two," History Compass (2013) 11#6 pp 419–428, online&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{main|India in World War II}}
During World War II, India was a colony of Britain known as [[British Raj]]. Britain declared war on behalf of India without consulting with Indian leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/second-world-war-1939-1945 « Making Britain: Second World War (1939–1945) »], ''The Open University''.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in resignation of Congress Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Sen, ''History: Modern India'' (2006) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ga-pmgxsWwoC&amp;pg=PA202 online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The British recruited some 2.5 million Indian volunteers, who played major roles as soldiers in the Middle East, North Africa and Burma in the [[British Indian Army]]. India became the main base for British operations against Japan, and for American efforts to support China.

In Bengal, with an elected Muslim local government under British supervision, the cutoff of rice imports from Burma led to severe food shortages, made worse by maladministration. Prices soared and millions starved because they could not buy food. In the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], three million people died.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Greenough, ''Prosperity and Misery in Modern Bengal: The Famine of 1943–1944'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

A small anti-British force of about 40,000 men (and a few women) formed in Southeast Asia, the [[Indian National Army]] (INA) under Subhas Chandra Bose. It was under Japanese army control and performed poorly in combat. Its members were captured Indian soldiers from British Indian Army who gained release from extreme conditions in POW camps by joining the Japanese-sponsored INA. It participated in Battle Of Kohima and Battle of Imphal. In postwar Indian politics, some Indians called them heroes.

The Congress Party in 1942 demanded immediate independence, which Britain rejected. Congress then demanded the British immediately "[[Quit India]]" in August 1942, but the Raj responded by immediately jailing tens of thousands of national, state and regional leaders; knocking Congress out of the war. Meanwhile, the Muslim League supported the war effort and gained prestige and membership, as well as British support for its demands for a separate Muslim state (which became Pakistan in 1947).

====Hong Kong====
[[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong was a British colony]] captured by Japan on December 25, 1941, after 18 days of fierce fighting. The conquest was swift, but was followed by days of large-scale looting; over ten thousand Chinese women were raped or gang-raped by the Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Snow|title=The Fall Of Hong Kong: Britain, China and the Japanese Occupation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Um5eZLwurzoC|year=2004|publisher=Yale U.P.|page=81 |isbn=978-0300103731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population halved, from 1.6 million in 1941 to 750,000 at war's end because of fleeing refugees; they returned in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Fang Tsai, "Wartime Experience, Collective Memories and Hong Kong Identity, ''China Review International'' (2005) 12#1 pp 229+ [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5012416388 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese imprisoned the ruling British colonial elite and sought to win over the local merchant gentry by appointments to advisory councils and neighbourhood watch groups. The policy worked well for Japan and produced extensive collaboration from both the elite and the middle class, with far less terror than in other Chinese cities. Hong Kong was transformed into a Japanese colony, with Japanese businesses replacing the British. The Japanese Empire had severe logistical difficulties and by 1943 the food supply for Hong Kong was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wei-Bin Zhang|title=Hong Kong: The Pearl Made of British Mastery And Chinese Docile-Diligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hwPUGWBTsX4C&amp;pg=PA109|year=2006|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=109|isbn=9781594546006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overlords became more brutal and corrupt, and the Chinese gentry became disenchanted. With the surrender of Japan the transition back to British rule was smooth, for on the mainland the Nationalist and Communists forces were preparing for a civil war and ignored Hong Kong. In the long run the occupation strengthened the pre-war social and economic order among the Chinese business community by eliminating some conflicts of interests and reducing the prestige and power of the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wei-Bin Zhang|title=Hong Kong: The Pearl Made of British Mastery And Chinese Docile-Diligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hwPUGWBTsX4C&amp;pg=PA109|year=2006|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=109|isbn=9781594546006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axis==
&lt;!--sorted by date of entry into World War II--&gt;

===Germany===
Germany had not fully mobilized in 1939, nor even in 1941. Not until 1943, under [[Albert Speer]] (the minister of armaments in the ''Reich''), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production. Instead of using all available Germans, it [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|brought in millions of slave workers from conquered countries]], treating them badly (and getting low productivity in return).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's economy was simply too small for a longer all-out war. Hitler's strategy was to change this by a series of surprise [[blitzkrieg]]s. This failed with defeats in Russia in 1941 and 1942, and against the economic power of the allies.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tooze, ''Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy'' (2006) pp. 429seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced labour====
{{main|Forced labour under German rule during World War II}}
Instead of expanding the economies of the occupied nations, the Nazis seized the portable machinery and rail cars, requisitioned most of their industrial output, took large quantities of food (15% of French output), and forced the victims to pay for their military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Homze, ''Foreign Labor in Nazi Germany'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis forced 15 million people to work in Germany (including POWs); many died from bad living conditions, mistreatment, malnutrition, and executions. At its peak, forced laborers comprised 20% of the German work force and were a vital part of the [[Economics of fascism#Political economy of Nazi Germany|German economic exploitation]] of the conquered territories. They were especially concentrated in munitions and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Panikos Panayi, "Exploitation, Criminality, Resistance. The Everyday Life of Foreign Workers and Prisoners of War in the German Town of Osnabrück, 1939–49," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' Vol. 40, No. 3 (Jul., 2005), pp. 483–502 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30036339 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 1.5 million French soldiers were kept in POW camps in Germany as hostages and forced workers and, in 1943, 600,000 French civilians were forced to move to Germany to work in war plants.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Herbert, "Forced Laborers in the 'Third Reich'", ''International Labor and Working-Class History'' (1997) {{cite web|url=http://projekte.geschichte.uni-freiburg.de/herbert/uhpub/forcedlaborers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415124110/http://projekte.geschichte.uni-freiburg.de/herbert/uhpub/forcedlaborers.html |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
Although Germany had about double the population of Britain (80 million versus 46 million), it had to use far more labor to provide food and energy. Britain imported food and employed only a million people (5% of the labour force) on farms, while Germany used 11 million (27%). For Germany to build its twelve synthetic oil plants with a capacity of 3.3 million tons a year required 2.4 million tons of structural steel and 7.5 million man-days of labor. (Britain imported all its oil from Iraq, Persia and North America). To overcome this problem, Germany employed millions of forced laborers and POWs; by 1944, they had brought in more than five million civilian workers and nearly two million prisoners of war—a total of 7.13 million foreign workers.

====Rationing====
Rationing in Germany was introduced in 1939 immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities. [[Hitler]] was at first convinced that it would affect public support for the war if a strict rationing program was introduced. The [[Nazi]]s were popular partly because Germany was relatively prosperous, and Hitler did not want to lose popularity or public support. Hitler felt that food and other shortages had been a major factor in destroying civilian morale during World War I, leading to defeatism and surrender.

Despite the rationing, civilians had enough food and clothing; witness [[Howard K. Smith]] later wrote that "[f]or a people engaged in a life-and-death war ... the German people for two years of war ate amazingly well." The meat ration, for example, was 500 g per week per person. After the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, however, this changed to 400 g per week, then fell further. Estimating that the meat ration had dropped by up to 80% in five months of fighting in Russia, and citing many other sudden changes in living conditions, Smith wrote that by the time he left Germany in late 1941, "for the first time ... ''the German people are undernourished''".&lt;ref name="smith1942"&gt;{{cite book | title=Last Train from Berlin | publisher=Knopf | author=Smith, Howard K. | authorlink=Howard K. Smith | year=1942 | pages=115–116, 120–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system gave extra rations for men involved in heavy industry, and extremely low starvation rations for Jews and Poles in the areas occupied by Germany, but not to the Poles inside Germany, many of whom had been brought in to perform heavy labor in German war industries.

According to a 1997 post by Walter Felscher to the "Memories of the 1940s" [[electronic mailing list]]:

{{quote|For every person, there were rationing cards for general foodstuffs, meats, fats (such as butter, margarine and oil) and tobacco products distributed every other month. The cards were printed on strong paper, containing numerous small "Marken" subdivisions printed with their value – for example, from "5 g Butter" to "100 g Butter". Every acquisition of rationed goods required an appropriate "Marken", and if a person wished to eat a certain soup at a restaurant, the waiter would take out a pair of scissors and cut off the required items to make the soup and amounts listed on the menu. In the evenings, restaurant-owners would spend an hour at least gluing the collected "Marken" onto large sheets of paper which they then had to hand in to the appropriate authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recycling and rationing in wartime Germany. |first=Walter |last=Felscher |publisher=[http://www.youth.net/memories/welcome.html Memories of the 1940's mailing list archive] |url=http://www.youth.net/memories/hypermail/0313.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970527112809/http://www.youth.net/memories/hypermail/0313.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-05-27 |date=1997-01-27 |accessdate=2006-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rations were enough to live from, but clearly did not permit luxuries. Whipped cream was unknown from 1939 until 1948, as well as chocolates, cakes with rich creams etc. Meat could not be eaten every day. Other items were not rationed, but simply became unavailable as they had to be imported from overseas: coffee in particular, which throughout was replaced by substitutes made from roasted grains. Vegetables and local fruit were not rationed; imported citrus fruits and bananas were unavailable. In more rural areas, farmers continued to bring their products to the markets, as large cities depended on long distance delivery. Many people kept rabbits for their meat when it became scarce in shops, and it was often a child's job to care for them each day.

By spring 1945, food distribution and the ration system were increasingly in collapse, due to insurmountable transportation disruption and the rapid advance of the Allied armies from west and east with consequent loss of food storage facilities. In Berlin, at the start of the [[Battle of Berlin]], the authorities announced a special supplementary food ration on April 20, 1945. It consisted of a pound (450 g) of bacon or sausage, half a pound of rice, half a pound of peas or pulses, a pound of sugar, four ounces (110 g) of coffee substitute, one ounce of real coffee, and a tin of vegetables or fruit. They also announced that standard food ration allocations for the next fortnight could be claimed in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Read, Fisher|first1=Anthony, David|title=The Fall Of Berlin|date=1992|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|isbn=978-0-7126-5797-6|page=346|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra allocation of rations were dubbed by Berliners ''Himmelfahrtsrationen'', Ascension-day rations, "because with these rations we shall now ascend to heaven"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Cornelius|title=The Last Battle|date=2015|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stouton|location=London|isbn=978-1-473-62007-0|edition=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nursing====
Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown nurses, which absorbed one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens in competition with the other nursing organizations, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killing of invalids, although this was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Rebekah McFarland-Icke, ''Nurses in Nazi Germany'' (Princeton University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male doctors and medics. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Williamson, ''World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services'' (2003) pp 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Displaced persons====
The conquest of Germany in 1945 freed 11 million foreigners, called "displaced persons" (DPs)- chiefly forced laborers and POWs. In addition to the POWs, the Germans seized 2.8 million Soviet workers to labor in factories in Germany. Returning them home was a high priority for the Allies. However, in the case of Russians and Ukrainians returning often meant suspicion or prison or even death. The UNRRA, Red Cross and military operations provided food, clothing, shelter and assistance in returning home. In all, 5.2 million were repatriated to the Soviet Union, 1.6 million to Poland, 1.5 million to France, and 900,000 to Italy, along with 300,000 to 400,000 each to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;William I. Hitchcock, ''The Bitter Road to Freedom: The Human Cost of Allied Victory in World War II Europe'' (2008), pp 250–56&lt;/ref&gt;

====Refugees====
In 1944–45, over 2.5 million ethnic Germans fled from Eastern Europe in family groups, desperately hoping to reach Germany before being overtaken by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Marrus, ''The Unwanted: European Refugees in the 20th Century'' (1985) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bessel]], ''Germany: 1945'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Half a million died in the process, the survivors were herded into refugee camps in East and West Germany for years. Meanwhile, Moscow encouraged its troops to regard German women as targets for revenge. Russian Marshal [[Georgi Zhukov]] called on his troops to, "Remember our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our wives and children tortured to death by Germans....We shall exact a brutal revenge for everything." Upwards of two million women inside Germany were raped in 1945 in a tidal wave of looting, burning and vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock, ''The Bitter Road to Freedom:'' (2008) pp 160–61; [https://books.google.com/books?id=1QSWIsVPHEoC&amp;pg=PA161 quote p. 161 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{main|Shōwa period#Second World War}}
The Japanese home front was elaborately organized, block by block, with full-scale food rationing and many controls over labor. The government used propaganda heavily and planned in minute detail regarding the mobilization of manpower, identification of critical choke points, food supplies, logistics, air raid shelters, and the evacuation of children and civilians from targeted cities. Food supplies were very tight before the heavy bombing began in fall 1944, then grew to a crisis. There was only a small increase of 1.4 million women entering the labor force between 1940 and 1944. The minister of welfare announced, "In order to secure its labor force, the enemy is drafting women, but in Japan, out of consideration for the family system, we will not draft them."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. H. Havens, ''Valley of Darkness: The Japanese People and World War Two'' (1978) p 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Evacuation of Schoolchildren in Japan.JPG|thumb|300px|Japanese schoolchildren evacuating to rural areas in 1944]] The weaknesses in the maximum utilization of womanpower was indicated by the presence of 600,000 domestic servants in wealthy families in 1944. The government wanted to raise the birthrate, even with 8.2 million men in the armed forces, of whom three million were killed. Government incentives helped to raise the marriage rate, but the number of births held steady at about 2.2 million per year, with a 10% decline in 1944–45, and another 15% decline in 1945–46. Strict rationing of milk led to smaller babies. There was little or no long-term impact on the overall demographic profile of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Havens (1978), pp 135–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The government began [[Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II|making evacuation plans in late 1943]], and started removing entire schools from industrial cities to the countryside, where they were safe from bombing and had better access to food supplies. In all 1.3 million children were moved—with their teachers but not their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Hideo Yamashita, ''Daily Life in Wartime Japan, 1940-1945'' (2015) p 124&lt;/ref&gt; When the American bombing began in earnest in late 1944, 10 million people fled the cities to the safety of the countryside, including two-thirds of the residents of the largest cities and 87% of the children. Left behind were the munitions workers and government officials. By April 1945, 87% of the younger children had been moved to the countryside.

Civil defense units were transformed into combat units, especially the Peoples Volunteer Combat Corps, enlisting civilian men up to the age of 60 and women to age 40.  Starting in January 1945 the government operated an intensive training program to enable the entire civilian population to fight the "decisive battle" with the American invaders using grenades, explosive gliders and bamboo spears. Everyone understood they would probably die in what the government called, the "Grand Suicide of the One Hundred Million."&lt;ref&gt;Yamashita, ''Daily Life in Wartime Japan, 1940-1945'' (2015) p 172&lt;/ref&gt;
Health conditions became much worse after the surrender in September 1945, with so much housing stock destroyed, and an additional 6.6 million Japanese repatriated from Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Havens (1978), pp 145, 154 161–3, 167&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food====
Agricultural production in the home islands held up well during the war until the bombing started. It fell from an index of 110 in 1942 to 84 in 1944 and only 65 in 1945. Worse, imports dried up.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Takafusa, et al. eds. ''Economic History of Japan 1914–1955: A Dual Structure'' (vol 3 2003), 326 – 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese food rationing system was effective throughout the war, and there were no serious incidences of malnutrition. A government survey in Tokyo showed that in 1944 families depended on the black market for 9% of their rice, 38% of their fish, and 69% of their vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;Havens, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese domestic food supply depended upon imports, which were largely cut off by the American submarine and bombing campaigns. Likewise there was little deep sea fishing, so that the fish ration by 1941 was mostly squid harvested from coastal waters. The result was a growing food shortage, especially in the cities. There was some malnutrition but no reported starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Collingham. ''The Taste of War'' (2011) pp 228–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite government rationing of food, some families were forced to spend more than their monthly income could offer on black market food purchases. They would rely on savings or exchange food for clothes or other possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://libarchive.dartmouth.edu/cdm/ref/collection/presstrans/id/10422|title = "Food Situation," November 2, 1945, Asahi, In Press Translations Japan, Social series, No. 1, Item 3, Pages 2-3, ATIS, G2, SCAP, November 5, 1945.|date = 2 Nov 1945|accessdate = 26 Oct 2015|website = |publisher = Dartmouth Digital Library|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deaths====
The American aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities took from 400,000 to 600,000 civilian lives, with 100,000+ in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The [[Battle of Okinawa]] resulted in 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths. In addition civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000. The total of Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war and were caused by starvation or severe malnutrition in garrisons cut off from supplies.&lt;ref&gt;John Dower, "Lessons from Iwo Jima," ''Perspectives'' (September 2007) 45#6 pp 54–56 at [http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2007/0709/index.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Condition at war's end====
Health and living conditions worsened after the surrender in September 1945. Most of the housing stock in large cities was destroyed, just as refugees tried to return from the rural areas. Adding to the crisis there was an influx of 3.5 million returning soldiers and 3.1 million Japanese civilians forcibly repatriated from Imperial outposts in Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines; about 400,000 civilians were left behind and not heard of again. Meanwhile, 1.2 million Koreans, POWs and other non-Japanese left Japan. The government implemented pro-natalist policies, which led to an increase in the marriage rate, but birth rates remained steady until they declined by 10% in the stress of the last year of the war, and another 15% during the hardship of the postwar period.&lt;ref&gt;Havens (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The American bombing campaign of all major cities severely impacted the economy, as did the shortages of oil and raw materials that intensified when Japanese merchant shipping was mostly sunk by American submarines. When industrial production was available to the military, for example, 24 percent of Japan's finished steel in 1937 was allocated to the military, compared to 85 percent in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Takafusa, et al. eds. ''Economic History of Japan 1914–1955: A Dual Structure'' (vol 3 2003), p 291&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, output percent of the highest capacity was still 100 percent for steel, although only 75 percent for aluminum, 63 percent for machine tools, 42 percent for vacuum tubes, 54 percent cement, 32 percent cotton fabric, and 36 percent for wool.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famines==
Severe food shortages were common throughout the war zones, especially in Europe where Germany used starvation as a military weapon. Japan did not use it as a deliberate policy, but the breakdown of its transportation and distribution systems led to famine and starvation conditions among its soldiers on many Pacific islands.&lt;ref&gt;Collinham (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Bose (1990) studies the three great Asian famines that took place during the war: Bengal in India, Honan in China, and Tonkin in Vietnam. In each famine at least two million people died. They all occurred in densely populated provinces where the subsistence foundations of agriculture was failing under the weight of demographic and market pressures. In each cases famine played a role in undermining the legitimacy of the state and the preexisting social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sugata Bose, "Starvation amidst Plenty: The Making of Famine in Bengal, Honan and Tonkin, 1942–45," ''Modern Asian Studies, July 1990, Vol. 24 Issue 4, pp 699–727 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/312730 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==
A great deal of housing was destroyed or largely damaged during the war, especially in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;One third of the Soviet housing stock was damaged or destroyed according to {{cite book|author=Jane R. Zavisca|title=Housing the New Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8bFNIUdt3IC&amp;pg=PA29|year=2012|publisher=Cornell UP|page=29|isbn=978-0801464775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, and Japan. In Japan, about a third of the families were homeless at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, "The Second World War as an Economic Disaster", in: {{cite book|author=Michael J.

'''Iquito''' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|iˈkitu|}}) is a highly endangered [[Zaparoan languages|Zaparoan]] language of [[Peru]]. Iquito is one of three surviving Zaparoan languages; the other two being [[Záparo language|Záparo]], with 1-3 speakers, and [[Arabela language|Arabela]] with about 75 speakers. Three extinct languages are also considered to be Zaparoan: [[Andoa language|Andoa]], [[Aushiri]], and [[Cahuarano]]. Some classifiers also consider [[Omurano language|Omurano]] to be Zaparoan.  Other names used for the language include '''Iquita''', '''Ikito''', '''Amacacore''', '''Hamacore''', '''Quiturran''', and '''Puca-Uma''', although Iquito is the most common.

Of the ethnic Iquito population of 500, as of 2006, there are 25 fluent or native speakers, all of whom are over 55 years old, and about 25 partial or [[Passive speakers (language)|passive speakers]], all of whom are over the age of 25. Iquito is spoken in the [[Loreto Province]], the regions of the [[Pintoyacu River|Pintoyacu]], [[Nanay River|Nanay]], and [[Chambira River|Chambira]] rivers, and the villages of San Antonio and Atalaya. 

It is technically an [[official language]] of [[Languages of Peru|Peru]]. There is a negative attitude towards the language in the Iquito communities and Iquitos mostly use [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. This is partially due to decades of pressure to assimilate into Spanish-speaking culture. The population is Christian; the Bible was translated into Iquito in 1963. The Iquito people cultivate yuca, are fishermen and hunters, rubber gatherers, and traders.

==History==
This area of present-day northeastern Peru was settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. In the mid 17th century, there was a large group of Iquito speakers where the present-day city of Iquitos developed.  

But, by the period of 1958 to 1966, only about 100 native speakers of Iquito remained, and they were on the verge of [[acculturation]] to [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. During this period, the population of older adults spoke Iquito and understood Spanish, middle-aged adults were bilingual in Spanish and Iquito, and children spoke Spanish as their first language and understood Iquito.

==Reasons for decline==
Several factors have affected the decline in speaking Iquito; there are 25 speakers now. The infectious diseases of [[whooping cough]], [[measles]], and [[pneumonia]] had devastating effects on the speaking population, with a high number of fatalities. Also, the [[patron system|landowner system]] in place at the time, and the disruptions associated with the [[rubber boom]] and exploitation of rubber reduced the population.

==Revitalization==
The [[University of Texas]] sponsored a program run by graduate students to help the population of San Antonio revitalize the Iquito language. They are working on a 1500-word dictionary and teaching plans in order to teach the younger population Iquito.

==Iquito Language Documentation Project==
The Iquito Language Documentation Project (IDLP) is a community language revitalization effort to help revitalize the Iquito language.

'''Kulina''' (also '''Kulína''', '''Kulyna''', '''Culina''', '''Curina''', '''Corina''', '''Korina''', '''Culina-Madijá''', '''Madijá''', '''Madija''', '''Madiha''', '''Madihá''') is an [[Arauan languages|Arawan language]] of [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] spoken by about 4,000 [[Kulina people]]. Kulina is similar to the [[Deni language|Deni]] language, as they have even been considered different dialects of the same language. Both languages have [[Subject–object–verb|SOV word order]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/culina.htm|title=Culina Language and the Culina Indian Tribe (Kulina Madihá, Kulína, Kulyna, Kurina, Corina, Madija, Kollina, Kulino)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.native-languages.org|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as three sets of alveolar [[affricate consonant]]s. It is believed the presence of the reconstructed phoneme '''''*s''''' in place of the fricative '''*s&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;''' is indicative of the Kulina and Deni languages as opposed to other languages in the Arawan family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dienst|first=Stefan|date=|title=The Innovation of s in Kulina and Deni|url=|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=47|pages=424–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Geography ==
The Kulina people traditionally live in the states of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] and [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] in Brazil and the [[Ucayali Region|Ucayali]] region in Peru.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898770080|title=A Grammar of Kulina|last=Stefan.|first=Dienst,|date=2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=9783110339680|location=Berlin/Boston|oclc=898770080}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Acre and Ucayali, the villages are found along the Purus and Envira rivers. In Amazonas, the villages are around the Juruá, Tarauacá and Jutaí rivers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Classification ==
Kulina is a member of the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] language family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Dienst (2014), it forms a Madihá [[dialect continuum]] with Western Jamamadi and Deni.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term ''madihá'' means 'people' in all of these languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
The basic constituent order is [[subject–object–verb]]. It is predominantly a [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] language with [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] morphology and some fusion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are two [[noun class]]es and two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] on transitive verbs is determined by a number of complex factors, both syntactic and pragmatic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Land consumption''' as part of human [[resource consumption]] is the [[land development|conversion of land]] with [[soil health|healthy soil]] and intact [[habitat|habitats]] into areas for [[intensive farming|industrial agriculture]], traffic ([[road|road building]]) and especially [[urbanization|urban]] [[human settlement|human settlements]]. More formally, the [[European Environment Agency|EEA]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Environment Agency]] EEA|year=1997|title=The concept of environmental space|url=http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/terminology/concept_html?term=land%20consumption}}&lt;/ref&gt; has identifid 3 [[land]] consuming activities:
#The expansion of [[built-up area]] which can be directly measured;
#the absolute extent of land that is subject to exploitation by [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] or other economic activities; and
#the [[overexploitation|over-intensive exploitation]] of land that is used for agriculture and forestry.
In all of those respects, land consumption is equivalent to typical [[land use]] in [[industrialized]] regions and civilizations.

[[File:Popiełuszki Olsztyn 2007.JPG|thumb|Road construction in [[Olsztyn]], Poland]]
Since often aforementioned conversion activities are virtually [[irreversible process|irreversible]], the term '''land loss''' is also used. From 1990 to 2000, [[orders of magnitude (area)#108_to_1014_square_metres|{{convert|1.4|e6ha}}]] of open space were consumed in the U.S..&lt;ref name=mcdonald&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS One|volume=5|issue=3: e9509.

This makes Europe the continent that is most dependent on land beyond its borders to sustain its [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], its [[agricultural industry]] and its [[energy demand|hunger for energy]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European Union, land take is estimated approximately about to 1.2 million hectares in 21 EU countries over the period 1990-2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardi|first=Ciro|last2=Panagos|first2=Panos|last3=Liedekerke|first3=Marc Van|last4=Bosco|first4=Claudio|last5=Brogniez|first5=Delphine De|date=2015-05-04|title=Land take and food security: assessment of land take on the agricultural production in Europe|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2014.899490|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|volume=58|issue=5|pages=898–912|doi=10.1080/09640568.2014.899490|issn=0964-0568}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

{{quote|[[Urban growth]] reduces [[Public space|open space]] in and around [[cities]], impacting [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem services]]|McDonald et al.&lt;ref name=mcdonald/&gt;}}

Land loss can also happen due to natural factors, like [[erosion]] or [[desertification]] - nevertheless most of those can also eventually be tracked back to [[human impact on the environment|human activities]]. Another slightly different interpretation of the term is the forced displacement or [[compulsory acquisition]] of a native people or settlers from their original land due to [[land grabbing]], etc.. Again, in most cases, this will be due to economic reasons like search for [[profitable]] [[investment]] and [[commodification of nature|commodification of natural resources]].

Even though global land loss progresses at an alarming rate, the [[land footprint]], the area required by some Western countries can a lot larger than the land actually used or even available in the country itself.&lt;ref name=soilatlas2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Friends of the Earth|FOE]] Europe|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/resource_use/2016/foee-true-cost-consumption-land-footprint.pdf|title=The true cost of consumption - The EU's land footprint|year=2016|quote=The European Union uses more than its fair share of global land. In 2010, the amount of land used to satisfy our [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], solely of agricultural goods and services, amounted to 269 million hectares – that’s 43% more agricultural land than is available within the EU itself and an area almost the size of France and Italy used outside of our borders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[land price]]s have surged in the first few years of the 21st century, land consumption economy still lacks [[environmental full-cost accounting]] to add the long-term costs of [[environmental degradation]].

==Consequences of land consumption==
The major effects of land conversion for [[economic growth]] are:
*[[Land degradation]]
*[[Habitat loss]] - built-up areas support only particularly adapted species
*[[Soil degradation]] - loss or [[soil contamination|contamination]] of [[top soil]] by civilization [[waste]] and general [[pollution]]
*[[Soil compaction]] - buildings, heavy machinery and vehicle traffic compact the soil to a degree that [[Macrobiology|macrobiotic]] [[soil life]] is eradicated
*[[Impervious surface]]s - [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] seal of the soil from the atmosphere and disrupt natural [[water cycle|water]] and [[biogeochemical cycle]]s

'''Kalal Laxma Goud''' (born 21 August 1940) is an Indian painter, [[printmaker]] and [[Drawing|draughtsman]]. He works in variety of mediums including etching, gouache, pastel, sculpture, and glass painting. He is best known for his early drawings that depict [[eroticism]] in a rural context, and also for the originality and quality of his etchings and aquatints.
&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;''A Guide to 101 Modern and Contemporary Indian Artists'', Amrita Jhaveri, India Book House, 2005 {{ISBN|81-7508-423-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Laxma Goud was born in Nizampur, Medak district, [[Hyderabad State]] to Venka Goud and Anthamma. He was one among five sons and two daughters in his family. His childhood was spent in a village environment, where he grew up keenly aware, through firsthand observation, of rural tradition and craft. When he was a young boy he watched Andhra leather puppetry and the creation of terracotta ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Drawings: F.N. Souza and K. Laxma Goud'', Nancy Adajania, The Guild Art Gallery, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As he grew older he studied drawing and painting at the Government College of Fine Arts and Architecture, [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]]. Goud went on to study Mural Painting under [[K.G. Subramanyan]] at the [[Faculty of Fine Arts]], [[Maharaja Sayajirao University]] of [[Baroda]] from 1963 to 1965. It was at Baroda that Goud discovered his love of printmaking, and became a driving force at the university in building a strong and credible voice for the fine art print.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Art in Baroda'', Tulika Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|81-85229-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Goud made the unlikely step of returning to his village of Nizampur. With the newly educated viewpoint of an urban sophisticate, the artist found himself attracted to the unselfconscious attitudes toward sexuality that contributed to the relaxed atmosphere of village life. This relaxed sexuality stood in stark contrast to the rigid sexual mores of the Indian middle-classes he had encountered in the cities.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

==Style==
Laxma Goud began to interpret his childhood memories of rural and tribal vivacity through an urban grid in which surreal, libidinal tones mingled with fantasy and poetry. He created masterful small paintings of village life in a palette of monochrome greys. He also drew in pen and ink, and his drawings and etchings from this period are an interesting combination of village nostalgia, the surreal, and the erotic.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The artist is quoted as saying about this period of visual-erotic exploration, "We come from a culture which spoke openly about the man-woman relationship, about fertility. When it recurs in a contemporary context, why should anyone pull a face?"&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Contemporary Painting'', Neville Tuli, Hary N. Abrams Incorporated, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8109-3472-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goats, both full-[[udder]]ed and with [[erect penis]]es, became a signature motif. These goats are not just symbols of rural India. In Goud's words, "No one cares for a goat except perhaps for the artist who sees in the creature the dogged determination of a people who have learnt to live off their landscape by foraging for what they can get out of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Manifestations III'', Geeta Doctor, Delhi Art Gallery, 2005, {{ISBN|81-902104-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s Goud began to explore aquatint in his etchings and also more intensely sexual themes. But by the 1980s the artist seemed to return to more traditional roots, exploring various craft forms such as terracotta and reverse glass painting in a more subdued and decorative style.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

He is the head and teacher at Sarojini Naidu School of Performing Art, Fine Art &amp; Communication, [[University of Hyderabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Delhi Art Gallery, [http://www.delhiartgallery.com www.delhiartgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life imprisonment in Australia''' is handed down for serious offences including treason, murder, and commercial drug trafficking by the [[Judiciary of Australia#Federal courts|State and Territory Supreme Courts]] in [[Australia]].

Life imprisonment is mandatory for murder in [[South Australia]], the [[Northern Territory]], and [[Queensland]], [[aircraft hijacking]] across Australia under the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and in the remaining states and territories for the murder of a police officer or public official.

In [[New South Wales]], the average prison term for murder is 25 years, despite the [[Crimes Act 1900]] (NSW) stating the maximum sentence to be for the remainder of the offender's 'natural life'.

==Notable sentences==

===With non-parole periods===
If a non-parole period is fixed, it must be at least 10 years unless exceptional circumstances exist, or 20 years if the prisoner is convicted of the murder of a police officer or other public official.

The longest overall non-parole period is 60 years, being served by Dieter Pfennig (South Australia), who kidnapped and murdered 10-year-old Louise Bell in January 1983, kidnapped and murdered 10-year-old Michael Black in January 1989, and kidnapped and sexually abused a third child in December 1989. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/12/06/pfennig-jailed-35-years-bell-murder Louise Bell's killer Dieter Pfenning to serve another 35 years, will almost certainly die behind bars] &lt;/ref&gt; As Pfenning would have to live to 103 years of age to serve that term, this means he will, effectively, be incarcerated for the rest of his life.

The longest overall non-parole period for a single murder is 45 years and six months, being served by Michael Barry Fyfe (South Australia), who stabbed fellow inmate Trevor Tilley in the kitchen of Yatala Prison in January 1995 while serving a 17 and a half year sentence for other crimes including attempted murder, attacking fellow inmates and prison staff, escaping lawful custody, dangerous driving causing death and assaulting police.

The longest non-parole period imposed is 37 years, being served by Adam Mikhail and his father Frank (Western Australia) for shooting dead convicted drug dealer Frank La Rosa and his wife Kim in an ambush at their Chittering property in June 2008. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-22/hefty-sentence-for-murder-of-perth-couple/2767896 Record sentence for Perth couple's killers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest non-parole period imposed for a single murder is 35 years, being served by Melbourne CBD gunman [[Christopher Wayne Hudson]] (Victoria).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/35-years-jail-for-cbd-gunman-20080922-4leb.html CBD gunman jailed for life with 35 year minimum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest non-parole period imposed on a woman is 32 years, being served by South Australian Angelika Gavare, who murdered and dismembered pensioner Vonne McGlynn in November 2008 for financial gain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/pensioner-killer-angelika-gavare-jailed-for-32-years/story-fn7x8me2-1226186019474 Pensioner killer to serve 32 years]&lt;/ref&gt; and Victorian Cai Xia Liao, who repeatedly stabbed Mai Mach and her four-year-old grandson Alistair Kwong with gardening shears in a vicious attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/true-crime-scene/jealous-exlover-cai-xia-liao-who-murdered-alistair-kwong-4-and-grandmother-in-revenge-is-jailed/news-story/fce8c962b1d6d9d34615154d133991b8 Ex-lover jailed for life for revenge double murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Without the possibility of parole===

In the most extreme cases, the sentencing judge will refuse to fix a non-parole period, which means that the prisoner will spend the rest of their life in prison. In New South Wales, if the prisoner is convicted of the murder of a police officer, they will automatically be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/cop-killers-to-get-mandatory-life-sentence/story-fn7y9brv-1226060520139 Cop killers will die in jail]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notorious criminals serving at least one sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole include:

*Backpacker serial killer [[Backpacker Murders|Ivan Milat]] (New South Wales)
*Serial sex killer [[Peter Dupas]] (Victoria)
*Snowtown serial killers [[John Justin Bunting]] and [[Robert Joe Wagner]], and double sex killer [[Mark Errin Rust]] (South Australia)
*Sadistic rapist and murderer [[Murder of Sian Kingi|Barrie Watts]] (Queensland)
*Port Arthur gunman [[Martin Bryant]] (Tasmania)
*Serial killer Allan Thompson (Australian Capital Territory)

There are three women serving life without parole:
*Cannibalistic husband killer [[Katherine Knight]] (New South Wales)
*Black widow Patricia Byers (Queensland)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-24/convicted-killer-says-husband-still-alive/1293560 Convicted killer says husband still alive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second woman from Queensland, who tortured, raped and attempted to kill a 13-year-old girl, but cannot be named for legal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-12/couple-jailed-over-rape-and-torture-of-schoolgirl/3726676 Couple to die in jail for depraved sexual torture of schoolgirl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serial killer [[David and Catherine Birnie#Catherine Birnie|Catherine Birnie]] (Western Australia) is serving four consecutive life sentences with a non-parole period of 20 years, but due to the requirement that the [[Attorney General of Western Australia|attorney-general]] signs off on all parole recommendations from the Prisoners Review Board, it is highly unlikely she will ever be released from prison. Former Attorney-General [[Jim McGinty]] openly stated he would not sign off on her release, even if the board recommended it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Spagnolo| first =Joe| title = Birnie 'will not be freed'| agency =AAP| work =Perth Now| publisher= The Sunday Times| date =19 May 2007| url = http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21758888-2761,00.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016064023/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/birnie-will-not-be-freed/story-e6frg13u-1111113570166 |archivedate=16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Birnie not applying for release, the board is required conduct a review of her eligibility every three years, which is continually rejected. A notable Perth barrister, Tom Percy QC, has called for her release, stating that she is harmless and "pure revenge" is keeping her in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Kate|title=Serial killer Catherine Birnie’s fourth bid for parole rejected|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/serial-killer-catherine-birnies-fourth-bid-for-parole-rejected/news-story/c9aaefcd0ec3bc9aa0971887393bfc61|website=PerthNow|publisher=NewsCorp|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoddle Street massacre gunman [[Julian Knight (murderer)|Julian Knight]] is serving seven consecutive sentences of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years, as the state of Victoria did not officially have provision for life imprisonment without parole until 1991, and Knight was a young offender, being aged 19 at the time of the murders; due to his age, prosecutors did not make an application to refuse to fix a non-parole period. However, legislation has been passed that ensures he will die in jail, or will only be released if he is infirm and incapacitated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2014/02/18/02/04/new-law-to-keep-hoddle-st-killer-in-jail New legislation will keep Hoddle St gunman Knight imprisoned for the rest of his life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221105857/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2014/02/18/02/04/new-law-to-keep-hoddle-st-killer-in-jail |date=21 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-17/julian-knight-hoddle-street-killer-loses-high-court-fight/8815834?pfmredir=sm High Court rules that Julian Knight, Hoddle Street mass murderer, will die in custody] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Territory==
Life imprisonment is mandatory for murder.

A murder conviction carries a standard non-parole period of 20 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/throwing-away-the-jail-cell-key/story-e6frg6po-1111118986295 Throwing away the key]&lt;/ref&gt; but the sentencing judge can fix a non-parole period of between 10 years and 25 years.

There is also provision for the crime of '''aggravated murder''', which applies in cases of premeditated murder, contract killing, multiple/serial murder, murder of a child under the age of 18, murder with a sexual motivation, and the murder of a police officer or public official.

In the case of an aggravated murder conviction, the sentencing judge can either fix a non-parole period of at least 25 years, or in the most extreme case refuse to fix a non-parole period; the latter option means that the prisoner will spend the rest of their life in prison.

There are three prisoners at present serving at least one sentence of life imprisonment without parole in the Northern Territory: double sex killer [[Martin Leach (Australian murderer)|Martin Leach]], psychopath and necrophiliac [[Andrew Christopher Albury]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.nt.gov.au/archive/doc/judgements/2004/ntsc/ntsc059.html The Queen v Albury NTSC 59 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; and serial rapist and pedophile William Gordon Turner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/to-hell-and-back-for-child-sex-slave/story-e6frg6po-1111116451935 Hell of child sex slave revealed as abuser gets life]&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest non-parole period imposed in the Northern Territory is 30 years, being served by [[Douglas Crabbe|Douglas John Edward Crabbe]], who deliberately drove his Mack Truck into a motel bar at [[Uluru]], killing five patrons; two parole applications, in 2013 and 2016, have been rejected. The longest non-parole period imposed for a single murder is 28 years, being served by [[Bradley John Murdoch]], who shot dead British backpacker Peter Falconio.

The only woman sentenced to life imprisonment in the Northern Territory under the current laws is Evelyn Namatjira, who stabbed her younger sister Jennifer after an argument during a drinking session and is serving a non-parole period of 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-19/namatjira-sister-murder-sentence-appeal-fails-alice-springs/4831462 Sister killer's appeal rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">Life imprisonment is the most severe penalty under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] penal law. It may be imposed for murder, genocide, qualified hostage-taking and the act of arranging a war against Switzerland with foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 112, 264/1, 185/3 and 266/2/2 of the Penal Code. {{cite book|last=Christian Schwarzenegger|author2=Markus Hug |author3=[[Daniel Jositsch]]|title=Strafrecht ll: Strafen und Massnahmen|publisher=Schulthess|year=2007|edition=8th|pages=32|isbn=978-3-7255-5280-1|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the military penal code, it can also be imposed in times of war for mutiny, disobedience, cowardice, treason and espionage. 

Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment are eligible for parole after having served fifteen years, or ten years in exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;Article 86/5 of the Penal Code. Schwarzenegger/Hug/Jositsch, op.cit., at 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to any penalty imposed, criminals may be sentenced to detention if they have committed or attempted an intentional felony, punishable by imprisonment of five years or more, aimed against the life or well-being of other people (such as murder, rape or arson), and if there is a serious concern that they may repeat such offences.&lt;ref&gt;Article 64/1 of the Penal Code. Schwarzenegger/Hug/Jositsch, op.cit., at 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The detention is of indefinite duration, but its continued necessity must be examined by the competent authority once per year.&lt;ref&gt;Article 64b of the Penal Code.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a series of murders by recidivists in the 1980s and 1990s, a citizens' committee collected 194,390 signatures to propose a [[popular initiative]] that would amend the [[Constitution of Switzerland|constitution]] to mandate the effective incarceration for life of violent criminals and sex offenders considered untreatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=882&amp;sid=4705403|title=Swiss get tough on violent offenders|last=McLean|first=Morven|date=February 8, 2004|publisher=[[Swissinfo]]|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was adopted by 56% of the popular vote on February 8 2004, even though it was supported only by the right-wing [[Swiss People's Party]]. 

It was unsuccessfully opposed by the other major political parties and the [[Swiss Federal Council|government]], as well as by legal scholars who argued that mandatory lifetime detention violates the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=882&amp;ty=st&amp;sid=8227159|title=Parliament wants violent offenders law|date=September 18, 2007|publisher=[[Swissinfo]]|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vallotton|first=André|title=People's initiative for a real life sentence: the negative effects of safety threats in direct democracy|journal=Champ Pénal / Penal Field|publisher=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|issn=1777-5272|url=http://champpenal.revues.org/document51.html|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enabling legislation entered into force on 1 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/as/2008/2961.pdf Official Journal 2008, 2961].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Love triangle (disambiguation)}}
{{Love sidebar|types}}
A '''love triangle''' (also called a '''romantic love triangle''' or a '''romance triangle''' or an '''eternal triangle''') is usually a [[Intimate relationship|romantic relationship]] involving three or more people. While it can refer to two people independently romantically linked with a third, it usually implies that each of the three people has some kind of relationship to the other two. The relationships can be [[friendship]]s, [[Romance (love)|romantic]], or [[family|familial]].

The 1994 book ''Beliefs, Reasoning, and Decision Making'' states, "Although the romantic love triangle is formally identical to the friendship triad, as many have noted their actual implications are quite different....Romantic love is typically viewed as an exclusive relationship, whereas friendship is not."&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Abelson/R. C. Schank, ''Beliefs, Reasoning, and Decision-Making'' (1994), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics suggest that, in Western society, "willingly or not, most adults have been involved in a love triangle".&lt;ref&gt;A. Pam/J. Pearson, ''Splitting Up'' (1998), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main forms of love triangle have been distinguished: "there is the ''rivalrous triangle'', where the lover is competing with a rival for the love of the beloved, and the ''split-object triangle'', where a lover has split their attention between two love objects".&lt;ref&gt;Deidre Johnson, ''Love: Bondage or Liberation'' (London, 2010) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and definitions==
[[Image:Gianciotto Discovers Paolo and Francesca Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|right|thumb|250px|"[[Gianciotto Malatesta|Gianciotto]] Discovers [[Paolo Malatesta|Paolo]] and [[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca]]" by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] ; it depicts [[the Divine Comedy]].]]

The term "love triangle" generally connotes an arrangement unsuitable to one or more of the people involved.  One person typically ends up feeling betrayed at some point (e.g., "Person A is [[Jealousy|jealous]] of Person C who is having a relationship with Person B who, in Person A's eyes, is 'his/her' person.").&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement that is agreed upon by all parties is sometimes called a [[triad (relationship)|triad]], which is a type of ''[[polyamory]]'' even though polyamory usually implies sexual relations. Within the context of [[monogamy]], love triangles are inherently unstable, with [[unrequited love]] and jealousy as common themes. In most cases, the jealous or rejected first party ends a friendship—and sometimes even starts a fight with—the second party over the third-party love interest. Though rare, love triangles have been known to lead to [[murder]] or [[suicide]] committed by the actual or perceived rejected lover.

[[Psychoanalysis]] has explored 'the theme of erotic love triangles and their roots in the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] triangle'.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Experience suggests that 'a repeated pattern of forming or being caught in love triangle can be much dissolved by beginning to analyse the patterns of the childhood relationship to each parent in turn and to both parents as a couple'.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In such instances, 'you find men who are attracted only by married woman but who can't sustain the relationship if it threatens to become more than an affair. They ''need'' the husband to protect them from a ''full'' relationship...as women who repeatedly get involved with married men need the wives'.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and How to Survive Them'' (1994) p. 268-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common themes===

A common love triangle is one in which the hero or heroine is torn between two suitors of radically contrasting personalities; one of a [[girl next door]] or [[nice guy]] type, and the other as a [[physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] but potentially hazardous person.  Alternatively, the hero or heroine has a choice between a seemingly perfect lover and an imperfect but endearing person.  In this case, the "too-good-to-be-true" person is often revealed to have a significant flaw, such as hidden insensitivity or [[lechery|lecherousness]], causing the other person to become the more desirable partner.

===Eternal triangle===
{{Other uses|Eternal triangle (disambiguation)}}
'In geometric terms, the eternal triangle can be represented as comprising three points – a jealous mate (A) in a relationship with an unfaithful partner (B) who has a lover (C)...A feels ''abandoned'', B is ''between'' two mates, and C is a ''catalyst'' for crisis in the union A-B'.&lt;ref&gt;Pam/Pearson, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that 'a collusive network is always needed to keep the triangle eternal'.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Pam/Pearson, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; This may take a tragic form – 'I saw no prospect of its ending except with death – the death of one of three people'&lt;ref&gt;Rose Macaulay, ''The Towers of Trebizond'' (1990) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; – or alternately a comic one: 'A man at the funeral of a friend's wife, with whom he has been carrying on an affair, breaks into tears and finally becomes hysterical, while the husband remains impassive. "Calm yourself," says the husband, "I'll be marrying again"'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' Vol II (1973) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosociality===

It has been suggested that if men 'share a sense of brotherhood and they allow a woman into their relationship, an [[isosceles triangle]] is created' automatically, as 'in [[Truffaut]]'s film ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca L. Copeland ed., ''Woman Critiqued'' (2006) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Girard]] has explored the role of envy and [[mimetic desire]] in such relationships, arguing that often the situation 'subordinates a desired ''something'' to the ''someone'' who enjoys a privileged relationship with it'.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''A Theatre of Envy'' (Oxford 1991) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, 'it cannot be fair to blame the quarrel of the mimetic twins on a woman....She is their common scapegoat'.&lt;ref&gt;Girard, p. 323-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital breakup===

When a love triangle results in the breakup of a marriage, it may often be followed by what has been called 'the imposition of a "defilement taboo"...the emotional demand imposed by a jealous ex-mate...to eschew any friendly or supportive contact with the rival in the triangle'&lt;ref&gt;Pam/Pearson, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The result is often to leave children gripped by 'shadows from the past...they often take sides. Their loyalties are torn', and – except in the best of cases – 'the one left "injured" can easily sway the feelings of the children against acknowledging this new relationship'.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Satir, ''Peoplemaking'' (1983) p. 181-4&lt;/ref&gt;

As to gender responsibility, evidence would seem to indicate that in [[late modernity]] both sexes may equally well play the part of the "Other Person" – that 'men and women love with equivalent passion as well as folly'&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and that certainly there is nothing to 'suggest that a man is better able to control himself in a love triangle than a woman'.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypically, the person at the center of a rivalrous love triangle is a woman, whereas for a split-object love triangle it is a man, due to the same reasons that [[polygyny]] is far more common than [[polyandry]].

Those who find themselves tempted to become the Other Man may, however, still find a cynic's advice from the 1930s pertinent on 'the emotional position of the adulterer, and why to avoid it...''Did I know what a mug's game was? – No. – "A mug's game," he told me, "is breaking your back at midnight, trying to make another man's wife come''{{'}}.&lt;ref&gt;Legman, p. 432-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In entertainment==
Love triangles are a popular theme in entertainment, especially romantic fiction, including [[opera]], [[romance novel]]s, [[soap opera]]s, [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]], [[manga]], [[tabloid talk shows]], and [[popular music]].

===Fiction===
[[Eric Berne]] termed that conflictual aspect of the love triangle "Let's You and Him Fight"; and considered "the psychology is essentially feminine. Because of its dramatic qualities, LYAHF is the basis of much of the world's literature, both good and bad".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Adult literature has seen a rise in the popularity of the love triangle story structure (such as ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' or ''[[The Selection]]''). But the love triangle story structure has been around since before early classic writers like [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]]. Shakespeare's famous play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' featured a love triangle between Juliet, Romeo, and Paris. Although more subtle, Dumas's classics ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' and ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' also feature love triangles strong enough to seek revenge and start a war.

Love triangles can either be relatively balanced, in which the two candidates each have a fair chance of ending up with the protagonist, or they can be lopsided, in which the hero or heroine has an obvious romantic interest in one of the candidates, and considers the other candidate as "[[platonic love|just a friend]]", but withholds a confession to avoid hurting feelings. An example of this is in the Broadway hit musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]],'' in which dim-witted Fiyero first displays affection for [[Glinda the Good Witch]], but then falls for [[Elphaba]], the supposedly [[Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]]. But in this latter case, to provide necessary tension and drama, the second platonic candidate is also very often the hero or heroine's long-term [[boyfriend]] or [[girlfriend]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A less permanent love triangle occurs when a former lover of the main character makes an unexpected appearance to win back the character's heart, provoking feelings of jealousy from the main character's steady partner.  However, this situation is usually not considered an actual love triangle since there is little possibility of the main character breaking up with a longtime partner to pursue a just-introduced character, and it is often used as only a test of the true depth of the main character's devotion to their partner.  In these cases, the long-term partner has usually been guilty of neglect toward the main character and in the end the relationship remains intact with the long-term partner having learned some valuable lesson.

===Television===
Usually, a love triangle will end with the hero or heroine confiding their feelings in the suitor they feel is most virtuous or has the most interest in them. (As in ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]''.) The other suitor usually steps aside to allow the couple to be happy, or comes to terms with their feelings, often claiming they could not love the main character as much.  Sometimes they are written out of the love equation entirely by falling in love with someone else, or being killed off or otherwise eliminated.  While love triangles can be accused of being [[clichéd]], if done well, they provide insight into the complexity of love and what is best to pursue in a romantic relationship.

In television shows, a love triangle is often prolonged, delaying final declarations of love between the pursued character and suitors that may prematurely end this dynamic or displease fans. Some examples of these include ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. Love triangles also featured prominently on [[soap operas]], and can span more than a decade, as famously shown by [[Taylor Hamilton]], [[Ridge Forrester]] and [[Brooke Logan]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. Another famous soap opera love triangle was the one that occurred on ''[[General Hospital]]'' between [[Luke Spencer]], [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]], and [[Scotty Baldwin]]. Similarly, [[romance film]]s also sustain this set-up until near the film's end, although they tend to establish a more clear-cut conclusion to the romantic entanglements than in long-running TV shows.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Popular music===
The love triangle has been a recurring subject in many popular songs through the years. These "love triangle songs" include, but are not limited to: "[[You Ain't Woman Enough]]" and "[[Fist City]]," both by [[Loretta Lynn]]; "[[The Girl Is Mine]]" by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Paul McCartney]]; "[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy is Mine]]" by [[Brandy (singer)|Brandy]] and [[Monica (singer)|Monica]]; "[[Make No Mistake, She's Mine]]" by [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Ronnie Milsap]]; "[[Does He Love You]]" by [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Linda Davis]]; "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]" by [[New Order (band)|New Order]]; "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]" by [[Marty Robbins]], "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]" by [[Dolly Parton]]; "[[She's All I Got]]" by [[Johnny Paycheck]]; "[[The Girl of My Best Friend]]" and "[[U.S. Male]]," both by [[Elvis Presley]]; "[[Torn Between Two Lovers]]" by [[Mary MacGregor]], "[[Don't Go Out]]" by [[T. Graham Brown]] and [[Tanya Tucker]], "[[My Toot Toot]]" by [[Rockin' Sidney]], "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)|Against All Odds]]" by [[Phil Collins]], "[[Hey Joe (Carl Smith song)|Hey, Joe]]" by [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], "[[Tell Her No]]" by [[The Zombies]], "[[Tennessee Waltz]]" by [[Patti Page]], and "[[Jessie's Girl]]" by [[Rick Springfield]].

[[Bob Dylan]] provides a violent outcome to "the sexual intrigues of [[Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts]], in their various ''ménage à trois'' manifestations".&lt;ref&gt;Neil Corcoran ed., ''Do You, Mr Jones?'' (London 2002) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real life==
*The [[Bloomsbury Group]] often produced some unusual forms of love triangles, as with that involving [[Vanessa Bell]], [[Duncan Grant]] and the latter's lover, [[David Garnett]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermione Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (London 1996) p. 381 and p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;
*Warned off a love triangle by one of his prospective partners, [[Einstein]] conceded to her that "You have more respect for the difficulties of triangular geometry than I, old mathematicus, have."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in W. Isaacson, ''Einstein'' (2007) p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==

===Ménage à trois===
A love triangle should not be confused with a [[ménage à trois]], a three-way relationship in which all members are romantically involved with each other instead of being in conflict over one person. Ménage à trois is French and directly translates to "household for three" meaning it is usually composed of a "married couple and a lover...who live together while sharing sexual relations". This differs from a love triangle because each participant is equally motivated purely by sexual desires.  The ménage à trois may be considered a subset of 'The Sandwich...a straight three-handed operation...which may be operated with any assortment of sexes: three men, three women, two men and a woman ("''Ménage à trois''"), or two women and a man ("The Tourist Sandwich")'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the possibility of 'a ''ménage à trois'' powered by the passion of hatred'.&lt;ref&gt;Belinda Sterling, ''The Journal of Dora Damage'' (London 2007) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;{{elaboration needed|date=May 2017}}

The '''Nanumba people''' are an ethnic group whose traditional homeland is in the southeast of the [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Region]] of Ghana. They speak Nanun (var. Nanuni), a Gur language.&lt;ref name="Awedoba"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=BrbIw2eYVM4C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=nanumba+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjaob_o5avKAhUD7BQKHdjAAi8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nanumba%20people&amp;f=false | title=An Ethnographic Study of Northern Ghanaian Conflicts: Towards a Sustainable Peace : Key Aspects of Past, Present, and Impending Conflicts in Northern Ghana and the Mechanisms for Their Address | publisher=African Books Collective | author=A.

==Geography==
As of 2000, population of the Nanumba in Ghana were estimated at  78,812.&lt;ref name="Anamzooya"&gt;{{cite journal | url=| title=Chieftaincy Succession Dispute in Nanuŋ, Northem Ghana: Interrogating the Narratives of the Contestants | author=Alhassan Sulemana Anamzoya &amp; Steve Tonah | journal=Ghana Journal of Geography | year=2012 | volume=4 | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Around 75,000 Nanumba are found in the Bawku Districts of northern Ghana. (we need a reference for this)--&gt;

Though Nanumba constitute a  homogeneous cultural and linguistic group, they are closely related to the Dagomba to the north and east and the Mamprusi further to the north, and more-remotely to the Mossi of Burkina Faso. Traditionally the originating ancestors of the paramount chiefly lines of the former three brothers, and the Mossi paramounts descended from a daughter of the Mamprusi line. Published references include quoted statements of Mampruli speakers: ''Ti ŋmampurisi, Yooba, Naanumma ni Moosi piiligu nyɛ la Kyama maa'' "The origin of us Mamprusi, Dagomba and Nanumba was in Chama",&lt;ref name="Piiligu"/&gt; ''Ti zaa nyɛ la yimmu'' "We are all one. (Mamprusi, Dagomba, Nanumba)"&lt;ref name="ducker"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ritual-aspects-of-the-mamprusi-kingship/oclc/2184368 | title=Ritual aspects of the Mamprusi kingship | publisher=Leiden : Afrika-Studiecentrum v.8. | author=Drucker-Brown, Susan | year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion in [''passim'']&lt;ref name="legends"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/legends-of-northern-ghana/oclc/3803111&amp;referer=brief_results | title=Legends of Northern Ghana | publisher=London, New York, Longmans, Green | author=St John-Parsons, D | year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital town of the Nanumba is [[Bimbilla]], a small town which serves as the capital of [[Nanumba North District|Nanumba North district]] in the [[Northern Region, Ghana|Northern Region]] of north [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="clashes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/8-persons-arrested-over-Bimbilla-clashes-367913 | title=8 persons arrested over Bimbilla clashes | work=Graphic.com.gh | date=11 July 2015 | agency=GhanaWeb | accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the capital of the Nanumba State and the seat of the Overlord of Nanumba, the Bimbilla Naa.&lt;ref name="bimbilla"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=YKOEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=capital+of+nanumba+state+bimbilla&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L2ZoeR8pbX&amp;sig=hyEsGx4zuRafkpD_l91qoeaYCek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizusCchazKAhUB1xQKHU9BAaUQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=capital%20of%20nanumba%20state%20bimbilla&amp;f=false | title=The Anthropology of Power: ASA Monographs | publisher=Routledge | author=Cheater, Angela | year=2003 | pages=224 | isbn=9781134650484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional authority==
The highest level in the traditional hierarchy, referred to in English as the 'Paramount Chief' or sometimes 'King', is the last court of appeal for all disputes at lower levels: between paramounts there was no recourse other than war. The subjects of a Paramount Chief constitute an ethnic group or 'tribe'. In this system the Bimbilla Naa with his seat at Bimbilla is the Paramount Chief of the Nanumba ethnic group.&lt;ref name="JOURNAL"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieagh.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gpj-v3-art6.pdf | title=Understanding the Causes and Impacts of Conflicts in the Northern Region of Ghana | author=Mohammed, Sulemana | journal=Ghana Policy Journal | date=August  2009 | volume=3 | issue=4 | pages=110–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the paramount chief of Mampurugu (the NaYiri) installed paramount chiefs directly from Mampurugu in the 'younger brother' and 'granddaughter' states, but for many centuries the NaYiri's recognition of the new paramounts has been symbolic at best and its significance disputed. The Nanumba have a particularly close relationship with the Dagomba, but the larger group have rarely exercised direct power over them.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/The-Bimbilla-chieftaincy-struggle-what-we-must-know-316414 | title=The Bimbilla chieftaincy struggle: what we must know | work=Ghanaweb.com | date=11 July 2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2016 | author=Attah, Hajia Salamatu Nantogmah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Ghana there is a House of Chiefs where traditional matters have a forum at the level of the nation state.&lt;ref name="chieftaincy"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Unanswered-questions-on-the-Bimbilla-chieftaincy-issue-319381 | title=Unanswered questions on the Bimbilla chieftaincy issue | work=Ghanaweb.com | date=2 August 2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2016 | author=Iddrisu, Farouk Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Islam is the most-practised and characteristic religion of the Nanumba and the Dagomba, the Nanumba less-so than the Dagomba, though many people also  consult non-Muslim diviners and give offerings to ancestral and other shrines.&lt;ref name=".gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nanumbanorth.ghanadistricts.gov.gh/?arrow=atd&amp;_=85&amp;sa=6970 | title=Nanumba North District | publisher=Ghanadistricts.gov. | date=2006 | accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few Christians, mostly Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name="gss"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/2010_District_Report/Northern/NANUMBA%20NORTH.pdf | title=NANUMBA NORTH DISTRICT | publisher=Ghana Statistical Service | date=2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2016 | pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Besides the two Islamic festivals; [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], the Nanumba celebrate [[Bugum Chugu]], [[Damba festival|Damba]] and [[Naa Jigli]] festivals.&lt;ref name="damba"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/9141-damba-festival-comes-off-successfully.html | title=Damba festival comes off successfully | work=Zakaria Alhassan | date=1 February 2013 | accessdate=January 15, 2016 | author=Bonsu, Abigail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myjoy"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2015/October-25th/fire-festival-truck-runs-into-revelers-kills-one-15-injured-after-tamale-gun-violence.php | title=Fire Festival update: Truck kills reveler; man butchered; 15 injured after gun violence | work=Myjoyonline.com | date=October 25, 2015 | accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jigli"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/50490-bimbilla-celebrates-naa-jigli.html | title=Bimbilla celebrates Naa Jigli | date=2 October 2015 | agency=Graphic.com.gh | accessdate=January 15, 2016 | author=Zadok Kwame Gyesi &amp; Suweiba Yakubu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaming PC set up.jpg|thumb|350px|An example of a dedicated [[Gaming PC|gaming-PC rig]].]]
The '''PC Master Race''', sometimes referred to by its original phrasing as the '''Glorious PC Gaming Master Race''', is an internet [[subculture]], [[internet community]], and a [[tongue-in-cheek]] term of superiority for [[PC game|PC gaming]] used among gamers to compare PC gaming to [[video game console|console]] gaming.&lt;ref name="newstatesman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsExtremeTech"/&gt; 

In current parlance, the term is used by PC enthusiasts both to describe themselves as a group, as well as their belief in the superiority of the PC platform in comparison to [[Video game console|consoles]], often citing features like more advanced graphics, smoother framerates, free online play, backwards compatibility, modifications, upgradability, customization, lower cost-over-time, open standards, multitasking, and performance.&lt;ref name="ignsuperior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lifehacker"/&gt; Popular imagery, discussion, and media referencing the term also commonly describes console users who find consoles better than PC as "console peasants" and people who play on PC as the "Glorious PC Gaming Master Race".&lt;ref name="Plunkett 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twsNYDailyNews" /&gt;

==History==

===Creation===

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=What quickly becomes obvious is that Witcher is very much a PC-exclusive game, which are typically designed to be as complex and unintuitive as possible so that those dirty console-playing peasants don't ruin it for the glorious PC-gaming master race.|salign=right|source=—[[Ben Croshaw]]&lt;ref name="twsCroshaw2008" /&gt;}}
In 2008, comedic writer [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] employed the comedically extreme term "Glorious PC Gaming Master Race" in a video-review for the role-playing game ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'' for the online gaming magazine ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''.&lt;ref name="twsCroshaw2008" /&gt; Croshaw explained that his initial intent in referencing [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[master race]] ideology when he coined the intense term 'Glorious PC Gaming Master Race' was to poke fun at an elitist attitude he perceived among some of the Witcher's PC playerbase at the time of The Witcher's release, who had complained about the PC release of the game being possibly negatively affected by the console port of the game:&lt;ref name="twsEscapistMagazine"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was intended to be ironic, to illustrate what I perceived at the time to be an elitist attitude among a certain kind of PC gamer. People who invest in expensive gaming PCs and continually spend money to make sure the tech in their brightly-lit tower cases is up to date. Who actually prefer games that are temperamental to get running and that have complicated keyboard interfaces, just because it discourages new or 'casual' players who will in some way taint the entire community with their presence. I meant it as a dig."&lt;ref name="twsEscapistMagazine"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reappropriation===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=In April 2011 I grabbed it [the expression] and changed its original meaning, creating a subreddit dedicated to the glory that is to play (and not only) on PC. (...) we're a serious group dedicated to the serious and clear advantages of PC over other work and gaming devices, whose only and arguable advantage are artificial restrictions put in place so as to squeeze gamers out of their money.|salign=right|source=—Reddit user pedro19, creator of the /r/PCMasterRace [[subreddit]]&lt;ref name="Monteiro, Joel" /&gt;}}

The term caught on quickly, but with a [[Reappropriation|different meaning]] than originally implied by Ben Croshaw. It is now being used as an expression of pride among PC gamers, who view their PC platform as superior to traditional [[video game consoles]] due to its ever-expandable and [[Upgrade|upgradable]] hardware, graphical potential, affordability, game library, mod support, optional mouse and keyboard input, and other popular reasons.&lt;ref name="twsEscapistMagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="techinsider2" /&gt; This change in meaning and widespread popularity can be linked back to the creation and popularization of the /r/PCMasterRace [[Reddit|subreddit]] created by Reddit user pedro19 in 2011, which accumulated one million members by July 2017.&lt;ref name="Monteiro, Joel" /&gt;

While ''The Escapist'' continued to popularize the term's (or at least the term "Glorious PC Gaming Master Race") usage in later episodes for several years,&lt;ref name="twsEscapist2"/&gt; writers in more mainstream computer-related and gaming-related publications tended to avoid using the term because of its negative associations, such as [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="twsLinusTechTips"/&gt; In early 2015, Tyler Wilde, executive editor of ''[[PC Gamer]]'', suggested the term should be abandoned altogether in an article titled "Let's stop calling ourselves the PC Master Race". "It worked as a hyperbolic joke when it was first said as a hyperbolic joke, and I did think it was a little funny to embrace the criticism ironically—for a moment, [but] when I see kids unironically boasting about their 'master race' affiliation on forums, I cringe."&lt;ref name="TylerWildePCgamer"/&gt; Tyler instead suggested replacing the term, and offered examples such as "Fearsome Keyboard People" and "PC Thunder Cats". The article was met by some disagreement from others who believed the term's usage was acceptable.&lt;ref name="newstatesman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CroshawResponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechRaptor" /&gt; While Ben Croshaw acknowledged the term's reference to and origins from Nazi Germany, he countered that those who use the term without knowing of the association can be viewed positively as a sign that those ideals and their historic Nazi associations had faded from the public mind. He also made a reference to attempts to incite the term's abandonment as being part of a sort of "[[thought police]]", criticizing Tyler Wilde's article.&lt;ref name="CroshawResponse" /&gt;

===Popularization===

The rapid growth of the shortened and now re-appropriated "PC Master Race" term as well as its handful of associated communities has attracted the attention of related computer hardware and game companies such as Corsair and Valve, as well as celebrities such as [[Terry Crews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BH592gCBRTn/|website=instagram.com|title=terrycrews|accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ie/gaming/Watch-Terry-Crews-is-really-getting-into-PC-gaming/383174.htm|website=entertainment.ie|title=Terry Crews is really getting into PC gaming|date=July 17, 2016|accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, several large technology companies have partnered with the PC Master Race group to organize contests, events and giveaways, such as [[AMD]],&lt;ref name="AMD480"/&gt; [[Corsair Components|Corsair]],&lt;ref name="Corsair_tweet" /&gt; [[Cooler Master]],&lt;ref name="Cooler_Master_tweet" /&gt; [[Oculus VR]],&lt;ref name="luckeyama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luckeyama2"/&gt; [[Nzxt|NZXT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing NZXT's Hue+ giveaway to PCMR!|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4bxnnl/announcing_nzxts_hue_giveaway_to_pcmr/|website=Reddit|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We here at NZXT want to help PC gamers out by doing a Steam Gift Card Giveaway.|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4phsmk/steam_sales_are_the_reason_why_i_am_going_back_to/|website=Reddit|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Year Anniversary NZXT x PCMR H440 Case!|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4ho10y/giveaway_5_year_anniversary_nzxt_x_pcmr_h440_case/|website=Reddit|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nvidia]].&lt;ref name="Nvidia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nvidia_tweet" /&gt; They have also been in close collaboration with the [[Folding@Home]] project, a distributed computing project developed by [[Stanford University]], regularly pushing members of the community to donate their computer power to science, and organizing promotion events to fight against cancer and other diseases, as well as hosting an AMA for the Folding@Home team themselves, which had the participation of investigators and students from [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]], [[Stanford University]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Folding_tweet" /&gt;

By several accounts, the term has become an [[Internet meme]],&lt;ref name="twsNYDailyNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twsEscapistMagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twsLinusTechTips"/&gt; and is a launching point for debates about the relative popularity of gaming platforms. A report by Julian Arenzon in the ''New York Daily News'' suggested that digital distribution of games to personal computers is becoming more prevalent within the gaming community, and that there has been a trend away from physical game systems as well as physical discs.&lt;ref name="twsNYDailyNews"/&gt; Reviewer Paul Tassi in ''Forbes'' suggested that in the platform battle, PCs have an edge because they were a "necessity" for everyday life while consoles were a "luxury" costing hundreds of dollars and only offering a few additional games or features over that of what a PC already offers.&lt;ref name="twsForbes" /&gt;

Between 5% to 10% of [[Homelessness in the United States|'''homeless people''']] '''in the United States own pets''' (mainly dogs and/or cats). Studies of homeless pet owners in urban settings show a sense of identity and community connection between pets and their owners. This topic is part of the Animals and Society branch of study in the field of [[Sociology]], and is also an issue with the values and responsibility of [[pet]] ownership.

== Impact on the homeless experience  ==
[[File:Homeless woman.jpg|thumb|Homeless woman with dogs, Haight Street, San Francisco, CA]]
One factor behind the actions of homeless pet owners is the fear and anxiety over the loss of their pet. This anxiety is explained in a theory by [[Clinton Sanders]], who notes that a close relationship with a companion animal shapes the construction of the owners’ identity, and forms the basis for interaction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Actions Speak Louder than Words: Close Relationships between Humans and Nonhuman Animals|last=Sanders|first=Clinton|date=2003|journal=Symbolic Interaction|volume=26|issue=3|pages=405|doi=10.1525/si.2003.26.3.405}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner and the pet are united in a 'couple' relationship which is socially defined. He notes that people link the animal and the owner and have a set of expectations regarding how they will act. In public animals serve as social facilitators and encourage openness to the point where strangers feel welcome in approaching the human-pet couple.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This relationship is supported by Irvine in her description of the "Pack of Two" designation of the homeless owner and their pet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dog Always Eats First: Homeless People and Their Animals|last=Irvine|first=Leslie|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc|year=2013|location=Boulder, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the anxiety for the pet, and the close emotional relationship between the owner and the pet, shapes the homeless experience.

=== Social interactions ===
Several studies have concluded that the homeless attribute their pet with saving their life, getting them off of drugs or alcohol; one researcher noted that many dog owners reported  their dogs knew when they were sad or emotional, an example of the ‘empathetic experience” of a human-pet connection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Homeless pet owners use their pets to facilitate socialization&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Blanchard (2015), ''[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.5252/az2015n2a3 Homeless people with dogs: what can be learned from the animals' names?]'', Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;, getting their owners out to local vet clinics and parks where they interact with other pet owners.  Many homeless pet owners regard their pet with a high degree of attachment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conti|first=L|last2=Lieb|first2=S|last3=Liberti|first3=T|last4=Wiley-Bayless|first4=M|last5=Hepburn|first5=K|last6=Diaz|first6=T|date=1995-11-01|title=Pet ownership among persons with AIDS in three Florida counties.|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.85.11.1559|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=85|issue=11|pages=1559–1561|doi=10.2105/AJPH.85.11.1559|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1615702}}&lt;/ref&gt; and report lower levels of loneliness with pet ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rew|first=Lynn|date=2000-07-01|title=Friends and Pets as Companions: Strategies for Coping With Loneliness Among Homeless Youth|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6171.2000.tb00089.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=125–132|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2000.tb00089.x|issn=1744-6171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sobriety ===
Leslie Irvine argues pet ownership prompts many to act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet. Additionally, many refuse housing in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Homeless pet owners will not sleep in shelters that do not allow pets, they will pass on the opportunity for housing if they cannot take their pet, and they will sacrifice their meal if food is limited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irvine|first=Leslie|date=August 2012|title=Animals as Lifechangers and Lifesavers, Pets in the Redemption Narratives of Homeless People|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|volume=42|pages=3|doi=10.1177/0891241612456550}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[caregiving]] to their pet is constructed as their primary reason for being in life. The pet is dependent on them for food and care and this gives the owner a sense of responsibility and a positive self-image and self-worth.

=== Shelter ===
As a group the homeless pet owners put pet ownership first before accepting housing or shelter, employment, leisure activity, or health care, themes identified by Irvine and Sanders. These themes were earlier identified in research among the homeless in San Francisco in 1994 by University of California at Davis researchers Aline and Robert Kidd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kidd|first=Aline H.|last2=Kidd|first2=Robert M.|date=1994-06-01|title=Benefits and liabilities of pets for the homeless|url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1994.74.3.715|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=74|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.2466/pr0.1994.74.3.715|issn=0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar themes were identified in research conducted in Canada by Michelle Lem, Director of Community Veterinary Outreach in Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of Companion Animal Ownership among Canadian Street-involved Youth: A Qualitative Analysis|last=Lem|first=Michelle|date=December 2013|journal=Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare|url=https://www.wmich.edu/hhs/newsletters_journals/jssw_institutional/institutional_subscribers/40.4.Lem.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pet owners described the ways their pets shaped their environment: they would sleep outside in the rain if the only option was shelter in a no pet shelter; their pet kept them off drugs and alcohol, and they avoided risky behavior that might result in arrest and incarceration because they feared their pet would be removed or euthanized.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They also reported that they gave up going to social events at arenas or other public areas where pets were not allowed for fear their pet would be taken from them. The ways in which their pets shape their daily decisions also carries over to the level of involvement of homeless pet owners in the local community.

== Implications for social institutions ==
Social interaction among the homeless is impacted by pet ownership. Many homeless pet owners reported that having a dog facilitated conversation, but at the same time having a dog had a negative impact on their ability to find housing because homeless shelters, rental housing, and subsidized government housing continue to have strict regulations against allowing pets to reside with their homeless owners. Some action is being taken by social institutions to address the issue. San Francisco initiated a program  which addressed both homelessness and animal shelter overcrowding: WOOF – Wonderful Opportunities for Occupants and Fidos.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Woof program offers second chances|last=Knight|first=H.|date=June 25, 2014|work=|via=sfgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Started in August 2012, the homeless are given a dog that would otherwise be euthanized, to foster until a permanent home can be found. The homeless are trained to care for the dogs and will receive a weekly stipend.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to dog training lesson, the foster owners received training in job readiness, communication skills, banking and health care. All pet food and care is provided by the shelter. Pets of the Homeless is a national nonprofit with a mission to feed and provide basic emergency veterinary care to pets of the homeless.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.petsofthehomeless.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Pets of the Homeless|website=Pets of the Homeless|access-date=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LoCascio has an arrest record dating from 1935, that includes arrests for illegal alcohol trafficking, [[narcotics]] violations, and  [[forgery]]. A lieutenant under his brother Carmine, Peter LoCascio was the main supplier of heroin on New York's [[Prince Street|Prince]] and [[Elizabeth Street (Manhattan)|Elizabeth Street]]. He was also an associate of [[John Ormento]], [[Solomon Kaplan]] and brothers [[Joseph DiPalermo|Joseph]] and [[Peter DiPalermo]], prior to the [[Apalachin Meeting]] in 1957.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2692">'''Post-painterly abstraction''' is a term created by [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] as the title for an exhibit he curated for the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1964, which subsequently travelled to the [[Walker Art Center]] and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario|Art Gallery of Toronto]].

Greenberg had perceived that there was a new movement in painting that derived from the [[abstract expressionism]] of the 1940s and 1950s but "favored openness or clarity" as opposed to the dense [[painterliness|painterly]] surfaces of that painting style. The 31 artists in the exhibition included [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Jack Bush]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Thomas Downing]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], [[Paul Feeley]], [[John Ferren]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Nicholas Krushenick]], [[Alexander Liberman]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Arthur McKay|Arthur Fortescue McKay]], [[Howard Mehring]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[David Simpson (artist)|David Simpson]], Albert Stadler, [[Frank Stella]], Mason Wells, [[Emerson Woelffer]], and a number of other American and Canadian artists who were becoming well known in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppacatalog.html list of artists in the exhibition] Retrieved August 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the prior generation of contemporary artists, [[Barnett Newman]] has been singled out as one who anticipated "some of the characteristics of post-painterly abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith]], ''Lives of the Great Twentieth Century Artists'', New York, Rizzoli, 1986;  p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As painting continued to move in different directions, initially away from [[abstract expressionism]], powered by the spirit of innovation of the time, the term "post-painterly abstraction", which had obtained some currency in the 1960s, was gradually supplanted by [[minimalism]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[lyrical abstraction]], and [[color field painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=SBMA: exhibitions &gt; current &gt; Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960-1979 |publisher=Sbmuseart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prakrits''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɑː|k|r|ɪ|t}}; {{lang-sa|प्राकृत}} {{IAST|''prākṛta''}}; {{lang-psu|{{IAST|pāuda}}}}; {{lang-pka|{{IAST|pāua}}}}) are any of several [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages]] formerly spoken in India.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sal&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolner|first=Alfred C.|title=Introduction to Prakrit|year=1928|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.,|location=[[Delhi]]|isbn=9788120801899|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts written in these languages date from the 3rd century BC to the 8th century AD or later.

==Overview==
The [[Ardhamagadhi]] (or simply [[Magadhi Prakrit|Magadhi]]) Prakrit, which was used extensively to write the scriptures of [[Jainism]], is often considered to be the definitive form of Prakrit, while others are considered variants of it. Prakrit grammarians would give the full grammar of Ardhamagadhi first, and then define the other grammars with relation to it. For this reason, courses teaching 'Prakrit' are often regarded as teaching Ardhamagadhi.&lt;ref&gt;Woolner, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pali]], the Prakrit used in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], tends to be treated as a special exception from the variants of the Ardhamagadhi language, as Classical Sanskrit grammars do not consider it as a Prakrit ''per se'', presumably for [[sectarianism|sectarian]] rather than linguistic reasons. Other Prakrits, such as [[Paiśācī]], are reported in old historical sources but are not attested.
[[File:Dhamma inscription.jpg|thumb|The Prakrit word "''[[Dhamma|Dha-m-ma]]''" (equivalent to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Dharma]]'') in the [[Brahmi script]], as inscribed by [[Ashoka]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka]], 3rd century BCE.]]
Some modern scholars follow this classification by including all Middle Indo-Aryan languages under the rubric of 'Prakrits', while others emphasise the independent development of these languages, often separated from the history of [[Sanskrit]] by wide divisions of [[caste]], [[religion]], and [[geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Deshpande, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  While Prakrits were originally seen as 'lower' forms of language, the influence they had on Sanskrit - allowing it to be more easily used by the common people - as well as the converse influence of [[Sanskrit]] on the Prakrits, gave Prakrits progressively higher cultural cachet.&lt;ref&gt;Deshpande, pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'Prakrit' itself has a flexible definition, being defined sometimes as 'original, natural, artless, normal, ordinary, usual' or '[[vernacular]],' in contrast to the literary and religious [[orthodoxy]] of [[Sanskrit]]. Alternatively, Prakrit can be taken to mean 'derived from an original,' which means evolved in a natural way. Prakrit is foremost a native term, designating 'vernaculars' as opposed to Sanskrit.

The Prakrits became literary languages, generally patronised by ancient kings of the [[Hindu]] [[kshatriya]] class, though were still regarded as illegitimate by the orthodoxy. The earliest extant use of Prakrit is in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] on [[Buddhism]] (r. 268–232 BCE). It appears as a very significant [[liturgical language]] in the form of the [[Pāli Canon]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] and the [[Jain Agamas|Agamas]] of the [[Jainism|Jains]], beside countless later grammars, lyrics, plays and epics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Prakrit |last=Woolner |first=Alfred C.|authorlink= |edition=2 (reprint) |year=1928 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |isbn=978-81-208-0189-9 |page= |pages=1–2 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontopr00woolrich |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each variety of Prakrit gradually became associated with a particular patron dynasty, and indeed particular religions, as well as with numerous regional literatures. Every one is today considered to constitute a distinct literary tradition within the history of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Suryaprajnapati Sutra.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Sūryaprajñaptisūtra, an astronomical work dating to the 3rd or 4th century BC, written in Jain Prakrit language (in [[Devanagari]] book script), {{circa|1500}} AD.]]

According to the dictionary of [[Monier Monier-Williams]] (1819–1899), the most frequent meanings of the  term ''{{IAST|prakṛta}}'', from which the word "prakrit" is derived, are "original, natural, normal" and the term is derived from ''{{IAST|prakṛti}}'', "making or placing before or at first, the original or natural form or condition of anything, original or primary substance". In linguistic terms, this is used in contrast with ''{{IAST|saṃskṛta}}'', "refined".

==Dramatic Prakrits==
[[File:Mathura Lion Capital Detail.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Pillar capital]] with [[addorsed]] lions and Prakrit inscriptions in the [[Kharosthi]] script,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[British Museum]]]]
Dramatic Prakrits were those that were devised specifically for use in dramas and other literature.  Whenever dialogue was written in a Prakrit, the reader would also be provided with a Sanskrit translation.  None of these Prakrits came into being as vernaculars, but some ended up being used as such when Sanskrit fell out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Woolner, pg. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "[[Dramatic Prakrit]]s" often refers to three most prominent of them: [[Shauraseni language|Shauraseni]], [[Magadhi Prakrit]], and [[Maharashtri Prakrit]]. However, there were a slew of other less commonly used Prakrits that also fall into this category.  These include Pracya, Bahliki, Daksinatya, Sakari, Candali, Sabari, Abhiri, Dramili, and Odri.  There was a strict structure to the use of these different Prakrits in dramas.  Characters each spoke a different Prakrit based on their role and background; for example, Dramili was the language of "forest-dwellers", Sauraseni was spoken by "the heroine and her female friends", and Avanti was spoken by "cheats and rogues".&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, pg. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Maharashtri Prakrit, the ancestor of modern [[Marathi language|Marathi]], is a particularly interesting case. Maharashtri was often used for poetry and as such, diverged from proper Sanskrit grammar mainly to fit the language to the meter of different styles of poetry.  The new grammar stuck, which led to the unique flexibility of vowels lengths – amongst other anomalies – in Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;Deshpande, pg. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual Prakrits appear in the margins of the Prakritic world: [[Elu]] in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Gāndhārī language|Gāndhārī Prakrit]] in [[Gandhara]] and [[Central Asia]] both have unusual phonological and grammatical changes not found in other Prakrits.

[[Developed country|Industrialized]] and [[developing country|developing countries]] have distinctly different rates of [[teenage pregnancy]]. In developed regions, such as United States, Canada, [[Western Europe]], Australia, and  New Zealand, teen [[parents]] tend to be [[marriage|unmarried]] and [[Adolescence|adolescent]] pregnancy is seen as a [[social issue]].

By contrast, teenage parents in developing regions such as [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Pacific Islands]] (in some civilizations) are often married, and their [[pregnancy]] may be welcomed by [[family]] and [[society]]. However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with [[malnutrition]] and poor [[health care]] to cause medical problems. A report by [[Save the Children]] found that, annually, 13 million children are born to women under age 20 worldwide. More than 90% of these births occur to women living in [[developing countries]]. [[Complications of pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] are the leading cause of [[death|mortality]] among women between the ages of 15 and 19 in such areas, as they are the leading cause of mortality among older women.

The age of the mother is determined by the easily verified date when the pregnancy ''ends'', not by the estimated date of ''[[Fertilisation|conception]]''.&lt;ref name=Kost&gt;{{cite journal

| quote = Pregnancies are the sum of births, abortions and miscarriages. Please note that in these tables, “age” refers to the woman’s age when the pregnancy ended. Consequently, actual numbers of pregnancies that occurred among teenagers are higher than those reported here, because most of the women who conceived at age 19 had their births or abortions after they turned 20 and, thus, were not counted as teenagers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the statistics do not include women who first became pregnant before their 20th birthdays, if those pregnancies did not end until on or after their 20th birthdays.&lt;ref name=Kost /&gt;

==Rates by continent==

===Africa===
[[File:Adolescent Fertility and Poverty in Africa.jpg|thumb|Adolescent fertility correlates strongly with poverty in African nations.]]
The highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world — 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 years — is in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Treffers P.E. | year = 2003 | title = Teenage pregnancy, a worldwide problem | pmid=14669537 | journal = Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde | volume = 147 | issue = 47| pages = 2320–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in [[Africa]], in general, get [[marriage|married]] at much earlier ages than women elsewhere — leading to earlier [[pregnancy|pregnancies]]. In [[Nigeria]], according to the Health and Demographic Survey in 1992, 47% of women aged 20–24 were married before 15 and 87% before 18. 53% of those surveyed also had given birth to a child before the age of 18.&lt;ref name="subsahara"&gt;Locoh, Therese.

A [[Save the Children]] report identified 10 countries where motherhood carried the most risks for young women and their [[baby|babies]]. Of these, 9 were in sub-Saharan Africa, and Niger, [[Liberia]], and [[Mali]] were the nations where girls were the most at-risk. In the 10 highest-risk nations, more than one in six teenage girls between the ages of 15 to 19 gave birth annually, and nearly one in seven babies born to these teenagers [[infant mortality|died before the age of one year]].&lt;ref name="savethechildren"&gt;[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7449/1152-a Pregnancy and childbirth are leading causes of death in teenage girls in developing countries]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[premarital sex]] is uncommon, but early [[marriage]] sometimes means adolescent pregnancy. The rate of early marriage is higher in [[rural]] regions than it is in [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas. [[Total Fertility Rate|Fertility rate]]s in South Asia range from 71 to 119 births   a trend towards increasing age at marriage for both [[sex]]es. In [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]], although the occurrence of [[sexual intercourse]] before marriage has risen, rates of adolescent childbearing are low at 4 to 8 per 1000. The rate of early marriage and pregnancy has decreased sharply in [[Indonesia]]; however, it remains high in comparison to the rest of [[Asia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Surveys from [[Thailand]] have found that a significant minority of unmarried adolescents are [[Human sexual behavior|sexually active]]. Although premarital sex is considered [[Normal (behavior)|normal behavior]] for males, particularly with [[prostitute]]s, it is not always regarded as such for females. Most Thai youth reported that their first sexual experience, whether within or outside of marriage, was without contraception. The adolescent fertility rate in Thailand is relatively high at 60 per 1000. 25% of women admitted to [[hospital]]s in Thailand for complications of induced abortion are [[student]]s. The [[Politics of Thailand|Thai government]] has undertaken measures to inform the nation's youth about the prevention of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and unplanned [[pregnancy]].

According to the [[World Health Organization]], in several Asian countries including [[Bangladesh]] and Indonesia, a large proportion (26-37%) of [[death]]s among female adolescents can be attributed to [[Maternal death|maternal causes]].&lt;ref name="escap"&gt;Mehta, Suman, Groenen, Riet, &amp; Roque, Francisco.

The overall trend in [[Europe]] since 1970 has been a decrease in the [[total fertility rate]], an increase in the age at which women experience their first birth, and a decrease in the number of births among teenagers.

The rates of teenage pregnancy may vary widely within a country. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the rate of adolescent pregnancy in 2002 was as high as 100.4 per 1000 among young women living in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], and as low as 20.2 per 1000 among residents in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] [[Local government|local authority]] area of [[Rutland]]. In Italy, the teenage birth rate in [[Central Italy|central regions]] is only 3.3 per 1,000, but, in the [[Mezzogiorno]] it is 10.0 per 1000.

Teenage birth is often associated with economic and social issues: such as alcohol and drug misuse and, across 13 nations in the [[European Union]], women who gave birth as teenagers were twice as likely to be living in [[poverty]], compared with those who first gave birth when they were over 20.&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;UNICEF. (2001). {{cite web |url= http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/repcard3e.pdf |title= A League Table of Teenage Births in Rich Nations |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060629123124/http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/repcard3e.pdf |archivedate= 2006-06-29 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(888&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}.

====Bulgaria and Romania====
Romania and Bulgaria have some of the highest teenage birth rates in Europe. As of 2015, Bulgaria had a birth rate of 37/1.000 women aged 15-19, and Romania of 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT|title=Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19) - Data|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries also have very large [[Romani people|Romani]] populations, who have an occurrence of teenage pregnancies well above the local average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdgr.undp.sk/DOCUMENTS/MDG_Slovenia_GB_6.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/21599-silence-makes-babies.html|title=Silence Makes Babies - Transitions Online|first=|last=http://www.tol.org|website=www.tol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9EGllb7aoGoC&amp;pg=PA34 The Politics of Gender: A Survey] By Yoke-Lian Lee&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the number of teenage mothers is declining in Bulgaria.

====Netherlands====
The [[Netherlands]] has a low rate of births and abortions among teenagers (5 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002&lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt;). Compared with countries with higher teenage birth rates, the Dutch have a higher average age at first intercourse and increased levels of contraceptive use (including the "double Dutch" method of using both a [[hormonal contraception]] method and a [[condom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}).

====Nordic countries====
[[Nordic countries]], such as Denmark and Sweden, also have low rates of teenage birth (both have 7 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002&lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt;). However, Norway's birth rate is slightly higher (11 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002&lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt;) and [[Iceland]] has a birth rate of 19 per 1,000 women aged 15–19 &lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt; (nearly the same as the UK). These countries have higher abortion rates than the [[Netherlands]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====Italy, Spain and Portugal====
In some countries, such as Italy and Spain, the rate of adolescent pregnancy is low (6 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002 in both countries).&lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt; These two countries also have low abortion rates (lower than Sweden and the other [[Nordic countries]])&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2001"/&gt; and their teenage pregnancy rates are among the lowest in Europe. However, [[Portugal]], has a relatively high rate of teenage pregnancy (17 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002).&lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom}}
The [[UK]] has one of the highest teenage birth rates in Europe with a rate of 26.4 teenage births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2006, down from 27.9 births in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Social Trends 38 Chapter 2 pp 23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK]] also has a higher rate of [[abortion]] than most European countries. Of young Britons reported engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] whilst in their teens, 80% said they did not use a form of [[contraception]] (Citation needed), although a half of those under 16, and one-third of those between 16 and 19, said they did not use a form of [[contraception]] during their first encounter (Citation needed). 10% of British teen mothers are married.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=7522&amp;More=Y Census 2001 People aged 16-29]" ''Office For National Statistics''&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent pregnancy is viewed as a matter of concern by both the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British government]] and the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]].

===The Americas===

====Canada====
The [[Canada|Canadian]] teenage birth rate in 2002 was 16 per 1000 &lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt; and the teenage pregnancy rate was 33.9. According to data from [[Statistics Canada]], the Canadian teenage pregnancy rate has trended towards a steady decline for both younger (15-17) and older (18-19) teens in the period between 1992-2002.&lt;ref name="teenpregna"&gt;Dryburgh, H. (2002). Teenage pregnancy. Health Reports, 12 (1), 9-18; Statistics Canada . (2005). Health Indicators, 2005, 2. Retrieved from [http://www.sexualityandu.ca/teachers/data-6.aspx Facts and Statistics: Sexual Health and Canadian Youth - Teen Pregnancy Rates]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's highest teen pregnancy rates occur in small towns located in rural parts of peninsular [[Ontario]]. [[Alberta]] and [[Quebec]] have high teen pregnancy rates as well.

====Colombia====

In 2016, the [[Minister of Health and Social Protection of Colombia]], [[Alejandro Gaviria Uribe]] announced that "teenage pregnancy decreased by two percentage points breaking the growing tendency that had been seen since the nineties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/disminuye-numero-de-embarazos-adolescentes-colombia-articulo-653537|title=Disminuye número de embarazos adolescentes en Colombia - ELESPECTADOR.COM|date=7 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{See also|Teenage pregnancy in the United States}}

In 2013, the teenage birth rate in the United States reached a historic low: 26.6 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19.&lt;ref name="Historic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/reproductive-health/teen-pregnancy/trends.html |title=Trends in Teen Pregnancy and Childbearing
 |date=August 15, 2014 |publisher=[[Department of Health and Human Services]] |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than three-quarters of these births are to adult women aged 18 or 19.&lt;ref name="Historic"/&gt;  In 2005 in the U.S., the majority (57%) of teen pregnancies resulted in a live birth, 27% ended in an induced abortion, and 16% in a fetal loss.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The U.S. teen birth rate was 53 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002,&lt;ref name="globalis"/&gt; the highest in the developed world.&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt; If all pregnancies, including those that end in abortion or miscarriage, are taken into account, the total rate in 2000 was 75.4 pregnancies per 1,000 girls. Nevada and the District of Columbia have the highest teen pregnancy rates in the U.S., while North Dakota has the lowest.&lt;ref name="guttermacher"/&gt; Over 80% of teenage pregnancies in the U.S. are [[unintended pregnancy|unintended]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Contraception |date=September 2008 | title = The Potential of Long-acting Reversible Contraception to Decrease Unintended Pregnancy |author1=J.

However, the trend is decreasing: in 1990, the birth rate was 61.8, and the pregnancy rate 116.9 per thousand. This decline has manifested across all [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s, although teenagers of [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] [[Kinship and descent|descent]] retain a higher rate, in comparison to that of [[European-American]]s and [[Asian-American]]s. The [[Guttmacher Institute]] attributed about 25% of the decline to [[Sexual abstinence|abstinence]] and 75% to the effective use of [[contraception|contraceptives]].&lt;ref name="guttermacher"&gt;Wind, Rebecca. The Guttmacher Institute. (February 19, 2004). "[http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2004/02/19/index.html U.S. Teenage Pregnancy Rate Drops For 10th Straight Year]." Retrieved July 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the United States teen pregnancy is often brought up in political discourse. The goal to limit teen pregnancy is shared by Republicans and Democrats, though avenues of reduction are usually different. Many Democrats cite teen pregnancy as proof of the continuing need for access to birth control and sexual education, while Republicans often cite a need for returning to conservative values, often including abstinence.

An inverse correlation has been noted between teen pregnancy rates and the quality of education in a state. A positive correlation, albeit weak, appears between a city's teen pregnancy rate and its average summer night temperature, especially in the Southern U.S. (Savageau, compiler, 1993–1995).

=== World Development Indicator ===
The birth rate for women aged 15–19 is one of the [[World Bank]]'s [[World Development Indicators]]. The data for most countries and a variety of groupings (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa or OECD members) are published regularly, and can be viewed or downloaded from a [[United Nations]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=WDI&amp;f=Indicator_Code%3ASP.ADO.TFRT|title=Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19)|date=|website=United Nations Data Retrieval System|publisher=United Nations|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Process art''' is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'' ([[work of art]]/[[found object]]), is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, patterning, and moreover the initiation of actions and proceedings.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing'' and how actions can be defined as an actual work of art; seeing the art as pure human expression. Process art often [[logical consequence|entails]] an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Movement==
Process art has been entitled as a creative movement in the US and Europe in the mid-1960s. It has roots in Performance Art, the [[Dada]] movement and, more traditionally, the drip paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]], and in its employment of [[serendipity]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, [[improvisation]], and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The ephemeral nature and insubstantiality of materials was often showcased and highlighted, as is demonstrated in this review of [[William Basinski]] and his work titled ''The Disintegration Loops I-IV'' by Joe Tangari for [[Pitchfork Media]]: &lt;blockquote&gt; You are slowly being destroyed. It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying.

It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinski's ''Disintegration Loops'' are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, [[William Basinski]] set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinski's old music.

In essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the result is the most amazing piece of processmusic I've ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/ (accessed: Saturday, February 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The process art movement and the [[environmental art]] movement are directly related:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists engage the primacy of organic systems, using perishable, insubstantial, and transitory materials such as dead rabbits, steam, fat, ice, cereal, sawdust, and grass. The materials are often left exposed to natural forces: gravity, time, weather, temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://www.artandculture.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/movement?id=1037  (accessed:  Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In process art, as in the [[Arte Povera]] movement, nature itself is lauded as art; the symbolization and representation of nature, often rejected.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Antecedent===
The process art movement has precedent in indigenous rites, shamanic and religious rituals, cultural forms such as [[sandpainting]], [[sun dance]], and the [[tea ceremony]] are fundamentally related pursuits.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Aspects of the process of the construction of a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] sand [[mandala]] (a [[subset]] of sandpainting) of [[Medicine Buddha]] by monks from [[Namgyal Monastery]] in Ithaca, New York that began February 26, 2001 and concluded March 21, 2001 has been captured and web-exhibited&lt;ref&gt;Source:  http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/construction.htm (accessed: Monday, December 22, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; by the Ackland's Yager Gallery of Asian Art. The dissolution of the mandala was on June 8, 2001.

===Relationship to other disciplines and movements===
Process art shares fundamental features with a number of other fields, including the [[Expressive therapies | expressive therapies]] and [[Transformative arts| transformative arts]], both of which pivot around how the creative process of engaging in artistic activities can precipitate personal [[Introspection | insight]], individual healing, and [[Social change | social change]], independent of the perceived value attributed to the obejct of creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Additionally, process art is integral to [[Arts-based research| arts-based research]], which uses creative process and artistic expression to investigate subjects that resist description or representation through other modes of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, T. and Eisner, E., Arts Based Research. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA: Sage, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; McNiff, S., Art-Based Research. London, UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">The Round Table Family organisation is a group of social networking and charitable clubs that together form a worldwide movement of tens of thousands of people. 

The clubs are:

&lt;big&gt;[[Round_Table_(club)|Round Table]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Founded in 1927. Open to men aged 18-45.

&lt;big&gt;[[Ladies Circle]]
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Founded in 1932. Open to women aged 18-45.&lt;br /&gt;
Ladies Circle is a social networking organisation for young women aged between 18 and 45, founded in 1932. It aims to promote friendship through social contact at local, national and international level and to be of service to the community. For many years Circlers were the wives or partners of members of Round Table, but in 1993 the rules were changed and Ladies' Circle is now open to any woman in the age range 18 - 45, and whilst Ladies' Circle work very closely with Round Table on many issues, both business and social, they are a totally independent organisation. The club is affiliated to [http://www.ladiescircleinternational.org/ Ladies Circle International].

&lt;big&gt;[[41 Club]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Founded in 1945. Open to past Round Tablers over 40.&lt;br /&gt;
The full name is "The Association of Ex-Round Tablers’ Clubs".
&lt;br /&gt; 41 Club specialises in continuing the friendships made in Round Table. The philosophy of the club is very similar to that of Round Table, but it is often less ‘active’ and in many cases clubs meet less often. The Club's main purpose is to support Round Table and, if possible, participate in local community service initiatives or charity work. However the ‘continued friendship’ and ‘fellowship’ aspect is of great importance. Most clubs meet monthly, often in a public house, golf club or restaurant. Meetings are usually semi-formal with either an activity or a speaker to entertain. Lifelong friendships are often made in 41 Club. To join 41 Club it is a requirement to have been a member of Round Table.
41 Club is affiliated to [http://www.41international.net/ 41 International].

&lt;big&gt;[[Tangent (club)|Tangent]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Founded 1953. Open to women over 45.&lt;br /&gt;
The National Association of Tangent Clubs is an organisation for women, mainly aged over 45, with a focus on making friends and enjoying a programme of interesting and fun activities, eating out, theatre, walks as well as sometimes supporting local and national causes through fundraising events. The UK club has links with Tangent Clubs across the world and are part of [http://www.tangentclubinternational.org/ Tangent Club International]. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;big&gt;Related clubs&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[[Table Plus (Club)|Table Plus]]. &lt;br /&gt;
Part of the 41 Club. Open to men aged 45-60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Tangle. &lt;br /&gt;
Part of Tangent. Open to women aged 45-60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{Personality disorders sidebar}}
'''Sadistic personality disorder''' is a [[personality disorder]] involving [[:wikt:sadism|sadism]] which appeared in an appendix of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-III-R]]).&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;Hucker, Stephen J. [https://archive.is/20130101004151/http://www.forensicpsychiatry.ca/paraphilia/sadPD.htm Sadistic Personality Disorder]&lt;/ref&gt; The later versions of the DSM ([[DSM-IV]], [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[DSM-5]]) do not include it.

The words ''sadism'' and ''sadist'' are derived from [[Marquis de Sade]].

== Definition ==
Sadism involves deriving pleasure through themselves or others undergoing discomfort or pain. The [[opponent-process theory]] explains the way in which individuals not only display, but also enjoy committing sadistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reidy D.E. |author2=Zeichner A. |author3=Seibert L.A. | year = 2011 | title = Unprovoked aggression: Effects of psychopathic traits and sadism | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 75–100 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=please explain how the opponent process theory explains this. |date=May 2013 }} Individuals possessing sadistic personalities tend to display recurrent aggression and cruel behavior.&lt;ref name="j.paid.2009.06.020"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 |title=Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency | volume=47 | journal=Personality and Individual Differences |pages=734–739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buckels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckels|first=E.

[[Theodore Millon]] claimed there were four subtypes of sadism, which he termed Enforcing sadism, Explosive sadism, Spineless sadism, and Tyrannical sadism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore Millon|author2=Carrie M.

== Comorbidity with other personality disorders ==
Sadistic personality disorder has been found to occur frequently in unison with other personality disorders. Studies have also found that sadistic personality disorder is the personality disorder with the highest level of [[comorbidity]] to other types of psychopathological disorders.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt; In contrast, sadism has also been found in patients who do not display any or other forms of [[psychopath]]ic disorders.&lt;ref name="j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x | volume=79 | title=Unprovoked Aggression: Effects of Psychopathic Traits and Sadism | journal=Journal of Personality | pages=75–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One personality disorder that is often found to occur alongside sadistic personality disorder is [[conduct disorder]], not an adult disorder but one of childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt;  Studies have found other types of illnesses, such as [[alcoholism]], to have a high rate of comorbidity with sadistic personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016517819390077T|title= Prevalence and characteristics of sadistic personality disorder in an outpatient veterans population| doi=10.1016/0165-1781(93)90077-T | volume=48|journal=Psychiatry Research|pages=267–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have had some level of difficulty distinguishing sadistic personality disorder from other forms of personality disorders due to its high level of comorbidity with other disorders.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt;

==Removal from the DSM==
Numerous theorists and clinicians introduced sadistic personality disorder to the DSM in 1987 and it was placed in the DSM-III-R as a way to facilitate further systematic clinical study and research. It was proposed to be included because of adults who possessed sadistic personality traits but were not being labeled, even though their victims were being labeled with a [[self-defeating personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology"&gt;Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology, p. 744&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists like Theodore Millon wanted to generate further study on SPD, and so proposed it to the DSM-IV Personality Disorder Work Group, who rejected it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV and Beyond, p. 482&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-clinical sadism in personality psychology ==

There is renewed interest in studying sadism as a [[personality trait]].&lt;ref name = "Buckels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Meara|first=A|author2=Davies, J |author3= Hammond, S. |title=The psychometric properties and utility of the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale (SSIS)|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=523–531|doi=10.1037/a0022400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadism joins with subclinical psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism to form the so-called "[[dark tetrad]]" of personality.&lt;ref name = "Buckels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chabrol H.|author2=Van Leeuwen, N.|author3=Rodgers, R.|author4=Sejourne, N.|year=2009|title=Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=47|issue=7|pages=734–739|lastauthoramp=y|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223672152_Contributions_of_psychopathic_narcissistic_Machiavellian_and_sadistic_personality_traits_to_juvenile_delinquency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soyot''' people live mainly in the Oka region in the [[Okinsky District]] in the [[Republic of Buryatia]], [[Russia]]. According to the 2010 [[census]], there were 3,608 Soyots in [[Russia]]. Their extinct language was of a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] type and basically similar to the [[Tuvans]]. Their language has been [[language revival|reconstructed]] and a textbook has been published.  The language is currently taught in some schools in Oka. The Oka River, the largest river flowing down from the Western Sayans into the Angara is called the Ok-hem meaning "an arrow-river" by the Soyots of the Oka River basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.baikal-center.ru/en/books/element.php?ID=96848 |title=Okinsky district |work=Tourist Buryatia |year=2009 |pages= 45–47 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They live dispersed among the [[Buryats]] and now speak the [[Buryat language]].

==Historical context==
According to Larisa R. Pavlinskaya, a Russian ethnographer based in [[Saint Petersburg | St. Petersburg]], Russia, "The ancestors of the Soyots (and of the closely related [[Tofalar|Tofa]], [[Tozhu Tuvans|Tozhu]], and [[Dukha people|Dukha]]) were proto-Samoyedic hunter-gatherers who arrived in the Eastern Sayan region from Western Siberia at the end of the third millennium BC and the beginning of the second millennium BC."&lt;ref name="Pavlinskaya_2003"&gt;{{citation |title=Reindeer Herding in the Eastern Sayan- A Story of the Soyot |url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/russia/reindeer-herding-eastern-sayan-story-soyot |first=Larisa R. |last=Pavlinskaya |journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly |volume=27 |number=1 |date=Spring 2003 |series=The Troubled Taiga |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1726 Tunka Valley Buryats spoke of a people who self-identified as Soyot but who the Buryats called Kosogol Urianghai. At that time the Soyot herded reindeer on the upper [[Irkut River]], a river in the [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryat Republic]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast]] of [[Russia]] to [[Khövsgöl Nuur|Lake Khövsgöl]], [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="Taiga-Sayan_2012"&gt;{{cite conference |title=On the Phonology and Morphology of the Taiga-Sayan Tuha Language |conference=The 4th International Turkish Research Symposium |location=Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey |date= May 2012 |first=Tomas |last=Eriksonas |url=https://www.academia.edu/3162586/On_the_Phonology_and_Morphology_of_the_Taiga-Sayan_Tuha_Language |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- near [[Irkutsk|Fort Irkutsk]]--&gt; Approximately 350–400 years ago, the Soyot people moved to [[Buryatia]] from the area of [[Khovsgol Lake]].&lt;ref name="Khabtagaeva_2009" /&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name="Rassadin_2005"&gt;{{citation |url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/soiot.shtml |title=The Soyot language |series=Endangered languages of indigenous peoples of Siberia |others=O.A.

In 1940 the Okinsky Region was designated as an aimag and officially recognized all residents of the Okinsky region as Buryat. Soyots lost their official identity as an ethnic group until 2000.&lt;ref name="Pavlinskaya_2003" /&gt;

==Reindeer herding==
Bernhard Eduardovich Petri, (1884-1937) Professor of ethnology at Irkutsk University, member of the British Anthropological Society, the USSR State Academy of the History of Material Culture, and full member of the [[American Anthropological Association]] undertook research with the indigenous peoples of Siberia.  In 1926 Petri led the first anthropological expedition into the Soyot reindeer-herding region.&lt;ref name="Pavlinskaya_2003" /&gt; Petri described a difficult period in Russian history claiming that Soyot reindeer herding was a "dying branch of the economy."&lt;ref name="Pavlinskaya_2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petri_1927"&gt;{{citation |last=Petri |first=B.E. |year=1927 |title=Anthropological Research into the Small-Numbered Peoples of the Eastern [[Sayan Mountains]] |type=Preliminary Findings |location=Irkutsk}}&lt;/ref&gt; "After the civil war, Petri was involved in "planning changes in the economic lives of minority peoples of the greater Altai-Sayan and Buryatia regions, including the nomadic reindeer-breeding Tungus (Evenki) and the Soyot and Tofalar."&lt;ref name="Sirinaa_2003" /&gt; He was wrongfully accused of "espionage for the British and German intelligence services, and of anti-Soviet activity, specifically establishing contacts with nationalistic representatives of the Buryat people, so-called Pan-Mongols" and executed in Irkutsk in 1937.&lt;ref name="Sirinaa_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bernard Eduardovich Petri: Forgotten pages in Siberian ethnography|journal=Anthropology &amp; Archeology of Eurasia |location=Moscow |volume=42 |issue=2 |year=2003 |doi=10.2753/AAE1061-1959420271 |first=A. |last=Sirinaa |pages=71–93 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavlinskaya argued that "later research and data collected from Soyot elders show that the herding tradition easily overcame the period's difficulties and endured until the middle of the 20th century, when the government interfered."&lt;ref name="Pavlinskaya_2003" /&gt;

[[Sev'yan I. Vainshtein]]  (1926–2008), a Russian ethnographer, archaeologist, historian and explorer of Siberian and Central Asian peoples and professor at the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, undertook expeditions to study reindeer-herders including the Soyot and published a number of works on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Vainshtein |first=Sev'yan I. |year=1971 |title=The Problem of the Origins of Reindeer Herding in Eurasia, Part II: The Role of the Sayan Center in the Diffusion of Reindeer Herding in Eurasia |journal=Sovetskaya Etnografiya |volume=5 |pages= 37–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vainshtein argued that Sayan reindeer herding "is the oldest form of reindeer herding and is associated with the earliest domestication of the reindeer by the Samoyedic taiga population of the Sayan Mountains at the turn of the first millenium [sic] A.D...The Sayan region was apparently the origin of the economic and cultural complex of reindeer hunters-herdsmen that we now see among the various Evenki groups and the peoples of the Sayan area." The Sayan ethnic groups still live almost exclusively in the area of the Eastern Sayan mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/russia/evenki-reindeer-herding-history |title=Evenki Reindeer Herding: A History |accessdate=30 December 2014 |work=Cultural Survival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 reindeer peoples of Mongolia and Russia were working on collaborative efforts to rebuild reindeer-herding.&lt;ref name="Plumley_2000"&gt;{{citation |first=Daniel R. |last=Plumley |work=Totem Peoples Preservation Project, Cultural Survival Inc. |date=June 2000 |title=Requiem or Recovery: The 21st Century Fate of the Reindeer-Herding Peoples of Geographical Central Asia |location=Republic of Tuva |url=http://totempeople.hypermart.net/requiem.htm |accessdate=31 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119065908/http://totempeople.hypermart.net/requiem.htm |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumley suggested that the Soyot of Buryatia's Okinsky Region, the [[Tofalar]] of [[Irkutsk Oblast]], the [[Tozhu Tuvans]] of the [[Republic of Tuva]] in Russia, and the [[Dukha]] of Mongolia's [[Hovsgol Province]], who are "cultures of reindeer-habitat" in Central Asia may well "have traded, inter-married and related across the breadth and width of the Sayans."&lt;ref name="Plumley_2000" /&gt;  

{{quote|Though linguists may disagree on the nature of the differences between these peoples, the facts remain that their linguistic backgrounds are turkic in origin, that their ecological habitats and the reindeer they raised nomadically are essentially the same.  As the breadth of this region of the Sayans and into Hovsgol of Mongolia covers a distance of less than 800 kilometers – and the annual range territory of reindeer herds can be as much as several hundred kilometers in and of themselves – it is very possible that these people have traded, inter-married and related across the breadth and width of the Sayans – and that their languages and ancestry are all closely related to the old Tuvan language and possibly original heritage.|Plumley 2000}}

}}  During the period of [[collectivization in the Soviet Union]], enforced under Stalin between 1928 and 1940, the Soyot and other Siberian inhabitants were forced into a settled way of life with socialistic enterprises replacing reindeer husbandry. The Soyots were moved to Sorok, Khurga, Bokson and Orlik, the administrative center of Okinsky District. Many were moved to cattle-breeding farms and they switched to Buryat-style husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ansipra.npolar.no/english/Indexpages/Ethnic_groups.html#2 |series=Indigenous Peoples of the Russian North, Siberia and Far East|title=Ethnic groups |work=Arctic Network for the Support of the Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Arctic |location=Tromsø, Norway |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ossendowski's accounts of visiting the Soyots in the 1920s==
[[File:Yeniseirivermap.png|In 1920 Dr. Ossendowski traveled from Krasnoyarsk, on the Yenisei River through the land of the Soyot|thumb|left|300px]] Oka River is a tributary of the Angara River. In the early 1920s, Dr. [[Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski|Ferdinand Ossendowski]], a scientist and writer, traveled through the traditional lands of the Soyot during the [[Russian Revolution]] and published a book entitled ''Beasts, Men and Gods'' in which he described his experiences.&lt;ref name="Ossendowski_1922"&gt;{{cite book|title= Beasts, Men and Gods |year=1922 |others=Lewis Stanton Palen |first=Ferdinand |last=Ossendowski |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2067/2067-h/2067-h.htm |accessdate=29 December 2014}}via Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 Ossendowski narrowly escaped being arrested by the Red Army who surrounded his house in the Siberian town of Krasnoyarsk, on the shores of the River Yenisei. He fled into the forest and lived for a while in the taiga along the shores of the Yenisei River. He and his companions followed the Tuba and Amyl Rivers to the Sayan mountains, where Urianhai, the northern part of Mongolia, begins. Urianhai is on the head waters of the Yenisei.&lt;ref name="Ossendowski_1922" /&gt;

{{quote|After three days we crossed the northern ridge of the Sayan chain, passed the border river Algiak and, after this day, were abroad in the territory of Urianhai. This wonderful land, rich in most diverse forms of natural wealth, is inhabited by a branch of the Mongols, which is now only sixty thousand and which is gradually dying off, speaking a language quite different from any of the other dialects of this folk and holding as their life ideal the tenet of "Eternal Peace." Urianhai long ago became the scene of administrative attempts by Russians, Mongols and Chinese, all of whom claimed sovereignty over the region whose unfortunate inhabitants, the Soyots, had to pay tribute to all three of these overlords.|Ossendowski 1922}}

The Soyots helped Ossendowski and his companions escape. He appreciated their hospitality.

{{quote|The inhabitants of Urianhai, the Soyots, are proud of being the genuine Buddhists and of retaining the pure doctrine of holy Rama and the deep wisdom of Sakkia-Mouni. They are the eternal enemies of war and of the shedding of blood. Away back in the thirteenth century they preferred to move out from their native land and take refuge in the north rather than fight or become a part of the empire of the bloody conqueror Jenghiz Khan, who wanted to add to his forces these wonderful horsemen and skilled archers. Three times in their history they have thus trekked northward to avoid struggle and now no one can say that on the hands of the Soyots there has ever been seen human blood. With their love of peace they struggled against the evils of war. Even the severe Chinese administrators could not apply here in this country of peace the full measure of their implacable laws. In the same manner the Soyots conducted themselves when the Russian people, mad with blood and crime, brought this infection into their land. They avoided persistently meetings and encounters with the Red troops and Partisans, trekking off with their families and cattle southward into the distant principalities of Kemchik and Soldjak. The eastern branch of this stream of emigration passed through the valley of the Buret Hei, where we constantly outstrode groups of them with their cattle and herds.|Ossendowski 1922}}

While in Urianhai, Ossendowski met Ta Lama, Prince of Soldjak and High Priest of the Buddhist Temple whose wife had red eyes. After he healed her eyes, the Prince "ordered one of the Soyots to guide their party to the Kosogol" [[Khövsgöl Nuur|Lake Khövsgöl]]. This was near the [[Tannu-Ola mountains]].&lt;ref name="Ossendowski_1922" /&gt;

Their Soyot guide took them through the [[Ulaan Taiga]] and the [[Darkhad Valley]] where they met Soyot herdmen rapidly driving their cattle over the Darkhat plain toward the northwest into Orgarkha Ola. They communicated to us very unpleasant news. They were fleeing the Bolsheviki from the Irkutsk district who had crossed the Mongolian border and captured the Russian colony at Khathyl on the southern shore of Lake Kosogol and were continuing their advance.&lt;ref name="Ossendowski_1922" /&gt;

A Norwegian scientific expedition, led by Orjan Olsen, H. Printz, Anders K. Olsen, Fritz Jensen (Norway) and J. E. Gustschin (Russia) in the early 1910s provides information on the customs of these people before they were completely assimilated to the Buryats. The ethnographic data and photographs collected by these scientists were published by Olsen in the book: "Et primitivt folk de mongolske rennomader" (Cappeln, 1915). There is a Spanish edition: "Los soyotos, un pueblo primitivo. Nómadas mongoles pastores de renos" (Calpe, Madrid, 1921). With all its shortcomings (the book is flawed with the eurocentrism of its age), it is probably the best study of these isolated people before they adapted to the larger Buryat culture. It includes a short list of Soyot words, several dozen photographs and a fortunate preserved account of a Soyot shamanic tale of divination, along with a detailed account of both shamanic and lamaistic rituals among these people (both Buddhism and native animism syncretically coexisted at the time of the expedition).

==Rassadin and Soyot as an endangered language==
According to Valentin I. Rassadin, the Soyots spoke their own language fluently in the 1920s.(Rassadin 1996:10-22).&lt;ref name="Khabtagaeva_2009" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Many Soyot married into the larger culture, the Buryats. By 1996 the language was almost lost (Rassadin 1996:10-22).&lt;ref name="Khabtagaeva_2009" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

==Shamanism==

The precise style of [[List of French monarchs|French Sovereigns]] varied over the years. Currently, there is no French sovereign; three distinct traditions (the Legitimist, the Orleanist, and the Bonapartist) exist, each claiming different forms of title.

The three styles laid claim to by pretenders to the French throne are:

* [[Legitimist]]: "Most high, most potent and most excellent Prince, '''X''', [[By the grace of God|by the Grace of God]], King of [[France]] and of [[Navarre]], [[Most Christian Majesty]]." (''Très haut, très puissant et très excellent Prince, '''X''', par la grâce de Dieu, Roi de France et de Navarre, Roi Très-chrétien'')
* [[Orleanist]]: "'''X''', [[By the grace of God|by the Grace of God]] and by the constitutional law of the State, King of the French." ('''''X''', par la grâce de Dieu et par la loi constitutionnelle de l'État, Roi des Français'')
* [[Bonapartist]]: "'''X''', By the Grace of God and the Constitutions of the Republic, Emperor of the French." ('''''X''', par la grâce de Dieu et les Constitutions de la République, Empereur des Français.'')

==''Francorum Rex''==
The Latin term ''Francorum Rex'' was the official Latin title of the "King of the Franks" after the accession of the Carolingian Dynasty (sometimes taking the form of ''Rex Francorum''); this title was used in official documents until French replaced Latin as the formal language of legal documents, and remained used on coins until the 18th century. However, from as early as the 12th century, the form ''Franciae Rex'' ("King of France") was also used.

==Most Christian King==
This title ''Rex Christianissimus'', or ''Roi Très-chrétien'' owed its origins to the long, and distinctive, relationship between the Catholic Church and the Franks. France was the first modern state recognised by the Church, and was known as the 'Eldest Daughter of the Church'; Clovis, the King of the Franks, had been recognised by the Papacy as a protector of Rome's interests. Accordingly, this title was frequently accorded to the French Kings (although on a number of occasions Kings of other [[realm]]s would be addressed as such by the Church), and came into frequent use during the reign of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]; under his son, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], it became recognised as a hereditary and exclusive title of the Kings of France. [[Pope Julius II]], allied between 1510 and 1513 with [[Henry VIII of England]] against [[Louis XII of France]], considered transferring the title from the French monarch to the English monarch, drafting a Papal brief to this effect; however, it was never issued. French kings thus continued to use the title, in particular on diplomatic documents, less frequently in France itself or in everyday parlance.

==King of the French==
With the French Revolution came the writing of a Constitution for France. As part of the reforms, the monarch ceased to be an absolute ruler of hereditary lands deriving power from God; instead, he became a constitutional ruler ruling by the will of the French People and for the good of the French People. By a decree on 12 October 1789, the king's title was thus changed from 'By the Grace of God, King of France and Navarre' to 'By the Grace of God and by the constitutional law of the State, King of the French' (French:  ''Par la grâce de Dieu et par la loi constitutionnelle de l'État, Roi des Français''), becoming official with the institution of the new constitution on 1 October 1791. The monarchy was abolished a year later, and the Bourbon supporters supported Louis XVI, and then Louis XVII and Louis XVIII, as King of France and Navarre rather than King of the French, under which title the Bourbons were restored in 1815. However, the constitutional monarchy was revived in 1830, with the Bourbon deposition. Although the Orleanist constitutional monarchy, the so-called 'July Monarchy', was abolished in 1848, the heirs of Louis-Philippe continued to claim the title and legacy.

==Emperor of the French==
The Bonapartist legacy, the title was instituted in 1804 by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had himself crowned Emperor. It is the title to which the Bonapartists and their supporters continue to lay claim.

==Distinct titles==
In addition to the titles above, the Kings of France at one point or another held other titles attached to the Crown.

===Brittany===
During the Middle Ages, the Kings of France considered that the Duchy of Brittany was feudally a part of their Kingdom of France (i.e. it was within the traditional borders of the realm, and the King of France was deemed to be overlord of the Duchy). In effect, however, the Duchy of Brittany was a largely independent sovereign state. It was recognized as independently sovereign and lying outside the Kingdom of France by [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]], an ally of [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany]]. Subsequent Kings of France sought to control Brittany in part because of the attempts of the King of England and the King of Spain to control the Duchy.

The independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany|Francis II of Brittany]]. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, [[Anne of Brittany|Anne]], but King [[Charles VIII of France]], determined to bring the territory under royal control. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] had her marriage annulled and then forced her to marry him in a series of actions that were acknowledged by the Pope. As a result, the Kingdom of  France and the Duchy of Brittany were placed in the personal union of their marriage, and the King of France also held the title of Duke of Brittany [[jure uxoris]]. During their marriage, the [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] prohibited [[Anne of Brittany]] from using the title Duchess of Brittany and imposed a Royal Governor from the House of Penthievre on the Duchy.

Legally, however, the Duchy remained separate from France proper; the two titles were linked only by the marriage of the King and Queen, and in 1498 when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] died childless, the title ''Duke of Brittany'' remained with Anne, rather than passing to the heir of France, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]]. [[Anne of Brittany]] returned to Brittany and began to re-establish an independent sovereign rule.

However, the new French King, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] married [[Anne of Brittany|Anne]] himself, and so the King of France was once more Duke of Brittany [[jure uxoris]]. Legally, Brittany still remained distinct, and its future remained dependent on the Ducal bloodline, now held by the House of [[Montfort of Brittany|Montfort]]. When Anne died, Brittany passed to her daughter and heiress, [[Claude of France|Claude]], rather than remaining with the King of France, her father.

[[Claude of France|Claude]] married the future King of France, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. By this marriage, and through the succession to the French crown, the King of France became Duke of Brittany [[jure uxoris]]  once more.

Claude's death in 1524 separated the Duchy from the crown once more, and (it would transpire) for the final time. Because Claude, like her mother, was sovereign Duchess, the title of 'Duke' did not remain with her husband, but instead passed to her son, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis III of Brittany]], who was also [[Dauphin of France]]. Legally, the Crown and Duchy were again separate, but the Duke was a child, and the Duchy had been governed as an integral part of France for years; the King had little trouble in maintaining royal control over the Duchy. Breton independence was effectively ended when in 1532 the Estates of Brittany proclaimed the perpetual union of Brittany with the French crown. Legally, the Duchy was part of France.

Francis III remained Duke of Brittany, but died without attaining the French crown in 1536. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was the first person to become both King of France and Duke of Brittany in his own right.   Any trace of Breton independence ended with the ascension of Henry, as [[Henry II of France]], to the French throne. The French Crown and Breton Duchy were now united by inheritance, and the merging of Brittany into France was thus completed. Notably, when [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (last direct male from [[Claude of France]]) died, Brittany passed as part of the Crown to the next heir of France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], rather than to Claude's most senior heirs (either [[Henry II, Duke of Lorraine]] or [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]]).

The title ''Duke of Brittany'' largely ceased to be used as a title of the King of France after the death of [[Claude of France]]. When it appeared the title was bestowed by the King of France to one of his direct descendants, and was in any event titular in status.

(See [[Duchy of Brittany]].)

===The Navarrese inheritance===
Navarre was twice united with France: from 1314&amp;ndash;1328 (effectively from 1284, upon the marriage of [[Philip IV of France]] to [[Joan I of Navarre]] ), and from 1589 to the present.

In the first case, the union was merely that of the two crowns: although the relevant Kings held both titles, the two Kingdoms were legally distinct, bound only by the descent of the Kings from the marriage between Joan and Philip. Accordingly, when their direct male descent died out, the two domains separated, France passing to Philip's nephew, [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], and Navarre being inherited by the granddaughter (and senior heiress) of Joan and Philip, [[Joan II of Navarre]]. However, Joan's possessions within France, inherited from her forebears the Counts of Champagne, did not pass with Navarre to Joan's heirs; instead, by treaty, Joan exchanged them for other lands within France, Philip then merging the Champenois inheritance into the French crown.

By chance, France and Navarre were united again in 1589, in the person of [[Henry IV of France]]: his mother, [[Joan III of Navarre]], had been the Queen of Navarre (and senior heiress of Joan II), his father, [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon]], had been the senior-most heir after the [[House of Valois]]. He thus became 'King of France and Navarre'. He was also, by inheritance, a holder of other significant lands within France: Béarn, Donnezan and Andorra, which were, although a part of the feudal boundaries of France, were independent sovereignties; and, under crown jurisdiction, the duchies of Albret, Beaumont, Vendôme, and the counties of Foix, Armagnac, Comminges, Bigorre and Marle.

By established tradition, lands within the legal borders of France (thus, Henry's duchies and counties) would merge into the crown when the holder became King; independent lordships, whether they were or were not part of France's feudal borders, would remain distinct possessions. Henry, however, refused to follow this tradition: having no legitimate sons to pass his possessions onto, and forced to fight to secure his rule over France, he wanted to ensure that if he died without legitimate children, in the ensuing division of his inheritance, his sister Catherine would receive all of their parental inheritance (if he allowed his French lands to merge with the crown before dying without legitimate children, the merged lands would go as part of the crown to the next heir to the throne, his cousin [[Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Henri, Prince of Condé]]). Accordingly, by letters patent of 13 April 1590, he declared that his personal estates would remain separate from the crown, and unsubjected to Salic law; in Letters of 21 December 1596, he further stated that "our ancient domain, in our kingdom of Navarre and sovereign land of Béarn and Donazan, low countries of Flanders, as well as our duchies, counties, viscounties, lands, lordships in this our kingdom, be and remained disunited, disjoint and separate of our house of France not to be in any way included or merged unless it is by us otherwise ordered, or unless God bestows on us the grace of having children we desire to provide thereto." The Paris Parlement refused to register these Letters, stating that French public law did not allow the division of a monarch's public and private possessions; instead, Henry had them registered at the Parlements of Bordeaux and Toulouse. Thus, from 1589–1607, the King of France and Navarre was also the Lord of Béarn, Duke of Albret and Vendôme, Count of Foix, etc.

These acts were reversed in 1606-1607: Henry had a legitimate son, and the death of his sister without issue had nullified any need to share the Navarrese inheritance. By an Edict of 1607, the original ruling of the Paris Parlement that lands within France were automatically merged in the Crown was upheld, and the King ceased to be Duke of Albret and Vendôme, Count of Foix, etc. Because Navarre, Béarn, Andorre and Donazan were independent of France, however, the King remained separately the King of Navarre, and Lord of the other domains.

In October 1620, the merging of the Navarrese inheritance into France was furthered, when Louis XIII on 20 October had an Edict passed in Pau by the Sovereign Council of Navarre, to prevent "the misfortunes and inconveniences which would occur if, failing a male heir to our Royal House, said countries passed by inheritance to Foreign princes, thereby opening a door to enter into our Kingdom.". By this "perpetual and irrevocable Edict", Navarre, Béarn, Andorra and Donezan were united and incorporated into the crown of France: although, as in the case of Scotland and England in 1707, whilst the Navarrese domains were politically and monarchically united with France, they retained their separate institutions - thus, they were bound irrevocably to France, but not merged into it. Unlike the British Act of Union, however, Navarre lost its independent judiciary, a fact the Navarrese resented for a long time afterwards. Nonetheless, in recognition of the separate nature of the Kingdom of Navarre (and the lordships of Béarn, Andorra and Donezan, which were considered attached to the Crown of Navarre), the Bourbon Kings of France customarily used the title 'King of France and Navarre'.

In the troubles of 1789, Navarre - being a distinct Kingdom - by order of the Navarrese estates refused to elect representatives to the Estates General of France, instead sending four representatives of the Estates to Versailles at the 'invitation' of the King; these representatives, arriving in July 1789, refused to sit with the National Assembly, and instead the Navarrese estates attempted to revoke the 1620 Union. This was denied, and by vote of the assembly the King's title was changed from 'King of France and Navarre' to 'King of the French' (thus denying the separation between the two Kingdoms, and emphasising the - presumed - unity of the French people). By the constitution of 1791, this change was effected, and the merging of Navarre was completed - it lost all of its separate institutions, and was denied any recognition as a state separate from the French nation. Although the last Bourbons entitled themselves 'King of France and Navarre' once more, it was a title only, 'Navarre' having ceased to exist as anything more than a name.

===Other examples===
The King of France was also at times ruler of lands outside France itself. If he would not or could not merge these lands into the French crown, and thus the French state, he would legally be sovereign of those lands separately to his role as French King. In such cases, the King's styles would be treated differently in the relevant territory. However, the title would be used only within the territory, or in documents relating to the territory; it would not be formally used as part of the King's title outside the relevant lands.

* The [[Dauphiné]]: the area had been ceded to the King of France by the last [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] de [[Viennois]] in 1349, on the condition that the land and title always be used by the King's eldest son; because the territory was legally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], rather than of [[France]], the Emperors legally forbade the region to be united with France. Nonetheless, when there was no [[Dauphin of France]], the King would be personally sovereign over the Dauphiné. His title there, when there was no Dauphin of France, was ''par la grâce de Dieu roi de France, dauphin de Viennois, comte de Valentinois et de Diois'' ("By the Grace of God King of France, Dauphin of Viennois, Count of Valentinois and of Diois").
* [[Provence]]: The territory was ceded to [[Louis XI]] by [[Margaret of Anjou]], the heiress, on 19 October 1480, and united to the crown in the following year; however, the Union was legally reversed by the 1486 [[Edict of Union]], which stipulated that Provence and its accompanying territories would "in no way be subordinated to the crown or realm of France". Accordingly, the King of France was titled in relation to Provence, ''par la grâce de Dieu roi de France, comte de Provence, Forcalquier et terres adjacentes'' ("By the Grace of God King of France, Count of Provence, [[Forcalquier]] and the lands adjacent.")
* Charles VIII used the title "King of [[Naples]] and [[Jerusalem]]" in relation to the [[Kingdom of Naples]]; his successor, [[Louis XII]], titled himself ''Ludovicus Dei Gratia Francorum Neapolis et Hierusalem Rex Dux Mediolani'' ("Louis, By the Grace of God King of the Franks, of Naples and of Jerusalem, Duke of Milan"). He abandoned it by the treaty of [[Blois]] of 22 Oct 1505.
* [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] used the title ''roi de France, duc de [[Milan]], comte d'Asti, seigneur de Gênes'' ("King of France, Duke of Milan, Count of [[Asti]], Lord of [[Genoa]]") in relation to the [[Duchy of Milan]].
* In January 1641, the King of France was chosen by the [[Catalans]] as 'Count of [[Barcelona]], [[Roussillon]], and [[Cerdagne]]'; accordingly, official documents relating to the area between 1641 and 1652 described the King as ''Dei gratia Galliarum et Navarrae Rex, comes Barcinonae, Rossilionis et Ceritaniae'' ("By the Grace of God King of the [[Gauls]] and [[Navarra]], Count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdagne"). Roussillon and Cerdagne were later ceded to France by [[Spain]], but were merged directly into the crown.

In addition, [[Alsace]] requested that the King take the title "Landgrave of Upper and Lower Alsace" in relation to the territory, but this did not happen.

The '''Swahili people''' (or '''Waswahili''') are an ethnic and cultural group inhabiting [[East Africa]]. Members primarily reside on the [[Swahili coast]], in an area encompassing the [[Zanzibar]] archipelago, littoral [[Kenya]], the [[Tanzania]] seaboard, and northern [[Mozambique]]. The name ''Swahili'' is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''Sawāhil'' سواحل, meaning ''coasts''. The Swahili speak the [[Swahili language]], which belongs to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branch of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] family.

==Definition==
{{see also|Shirazi people}}

The Swahili people originate from Bantu inhabitants of the coast of Southeast Africa, in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. These Bantu-speaking agriculturalists settled the coast at the outset of the first millennium. Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such at Mkokotoni and [[Dar es Salaam]] indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean trade at this early period, and trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity between the mid-8th and the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Horton (archaeologist)|Horton, Mark]] and Middleton, Tom. "The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community." (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Swahili claim a [[Shiraz]]i origin. This forms the basis of the [[Shirazi era]] origin myth that proliferated along the coast at the turn of the millennium. Modern scholarship has rejected the veracity of these claims. The most likely origin for the stories about the Shirazi is from Muslim inhabitants of the [[Lamu]] archipelago who moved south in the 10th and 11th centuries. They brought with them a coinage tradition and localized form of Islam. These Africans migrants seem to have developed a concept of Shirazi origin as they moved further southwards, near [[Malindi]] and [[Mombasa]], along the Mrima coast. The longstanding trade connections with the Persian gulf gave credence to these myths. In addition, because most Muslim societies are patrilineal, one can claim distant identities through paternal lines despite phenotypic and somatic evidence to the contrary. The so-called Shirazi tradition represents the arrival of Islam in these eras, one reason it has proven so long lasting. Extant mosques and coins demonstrate that the "Shirazi" were not Middle Eastern immigrants, but northern Swahili Muslims. They moved south, founding mosques, introducing coinage and elaborately carved inscriptions and mihrabs. They should be interpreted as indigenous African Muslims who played the politics of the Middle East to their advantage. Some still use this foundation myth a millennium later to assert their authority, even though the myth's context has long been forgotten. The Shirazi legend took on new importance in the 19th century, during the period of Omani domination. Claims of Shirazi ancestry were used to distance locals from Arab newcomers, since Persians are not viewed as Arabs but still have an exemplary Islamic pedigree. The emphasis that the Shirazi came very long ago and intermarried with indigenous locals ties this claim to the creation of convincing indigenous narratives about Swahili heritage without divorcing it from the ideals of being a maritime-centered culture.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Mark &amp; Middleton, John. "The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Society." (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 2000) Pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Mark &amp; Middleton, John.

(Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University press, 2016) Pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main theories about the origins of the [[Shirazi people|Shirazi]] subgroup of the Swahili people. One thesis based on [[oral tradition]] states that immigrants from the [[Shiraz]] region in southwestern [[Iran]] directly settled various mainland ports and islands on the eastern Africa seaboard beginning in the tenth century.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p379a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Derek Nurse|author2=Thomas Spear|author3=Thomas T.

[[Islam]] established its presence on the Southeast African coast from around the 9th century, when Bantu traders settling on the coast tapped into the Indian Ocean trade networks. The Swahili people follow the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] denomination of Islam.

Large numbers of Swahili undertake the Hajj and Umrah from Tanzania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tanzania Hajj pilgrims stranded|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7140977.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200911191155.html|title=Kenya: Mombasa Pilgrims Jam Airport for Hajj Trip|author=|date=19 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 April 2017|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hajinformation.com/display_news.php?id=1432|title=hajinformation.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Islamic dress such as the [[jilbab]] and [[thob]] are also popular among the Swahili. The Swahili also are known for their use of divination, which has adopted some syncretic features from underlying traditional indigenous beliefs, they believe in [[djinn]] and many men wear protective amulets with verses from the Qu'ran.

[[Divination]] is practiced through Qur'anic readings. Often the diviner incorporates verses from the [[Qur'an]] into treatments for certain diseases. On occasion, he instructs a patient to soak a piece of paper containing verses of the Qur'an in water. With this ink infused water, literally containing the word of Allah, the patient will then wash his body or drink it to cure himself of his affliction. It is only prophets and teachers of Islam who are permitted to become medicine men among the Swahili.&lt;ref name="millermintz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Swahili.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918162312/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Swahili.html |archivedate=2006-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
For centuries the Swahili depended greatly on trade from the Indian Ocean. The Swahili have played a vital role as middle man between southeast, central and South Africa, and the outside world. Trade contacts have been noted as early as 100&amp;nbsp;AD by early [[Roman Empire|Roman]] writers who visited the Southeast African coast in the 1st century.{{fact|date=March 2017}} Trade routes extended from [[Kenya]] to [[Tanzania]] into modern day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], along which goods were brought to the coasts and were sold to Arab, Indian, and Portuguese traders.

Many captives of the Portuguese sold in Zanzibar ended up in Brazil, which was then a Portuguese colony. Swahili fishermen of today still rely on the ocean to supply their primary source of income. Fish is sold to their inland neighbors in exchange for products of the interior.

Although most Swahili live with living standards far below that of  upper hierarchy of the  wealthiest nations, the Swahili are generally considered a relatively economically powerful group due to their history of trade. They are comparatively well-off; According to the United Nations, [[Zanzibar]] has a 25% higher per capita GDP than the rest of Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=Zanzibar&amp;d=SNAAMA&amp;f=grID:101;currID:USD;pcFlag:1;crID:836|title=UNdata - record view - Per capita GDP at current prices - US dollars|author=|date=|work=UN.org|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic influence has led to the continued spread of their culture and language throughout East Africa.

Previously thought by many scholars to be essentially of [[Arab]]ic or [[Persia]]n style and origin, archaeological, written, linguistic, and cultural evidence instead suggests a predominantly African genesis and sustainment.

Koedt wrote this feminist response during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. The goal of this response is to address both the 'myth of the [[vaginal orgasm]]', create awareness and education for women and men about female sexual pleasure, and to counter previous thought about the female orgasm. Koedt reflects in her writing, "It was [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s feelings about women's secondary and inferior relationship to men that formed the basis for his theories on female sexuality. Once having laid down the law about the nature of our sexuality, Freud not so strangely discovered a tremendous problem of [[frigidity]] in women. His recommended cure for a woman who was frigid was psychiatric care.
