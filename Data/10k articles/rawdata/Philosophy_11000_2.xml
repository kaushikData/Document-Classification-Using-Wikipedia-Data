'''1840 Hus''', provisional designation {{mp|1971 UY}}, is an [[asteroid]] from the outer regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 13 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 26 October 1971, by Czech astronomer [[Luboš Kohoutek]] at [[Bergedorf Observatory]] in Hamburg, Germany.&lt;ref name="MPC-Hus" /&gt; It was later named after 15th-century theologian [[Jan Hus]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Hus'' orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|outer]] main-belt at a distance of 2.9–3.0&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 12 months (1,820 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.02 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 2[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The first [[Astrometry|astrometric]] record of ''Hus'' is a [[precovery]] taken at [[Lowell Observatory]] in 1931. Its first used observation was another precovery taken at [[Goethe Link Observatory]] in 1953, extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 18 years prior to its official discovery observation. At both these observatories, the asteroid was also identified as {{mp|1931 TS|3}} and {{mp|1953 CG}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="MPC-Hus" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Rotation period and pole ===

In June 2006, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Hus'' was obtained from photometric observations taken at Chiro Observatory in Western Australia. It gave a [[rotation period]] of 4.780 hours with a brightness variation of 0.85 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2-]]}}).&lt;ref name="Clark-2010" /&gt; A second lightcurve was published in March 2016, gave a similar period of 4.749 hours, using sparse-in-time photometry data from the Lowell Photometric Database ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=n.a.]]}}).&lt;ref name="Durech-2016" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Hus'' measures 12.4 and 12.6 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.261 and 0.255, respectively.&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt; However, the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' (CALL) assumes a standard albedo for [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] asteroids of 0.057, rather than one for a [[S-type asteroid|stony]] body, as indicated by WISE/NEOWISE. CALL therefor calculates a twice as large diameter of 25.4 kilometers, as the lower the albedo, the larger the body's diameter for a constant [[absolute magnitude]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after Czech [[Jan Hus]] (1372–1415), a fifteenth century Bohemian theologian, rector of Charles University in Prague and forerunner of the [[protestant reformation]]. He was condemned to death by the [[Council of Constance]] and burned at the stake for his reformation ideas.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; Jan Hus is also known as ''[[John Huss]]'' in the English speaking world. The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] before November 1977 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 3757}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''''Amour-propre''''' (French, "[[self-love]]") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that [[wikt:esteem|esteem]] depends upon the opinion of others.  Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour de soi]]'', which also means "self-love", but which does not involve seeing oneself as others see one.  According to Rousseau, ''amour de soi'' is more primitive and is compatible with wholeness and happiness, while ''amour-propre'' is an unnatural form of self-love that arose only with the appearance of society and individuals' consequent ability to compare themselves with one another. Rousseau thought that ''amour-propre'' was subject to corruption, thereby causing vice and misery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/rousseau/ Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778)] ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''amour-propre'' predates Rousseau and is found in the writings of [[Blaise Pascal]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Pierre Nicole]], [[Jacques Abbadie]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/title/L%2527amour-propre L'amour-propre] at Everything2.com&lt;/ref&gt; For Pascal, Christianity was the only true remedy to this wretched state of man known as ''amour-propre'', which for him is a direct consequence of the [[Fall of Man|Fall]], and in his writings the term generally refers to man's desire to satisfy his own needs and desires.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Astral body''' is a [[subtle body]] posited by many philosophers, intermediate between the intelligent soul and the mental body, composed of a subtle material.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur A.Powell, ''stral Body and other Astral Phenomena'', The Theosophical Publishing House, London, England; Wheaton,Ill, U.S.A.; Adyar, Chennai, India, 1927, reprinted in 1954 and 1965, page 7, online July 2012 at http://hpb.narod.ru/AstralBodyByPowell-A.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The concept ultimately derives from the philosophy of [[Plato]]: it is related to an [[astral plane]], which consists of the [[Planets in astrology|planetary heavens of astrology]]. The term was adopted by nineteenth-century [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophists]] and [[Rosicrucianism|neo-Rosicrucians]].

The idea is rooted in common worldwide religious accounts of the [[afterlife]]&lt;ref&gt;Suki Miller, ''After Death: How People around the World Map the Journey after Death'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Soul (spirit)|soul's]] journey or "ascent" is described in such terms as "an ecstatic.., mystical or out-of body experience, wherein the spiritual traveller leaves the physical body and travels in his/her subtle body (or dreambody or astral body) into ‘higher’ realms".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Roger J. Woolger, ''Beyond Death: Transition and the Afterlife'', accessed online June 2008 at the website of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/PDF/RWoolgerTransition.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence "the "many kinds of 'heavens', 'hells', and purgatorial existences believed in by followers of innumerable religions" may also be understood as astral phenomena, as may the various "phenomena of the séance room".&lt;ref&gt;Powell, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of [[apparitional experience]] is therefore related, as is made explicit in Cicero's [[Dream of Scipio]].

The astral body is sometimes said to be visible as an [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of swirling colours.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Leadbeater, ''Man, Visible and Invisible''; Barbara Brennan, ''Hands of Light''; Dora Van Gelder Kunz, ''The Personal Aura''; Barbara Y. Martin, ''Change Your Aura, Change Your Life.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely linked today with [[out-of-body experience]]s or [[astral projection]]. Where this refers to a supposed movement around the real world, as in [[Sylvan Muldoon|Muldoon]] and Carrington's book ''The Projection of the Astral Body'', it conforms to [[Madame Blavatsky]]'s usage of the term. Elsewhere this latter is termed "etheric", while "astral" denotes an experience of dream-symbols, archetypes, memories, spiritual beings and visionary landscapes.

==History==
{{planes of existence}}

===The classical world===
[[Neoplatonism]] is a branch of classical philosophy that uses the works of [[Plato]] as a guide to understanding religion and the world. In [[the Myth of Er]], particularly, Plato rendered an account of the afterlife which involved a journey through seven planetary spheres and then eventual reincarnation. He taught that man was composed of mortal body, immortal reason and an intermediate "spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', trans. Desmond Lee, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoplatonists agreed as to the immortality of the rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] but disagreed as to whether man's "irrational soul" was immortal and celestial ("starry", hence astral) or whether it remained on earth and dissolved after death. The late Neoplatonist [[Proclus]], who is credited the first to speak of subtle "planes", posited two subtle bodies or "carriers" (''okhema'') intermediate between the rational soul and the [[physical body]]. These were; 1) the '''astral''' vehicle which was the immortal vehicle of the Soul and 2) the spiritual (''pneuma'') vehicle, aligned with the vital breath, which he considered mortal.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. R. Dodds|Dodds, E.R.]] ''Proclus: The Elements of Theology''. A revised text with translation, introduction, and commentary, 2nd edition 1963, Appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "astral" means "of the stars", thus the [[astral plane]], consisting of the [[celestial spheres]], is held to be an [[astrology|astrological]] phenomenon: "The whole of the astral portion of our earth and of the physical planets, together with the purely astral planets of our System, make up collectively the astral body of the Solar Logos". There are "seven types of astral matter" by means of which "psychic changes occur periodically".&lt;ref&gt;Powell, ''op. cit.'' page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Modern Era===
Such ideas greatly influenced mediaeval religious thought and are visible in the Renaissance medicine of [[Paracelsus]] and [[Servetus]]. In the [[Romanticism|romantic]] era, alongside the discovery of electromagnetism and the nervous system, there came a new interest in the spirit world. [[Franz Anton Mesmer]] spoke of the stars, animal magnetism and magnetic fluids. In 1801, the English occultist Francis Barrett wrote of a herb's "excellent astral and magnetic powers" - for herbalists had categorised herbs according to their supposed correspondence with the seven planetary influences.

In the mid-nineteenth century the French occultist [[Eliphas Levi]] wrote much of "the astral light", a factor he considered of key importance to magic, alongside the power of will and the doctrine of correspondences. He considered the astral light the medium of all light, energy and movement, describing it in terms that recall both Mesmer and the [[luminiferous ether]].&lt;ref&gt;Chic Cicero, Chic C, Sandra Tabatha Cicero ''The Essential Golden Dawn'', Llewellyn Worldwide, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levi's idea of the astral was to have much influence in the English-speaking world through the teachings of [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|The Golden Dawn]], but it was also taken up by [[Helena Blavatsky]] and discussed in the key work of Theosophy, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''. Levi seems to have been regarded by later Theosophists as the immediate source from which the term was adopted into their sevenfold schema of planes and bodies, though there was slight confusion as to the term's proper use.

===Theosophy===
Blavatsky frequently used the term "astral body" in connection with the Indian ''linga sharira'' which is one of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] of human life. However, she said that "there are various astral bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blavatsky|first1=Helena Petrovna|title=Collected Writings vol. XII|url=http://www.katinkahesselink.net/blavatsky/articles/v7/|publisher=(Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House), 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, she talked of one as being constituted by "the lower manas and volition, kama"&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Writings'' vol. V (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House), fn. 81&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Theosophical founder William Q. Judge "There are many names for the Astral Body. Here are a few: Linga Sarira, Sanskrit, meaning design body, and the best one of all; ethereal double; phantom; wraith; apparition; doppelganger; personal man; perispirit; irrational soul; animal soul; Bhuta; elementary; spook; devil; demon. Some of these apply only to the astral body when devoid of the corpus after death." &lt;ref&gt;William Judge, ''The Ocean of Theosophy'' 2nd Ed. TPH, 1893, Chapter 5, book online June 2008 at http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/ocean/oce-hp.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]] ([[Theosophical Society Adyar]]), equated it with Blavatsky's ''Kama'' (desire) principle and called it the ''Emotional body''. ''Astral body'', ''desire body'', and ''emotional body'' became synonymous, and this identification is found in later Theosophically-inspired thought. The astral body in later Theosophy is "the vehicle of feelings and emotions" through which "it is possible...to experience all varieties of desire". We have a "life in the astral body, whilst the physical body is wrapped in slumber". So the astral body "provides a simple explanation of the mechanism of many phenomena revealed by modern psycho-analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Powell, ''op. cit.'' Ch.1 ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; To this extent, then, the "astral body" is a reification of the dream-world self.

===Post-theosophists===
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|left|thumb|333px|Anonymous [[Flammarion engraving]] (1888).]]
According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucian]] writings the Desire body is made of desire stuff from which human beings form [[feeling]]s and [[emotion]]s. It is said to appear to [[clairvoyance|spiritual sight]] as an ovoid cloud extending from sixteen to twenty inches beyond the physical body. It has a number of whirling vortices ([[chakras]]) and from the main vortex, in the region of the [[liver]], there is a constant flow which radiates and returns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen02c.gif Currents in the desire body]&lt;/ref&gt; The desire body exhibits colors that vary in every person according to his or her temperament and mood.
However, the astral body (or "Soul body") must be evolved by means of the [[Philosopher's Stone|work of transmutation]] and will eventually be evolved by humanity as a whole. According to Heindel, the term "astral body" was employed by the mediaeval [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] because of the ability it conferred to traverse the "[[Astrology|starry]]" regions. The "Astral body" is regarded as the "[[Philosopher's Stone]]" or "Living Stone" of the alchemist, the "Wedding Garment" of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{Bibleref2|Matthew|22:1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Soul body" that [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] mentions in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/c.pl?book=1Cr&amp;chapter=15&amp;verse=44&amp;version=KJV#44 1Cor 15:44] (concordance Greek/[[Textus Receptus]]): "It is sown a soul body [Gr. "soma" – body and "psuchicon" – psu(y)che – soul; mistranslated "natural body"]; it is raised a spiritual body (...)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other popular accounts of post-Theosophical ideas appeared in the late 20th century. [[Barbara Brennan]]'s ''Hands of Light'' distinguishes between the emotional body and the astral body. She sees these as two distinct layers in the seven-layered "Human Energy Field". The emotional body pertains to the physical universe, the astral body to the astral world. [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] sometimes referred to the astral body and experiences on the astral plane. The Indian master [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] occasionally made use of a modified Theosophical terminology.

According to [[Samael Aun Weor]], who popularised Theosophical thought in Latin America, the astral body is the part of human soul related to emotions, represented by the sephirah [[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]] in the kabbalistic Tree of Life. However the common person only has a [[Kamarupa (Theosophy)|kamarupa]], body of desire or "lunar astral body," a body related to animal emotions, passions and desires, while the true human emotional vehicle is the solar astral body, which can be crystallised through Tantric sex. The solar astral body is the first mediator between the Cosmic [[Christ]], [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokmah]], and the individual human soul.&lt;ref name="sevenwords"&gt;{{Citation

===George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff===
 "What is called the ‘body-Kesdjan,’ or, as they themselves later began to name this being-part of theirs—of which, by the way, contemporary beings know only by hearsay—the ‘Astral-body.’"&lt;ref&gt;All and Everything: Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson, CH 16 The Relative Understanding of Time&lt;/ref&gt;
"At first on the planet itself the ‘second-being-body,’ i.e., the body-Kesdjan, together with the ‘third-being-body’ separate themselves from the ‘fundamental-planetary-body’ and, leaving this planetary body on the planet, rise both together to that sphere where those cosmic substances— from the localizations of which the body-Kesdjan of a being arises—have their place of concentration.
“And only there, at the end of a certain time, does the principal and final sacred Rascooarno occur to this two-natured arising, after which such a ‘higher being-part’ indeed becomes an independent individual with its own individual Reason."&lt;ref&gt;All and Everything: Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson, Ch 39 The Holy Planet Purgatory&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Gurdjieff]] it is an independent arising which is intermediate between the physical body and the Soul.

[[Gurdjieff]] refers to the astral body as the "body Kesdjan" or "vessel of the soul": it is of the sun and all planets, just as the physical body is of the earth. While it is not developed one is a "human being only in quotation marks", who cannot be considered in any meaningful sense to have a soul and who will "die like a dog".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Walker, ''A Study of Gurdjieff's Teachings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific reception==
There is no scientific evidence that an astral body exists. Psychologist [[Donovan Rawcliffe]], who assumes the existence of the astral body to be a myth, has written that "delusions and hallucinations due to [[acenesthesia]] or [[hysteria]] have undoubtedly helped to perpetuate the myth of the astral body."&lt;ref&gt;[[Donovan Rawcliffe|Rawcliffe, Donovan]]. (1988). ''Occult and Supernatural Phenomena''. Dover Publications. p. 123. {{ISBN|0-486-25551-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Augustine of Hippo''' ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|s|t|ᵻ|n}}; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430 AD)&lt;ref name="Wells 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=J. |authorlink=John C. Wells |title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-582-36467-7 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a  [[Roman Africans|Roman African]], early [[Christian theologian]] and [[philosopher]] from [[Numidia (Roman province)|Numidia]] whose writings influenced the development of [[Western Christianity]] and [[Western philosophy]]. He was the [[bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius]] in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in Western Christianity for his writings in the [[Patristics|Patristic Period]]. Among his most important works are ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]].''

According to his contemporary [[Jerome]], Augustine "established anew the ancient Faith".&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Jerome]] wrote to Augustine in 418: "You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith" (''conditor antiquae rursum fidei'').

After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustine the Theologian |last=TeSelle |first=Eugene |year=1970 |location=London |pages=347–349 |isbn= 978-0-223-97728-0}} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the [[Grace in Christianity|grace of Christ]] was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of [[original sin]] and made seminal contributions to the development of [[just war theory]]. When the [[Western Roman Empire]] began to disintegrate, Augustine imagined the Church as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]], distinct from the material Earthly City.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will |title=Caesar and Christ: a History of Roman Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 |publisher=MJF Books |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-56731-014-6 |authorlink=Will Durant|title-link=Ancient Rome }}&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview.

Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Christian Church, and the [[Anglican Communion]] and as a preeminent [[Doctor of the Church]]. He is also the patron of the [[Augustinians]]. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. Augustine is the [[patron saint]] of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name="KnoYrSaint"&gt;[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/library/saints/index.htm Know Your Patron Saint]. catholicapologetics.info&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the [[Protestant Reformation]] due to his teachings on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace]].&lt;ref name="Hägglund 2007 139–140"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hägglund| first=Bengt| title=Teologins historia| language=German|trans-title=History of Theology| others=Translated by Gene J.

[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102138.htm English version], [http://www.augustinus.it/latino/lettere/lettera_139_testo.htm Latin version]&lt;/ref&gt; to Ponticianus as "a country man of ours, insofar as being African,"&lt;ref name="Hollingworth2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Confess., VIII, 6, 14.

Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were [[liberti|freedmen]] of the ''[[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]]'' given full Roman citizenship by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in 212. Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge (2002) ''Saint Augustine'', Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern, p. 5, {{ISBN|0334028663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of [[Berbers|Berber]] origin, on the basis of her name,&lt;ref name="KP"&gt;Power, Kim (1999) "Family, Relatives", pp. 353–354 in ''Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia''.

At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now [[M'Daourouch]]), a small [[Numidia]]n city about {{convert|19|mi}} south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Andrew and Penkett, Pachomios (2004) ''Augustine and His World''. InterVarsity Press. Ch. 2. {{ISBN|9780830823567}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, ''The Confessions''. He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because he was hungry, but because "it was not permitted."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:4&lt;/ref&gt; His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus,&lt;ref name=EA&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', v. 2, p. 685. Danbury, Connecticut: Grolier, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7172-0129-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine went to [[Carthage]] to continue his education in [[rhetoric]]. It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression and sparking his interest in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4&lt;/ref&gt; Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]], much to his mother's despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Pope | first = Hugh | work =Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Saint Monica| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm | accessdate = 20 April 2012|quote= At Carthage Augustine had become a Manichaean and when on his return home he propounded certain heretical propositions she drove him away from her table, but a strange vision urged her to recall him.

The need to gain their acceptance forced inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, "Grant me [[chastity]] and [[sexual abstinence|continence]], but not yet."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 8:17&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the age of 17, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover&lt;ref name=Uta&gt;{{cite book |title= Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality and the Catholic Church | last =Ranke-Heineman | first = Uta| publisher= Penguin Books | place = US |year=1988| isbn=9780385265270}}&lt;/ref&gt; for over fifteen years&lt;ref name="utne.com"&gt;Boyce, James (May 2015) [http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/st-augustine-and-original-sin-ze0z1505zken.aspx "Don't Blame the Devil: St Augustine and Original Sin"].

In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.&lt;ref name="utne.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek&lt;ref name=O&gt;[http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/augustine/ O'Donnell, James J. "Augustine the African", Georgetown University]. Faculty.georgetown.edu. Retrieved on 2015-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;—he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.

===Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan===
[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]

Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.

Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who while traveling through Carthage had been asked by the imperial court at [[Milan]]&lt;ref name="celife" /&gt; to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.

Although Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or "elect", but an "auditor", the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy.&lt;ref name = "celife" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chadwick |first1=Henry |title=Augustine: A Very Short Introduction |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191606632 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.&lt;ref name="celife" /&gt; In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Kishlansky| first1=Mark| last2=Geary| first2=Patrick| last3=O'Brien| first3=Patricia| title=Civilization in the West| date=2010| publisher=Pearson Education Inc.| location=New Jersey| pages=142–143| volume=Vol. 1: to 1715| ref=Augustine of Hippo|isbn=978-0205664726}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]], and his friend [[Simplician]]us all urged him towards Christianity.&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with [[Ambrose]] of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.

Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced.&lt;ref name = "BeDuhn2009"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jason David | last = BeDuhn | title = Augustine's Manichaean Dilemma: Conversion and Apostasy, 373–388 C.E. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEmZaq1Gg3wC&amp;pg=PA163 | accessdate = 17 June 2011 | date =2009| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-4210-2|page= 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. Augustine arrived in Milan and was immediately taken under the wing by Ambrose. Within his ''Confessions'', Augustine states, "That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should."&lt;ref name="Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Outler| first1=Albert| title="Medieval Sourcebook."

Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, "And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church—but as a friendly man."&lt;ref name="Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion"/&gt; Augustine visited Ambrose in order to see if Ambrose was one of the greatest speakers and rhetoricians in the world. More interested in his speaking skills than the topic of speech, Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion"/&gt;

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a marriage for him. Although Augustine accepted this marriage, for which he had to abandon his concubine, he was deeply hurt by the loss of his lover. He wrote, "My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding." Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed, even began to fester.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 6:15&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Burrus | first=Virginia| year=2011| title="Fleeing the Uxorious Kingdom": Augustine's Queer Theology of Marriage | journal =Journal of Early Christian Studies|volume=19| issue=1| pages = 1–20| doi=10.1353/earl.2011.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Confessions'', he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancée, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at [[Cassago Brianza|Cassiciacum]], a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as ''Christianae vitae otium'' – the leisure of Christian life.&lt;ref name="Ferguson208"&gt;Ferguson, Everett (1999) ''Christianity in Relation to Jews, Greeks, and Romans'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], p. 208, {{ISBN|0-8153-3069-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fra angelico - conversion de saint augustin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''The Conversion of St. Augustine'' by [[Fra Angelico]]]]
In late August of 386,&lt;ref&gt;The historian Peter Brown places Augustine's garden conversion at the end of August, 386. [[#Brown|Brown]], p. 64.
&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 31, after having heard and been inspired and moved by the story of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to "take up and read" ({{lang-la|tolle, lege}}), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. Augustine read from [[Epistle to the Romans|Paul's Epistle to the Romans]] – the "''[[Epistle to the Romans#Transformation of believers (12–15:13)|Transformation of Believers]]''" section, consisting of chapters 12 to 15 – wherein Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers, and describes the believers' resulting behaviour. The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit:
{{Quote |Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Augustine of Hippo | title = Confessions |year= 2008| publisher= Oxford University Press| place = New York | pages =152–153 | others = Chadwick, Henry transl}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He later wrote an account of his conversion – his very transformation, as Paul described – in his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of [[autobiography]]. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the ''Confessions'' also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics.&lt;ref name="justus.anglican.org"&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/50.html Augustine of Hippo, Bishop and Theologian].

For Thyself Thou hast made us,
And restless our hearts until in Thee they find their ease.

[[Ambrose]] baptized Augustine, along with his son Adeodatus, in Milan on [[Easter Vigil]], April 24–25, 387.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], p.  117.
&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 388, Augustine completed his [[Christian apologetics|apology]] ''On the Holiness of the Catholic Church''.&lt;ref name="celife"/&gt; That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Augustine's mother Monica died at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Pope| first=Hugh| work = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | title = Saint Monica| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm| accessdate=20 April 2012| quote=Here death overtook Monica and the finest pages of his "Confessions" were penned as the result of the emotion Augustine then experienced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property.&lt;ref&gt;Possidius, ''v. Aug.'' 3.1&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Adeodatus, too, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=A'Becket| first=John| title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Adeodatus| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01141e.htm| accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine then sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a [[monastic]] foundation for himself and a group of friends.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt;

In 391 Augustine was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in [[Hippo Regius]] (now [[Annaba]]), in [[Algeria]]. He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.&lt;ref name="celife"&gt;Portalié, Eugène (1907). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02084a.htm "Life of St. Augustine of Hippo"] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 395, he was made [[coadjutor Bishop]] of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]]&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name "Augustine of Hippo"; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''ep.''126.1&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in that position until his death in 430. He wrote his autobiographical ''Confessions'' in 397–398. His work ''The City of God'' was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the [[Visigoths]] had [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]].

Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a ''[[Monastic rule|regula]]'' for his monastery that led to his designation as the "[[patron saint]] of [[regular clergy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-augustine-of-hippo/ Saint Augustine of Hippo] at ''saints.sqpn.com''. Retrieved 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend [[Possidius]], bishop of [[Calama (Numidia)|Calama]] (present-day [[Guelma]], Algeria), in his ''Sancti Augustini Vita''. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.&lt;ref name=Weiskotten&gt;{{cite book |author=Weiskotten, Herbert T. |title=The Life of Saint Augustine: A Translation of the Sancti Augustini Vita by Possidius, Bishop of Calama |publisher= Evolution Publishing | location = Merchantville, New Jersey | year=2008 | isbn = 978-1-889758-90-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and veneration===
Shortly before Augustine's death, the [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe that had converted to [[Arianism]], invaded [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]]. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege.&lt;ref name=Weiskotten/&gt;{{rp|43}} According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430.&lt;ref name=Weiskotten/&gt;{{rp|57}} Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_augustine.html "St Augustine of Hippo"] at ''PhilosophyBasics.com''. Retrieved 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was [[canonization|canonized]] by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02662a.htm| title=New Advent – Pope Boniface VIII| accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[feast day]] is 28 August, the day on which he died. He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name="KnoYrSaint"/&gt; 

====Relics====
According to [[Bede]]'s ''True Martyrology'', Augustine's body was later [[Translation (relic)|translated]] or moved to [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]], by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by [[Huneric]]. Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter, [[bishop of Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Muslim]]s. In January 1327, [[Pope John XXII]] issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called ''Arca''), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.

In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the [[regular canons]] (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, [[Monsignor]] Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Saint Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=2213&amp;iparentid=145 Augustine's tomb, Augnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172526/http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=2213&amp;iparentid=145 |date=22 February 2014 }}. Augnet.org (2007-04-22). Retrieved on 2015-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in [[Milan]] with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled ''Arca'', which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair, but was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of [[Agostino Gaetano Riboldi]], and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dale, Shanon |title=A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII| doi=10.1016/S0304-4181(00)00016-6| year=2001| journal=Journal of Medieval History| volume=27| page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Harold Samuel (2002) ''St. Augustine's Bones: A Microhistory'' (Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book) Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], {{ISBN|1558493883}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842, a portion of Augustine's right arm (cubitus) was secured from Pavia and returned to [[Annaba]].&lt;ref name="SchnaubeltFleteren1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schnaubelt, Joseph C. |author2=Van Fleteren, Frederick |title=Augustine in Iconography: History and Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhTqAAAAMAAJ|date=1999|publisher=P.

==Views and thought==
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
{{Catholic philosophy}}
Augustine's large contribution of writings covered diverse fields including theology, philosophy and sociology. Along with [[John Chrysostom]], Augustine was among the most prolific scholars of the early church by quantity of surviving writings.

===Theology===
====Christian anthropology====
Augustine was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with a very clear vision of [[Christian anthropology|theological anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Stanford | title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#PhiAnt | contribution = Saint Augustine {{ndash}} Philosophical Anthropology | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise ''[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5]]'' (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627 [13–22]; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...)Haec enim non ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is marriage: ''caro tua, coniunx tua – your body is your wife''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; 46, 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was not preoccupied, as [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7–6.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = WE | last = Mann | contribution = Inner-Life Ethics | title=The Augustinian Tradition | publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 | pages=141–142 | isbn=978-0-520-20999-2 | editor-first = GB | editor-last = Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-5209-0792-8}}), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine "vigorously condemned the practice of induced [[abortion]]", and although he disapproved of an abortion during any stage of pregnancy, he made a distinction between early abortions and later ones.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, 1"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm B Eerdmans | isbn = 978-0-8028-3843-8| page = 1| editor-first = Allan D | editor-last = Fitzgerald | last = Bauerschmidt | first = John C |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcVhAGpvTQ0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Abortion |encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the distinction between "formed" and "unformed" fetuses mentioned in the [[Septuagint]] translation of {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:22–23}}, which is considered as wrong translation of the word "harm" from the original Hebrew text as "form" in the Greek Septuagint and based in Aristotelian distinction "between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'", and did not classify as murder the abortion of an "unformed" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life.cfm Respect for Unborn Human Life: the Church's Constant Teaching]. U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine held that "the timing of the infusion of the soul was a mystery known to God alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Moral Medicine: Theological Perspectives on Medical Ethics|editor1=Lysaught, M. Therese |editor2=Kotva, Joseph |editor3=Lammers, Stephen E. |editor4=Verhey, Allen |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8028-6601-1|page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he considered procreation as one of the goods of marriage; abortion figured as a means, along with drugs which cause sterility, of frustrating this good. It lay along a continuum which included infanticide as an instance of ‘lustful cruelty’ or ‘cruel lust.’ Augustine called the use of means to avoid the birth of a child an ‘evil work:’ a reference to either abortion or contraception or both."&lt;ref name="Vasa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/bishops/vasapelosi.htm|title=Modern Look at Abortion Not Same as St. Augustine's|website=www.ewtn.com|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation====
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}
In ''City of God'', Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 "Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past"], ''The City of God'', Book 12: Chapt. 10 [419].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'', Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days as a literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]] 18:1, ''creavit omnia simul'' ("He created all things at once"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm B Eerdmans | isbn = 978-0-8028-3843-8 | pages = 377–378 | editor-first = Allan D | editor-last = Fitzgerald | last = Teske| first = Roland J | title = Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De| encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an additional support for describing the six days of creation as a [[heuristic]] device, Augustine thought that the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore need to be translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Franklin-Brown | first = Mary | title = Reading the world : encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago London | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780226260709|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].&lt;ref&gt;''On the Merits'', 1.2; ''City of God'', 13:1; ''Enchiridion'', 104&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecclesiology====
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]
Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the [[laity]]) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of "wheat" and "tares", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the "true" or "pure" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{cite book

| publisher=Abingdon Press
| isbn=978-0687171835
| date=1970–1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt; and that their authority in the Church is God-given.

====Eschatology====
Augustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Blomberg, Craig L. |title=From Pentecost to Patmos| publisher=Apollos| year=2006| page=519| isbn=978-0805432480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Reformation]] theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=Frank L. |editor2-last=Livingstone |editor2-first=Elizabeth |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3 |ref=Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Enchiridion'', 110&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;

====Mariology====
Although Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the [[Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Ever-Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], believing her to be "full of grace" (following earlier Latin writers such as [[Jerome]]) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary "conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever".&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation====
Augustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this "literal sense" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad literam 1:19–20'', Chapt. 19 [408], ''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Original sin====
{{see also|Original sin}}

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]
Augustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''. (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 795)&lt;/ref&gt; The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] (Gen 2:17).&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6:12, vol. 1, p. 192-3 and 12:28, vol. 2, p. 219-20, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ; [[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49,28 and 50–52; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 34, 377; cf. idem, ''De Trinitate'', XII, 12.17; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 371–372 [v. 26–31; 1–36];  ''De natura boni'' 34–35; CSEL 25, 872; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 42, 551–572&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was a symbol of the order of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 4.8; [[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Augustine explained it in this way: "Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more." ("[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]" (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1–12])&lt;/ref&gt;

They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if [[Satan]] hadn't sown into their senses "the root of evil" (''radix Mali'').&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus''  ("Contra Julianum", I, 9.42; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 670)&lt;/ref&gt; Their nature was wounded by [[concupiscence]] or [[libido]], which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In one of Augustine's late works, ''[[Retractationes]]'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: "Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido" ("libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis"). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: «Quod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest». Quod ideo dictum est, quoniam "libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis". Sicut enim malum est male uti bonis, ita bonum bene uti malis. De qua re alias, maxime contra novos haereticos Pelagianos, diligentius disputavi''. Cf. ''De bono coniugali'', 16.18; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 385; ''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', II, 21.36; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 443; ''Contra Iulianum'', III, 7.16; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 710; ibid., V, 16.60; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 817.

Une théologie baptismale de la vie conjugale |author= Idem |year= 1983 |publisher= Études Augustiniennes |location=Paris |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[metaphysics]], concupiscence is not a being but bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.&lt;ref&gt;''Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor''. (''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', I, 25. 28; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 430; cf. ''Contra Julianum'', VI, 18.53; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 854; ibid. VI, 19.58; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 857; ibid., II, 10.33; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 697; ''Contra Secundinum Manichaeum'', 15; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 42, 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of original sin and the necessity of redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt; who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib. subnot.in verb. Iul. Praef.'',2,3; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 48,111 /v.5-13/; {{cite book |last= Bonner |first= Gerald |title= Rufinus of Syria and African Pelagianism |page= 35(X) }} in: {{cite book |author= Idem |title= God's Decree and Man's Destiny |location= London |year= 1987 |pages= 31–47 (X) |isbn= 978-0-86078-203-2 |publisher=  Variorum Reprints}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refused to agree that original sin wounded human will and mind, insisting that the human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;{{rp|355–356}}&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/grazia_cristo/grazia_cristo_1_libro.htm De gratia Christi et de peccato originali]'', I, 15.16; CSEL 42, 138 [v.24–29]; Ibid., I,4.5; CSEL 42, 128 [v.15–23].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Jovinian]], Pelagians insisted that human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality, ''e.g.'' [[fornication]], is exclusively a matter of will, ''i.e.'' a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 1.31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine had served as a "Hearer" for the Manichaeans for about nine years,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; who taught that the original sin was [[carnal knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm |title=The Manichaean Version of Genesis 2–4 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029144459/http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm |archivedate=29 October 2005 }}.

Clarke SJ writes: ''Towards Neoplatonism there was throughout his life a decidedly ambivalent attitude; one must expect both agreement and sharp dissent, derivation but also repudiation. In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul. The disagreement chiefly concerned, as we have said, two related and central Christian dogmas: the Incarnation of the Son of God and the resurrection of the flesh''. {{cite journal |last= Clarke, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] |first= T.

''Plotinus''. New York: Routledge, 1994. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine taught the redemption, i.e. transformation and purification, of the body in the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''"Enarrations on the Psalms"'' (''Enarrationes in psalmos''), 143:6; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad Litteram''), 9:6:11, trans.

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against [[human sexuality]] and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the ''Confessions''. But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;{{rp|312}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Gerald Bonner's comment explains a little bit why there are so many authors who write false things about Augustine's views: "It is, of course, always easier to oppose and denounce than to understand."&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine taught that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a ''remedium concupiscentiae'' – remedy of concupiscence.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De continentia'', 12.27; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 368; Ibid., 13.28; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 369; ''Contra Julianum'', III, 15.29, &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 717; Ibid., III, 21.42, &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 724.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=A Postscript to the Remedium Concupiscentiae| journal=The Thomist| volume= 70 |year=2006| pages= 481–536 |url=http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1501.htm Merits and Remission of Sin, and Infant Baptism]'' (''De peccatorum meritis et remissione et de baptismo parvulorum''), I, 6.6; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 112–113; cf.

John Hammond Taylor SJ, vol. 2, pp. 76–77; &lt;abbr title="Patrologia Latina"&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 34, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by [[concupiscence]],&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Imperfectum Opus contra Iulianum'', II, 218&lt;/ref&gt; which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In 393 or 394 he commented: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and [[idolatry]] unbelief, and [[covetousness]] idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal.'' ("[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/16011.htm On the Sermon on the Mount]", ''De sermone Domini in monte'', 1:16:46; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 35, 52)&lt;/ref&gt; making humanity a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}} Although earlier Christian authors taught the elements of physical death, moral weakness, and a sin propensity within original sin, Augustine was the first to add the concept of inherited guilt (''reatus'') from Adam whereby an infant was eternally damned at birth.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Augustine's Conversion from Traditional Free Choice to "Non-free Free Will": A Comprehensive Methodology |date=2018 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen |isbn=9783161557538 |pages=93, 127, 140, 146, 231-233, 279-280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Augustine's anti-Pelagian defense of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils,''i.e.'' [[Council of Carthage (418)|Carthage (418)]], [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431), [[Council of Orange (529)|Orange]] (529), [[Council of Trent|Trent]] (1546) and by popes, ''i.e.'' [[Pope Innocent I]] (401–417) and [[Pope Zosimus]] (417–418), his inherited guilt eternally damning infants was omitted by these councils and popes.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; [[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' the definition that was followed by the great 13th-century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the "privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess", thus separating it from ''concupiscence'', with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;{{rp|371}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |last=Southern |first=R.W. |year=1953 |location=London |pages=234–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; as later did Luther and Calvin.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}} In 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}}

====Predestination====
{{see also|Predestination}}
Augustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.&lt;ref name="Levering"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levering |first=Matthew |title=Predestination: Biblical and Theological Paths |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-960452-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLBS6Dl1OYgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} Prior to 396, he believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was "a reward for human assent".&lt;ref name="Levering"/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith.&lt;ref name="Levering"/&gt;{{rp|47–48}}

Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars have held that Augustine did believe in double predestination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Frank A., III |year=1998 |title=Peter Martyr Vermigli and Predestination: The Augustinian Inheritance of an Italian Reformer |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1833170/peter-martyr-vermigli-and-predestination-the-augustinian |subscription=yes |via=[[Questia]] |p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Protestant theologians, such as [[Justo L. González]]&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt;{{rp|44}} and [[Bengt Hägglund]],&lt;ref name="Hägglund 2007 139–140"/&gt; interpret Augustine's teaching that grace is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]], results in conversion, and leads to [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]].

In ''On Rebuke and Grace'' (''De correptione et gratia''), Augustine wrote: "And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them."&lt;ref name="St. Augustine of Hippo"/&gt;

====Sacramental theology====
[[File:Vittore carpaccio, visione di sant'agostino 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[St. Augustine in His Study (Carpaccio)|St. Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], 1502]]

Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the "regularity" and "validity" of the [[sacrament]]s. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt; Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.

Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], saying that Christ's statement, "This is my body" referred to the bread he carried in his hands,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the [[Apocalypse]], may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Astrology====
Augustine's contemporaries often believed [[astrology]] to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and [[horoscope]]s. (Augustine's term "mathematici", meaning "astrologers", is sometimes mistranslated as "mathematicians".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but "common swindlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Augustine the Bishop.

====Epistemology====
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[divine illumination]]. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of [[sense perception]]. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last=Mendelson| first=Michael| title=Saint Augustine| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/| publisher=''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''| accessdate=21 December 2012| date=2000-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Matthews, Gareth B. |title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes| isbn=978-0801427756| publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=King| first=Peter| author2=Nathan Ballantyne| title=Augustine on Testimony| journal=[[Canadian Journal of Philosophy]]| year=2009| volume=39| issue=2| doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045| url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| page=195| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911164130/http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| archivedate=11 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Just war====
{{See also|Just war theory}}
Augustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html "A Time For War?"] ''Christianity Today'' (2001-01-09). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defence of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine coined the phrase in his work ''The City of God''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo].

====Free will====
Included in Augustine's [[theodicy]] is the claim that God created humans and angels as rational beings possessing [[free will]]. Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as "free" as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin's corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-first=Chad |editor-last=Meister| editor2-first=Paul| editor2-last=Copan| title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion| date=2012| series=Routledge Philosophy Companions| location=London| isbn=9780415782944| edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.&lt;ref name="ceteach"/&gt; He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish.&lt;ref name="ceteach"/&gt; While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.&lt;ref name="ceteach"&gt;Portalié, Eugène.

Retrieved 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology, morals and ethics===
====Slavery====
Augustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves "as an act of piety".&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, "Of the Work of Monks", p. 25, Vol. 3, ''Nicene &amp; Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing [[infanticide]] when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;The Saints, Pauline Books &amp; Media, Daughters of St. Paul, Editions du Signe (1998), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''The City of God'', he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God "did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation – not man over man, but man over the beasts". Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. "The condition of slavery is the result of sin", he declared.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''The City of God'', Ch. 15, p. 411, Vol. II, ''Nicene &amp; Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The City of God'', Augustine wrote he felt that the existence of slavery was a punishment for the existence of sin, even if an individual enslaved person committed no sin meriting punishment. He wrote: "Slavery is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120119.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: City of God, Book XIX (St. Augustine)|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that slavery did more harm to the slave owner than the enslaved person himself: "the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Augustine proposes as a solution to sin a type of cognitive reimagining of one's situation, where slaves "may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love," until the end of the world eradicated slavery for good: "until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Jews====
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33–35, {{ISBN|0752417703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews "survive but not thrive" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example)&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James (2002) ''Constantine's Sword''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|9780618219087}}. p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1864878,00.html Paula Fredriksen, interviewed by David Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"]. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexuality====
For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.27; ''A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the "better" way (''Confessions'' 8.2) and abstain from marriage (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russel|Russell]], p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, "just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat"; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse "simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence" (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 2.29; cf. ''City of God'' 14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: "Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also" (''City of God'' 14.16).

Augustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, E. ed. (1996) ''St. Augustine on Marriage and Sexuality''. Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Augustine did not believe that Adam was any less guilty of sin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1484/J.RA.5.102318|author=Clark, E.|title='Adam's Only Companion': Augustine and the Early Christian Debate on Marriage|journal=Recherches Augustiniennes|volume=21 |year=1986|pages= 139–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Augustine praises women and their role in society and in the Church. In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the [[Samaritan]] woman from John 4:1–42, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." &lt;ref&gt;(Eph: 5, 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pedagogy====
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - St Augustin dans son cabinet de travail.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Augustine in His Cell (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1494, [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]
Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his ''[[Retractationes]]'' (''Retractations''), reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of "retractationes" may be "reconsiderations". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.&lt;ref name=mccloskey/&gt;

Augustine was a strong advocate of [[critical thinking]] skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Saint Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.&lt;ref name=mccloskey&gt;McCloskey, Gary N. (April 2008) [http://www.merrimack.edu/academics/augustinian_pedagogy/documents/encountering_0408.pdf Encounters of Learning: Saint Augustine on Education], Saint Augustine Institute for Learning and Teaching, [[Merrimack College]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:
* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;
* the student who has had no education; and
* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.

If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between "having words and having understanding" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Under the influence of [[Bede]], [[Alcuin]], and [[Rabanus Maurus]], ''De catechizandis rudibus'' came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Howie, G. (1969) ''Educational Theory and Practice in St. Augustine'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, pp. 150–153&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.

==Works==

[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine'' painting by Antonio Rodríguez]]
Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, F.A. and Sinclair, T.A. (1931) ''A History of Later Latin Literature'', Dawsons of Pall Mall, London, pp. 56 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermon]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.

Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate Dei'' (''[[The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} He also wrote ''On Free Choice of the Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

==Influence==
[[File:Vergós Group - Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics'' painting by Verges Group]]

In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the ''[[Enneads]]'', probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russel|Russell]], Book II, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

===In philosophy===
[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russel|Russell]], pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the "eternal present"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''&lt;/ref&gt; clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.

[[File:Vergós Group - Saint Augustine Meditates on the Trinity when the Child Jesus Appears before him - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Meditates on the Trinity when the Child Jesus Appears before him'' by Vergós Group]]
Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=de Paulo| first=Craig J. N.| title=The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology| year=2006| publisher=[[The Edwin Mellen Press]] | isbn=978-0773456891}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: "The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem."&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1964) ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For example, Heidegger's articulations of how "Being-in-the-world" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': "The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''." Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': "Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'". ''Being and Time'', Trs. Macquarrie &amp; Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): "The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Chiba, Shin| title= Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship| journal=The Review of Politics| volume= 57| issue= 3 | year=1995| pages= 505–535 (507)| jstor=1408599| doi=10.1017/S0034670500019720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: "Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced [[the Holocaust]] as merely banal [in ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'']."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Tinder, Glenn| journal=[[American Political Science Review]]| volume= 91| issue= 2| year=1997| title=Augustine and the Limits of Politics, by Jean Bethke Elshtain| pages= 432–433| url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmPoliticalScienceRev-1997jun-00432| doi=10.2307/2952372| last2=Elshtain| first2=Jean Bethke| jstor=2952372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian political theology; and third, Augustinian political theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Woo, B.

===In theology===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without "supernatural gifts".&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1203}} While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}}

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]]. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Marxism]], [[Freudianism]] and eco-fundamentalism.&lt;ref name="Deepak Lal"&gt;Lal, D. (March 2002) [http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp812.pdf "Morality and Capitalism: Learning from the Past"]. Working Paper Number 812, Department of Economics, [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly ''The City of God'', in their book of political philosophy ''Empire''.

Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. [[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of [[semiotics]], but rather built upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: "as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies."&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, E. (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IWtCAAAAQBAJ "On the Object-Language / Metalanguage Distinction in Saint Augustine's Works. De Dialectica and de Magistro"], p. 65 in Cram, D., Linn, A. R., &amp; Nowak, E. (eds.). ''History of Linguistics: Volume 2: From Classical to Contemporary Linguistics''. [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]. {{ISBN|9789027283818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.

===Oratorio===
[[File:Jaume Huguet - Consecration of Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Consecration of Saint Augustine]]'' by [[Jaume Huguet]]]]

Much of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in the oratorio ''La conversione di Sant'Agostino'' (1750) composed by [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]. The libretto for this oratorio, written by [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]], draws upon the influence of [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]] (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based off an earlier five-act play ''Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus'' written by the Jesuit priest [[Franz Neumayr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7vpR97_-VIC&amp;lpg=PA98|title=A History of the Oratorio|last=Smither|first=Howard E.|date=1977-01-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807812747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the libretto Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity. As Dr. Andrea Palent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La conversione Di Sant' Agostino|last=Hasse|first=Johann Adolf|publisher=Capriccio Digital|year=1993|isbn=|location=CD Booklet: Marcus Creed's recording of La conversion di Sant' Agostino with the RIAS Kammerchor; 10 389/90.|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; says: {{Quote|text=Maria Antonia Walpurgis revised the five-part Jesuit drama into a two-part oratorio liberty in which she limits the subject to the conversion of Augustine and his submission to the will of God. To this was added the figure of the mother, Monica, so as to let the transformation appear by experience rather than the dramatic artifice of deus ex machina.|sign=|source=}}Throughout the oratorio Augustine shows his willingness to turn to God, but the burden of the act of conversion weighs heavily on him. This is displayed by Hasse through extended recitative passages.

'''Bruno Leoni''' (26 April 1913 – 21 November 1967) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[classical-liberal]] [[political philosopher]] and [[lawyer]].
Whilst the war kept Leoni away from teaching, in 1945 he became Full professor of Philosophy of Law. Leoni was also appointed Dean of the Department of Political Sciences at the [[University of Pavia]] from 1948 to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riscoprire Bruno Leoni|url=http://riscoprire.brunoleoni.com/it/biografia|website=riscoprire.brunoleoni.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Leoni fought in [[World War II]] as part of the “A Force”, an organization that rescued prisoners of war ([[POWs]]) in Italy after 1943. 

Leoni was the founder and editor of the political science journal ''Il Politico''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivista "IL Politico"|url=http://www-3.unipv.it/ilpolitico/|website=University of Pavia|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved as secretary and later president of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Presidents {{!}} MPS|url=https://www.montpelerin.org/past-presidents-2/|website=www.montpelerin.org|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Richard Posner]], Leoni has been also one of the fathers of the [[Law and Economics]] school.

Leoni died prematurely (aged 54) in Alpignano, under tragic circumstances, killed in 1967 by Osvaldo Quero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merlo|first1=Cristian|title=Bruno Leoni, un “austriaco” di adozione - Ludwig von Mises Italia|url=http://vonmises.it/2013/02/18/bruno-leoni-un-austriaco-di-adozione/|website=Ludwig von Mises Italia|accessdate=20 December 2017|language=it-IT|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Italian libertarian scholars [[Carlo Lottieri]], {{ill|Alberto Mingardi|it}} and {{ill|Carlo Stagnaro|fr}} founded the [[Bruno Leoni Institute]], a free-market think-tank.

==Work==
Bruno Leoni was a student of [[Austrian economics]] and he applied its core insights to legislation. According to Leoni, just as a central planner lacks the information that emerges in a market, a legislator lacks the information that emerges in case law.

Bruno Leoni’s thought had an impact both on law and economics and on contemporary [[libertarianism]]. For Leoni, liberty consists of keeping the lives of people and the resources they command out of the political sphere as much as possible. Thus, law should filter, rather than facilitate, the tendency toward the full politicization of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mingardi|first1=Alberto|title=Bruno Leoni's Lesson|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324474004578444672749695276|accessdate=20 December 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leoni believes that, in the long run, a system centered on legislation is fundamentally incompatible with the maintenance of a [[free society]]. Partly, this is because of the inherent temptations that legislation provides for rent-seekers and other parties seeking to oppress or plunder non-consenting losers in the political process. Partly it also has to do with the inherent instability of the legislative process and the relative predictability of the common law process, properly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zywicki|first1=Todd|title=When Friedrich Hayek Met Bruno Leoni - Law &amp; Liberty|url=http://www.libertylawsite.org/2014/07/17/when-friedrich-hayek-met-bruno-leoni/|website=Law &amp; Liberty|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what it is probably his most important work, ''Freedom and the Law'', Leoni makes the observation that for the [[free market]] to function effectively it is necessary for private individuals to have a stable legal framework in which to plan and be confident that their plans will be carried through to fruition. Moreover, for individuals to free from oppression it is necessary for government to be announce their rules in advance so that individuals can know what is their permitted range of freedom (what is often, although imprecisely, referred to as the “rule of law”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom and the Law (1961 ed.) - Online Library of Liberty|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/leoni-freedom-and-the-law-1961-ed|website=oll.libertyfund.org|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leoni’s thought had a strong impact on important thinkers like [[James M. Buchanan]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Murray N. Rothbard]] and [[Gordon Tullock]].

{{Close Relationships}}

'''Casual dating''' or a '''casual relationship''' is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may have [[casual sex]] or a near-[[sexual relationship]] without necessarily demanding or expecting the extra commitments of a more formal [[romantic relationship]]. Motives for casual relationships vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belle |first=Heather |author2=Michelle Fiordaliso |title=Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Ex* |publisher=Sourcebooks Casablanca |year=2009 |isbn= 1-4022-2923-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant gender and cultural differences in acceptance of and breadth of casual relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chara PJ, Kuennen LM |title=Diverging gender attitudes regarding casual sex: a cross-sectional study |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=57–8 |date=February 1994 |pmid=8153236 |quote=Abstract: Students at five educational levels ranging from seventh graders to college seniors were surveyed regarding their attitudes about the acceptability of casual sex.

Broude, 'Male-Female Relationships in Cross-Cultural Perspective: A Study of Sex and Intimacy' Cross-Cultural Research, Vol. 18, No. 2, 154–181 (1983) Abstract: Societies are neither entirely consistent nor entirely arbitrary in their patterning of heterosexual relationships. This research suggests that sexual relationships, and male sexual orientation are not highly related to each other.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in regrets about action/inaction in those relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roese NJ, Pennington GL, Coleman J, Janicki M, Li NP, Kenrick DT |title=Sex differences in regret: all for love or some for lust? |journal=Pers Soc Psychol Bull |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=770–80 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16648202 |pmc=2293329 |doi=10.1177/0146167206286709 |quote=Abstract: within romantic relationships, men emphasize regrets of inaction over action, whereas women report regrets of inaction and action with equivalent frequency. Sex differences were not evident in other interpersonal regrets (friendship, parental, sibling interactions) and were not moderated by relationship status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casual dating may be part-time, or for a limited time. It may or may not entail partner-exclusivity. In each case, the relationship's dominance in the lives of those involved is being voluntarily limited, and there is usually a sense that the relationship is intended to endure only so long as both parties wish it to. Casual relationships sometimes include mutual support, affection and enjoyment, which underpin other forms of loving relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbett|first1=Sherry|last2=Sherwin|first2=Robert|title=Campus sexual norms and dating relationships: A trend analysis|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1985|volume=21|issue=3|pages=258–274|doi=10.1080/00224498509551266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A casual relationship is sometimes referred to as a "no strings attached" relationship.

==College students==

A "no strings attached" relationship is most commonly found in young adults such as college students. The shift from childhood to adulthood brings on much exploration in different fields. One of these fields include relationships and sex.&lt;ref name=Grello&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grello|first=Catherine M.|author2=Welsh, Deborah P. |author3=Harper, Melinda S. |title=No strings attached; The nature of casual sex in college students|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=11 Jan 2010|volume=43|issue=3|pages=255–267|doi=10.1080/00224490609552324|pmid=17599248}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is the time in life where mastery of future life skills is attempted.&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt; Grello's study suggests that, in most cases, the same students who lost their virginity in high school lost them in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt; After experiencing sexual intercourse, many college students go on to have [[casual sex]] with either friends or peers they have been recently or newly acquainted with.&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt;

A study published by the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' reported that sixty percent of college students have participated in a casual relationship. [[Wayne State University]] and [[Michigan State University]] conducted a similar survey and sixty-six percent of the undergraduates in this study said they had also been in a casual relationship. About half of this sixty-six percent said they were currently in such a relationship.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study: 'Friends With Benefits' Sex Common in College|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512241,00.html|publisher=Imaginova Corp.|accessdate=24 April 2012|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A casual relationship, unlike a romantic relationship, is very undefined and it is difficult to ascribe norms, scripts, and expectations to it.&lt;ref name=Maley /&gt; Rebecca Plante, an associate professor at [[Ithaca College]], has specialized in research on casual relationships, and says that this type of relationship can be beneficial. Casual relationships can establish a "healthy outlet for sexual needs and desires."&lt;ref name=Maley&gt;{{cite web|last=Maley|first=David|title='Friends With Benefits' Lets Couples Get Close But Not Too Close, Says Ithaca College Expert|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/news/releases/friends_with_benefits_lets_couples_get_close_but_not_too_close-20143/|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of college-aged lovers===

J.A. Lee, author of ''Love Styles'' in the ''R.J Sternberg &amp; M.L. Barnes: The psychology of love'' journal, has come up with two main types of lovers for college aged young adults. They are "Eros" lovers who are passionate lovers and "Ludas" or "Ludic" lovers, which are game-playing lovers.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=J.A.|title=Love Styles|journal=R.J Sternberg &amp; M.L. Barnes: The psychology of love|year=1988|pages=38–67|accessdate=15 March 2012|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Love-Rj-Sternberg/dp/0300045891}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Eros]]" lovers are lovers that are often struck by "Cupid's Arrow". They often fall head over heels at the first sight of a potential relationship. "Eros" fall in love with the physical attributes of another before any other characteristic. This type of lover is also known to commit to other [[casual sex]] relationships.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; Because physical attributes are the main reason for attraction, it is very hard to further a real romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt; "Ludic" lovers are out for the game. They are looking for the feeling of conquest and typically enter a relationship  or hook-up with very little or no intentions of establishing any kind of commitment. They, in most cases, will have more than one sexually active partner at a given time. They also find it very hard to picture a relationship getting serious.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; With both of these types of lovers being open to having more than one sexual partner, it helps explain why many college students participate in casual relationships.&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt;

===Negotiation between participants===

Many casual relationships establish guidelines or a set of rules. The two participants in the relationship will reach an agreement about what each expects from the relationship. Another major concern is that one of the partners will develop romantic feelings for the other.&lt;ref name=Bisson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bisson|first=Melissa A.|author2=Levine, Timothy R.|title=Negotiating a Friends with Benefits Relationship|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=13 September 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=66–73|doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9211-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Communication between the two partners is essential to making this type of relationship work and because the partners in the casual relationship are often friends beforehand, talking to one another is a much simpler task.&lt;ref name=Bisson /&gt;

===Triangle theory of love===
{{Main|Triangular theory of love}}

[[Robert Sternberg]]'s triangular theory of love offers the type of flexibility that may be suited in helping this type of relationship become successful.

===Relationship maintenance and student concerns===

Casual relationships, being a mix between a friendship and a non-romantic sexual relationship, result in the partners facing many challenges in maintaining a working relationship.  Based on the [[exchange theory]], Hughes witnessed an individual dependency on either partner as the exchange of resources, knowledge, rewards, and costs of items, becomes more and more prominent.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Mikayla |author2=Morrison, Kelly |author3=Asada, Kelli Jean K. |title=What's love got to do with it? Exploring the impact of maintenance rules, love attitudes, and network support on friends with benefits relationships|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=2005|volume=69|issue=1|pages=49–66|doi=10.1080/10570310500034154}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The partners may become dependent on advice the other partner gives, or the company they receive when being around one another. This may be a one-way street and one partner may not feel this way.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; Any partner that is not fully dependent upon the other typically controls the casual relationship. The dependent partner is more submissive to their dominant partner as they do not want the relationship to end.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; This allows the less dependent partner to be able to fix and maintain the relationship the way he/she wants it to be. They normally control when they meet up, when they have sex, and when they do things together.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;

Many students share the same concerns when it came to beginning a casual relationship with a person who was already their friend. Bisson and Levine found that there were four main worries.&lt;ref name="Fox News" /&gt; 
*'''Romantic feelings would occur:''' 65.3% of students were afraid one or both of the participants would establish romantic feelings for the other.&lt;ref name="Fox News" /&gt;
*'''Hurting the friendship:''' 28.2% were worried that the friendship that was already established would be harmed.&lt;ref name="Fox News" /&gt;
*'''Causes negative emotions towards one another:''' 27.4% were concerned negative feelings would develop between the two friends.&lt;ref name="Fox News" /&gt;
*'''Pregnancy/STDs:''' 9.7% of the students surveyed were worried they would become pregnant or catch an STD.&lt;ref name="Fox News" /&gt;

===Disclosure of casual relationship to peers===

Hughes's study also revealed the four main categories of why partners participating in a casual relationship did not feel the need to tell their same sex friends about the relationship. The first category was that the partners did not feel that their same sex friends needed to know this information.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; The second category consisted of people wanting to keep the casual relationship a [[secret]] and didn't want their same sex friends to know.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; The feeling of [[embarrassment]] was the third category. Many students said that they would feel ashamed or didn't want to be judged by their same sex friends.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; The final category is students who didn't want to tell their same sex friends because they would show disapproval of the relationship.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;

===Motivations===

Hughes's study suggests that there were five main [[motivation]]s to why college students wanted to be in a casual relationship.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;  The five main motivators are:
*'''Relationship avoidance:''' Students that liked multiple partners at once and wanted to avoid being tied down to one person.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;
*'''Sex:''' Students find each other attractive and want to hook-up.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;
*'''Relationship [[simplicity]]:''' Students get the benefits of a relationship without all the drama.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;
*'''Emotional connection:''' Students miss the [[Intimacy#Intimacy|intimacy]] they used to have with ex relationships and want to experience it again with no strings attached.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;
*'''Always wanted a casual relationship:''' Two students that are single and want to take advantage of it together.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;

===Gender participation===

A traditional [[stereotype]] of heterosexual casual relationships in college is that the men initiate the sexual activity.&lt;ref name=Paul&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Elizabeth L.|author2=McManus, Brian |author3=Hayes, Allison |title="Hookups": Characteristics and Correlates of College Students' Spontaneous and Anonymous Sexual Experiences|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=Feb 2000|volume=37|issue=1|pages=76–88|doi=10.1080/00224490009552023}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another stereotype is that men are more sexually active and women link sex with [[Romance (love)|romance]]. This is not true all the time, especially in college students.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt; 
A study conducted by Paul and her team suggests that when it comes to [[gender]] participation, there are just as many women initiating these relationships.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt; Pressure from friends and other social means may persuade college students to participate in a casual relationship or "hook-up" regardless of their gender.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt;

===Environmental factors===

College and university campuses are often characterised by the amount of drinking or partying that goes on there.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt; However, campuses can also be characterized by how sexually permissive the students are and also the types of sexual activity prevalent (intercourse, oral, anal) with one or multiple partners.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt; Being placed in an environment of already sexually active students can put pressure on other students to be sexually active as well.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt;

The environment that students are placed in often plays a role in whether or not they feel pressured into finding a casual relationship. The colleges and universities known for a larger alcohol consumption by their students seem to also have a larger number of students participating in casual relationships.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt; Researchers have struggled with the idea that the "perceived [[Disinhibition|disinhibitory]] function" leads to the reason for increased sexual activity.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt;

==Casual sex==
{{Main|Casual sex}}

Casual sex are certain types of [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] outside the context of a [[romantic relationship]]. Although individuals in a casual relationship may engage in [[casual sex]], the former encompasses a range of activities not confined to the context of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/casual|title=Definition of CASUAL|website=www.m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual+sex|title=the definition of casual sex|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While providing a sexual outlet, the practice of casual sex often carries negative connotations. In some sexual relationships among teenagers in the U.S., the predominant activity is not penetrative sex, but rather [[oral sex]] and [[mutual masturbation]], as this reduces the risks associated with sexual promiscuity, such as [[pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. Some medical authorities – such as Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of [[pediatric]]s – suggest that teenagers do not view oral sex as "real sex" and use it to remain in a state of "technical" [[virginity]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern-Fisher B [[University of California at San Francisco]] [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7378833/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common factor found in many studies on casual sex is that sexual intercourse occurs within a relationship between two partners that have no commitment towards one another.  Casual sex presents itself as less risky than random sexual intercourse because of your prior knowledge of the partner you are having sexual intercourse with.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt; When participating in casual sex, you are more likely to know your partner (on a more personal level) than a partner you just have a "one night stand" with.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt;

===Alcohol consumption===

According to [[clinical psychologist]] Catherine Grello, "alcohol consumption appears to have a direct link with casual sex."&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt; The more [[alcohol]] that is involved the higher the possibility of a casual relationship forming. Both male and female college students are more likely to engage in sexual activity while [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]].&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt;  Consumption of alcohol increases the [[perception]]s of [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]] between partners which leads to sexual activity at a much higher rate. Also, with intoxication, low self-esteem and symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] may be adding factors to increase the chances to engage in this type of relationship or sexual activity.&lt;ref name=Grello /&gt;

'''Chilla''' ({{lang-fa|چله}}, {{lang-ar|أربعين}}, both literally "forty") is a spiritual practice of [[penance]] and solitude in [[Sufism]] known mostly in [[India]]n and [[Iran|Persian]] traditions. Elsewhere the practice is often referred to as [[Khalwa]]. In this ritual a [[mendicant]] or [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attempts to remain seated in a circle practicing meditation techniques without food for 40 days and nights in imitation of the [[Arba'een]].{{sfn|Landolt|Lawson|2005|p=203}}{{sfn|Dehlvi|2012||p=109}} The fan
''chilla'' is derived from the Persian word ''chehel'' "forty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halveti.org/content.asp?cid=6&amp;sid=21 The Path of Khalwati and Shabani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111191108/http://www.halveti.org/content.asp?cid=6&amp;sid=21 |date=2005-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilla is commonly performed in a solitary cell called a ''chilla-khana''.

== In Hindustani classical music ==
A practice similar to chilla is also performed by [[Hindustani classical music]] practitioners at an advanced level.It is called [[chilla katna]]. The musicians lock themselves up in a ''chilla-khana'' for forty days and practice their instrument severely. A special diet, often omitting meat and grains, is taken during this period and very little food is eaten. Any contact to the outside world is avoided during this period. People try not to fall asleep at any cost, if necessary they will tie their hair to a noose at the ceiling. It is done to achieve a very high level of skill, that cannot be achieved due to normal regular practice. The ''chilla'' details may differ between [[gharana]]s (musical lineages).

Many Indian classical musicians have confessed about going into chilla when they felt that they were at a crossroads where they could not see the path ahead clearly. They have also described chilla as an extremely intense, private and exhausting experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ustad Zakir Hussain @ Algebra live |publisher=Algebra talks (you tube)|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ustad Zakir Hussain]] went into a chilla, at the Dargah of Haji Mallam, with just his tabla as companion for 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kabir |first1=Nasreen Munni |title=Zakir Hussain: a life in music |date=15 January 2018 |publisher=Harper Collins India |isbn=9352770498 |edition=1 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People who have performed partial or complete chillas ==
The most famous case of chilla is found in the biographies of the 14th century Sufi poet [[Hafez]] of [[Shiraz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/hafiz.htm Teachings of Hafiz: Translated by Gertrude Lowthian Bell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hafizonlove.com/bio/ Hafiz حافظ Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/hafez/hafez.php Iran Chamber Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[tabla]] maestro [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]] describes having gone into chilla at the age of 16 during his first experience of fame, in an attempt to rediscover music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kubiak |first1=David |title=On Musical Chakras, Chilla and Uncharted Epiphanies - a conversation with Ustad Zakir Hussain |journal=Kyoto journal |url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/conversations/on-musical-chakras-chilla-and-uncharted-epiphanies/ |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objecting to God'', (Cambridge University Press, 2011); {{ISBN|978-0-521-18665-0}}. The growth of science and a correspondingly scientific way of looking at evidence have for the last three centuries slowly been gaining ground over religious explanations of the cosmos and mankind's place in it. However, not only is secularism now under renewed attack from religious fundamentalism, but it has also been widely claimed that the scientific evidence itself points strongly to a universe deliberately fine-tuned for life to evolve in it. In addition, certain aspects of human life, like consciousness and the ability to recognise the existence of universal moral standards, seem completely resistant to evolutionary explanation. In this book Colin Howson analyses in detail the evidence which is claimed to support belief in God's existence and argues that the claim is not well-founded. Moreover, there is very compelling evidence that an all-powerful, all-knowing God not only does not exist but cannot exist, a conclusion both surprising and provocative.

'''Criminal responsibility''' is the obligation in French law to answer for infractions committed and to suffer the [[punishment]] provided by the [[legislation]] that governs the infraction in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Gérard|last1=Cornu|first2=Association Henri Capitant|last2=dir.|title=Vocabulaire juridique|location=Paris|publisher=[[Presses Universitaires de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[democracy]] citizens have rights but also duties: with freedom comes responsibility.

Unlike civil [[legal liability|liability]], the obligation to answer for damage one has caused, either by repairing it or paying [[damages]] and interest for it, criminal responsibility implies [[legal recourse]] for the state against a disturbance of the peace. This includes three major factors:
*participation in a criminal offense
*forms of criminal responsibility
*exceptions to criminal responsibility.

== Participation ==

=== The author and the co-author ===
* '''The material author''' of the infraction is the person who physically performs the actions necessary to make up the criminal action. In the case of a [[murder]] this would be the person who struck the fatal blow. For crimes of [[omission (law)|omission]] the material author would be the person who didn't move when he had the possibility to rescue someone. Under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' a [[collective responsibility]] was often envisaged. This concept disappeared in the codes, although jurisprudence sometimes makes use of a concept of collective guilt, but this is most apparent in [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] cases. (Article 450-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-450-1|title=Code pénal – Article 450-1|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Indeed, in a conspiracy, each participant in the group is considered the principal author of the infraction.
* '''The co-author''' materially participates in events at the side of the principal author, and incurs the same prescribed penalties, even if the principal author is in the end finally declared non-responsible, as in a case of [[dementia]] for example. The co-author may have [[extenuating circumstances]] such as youth. [[Aggravation (law)|Aggravating circumstances]] are also possible, such as [[recidivism]]. Not to be confused with the accomplice, who would, for example, be the person who furnished the killer with a weapon.
* '''The moral''' author acts in the wings to have the crime committed, for example someone who pays to have a person killed or to have an object stolen, and is sometimes also called the intellectual author. French law doesn't really have this concept and such actions are addressed as conspiracies and sometimes described as [[complicity]] by [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] or by instruction.
* In the transition from the Napoleonic [[French Penal Code of 1810|penal code of 1810]] to the newer reformed criminal code, the [[law commission|reform commission]] considered including an autonomous criminal responsibility for intellectual authors but quickly abandoned the idea in the face of the difficulty of implementing such a modification of the criminal code while at the same time still preserving freedoms. However, in certain cases the moral authors may be prosecuted for the offense themselves, for instance for provocation to suicide or untruths. The untruths themselves are not criminal offences, nor is suicide. The "Perben 2" law of 2004 also created a specific infraction of instigating a  crime, and sanctions the moral author of certain crimes, even when the instigation was not successful and the crime was not committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2004/01/27/loi-perben-les-cinq-points-inquietants-pour-les-libertes-publiques_350647_3224.html|title=Loi Perben : les cinq points inquiétants pour les libertés publiques|trans-title=Perben Law: the five worrying points for public liberties|date=January 27, 2004|work=Le Monde Société|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempt ===
The penal code declares that the authorship of a crime includes not just the person who commits the incriminating act, but also he who in the cases provided by the law, only [[attempt]]s to commit it.

An attempt is constituted when a beginning of execution has manifested and only was suspended or failed to have an effect because of circumstances independent of the author's will (Article 121-5)

A person is an [[accomplice]] who knowingly offers aid or assistance to the preparation or commission of an infraction. A person is equally an accomplice a person who by gift, promise, threat order abuse of authority or of power provokes into an infraction or who gives instructions for committing it (Article 121-7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-7|title=Article 121-7 of the penal code}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 121-4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-4|title=Article 121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code says that trying to commit a crime is punishable, but attempting to commit a [[misdemeanor]] is not, unless a law specifically so provides. Attempting to commit an infraction is never an offense. The author of an attempt is considered an author of the actual infraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-6|title=Article 121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code, and incurs the same penalties as if his attempt had succeeded.

==== Material element ====

===== The beginning of execution =====
An attempt must manifest through the beginning of the commission of the infraction. The actor is no longer at the stage of preparatory actions, yet has not yet entirely found himself involved in the principal infraction. Jurisprudence defines the beginning of execution as the act or acts that "directly tend to the consommation of the infraction" (''tendant directement à la consommation de l'infraction'').

Example: arrêt Lacour, crim. 25 October 1962: Mr Lacour paid an individual to murder the adopted son of his mistress. The hired killer pretended to kidnap the adopted son, then collected his payment before reporting Lacour to the police. Lacour was prosecuted, notably, for [[attempted murder]].

He was acquitted however, on the theory that his actions did not tend either directly or immediately towards the death of the victim. In reality, his actions were not attempted murder; they amounted to attempted conspiracy to commit murder. No matter what, Lacour would never have been a murderer, just an accomplice. Without having acted immediately and directly to commit the crime, he did not have a punishable attempt under the law of [[intention (criminal law)|intent]] (although his actions could nonetheless be sanctioned under other criteria).

Attempted [[insurance fraud]] has given place to an important piece of jurisprudence: simply simulating a fire is merely a non-punishable act of preparation, because it does not result immediately and directly in disbursement of the policy amount. On the other hand, submitting a claim to the insurance company after making a false statement to the police would constitute the beginning of execution for the crime of fraud. A false declaration or statement, accompanied by fraudulent manoeuvers, or by staging or manipulating the evidence, have also been considered to amount to a beginning of execution.

===== Failure to voluntarily desist =====
An attempt is a failed crime and the failure of that crime was contrary to the will of its author. On the other hand, preparing then voluntarily desisting from the criminality before the crime is committed halts any prosecution.

This mechanism can be explained differently. The person who voluntarily renounces his criminal business has shown that he wasn't dangerous. The law encourages future wrongdoers to renounce their path and offers [[impunity]] as a reward. One can equally explain the mechanism by justifying its prevention of criminal attempts: the idea is to punish the person whose irrevokable criminal [[intention]] has not yet led him to carry out the crime in question. So the person who renounces his criminal intentions proves by doing so that they were not irrevocable, and therefore in law there was no attempted crime.

If the attempt failed for reasons beyond the intentions of its author, such as a missed shot, an unexpected passerby or the arrival of law enforcement, a stooge unexpectedly quitting, or sometimes the actions of the victim (a rapist fleeing because of victim's screams),&lt;ref&gt;Crim. 26 avril 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the attempted crime is punishable.

The failure to voluntarily desist does not necessarily require the intervention of an outside force: Crim. 10 janvier 1996 held that an attempted rape which could not be completed due to the criminal's sexual dysfunction was nevertheless an attempted rape.

The problem may arise where the causes of the criminal stopping before he commits a crime was are mixed; for example, a moralizing friend dissuades an offender from committing a planned burglary.(Crim. 20 mars 1974). Circumstances in such cases have not forced him to desist but he hasn't independently or spontaneously opted not to commit the crime either.

The letter of the law, article 121-5&lt;ref name="cp 121-5" /&gt; of the penal code, specifies that an attempted crime has occurred when the criminal action did not succeed solely because of circumstances independent of the defendant's actions.

The problem of an offender who flees in fear, for example, perhaps because he heard a noise, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Jurisprudence generally seems to lean towards impunity when the fear was spontaneous.

Voluntarily desisting must come before the action is taken in order to absolve the defendant of responsibility. Some specialized statutes reward active repentance after an offense is committed, the conspiracy statutes for example, but these remain the exception. Penal law does not as such take into account voluntarily desisting from further offenses after a crime has been committed, seeing this as remorse with no judicial value.

==== Moral element ====
The author of the attempted crime must have had the intent to carry it out. This element, which does not seem particularly remarkable at first glance, is nonetheless essential. This criminal intent justifies preventing attempted crime, regardless of any disturbances of the public order.

==== A special case of attempt: the impossible infraction ====
Impossible offenses are those which were not carried out, not because of clumsiness or a chance intervening event, but because of an objective impossibility to commit the offence.

Some impossibilities are legislated into criminality: for example, the old penal code defined a crime of aborting a woman believed to be pregnant. This can be compared to provisions that refer to real or supposed attributes of certain persons, especially in matters of discrimination (article 225-1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codesetlois.fr/codepenal/article225-1|title=Article 225-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code. It might seem impossible to be guilty of antisemitism towards a person who isn't Jewish, but this putative infraction is nonetheless outlawed.

Hypothetical impossible infractions unanticipated by legislators remain. Initially, 19th-century jurisprudence considered that if an offense was impossible it was also impossible to outlaw it. Since the offense had not been committed, the only possible grounds to prosecute it would be as an attempted crime.

The reasoning that leads to impunity relies on the very definition of an attempt: starting to execute the criminal action means performing the individual physical movements that lead directly and immediately to the criminal act. When the action is impossible there can exist no actions that tend to lead to it either directly or immediately. Therefore, no punishable attempted crime takes place; what does occur is a disturbance in the public peace.

This reasoning, which has legality going for it as well as a certain rationality, however, allowed offenders to escape prosecution who had nonetheless demonstrated their dangerousness and the irrevocability of their criminal determination. Faced with this reproach, jurisprudence took a middle path, seeking inspiration in doctrinal propositions which notably sought to distinguish between absolute and relative impossibility.

The former occurs when the object of the infraction does not exist, such as in the murder of a corpse, or when the means are intrinsically ineffective, such as poisoning with a non-toxic substance. Relative impossibility exists when the object of it exists but cannot for the moment be reached, or when the means used could have succeeded, a badly-aimed bullet for example. The doctrine also proposed a distinction between impossibility in fact (prosecutable) vs impossibility in law, where a critical element of the infraction is missing.

None of these criteria proved intellectually or judicially satisfactory. The Court of cassation, the French court of final appeal, eventually elected to systematically prosecute impossible infractions within its jurisdiction; see the ''Perdereau'' decision of 16 January 1986. In this case the crime was the attempted murder of a cadaver.

The Court of cassation underlined that the prior demise of the victim was a circumstance beyond the author's control, which could be analyzed as a failure to voluntarily desist, leading to the failure of the planned criminality. The court added that the violence done to the cadaver constituted a beginning to execute the murder. This interpretation does not correspond to the classic definition of beginning to execute; in no case can striking a cadaver lead directly or immediately or in the long term for that matter to the death of a human being.

It is a putative crime, which exists only in the mind of its author, but which is prosecuted because the blows that were struck were struck in the intention of committing the crime. The beginning of execution was not the primary element of this attempt; the attempted crime is used here more as a means to prove irrevokable intention.

Since this decision one may ask about the survival of classical solutions to imaginary infractions:
*is statutory rape carried out against an adult an attempted statutory rape?
*Planning an assassination that uses sorcery and spells, would that be attempted murder?
*Is theft of an object that one actually owns attempted theft

The doctrine excludes from proceedings the hypotheses about motive that they cannot attribute to any crime, contrary to the attempted commission of an impossible infraction it considered sufficient proof of intent to commit a crime. Still, a perceptible difference still separates a murderous attack that would have succeeded if the person had been alive from an allegedly sorcerous assassination, assuming that you don't believe in sorcerous assassination.

The danger is falling into mindless prosecution of simple thoughts and possibly of the desires or craving to do things the justice system would consider criminal, which would essentially amount to thought crime.

=== The accomplice ===
An accomplice furnishes help or assistance that facilitates the preparation or execution of a crime or other offence:"whoever by gift, promise, threat, order, or abuse of authority or power gives instructions to commit an infraction." &lt;!--''Qui par don, promesse, menace, ordre, abus d'autorité ou de pouvoir ou bien donne des instructions pour commettre une infraction.'' --&gt;

Complicity may be defined as a temporary, even momentary, understanding between individuals who are going to commit or try to commit one or more infractions. More simply, an accomplice participates in the action without himself needing to meet each element of the criteria that make up the infraction. As with the infraction itself, assessing the extent of complicity will depend in each case on legal, material and moral elements.

==== Material element ====
Legislators have narrowly and precisely defined the behaviors that can be charged as complicity:
* Help or assistance: Help with the preparation or commission of the offense. This can range from standing lookout to furnishing stamps for false [[documents]] to loaning a vehicle.
* Provocation or instigation: This behavior pushes the author of the offense to commit it, using a means foreseen by the legislation. Thus not all forms of provocation are punishable, only those carried out by:
** gift
** threat
** promise
** order
** [[abuse of authority]] or [[abuse of power|power]].
***Also, whatever method is used must be sufficiently suggestive, individual or direct. Simple advice or suggestion cannot be penalized. And the incitement must be followed by an effect; a murder committed two years later for completely different reasons cannot be criminalized.
* Instructions are information given to facilitate or allow commission of the offense, such as providing the floor plan of a bank building to a robber. For complicity to exist [[causality]] must be established.

Legislators have also provided for a number of cases where complicity is not punishable:

*passive assent
In principle, abstention is never punishable and this has been fairly consistent in case law. In some cases however the judge decided that inaction was punishable, especially where the person had a protective role towards the author, his parents for example, or people whose work this is, such as policemen or guards. Thus in 1989 a mother was found guilty of leaving a weapon available to her son, who used it to kill his father. This theory holds that an accomplice by abstention is punishable if he knew about the offense, and had the means to prevent it but refrained, so that the crime was committed.

*complicity after the fact
In principle help given after the primary act has been performed is not criminalized, but here too legislators have enacted exceptions, criminalizing certain behaviors such as concealing the fruit of a crime, or its author, for example. Case law holds that help after the fact constitutes complicity if it results from a prior agreement. (Although one might suppose that the help is actually constituted by the agreement itself; in effect, promising the offender assistance after the crime is what made up his mind to take action.) The Court of cassation seems to also endorse guilty findings when the offender is an habitual delinquent and the help encourages him to repeat his bad behavior.

==== Moral element ====
The material element cannot be the only criteria as this would engender a climate of suspicion harmful to society. So, therefore, a person can only become an accomplice willingly, and must be aware of the offender's plans and agree with them. Also, if the project described to the accomplice differs from the one that is carried out, the accomplice will only be held to account for the project of which he had knowledge. Therefore, if he loaned a firearm to intimidate and not to kill, he cannot be held responsible for the murder, although this requires also that the difference between the plan and the reality be noticeable. so if simple theft was intended and this became theft with breaking and entering this breaking and entering will be taken into account. Normally there can be no complicity in unintentional offenses but in certain cases, especially faults of imprudence, such as inciting someone to run a red light or to drive while drunk, complicity may be retained.

==== Legal element ====
Criminal law, unlike [[civil law (area)|civil law]], allows very little freedom of interpretation to the judge and the legislator must foresee that which légalement un acte de complicité et notamment la theory de l'emprunt de criminality
* The primary action must be a criminal offense: thus one cannot be prosecuted for having helped in the commission of an act which is not an infraction. The case of provocation to suicide mentioned above is an infraction in itself, although suicide itself is not.
*  In the old penal code the infraction must have had a certain severity (at least have been a misdemeanor) but under the new code it is possible to be an accomplice to a merely citable offense.
* The principal act must have been committed: an accomplice who organizes everything but whose principal author does not begin execution cannot be prosecuted. The infracrtion must at least have been attempted. If a fact may justify the infraction—legitimate defense for example—the infraction is erased and that of the accomplice as well. In cases of immunity, or theft between spouses, the accomplice cannot be prosecuted, unless the judge determines that the person presented as an accomplice is in fact a co-author, in which case he is still within reach of prosecution.

Procedurally the statute of limitations for an accomplice runs from the same day as for the principal author, and the withdrawal of a victim's complaint puts an end to prosecution of the accomplice as well. Amnesty for the infraction also benefits the accomplice.

Another question is whether it complicity in complicity is punishable. Article 121-7 specifies that a second-degree complicity is only legally punishable with respect to knowing or informed help or assistance, even through the intermediary of another accomplice in the case of fraud, but the [[Case law|jurisprudence]] is rather severe and generally finds complicity even in the third degree.

In addition, while it is necessary that the infraction be punishable for complicity to be punishable, the infraction need not necessarily be punished. A guilty verdict for the accomplice is not tied to the sanction of the principal author of the crime. Thus if the principal author is not prosecuted for reasons of dementia, the accomplice can still be prosecuted, and the same if the principal author has died or could not be arrested.

==== Sanction incurred ====

The principle in the old pernal code was that the accomplice and the author incurr the same penalties,

In the new code, the co-author does not necessarily face the same penally as the principal author. Also, he must have been able to commit the primary offense to be sentenced for it. For example, an individual cannot be charged with an offense that can only be committed by a member of law enforcement; he can at most be an accomplice.

Henceforth any personal circumstances that might play in the favor of a principal author no longer do the same for an accomplice, the same real circumstances of the act (break-in, provocation, carrying a weapon)that could be held for or against the principal author will do sa as well for the accomplice.

For example, in the case of a [[homicide]] committed by two persons, one of whom is the son of the victim, the latter, even if only an accomplice to the murder of his father, can receive as heavy a sentence as the principal author, since [[parricide]] constitutes a mixed aggravating circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opgie.com/cours/droit_penal_general/les_circonstances_aggravantes.htm Les circonstances aggravantes sur ''opgie.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persons responsible: the principle of responsibility for personal actions ==

=== Physical persons subject to criminal responsibility ===
* According to article 121-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-|title=1 Article 121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the new penal code, "none are penally responsible for any but their own actions." (''Nul n'est responsable pénalement que de son propre fait.'') In the old code this rule existed only in case law. One exception exists, the actions committed by a person under the authority of another. In this precise case, the person with authority can be found guilty of the actions committed by the person under his authority. Such would be the head of a company when an employee causes an accident while making a delivery for the enterprise. He can escape this responsibility by proving a prior delegation of authority, in which case the holder of the authority will be responsible.

==== Minors ====
Normally the attributes of the person do not affect his criminal responsibility, except for the one case where the person is a minor. This distinction is based in part on a difference between the abilities of children and of adults to understand mistakes. Minors, therefore, benefit from dedicated courts, but procedures and penalties also differ.

===== History =====
Until 1912, there were no court procedures specifically geared to minors. It was just generally understood that if a sentence were to be imposed on a minor, he benefitted from the "excuse of youth", which generally reduced the penalty by half.

The law of 22 July 1912 transformed the system by putting juvenile courts into place, along with an absolute presumption of non-responsibility for minors 13 and under. Special penalties were also created in the law, such as supervised freedom, which allowed the minor to be placed in an institution and thus to be re-educated.

Then came the ordonnance du 2 février 1945 on delinquent childhood, which while reworked several times, remains in effect today. In this system it is the personality of the author more than the act itself which enters into account. The system is above all preventive and more geared to avoiding recidivism than to sanctioning a mistake.

==== Advent of the responsibility of minors ====
In France, a minor of 13 cannot be sentenced to a penalty, but is nonetheless responsible for his actions. Article 122-8 of the ''code pénal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417221&amp;dateTexte=20081006|title=Article 122 B}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides that "Minors capable of discernment are penally responsible for the crimes, misdemeanors or offences of which they have been found guilty. &lt;!--(''Les mineurs capables de discernement sont pénalement responsables des crimes, délits ou contraventions dont ils ont été reconnus coupables'') --&gt;

While poorly written, Article 122-8 is without possible appeal: a minor who has discernment is responsible for his actions. Still, the many measures that apply to him tend to sow doubt among legal practitioners and some works still speak of the non-responsibility of delinquent juveniles.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The ordonnance n° 45-171 of 2 February 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081006|title=Ordonnance n° 45-174 du 2 février 1945 relative à l'enfance délinquante. - Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers the following categories of minor and the measures it envisages for them:
* Minor of 10 without discernment: absolute penal non-responsibility
* Minor of 13 with discernment (sole discretion of the judge, 8 years on average): incurs "infliction of educational measures".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=2BA05DF366407977DF26A1942BCC51D9.tpdjo04v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006495309&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081006&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between children younger than 10 and those aged 10–13 subject to educational sanctions,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=2BA05DF366407977DF26A1942BCC51D9.tpdjo04v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006495311&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081006&lt;/ref&gt; controversial measures since they sit at the border between penalty and education.
* Minor aged 13 to 16: Beyond educational measures the legal system tends to consider their responsibility attenuated and they incur only half of the common-law penalty, which cannot exceed 20 years of incarceration.&lt;ref name="legifrance 000006069158"&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=2BA05DF366407977DF26A1942BCC51D9.tpdjo04v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006495329&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081006&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,500 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=2BA05DF366407977DF26A1942BCC51D9.tpdjo04v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006495332&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minor aged 16 to 18: also has the benefit of the excuse of minority, but it can in principle be withdrawn in cases of a second repeat offense of specific offenses, or when "the circumstances of the case and the personality of the minor warrant this" ("lorsque les circonstances de l'espèce et la personnalité du mineur le justifient"&lt;ref name="legifrance 000006069158" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsi, dans l'Affaire Ghofrane Haddaoui, un cas de [[Stoning|lapidation]] en 2004, l'excuse de minorité a été refusée, et les auteurs condamnés à 23 ans de prison, voir [http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20070414.OBS1969/les_2_meurtriers_de_ghofranecondamnes_a_23_ans_de_priso.html « Les 2 meurtriers de Ghofrane condamnés à 23 ans de prison »] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007032542/http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20070414.OBS1969/les_2_meurtriers_de_ghofranecondamnes_a_23_ans_de_priso.html |date=2007-10-07 }}, 15 avril 2007, ''[[L'Obs|Le Nouvel Observateur]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Responsibility of leaders and deciders ===
To ensure that certain legal and regulatory provisions are complied with, legislators have over the 20th century accompanied them with penal sanctions.
Generally these have been obstructive offenses destined to prevent serious damage, for example in the case of hygiene and workplace security, of the environment, finance, union rights a collective framework: regulation of some economic activities, of paid work, of public open spaces.

For an infraction to be described as preventive it should not so much incriminate the damaging behavior as the omission of a behavior that is required by law.

How to impute a crime of omission to a person while respecting the principle of personal responsibility?

An offender will, logically, be a person that regulation had exhorted to act, only the person who has an obligation to act can be reproached with not acting.

Some legal obligations to act weigh individually on every citizen: assistance to persons in danger, refraining from homicides and wounding through carelessness.

Others have the specific trait of not being possible to be committed except in a social framework: regulation of certain economic activities, of salaried work, of public spaces.

The law addresses an injunction to leaders and decision-makers of the collective: whether corporate president, mayor of a municipality, chairman of the general council or manager of a business, the decision-maker must use his powers to monitor the respect of laws in place, either by obeying legal obligations or by monitoring the compliance of his subordinates.

If the moral element of the infraction no doubt belongs to the person who commits it, since the delegate has no autonomy, the perception of the material element is more problematic. If the decider had respected the law, he would have ordered the subordinate to act or not to act in a certain way; he would not have respected the restrictions of regulation but he would have had them respected by a subaltern. When they have not been respected the decision-maker appears not as a material author of the infraction but as a moral author, almost an accomplice. Often applied to infractions of omission, nonetheless, the distinction between a material author and one who simply had an offending desire is tenuous.

This is why one can reproach the director who was to respect and enforce the applicable rules of failing to do so. If the infraction was apparently committed by a third subordinate, the decider is indeed responsible for not having acted. This responsibility of the decider does not violate the principle of responsibility for personal actions. It also does not exonerate the subordinate of his own responsibility if the elements of an infraction can be imputed to him.

As well, the decider in principle must submit proof of his absence of fault, even if this proof would in practice be difficult to produce: the decider is assumed to know the rules that apply to his activity and is most often blamed for not respecting them or ensuring they are respected. Example: a mayor is personally guilty of favoritism because he set the agenda and presided over the meeting of the municipal council that violated legal restrictions (Crim. 19 novembre 2003).

When the decision-maker in fact is not the decision-maker in law, the Court of cassation adopts a solution similar to that of the civil jurisdictions in similar circumstances: the decision-makers are co-authors of the infraction, and each can be pursued as if he were the only decider (Crim. 12 septembre 2000).

The judicial administrator of a company, invested with the powers of the executive, also assumes his responsibility and qualities.

It has nonetheless appeared that in large hierarchies &lt;!--important (structures) --&gt; the decider is not in practice responsible for the entirety of the business' activities. Worse, the decider cannot materially meet all the obligations that weigh on him: the head of an enterprise should constantly pay heed that safety instructions are being followed by workers, the rules of accounting and billing by the accounting department, labor laws are followed by the personnel office, and the rules of sanitation by the maintenance and upkeep departments… it does not seem either just or opportune to impute to him an infraction when the power of decision lay with a third party.

This is the mechanism of delegation of power.

==== Delegation of power ====
The criminal responsibility of the decision-maker is tied to the powers he holds over the functioning of the enterprise: these are the powers which allow him to be reproached with not acting, or with allowing an infraction to be committed.

One cannot disassociate this responsibility from the qualities of the powers of the decision-maker. As a result, the delegation of power also carries with it onto this third party the attendant criminal responsibility. This logical solution was endorsed by the Cour de cassation from the very start of the 20th century (28 juin 1902).

Delegation of power is a consensual act between a delegating decision-maker and a delegatee subordinate; writing is useful only as proof. One can imagine subdelegations with the same conditions of dans les mêmes conditions of validity and effectiveness as the initial delegation. On the other hand, any co-delegation is ruled out: the delegate must enjoy an autonomy and power incompatible with the collective exercise of delegation.

La validity and effectiveness of the delegation of powers depend on several criteria brought out in the case law:

a. Delegation only exonerates of the responsibility in that capacity: in no case can a decider who personally took part in the consummation of an infraction avail himself of delegation. The decision-maker who personally takes part in the infraction is responsible for his personal actions and like any material author of the infraction he can be punished. Only the responsibility incurred by failing to fulfil the obligations specifically incumbent on his functions can benefit from delegation of powers.
Example : Crim. 17 septembre 2002, aggressive sales strategies, an element of fraud, remain imputable to the decision-maker despite the delegation of power, since he conceived and organized the strategies himself.

b. Delegation of powers is made necessary by the structure of the enterprise: only the decision-maker who cannot effectively assume his legal obligations can delegate his responsibilities to a third party. The mechanism of delegation of powers is not a means for the decision-maker to escape his criminal responsibility, but a mechanism to assure the effectiveness of legal limitations. It's when the scale or material organization of an enterprise do not allow a decision-maker to confront his obligations that delegation of power is authorized and even desirable. In the same spirit delegation cannot be general but must concern a precise sector of activity. This special character the delegation is strictly interpreted by judges.

Example: Crim. 14 octobre 2003, the delegation of power in hygiene and security to an administrator, president of the Committee of Hygiene Security and Work Conditions (CHSCT), the mandated committee in every workplace, does not transfer the responsibility for not consulting CHSCT: an interference has been committed by the company decision-maker. The Court of Cassation seems to distinguish "technical" delegation in matters of hygiene and security, concrete, and a delegation of judicial or administrative obligations tied to the functioning of the CHSCT.

c. The delegate is a member of the enterprise provided with the competence, authority, and necessary means: the decision-maker must designate one of his subordinates or possibly the head of a daughter organization in a group of companies who has the technical competence, authority and material means permitting him, in practice, to bring to a successful conclusion the mission assigned to him by the delegation.

These conditions are to avoid fictitious delegations. For a subordinate to assume the criminal responsibility attached to certain responsibilities, the decision-maker must have put him in a position to effectively ensure the respect of the law. The decider who proceeds to a judicial delegation without effectively transmitting his powers will remain responsible in that capacity for the delegated matter.

The finding of the existence and regularity of a delegation of powers assures stems from the sovereign power of lower-court judges, who often show themselves rather severe with deciders, distrusting fictive delegations: Crim 10 septembre 2002, for example, in a matter of asbestos which finds the general delegation of organization and supervision of construction site safety.

The effect of this responsibility in that capacity associated to the mechanism of the delegation of power is to give decision-makers a real duty to delegate their responsibilities as soon as they cannot assume them themselves, which ensures an maximum effectiveness of the regulation of their activity.

==== RPPM ====
To trigger the criminal responsibility of a corporation as author, the infraction must have been committed on behalf of the corporation by its agent or representative.

It's the mechanism for criminal responsibility by ricochet.

The corporation is not considered in criminal law as an autonomous person endowed with his or her power of decision and methods of action, but rather an abstract person incarnated by its representatives or agents.

RPPM is a mechanism that imputes to the corporation the offenses of one or more physical persons: the representative or the agent, in other words persons with the legal, statutory of conventional power to engage the corporation, and notably the delegate of a representative with the ability, authority and means  necessary to perform this mission.

An infraction committed by a stranger to the corporation, and sometimes by acts foreign to the scope of representation, or a crime which is not committed on behalf of the corporation (i.e. in its interest or in its name) cannot be imputed to it.

Imputation of an infraction to a corporation supposes the elements of the crime are present, and is more often done to physical people à une personne morale suppose la réunion de tous les éléments de l'infraction, le plus souvent sur la tête d'une personne physique identifiée, organe ou représentant de la personne morale.
Les juges ne peuvent en aucun cas établir l'existence des éléments de l'infraction directement dans le chef de la personne morale (Crim. 29 avril 2003).

A finding of non-responsibility for a representative or an agent in theory prevents the prosecution of corporations, even, it seems, in the case of a subjective cause of non-responsibility, a personal attributes of the agent such as demential, even though the solution is unclear in law.

A corporation constitutes an autonomous entity with a different judicial personality from that of its constituent parts. As, in theory, nothing allows applying to a person a subjective cause of non-responsibility applicable to a third party, il ne semble pas opportun de contrevenir à ce mécanisme dans l'hypothèse d'une personne morale, sauf à rompre l'égalité des justiciables devant la loi pénale.

The disappearance of the corporation naturally puts an end to prosecution, this even in the case of merger or acquisition. The principle of responsibility for personal actions runs counter to the acquiring entity or person of responsibility for infractions committed by the acquired business (Crim. 14 octobre 2003).

== Causes of criminal non-responsibility ==
If the author of an infraction has a cause for a finding of non-responsibility, he will not be condemned due to his absence of responsibility, even if the facts that constitute the infraction are established and guilt recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fxrd.blogspirit.com/archive/2008/02/15/les-faits-justificatifs.html|title=LES FAITS JUSTIFICATIFS|website=fxrd.blogspirit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctrine, like jurisprudence, operates a distinction that does not appear in the penal code among the objective causes of not-responsible findings, or justifying facts, or the subjective causes of non-responsibility, or non-imputability.

=== Objective causes of non-responsibility (justifying facts) ===
Objective causes of penal non-responsibility, also called justifying facts, erase the punishable nature of the act.  The impunity of the principal actor extends thereafter to the accomplice as well as the corporation.

Justifying facts are of three types:
*authorisation of the law, or order from a legitimate authority (article 122-4&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 122-4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-4|title=Code pénal – Article 122-4|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*legitimate defense (articles 122-5&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 122-5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-5|title=Code pénal – Article 122-5|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; et 122-6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-6|title=Code pénal – Article 122-6|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; )
*state of necessity (article 122-7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-7|title=Code pénal – Article 122-7|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Authorisation of the law, order from a legitimate authority ====
The authorisation of law or regulation reveals a contradiction between a criminal law text and another law text, whether it contains civil, administrative or penal law. Authorisation of regulation can only justify regulatory contraventions  and not violations of criminal law, as much because of the hierarchy of norms as because of the separation of the executive, legislative and judicial powers.

The liberal principle would have us believe that interdiction is always the exception when it comes to liberty, so authorisation in law must always weigh heavier than the prohibitions of a different law of the same type (valeur=value).

The most recent applications of the justifying facts concern use of force by the police and by the ''gendarmerie,'' medical acts, which are not qualified as violent if they are the acts of physicians and have a therapeutic motive. Also article 73 of the Code of penal procedure, which allows any citizen to arrest the author of a crime or misdemeanor punishable by a sentence of imprisonment, and to restrain that person until police arrive.

On January 5, 2000, the [[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] indicated that the justifying facts defense of authorization  under law extends to involuntary infractions committed in the course of the execution of an act authorized by law, for example, clumsiness of a ''gendarme'' caused the death of the person he was lawfully pursuing.

This assumes, of course that the criteria to apply that authorization to the given situation were all in place, and that it was absolutely necessary for example for the ''gendarme'' to use his weapon, Crim. 18 February 2003.

This decision confirms that [[authorization|authorisation]] of law is not a subjective cause of non-responsibility; authorization does not make the moral element disappear, or else imprudence would remain punishable.

Authorisation under low can only cover exactly the facts detailed as authorized in the legislation. Also, the duty de cohabitation which mandates spouses to maintain sexual relations doesn't authorize one of them to impose sexual relations on the other. The right to arrest and restrain the author of a flagrant misdemeanor does not permit molesting, searching or questioning him before the polica arrive.

Nor does an administrative notice, or autorisation to perfourrm an activity justify a violation of criminal law. Apparently the administrative authorities do not have the power to allow a behavior to escape from the scope of criminal law.

The Cour de cassation has found that the duty to assist a person in danger described in article 223-6 of the ''Code pénal'' did not justify the assistance given a miscreant by a nurse, once the services provided to him went beyond strictly necessary assistance required by the endangerment of the miscreant (Crim. 17 septembre 2003).

À l'autorisation de la loi, il convient d'associer la coutume qui permet des atteintes légères à la personne humaine sans que leur auteur puisse être inquiété : ainsi, le droit de correction des parents sur leur enfant, la pratique de sports violents ou la possibilité de réaliser des piercings et ou des tatouages sans être poursuivi pour violences volontaires.

==== Legitimate defense ====
Legitimate defense is provided by article 122-5&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 122-5" /&gt; of the penal code. This justifying fact benefits the person who, faced with an unjust and current attack against a person or a good, carries out a necessary, simultaneous and proportionate act in defense of that person or that good.

The elements of a legitimate defense are as follows:
* an unjust attack against oneself, others, or an asset. The unjust nature of the attack notably excludes legitimate violence like a policeman trying to protect the public order, or licit behaviours like confisating GMO corn.
* A concurrent attack, in other words, fighting back at the time of the attack. It is impossible to avail oneself of a legitimate defense argument for an act of  vengeance, for example where a victim fires at an aggressor who is already running away. On the other hand, a defense prepared in advance (setting traps, electric fences) is valid as long as the defensive measures do not execute until there is an actual attack.
* necessary retaliation: in other words, to counter the attack, commission of an illicit act is necessary; there is no legal alternative to the retaliation.
* a response proportionate to the attack: the value sacrificed must be less than the value protected; the reply must engender a lower social cost than if the attack had been carried out.

Jurisprudence has been able to clarify the conditions for laying a legitimate defense argument.

The actual and unjust character of the attack poses no serious application problem. When the attack is an action of a public authority, its injustice may be perceived in cases of manifest illegality (beatings and night raids).

The necessary and proportionate character of the response is itself subject to the assessment of lower-court juges, and in function of the entirety of the circumstances of fact. The [[Court of Cassation]] decisions of 6 December 1995 et 21 February 1996 reveal a victim seized by the collar found guilty for having responded with blows from sharp claws but recognized as a legitimate defense for shooting a bullet into heart of the aggressor.

In many affairs that take place at night, it can be seen that determining the necessary and proportionate character of the response does not depend on the reality of the aggression, but rather on its gravity as perceived by the author of the ''riposte''.

Rather than ponder the balance of interests that are really in play, the penal judge asks himself whether a reasonable person placed in the same situation would have reacted in the same way.

This subjective  approach, which can lead to a finding of an admissibility for a purely putative claim of legitimate defense, in reaction to an imaginary aggression, explains the refusal to justify as legitimate defense involuntary infractions. A prudent man can control his actions and responds in a proportionate manner to an aggression of which he is victim; he will not commit any imprudent or negligeant acts bringing about the wounding or death of his aggressor.

This approach also justifies denying the benefit of legitimate defense to one who does not know he is in a defensive position: for example, a person who joins a brawl for the pleasure of fighting and who by chance becomes part of a group of victims in a state of legitimate defense. Legitimate defense would protect someone who while committing an illicit act does not commit a fault, or who reveals his lack of social dangerousness.

==== Necessity ====
A state of necessity is a true justifying fact, which covers even involuntary infractions: ''Crim. 16 juillet 1986'' found a ''gendarme'' not criminally responsible for a bullet shot into the ground because he needed to intimidate someone, which wounded that person in a ricochet.

The determining criteria for the state of necessity to enter into play may be the balance between the protected interest and the sacrificed interest, as two arrests in the criminal chamber on May 11, 2004 . In this case (''appeal n° 03-80.254''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=cass. crim. 11 mai 2004, pourvoi n° 03-80.254|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007065989|website=Légifrance|date=11 May 2004|accessdate=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guilty verdict of trial court judges of  Sangachali-Duvanni on theft charges was overturned because the fraudulently-seized documents were to be used to defend of the accused in litigation with her employer. The upper court (Haute jurisdiction) effectively found that on the one hand the strictly necessary character of the documents to the defense of the prosecuted person was not researched by the lower-court judges, given that the theft of the documents was carried out only in the intention of "legitimately preserving proofs" in the context of a lawsuit. The appeals court confirmed the same day in another case (appeal  n° 03-85.521&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=Cour de Cassation, Chambre criminelle, du 11 mai 2004, 03-80.254, (cass. crim. 11 mai 2004 pourvoi n° 03-85.521)|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT000007071415&amp;fastReqId=39416319&amp;fastPos=1|website=Légifrance|date=11 May 2004|accessdate=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the acquittal of a person prosecuted on a charge of theft.

=== Subjective causes of non-responsibility (non-imputability) ===

==== Coercion ====
[[Duress|Coercion]] is the penal equivalent of ''force majeure''. It is an irresistible force. As in civil law, a debate exists concerning unforeseeability—is this a  condition for the implementation of the idea or is it a corollary of irresistibility, foreseeable events being by nature resistible? The criminal chamber has required that the constraint be unforeseeable and irresistible. The law, however, mentions only irresistibility.

Coercion can be physical or moral; the important criteria are its irresistible characture and its causal tie to the crime. Coercion is a cause of non-imputability, but it must have abolished the discernment of the victim to be taken into account.

This could take the form of a natural disaster of an illness of the actor: a driver who becomes unwell due to an illness he did not know he had, exonerates him of all criminal responsibility for the consequences of the accident he may have caused.

The classical example of a moral coercion is coercion which results from pressure or blackmail which has abolished the discernment of the victim. The Court of cassation has been able to find that the alleged pressure of the German authorities on the person of [[Maurice Papon]] did not abolish his free will and he, therefore, remained responsible for his complicity in crimes against humanity (Crim. 23 janvier 1997).

The coercion will not be taken into account if results from a fault or an imprudence of the person who acts. Thus, a person who knows himself subject to unwellness but who drives anyway, or who dozes off after starting a trip in an advanced state of fatigue, are responsible for homicide or involuntary wounding if they cause an accident.

==== Legal error ====
"Nemo censetur ignorare legem" (None should be ignorant of the law): the adage supplies a [[legal fiction]] (not a presumption or simple [[evidence (law)|proof]]) which is necessary to the functions of all judicial systems.

Law rests on its compulsory character and one cannot envisage a judicial system in which individuals could avail themshelves of their ignorance of the law to escape its application.

When the penal code was reformed the lawmakers attempted to satisfy the imperatives of clarity and accessibility and list possible infractions ''hors code'', outside the code, in the fifth book of the penal code. It appears that it was impossible to enumerate the entirety of the offenses extant and active in French law, but their numbers are estimated at 10,000.

This impossibility to know the exact contours of criminal law has led legislators to attenuate the fiction of knowledge of law by the introduction of error of law as a cause of non-responsibility. Article 122-3 of the penal code provides for the non-responsibility of a person who can prove having believed, by an error of law he could not avoid, that he could legitimately carry out the action in question. It is not so much a matter of proving one's ignorance of criminal law as it is of proving one's belief in the legality of the action in question.

The Court of Cassation has applied this cause of non-responsibility in a very restricted manner, finding for example that the error on the scope of a court decision caused by the legal counsel of the party is not necessarily an invincible defense, since the judge could be asked to interpret it ''(Crim. 11 octobre 1995)''. It has equally found that a company which had expanded its market after a (ministériel) indicated that it did not need an authorization had not committed an invincible error, because it could have consulted qualified jurists ''(Crim. 19 mars 1997)''.
It later formulated the principle that simple advice from a law professional does not constitute an error of law (Crim. 7 janvier 2004).

The court has accepted the non-responsibility of a head of an enterprise who merely applies a collective bargaining agreement signed under the aegis of a mediator designated by the government (Crim. 24 novembre 1998).

This cause of non-responsibility is used more widely by lower courts, generally censured by the Court of cassation, due to equity concerns. For example, the Paris Court of Appeals held that the mismatch between the case law of the  business and criminal chambers of the Court of cassation as to the legality of the documents photocopied by employees in order to produce them in justice had led the employee to an error of law preventing a guilty verdict for theft (''CA Paris, 9 novembre 2000, Crim.11 mai 2004'').

Beyond these three subjective causes of non-responsibility, immunities exist that stem from the personal qualities of the defendant, such as the application of Article 311-12 of the Code pénal, immunity of spouses, ascendant et descendant in matters of theft. Such immunities are personal causes of non-responsibility which do not apply to the accomplice or to the corporation; they are nonetheless not the same as a lack of moral elements and in this they approach the objective causes of non-responsibility.

==== Mental disturbance or dementia ====
Article 122-1 of the ''Code pénal'' says that a person "afflicted at the moment in question by a psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that abolishes his discernment or his control of his actions" will not be found criminally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|title=Chapitre II: Des causes d'irresponsabilité ou d'atténuation de la responsabilité|publisher=Légifrance|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=1E70007035452E506E3984590E742BE1.tpdila14v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006149818&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20150515|website=légifrance.gouv.fr|date=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the moment when the psychic or neuropsychic trouble declared itself, the person's charges could be dismissed by the  juge d'instruction, or receive an acquittal or not-guilty verdict in the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=L'irresponsabilité pénale des malades mentaux|trans-title=Lack of criminal responsibility in the mentally ill|url=http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc132/lc132_mono.html|website=senat.fr/|date=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person is considered a danger to society because of his mental disturbance, he can be committed to a mental institution. The prefect (préfet) decides what to do with the person in this case.&lt;ref name="sénat lc132"&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=L'irresponsabilité pénale des malades mentaux|url=http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc132/lc132_mono.html|website=senat.fr|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal responsibility of French politicians ==

=== Parliamentarians ===
In France, deputies and senators have parliamentary immunity which comes down to non-responsibility (fundamental immunity) and inviolability (immunity of procedure).

=== Local elected officials ===
Local elected officials in 1974 gained a jurisdictional privilege, notably prefects and magistrates. Instituted following the 5/7 dance hall fire and the subsequent  sentencing of then-mayor of [[Saint-Laurent-du-Pont]],  which made a powerful impression on the political class. This privilege allowed the investigation of crimes and misdemeanors of elected officials in another jurisdiction than their own, to avoid any partiality on the part of the judge, and was abolished with the reform of the penal code in 1993.

The implementation of decentralization has led to significant growth in 20-some years of the body of standards (more than 5,000 texts spread through 18 Codes) to which elected officials are subject, sometimes without having the means, especially in small municipalities, of applying them in practice. The areas of urban design, the environment, and the security of the financial markets are so many "infraction niches". Also, legislators have created unintentional misdemeanors, a straying from the principle that says "there is no crime of offence without the intention of committing it" (art. 121-3&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 121-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-3|title=Code pénal – Article 121-3|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; of penal code). Finally, in the context of an economic crisis and of competition between towns to attract businesses, some mayors have been brought to make perilous judicial combinations (''montages'').

Mayors may have felt like the "scapegoats of proximity democracy," in the words of Senator [[Hubert Haenel]], forced to limit their initiatives. So legislation therefore attempted to better frame the phenomenon, notably with the ''Fauchon'' law of July 10, 2000, on unintended misdemeanors (…).&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Christine Steckel, « Plaidoyer pour une dépénalisation des fautes non intentionnelles des élus locaux », Revue juridique – Droit prospectif, 2002, n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 1, pp. 427–447&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy [[Étienne Mourrut]] introduced a law concerning the criminal liability of elected local officials in sports or cultural demonstrations.

* 1991 : fall of a portico de basket à [[Saint-Denis (Seine-Saint-Denis)|Saint-Denis]]

'''David Wight Prall''' (1886–1940) was a [[aesthetics|philosopher of art]]. Born on 5 October 1886 in Saginaw, Michigan, Prall received his PhD in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1918.

Prall was Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University (1920–21; 1930–40). He taught also at Cornell (1910–12), the University of Texas (1912–14), Amherst (1918–19), and the [[University of California]] (1921–30). While at Harvard, Prall was a teacher and mentor to the notable composer and conductor, [[Leonard Bernstein]].

Prall died on 21 October 1940 in Cambridge. MA. His papers are held at Mills College, Oakland, California.

'''Eufrosin Poteca''' ({{IPA-ro|ˌe.ufroˈsin poˈteka}}; born '''Radu Poteca'''; 1786 – 10 December 1858) was a [[Romanian philosophy|Romanian philosopher]], [[theologian]], and translator, professor at the [[Saint Sava Academy]] of [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=ERom/&gt; Later in life he campaigned against slavery. He was the grandfather of the Romanian philosopher [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]].

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Poteca was born '''Radu Poteca''' in 1786, in the village of [[Nucșoara]], [[Prahova County]], in [[Walachia]], into a family of peasants.

He began his elementary education with the priest from the village's church, and continued his studies in a Greek-language school. In order to continue his education, he first went to Căldăruşani monastery and later to Neamţ monastery, the place where [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] had laid the basis of a strong [[hesychast]] monastic life. It is there that, in 1806, he became a monk and took the name "Eufrosin". In 1808 he moved to Bucharest. On March 28, 1809, he was ordained [[hierodeacon]], and on January 21, 1813, he was tonsured [[hieromonk]].

=== Studies ===

From 1813–1816 he studied under [[Konstantinos Vardalachos]], a famous professor of the time, at the Greek-language [[Princely Academy of Bucharest]]. From 1816 until 1818 Poteca was a teacher of [[dogmatics]] at the same Academy, which was then directed by [[Neophytos Doukas]]. In 1818, while [[Benjamin Lesvios]] was the director of the Greek-speaking Academy, [[Gheorghe Lazăr]] began giving lectures in Romanian, at the Saint Sava monastery, thus founding a Romanian-language Academy. Eufrosin Poteca became professor of [[geography]] at this Academy, between 1818–1820.

Eufrosin Poteca was one of four students sent abroad to study at Western universities by the Ephory  (office) of the Schools, as there was a perceived need for Romanian-speaking professors at the national schools. Between 1820–1823, he studied at the [[University of Pisa]] (Italian, Latin, philosophy, theology, history, politics, literature, experimental chemistry), and between 1823–1825 he studied at the [[University of Paris]].

=== Professorship ===

Returning to Walachia in October 1825, he was appointed Professor of philosophy at the [[Saint Sava Academy]], where he taught until 1828, when Bucharest was occupied by the Russian Army. In 1828–1829 he went to [[Buda]], where he printed his translation from [[Johann Gottlieb Heineccius]]'s work, ''Elementa Philosophiae Rationalis et Moralis'' (1726), a handbook of history of philosophy, logic and ethics. At the [[University of Pest]], he assisted at the lectures of [[Janos Imre]], an eclectic philosopher who promoted "critical-rational synthetism", a philosophy that made metaphysics possible against Kant, arguing that most metaphysical judgements are "analytical ''a priori''", judgements unaffected by the Kantian criticism of metaphysics.

In 1830 Poteca was forced to retire by General [[Kiseleff]], under the pretext that he was too old.  In fact, Poteca had been outspoken in his speeches that slavery should be abolished, because it contradicts both Christian religion and natural law. For Poteca the teachings of Jesus Christ were identical to those of the nature, and they could be synthesised in the [[Golden Rule]]; or, having slaves is against this moral principle. The Walachian [[boyars]] were in opposition to his opinions, and had decided to eliminate Poteca if he continued; the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] didn't approve of Poteca, because he resented fasting, the theology of death, and even celibacy. These were the true reasons for which Poteca was banned to the Gura Motrului monastery, in [[Oltenia]].

=== Later days ===

Beginning with 1832, Eufrosin Poteca spent his life at this monastery, as its [[hegumen]]. While there, he continued his cultural activity, translating and publishing works of Western authors. He had a relationship with the wife of a local priest (Orthodox priests can marry; they are not obligated to be celibate), from which resulted a son, Radu Popescu. His son, whose identity was not made public, was employed as his private secretary. Another son,  [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], was an important Romanian philosopher. Eufrosin Poteca died at this monastery, where he is buried, on December 10, 1858.

'''Evolutionary mismatch''', also known as mismatch theory or [[evolutionary trap]], is a concept in [[evolutionary biology]] that refers to evolved traits that were once advantageous but became [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] due to changes in the environment. This can take place in humans and animals and is often attributed to rapid environmental change.

[[File:Evolutionary Mismatch Timeline.png|thumb|Timeline showing a period of mismatch following an environmental change.]]
Mismatch theory represents the idea that traits that evolved in an organism in one [[Natural environment|environment]] can be disadvantageous in a different environment.  This environmental change leading to evolutionary mismatch can be broken down into two major categories: temporal (change of the existing environment over time, e.g. a climate change) or spatial (placing organisms into a new environment, e.g. a population migrating).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Elisabeth|last2=Wilson|first2=David Sloan|last3=Sober|first3=Elliott|year=2011|title=Evolutionary Mismatch And What To Do About It: A Basic Tutorial|journal=Evolutionary Applications|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since environmental change occurs naturally and constantly, there will certainly be examples of evolutionary mismatch over time. However, because large-scale natural environmental change – like a natural disaster – is often rare, it is less often observed. Another more prevalent kind of environmental change is anthropogenic (human-caused). In recent times, humans have had a large, rapid, and trackable [[Human impact on the environment|impact on our environment]], thus creating scenarios where it is easier to observe evolutionary mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lean|first=Judith L.|last2=Rind|first2=David H.|title=How Natural and Anthropogenic Influences Alter Global and Regional Surface Temperatures: 1889 to 2006|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|publication-date=16 September 2008|volume=35|issue=18|doi=10.1029/2008GL034864|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3518701L|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the mechanism of [[evolution]] by natural selection, the environment ("nature") determines ("selects") which traits will persist in a population. Therefore, there will be a gradual weeding out of disadvantageous traits over several generations as the population becomes more adapted to its environment. Any significant change in a population's traits that cannot be attributed to other factors (such as genetic drift and mutation) will be responsive to a change in that population's environment; in other words, natural selection is inherently reactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connallon|first=Tim|last2=Clark|first2=Andrew G.|year=2015|title=The Distribution Of Fitness Effects In An Uncertain World|journal=Evolution|volume=69.6|pages=1610–1618|doi=10.1111/evo.12673|pmc=4716676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly following an environmental change, traits that evolved in the previous environment, whether they were advantageous or neutral, are persistent for several generations in the new environment. Because [[Rate of evolution|evolution is gradual]] and environmental changes often occur very quickly on a geological scale, there is always a period of "catching-up" as the population evolves to become adapted to the environment. It is this temporary period of "disequilibrium" that is referred to as mismatch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mismatched traits are ultimately addressed in one of several possible ways: the organism may evolve such that the maladaptive trait is no longer expressed, the organism may decline and/or become extinct as a result of the disadvantageous trait, or the environment may change such that the trait is no longer selected against.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

As [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]] became more prevalent, scientists studied and attempted to explain the existence of disadvantageous traits, known as [[maladaptation]]s, that are the basis of evolutionary mismatch.

The theory of evolutionary mismatch began under the term [[evolutionary trap]] as early as the 1940s. In his 1942 book, evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] described evolutionary traps as the phenomenon that occurs when a genetically uniform population suited for a single set of environmental conditions is susceptible to extinction from sudden environment changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1942|isbn=0674862503|location=New York|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, key scientists such as Warren J. Gross and [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] have studied and identified numerous examples of evolutionary traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Warren J.|year=1955|title=Aspects of Osmotic Regulation in Crabs Showing the Terrestrial Habit|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=89|pages=205–222|doi=10.1086/281884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|year=1959|title=Adaptive Shift and Dispersal in a Tropical Ant Fauna|url=|journal=Evolution|volume=13|pages=122–144|doi=10.2307/2405948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term "evolutionary mismatch" may have been in a paper by Jack E. Riggs published in the [[Journal of Clinical Epidemiology]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=Jack E.|year=1993|title=Stone-age genes and modern lifestyle: Evolutionary mismatch or differential survival bias|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=46|pages=1289–1291|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/0895-4356(93)90093-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years to follow, the term evolutionary mismatch has become widely used to describe biological maladaptations in a wide range of disciplines. A coalition of modern scientists and community organizers assembled to found the Evolution Institute in 2008, and in 2011 published a more recent culmination of information on evolutionary mismatch theory in an article by [[Elisabeth Lloyd]], [[David Sloan Wilson]], and [[Elliott Sober]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution-institute.org/project/evolutionary-mismatch/|title=Evolution Institute Projects: Evolutionary Mismatch|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Evolution Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2018 a popular science book appeared by [[evolutionary psychologists]] on evolutionary mismatch and the implications for humans&lt;ref&gt;Giphart, R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2018). Mismatch: How our stone age brain deceives us every day (and what we can do about it). https://www.amazon.com/Mismatch-Stone-Brain-Deceives-Every/dp/B077BQ8VTX&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of the scientific community continue to explore the effects of evolutionary mismatch in our quickly changing world&lt;ref&gt;Giphart, R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2018).

== Mismatch in human evolution ==

=== The Neolithic Revolution: transitional context ===
The [[Neolithic Revolution]] brought about significant evolutionary changes in humans; namely the transition from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle, in which humans foraged for food, to an [[Agriculture|agricultural]] lifestyle. This change occurred approximately 10,000–12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordain|first=Loren|last2=Eaton|first2=S. Boyd|last3=Sebastian|first3=Anthony|last4=Mann|first4=Neil|last5=Lindeberg|first5=Staffan|last6=Watkins|first6=Bruce A.|last7=O'Keefe|first7=James H.|last8=Brand-Miller|first8=Janette|date=2005-02-01|title=Origins and evolution of the Western diet: health implications for the 21st century|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/2/341|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|language=en|volume=81|issue=2|pages=341–354|issn=0002-9165|pmid=15699220|doi=10.1093/ajcn.81.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|last=Barker|first=Graeme|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans began to domesticate both plants and animals, allowing for the maintenance of constant food resources. This transition quickly and dramatically changed the way that humans interact with the environment, with societies taking up practices of farming and animal husbandry. However, human bodies had evolved to be adapted to their previous foraging lifestyle. The slow pace of evolution in comparison with the very fast pace of human advancement allowed for the persistence of these adaptations in an environment where they are no longer necessary. In human societies that now function in a vastly different way from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, these outdated adaptations now lead to the presence of maladaptive, or mismatched, traits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giphart, R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2018). Mismatch: How our stone age brain deceives us every day (and what we can do about it). https://www.amazon.com/Mismatch-Stone-Brain-Deceives-Every/dp/B077BQ8VTX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, N. P., van Vugt, M., &amp; Colarelli, S. M. (2017). The Evolutionary Mismatch Hypothesis: Implications for Psychological Science. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 0963721417731378. https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417731378&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that some modern human populations engage in hunter-gatherer practices.

=== Human disease ===

==== Obesity and diabetes ====

Human bodies are predisposed to maintain [[homeostasis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SEM983GpkFoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=evolutionary+mismatch+theory+obesity&amp;ots=CRp6Iq7aMK&amp;sig=KJnOgEayLeZoKW0ptmTqJ2ZhjHg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Evolution of Obesity|last=Power|first=Michael L.|last2=Schulkin|first2=Jay|date=2013-01-02|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9781421409603|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when storing energy as fat. This trait serves as the main basis for the "thrifty gene hypothesis", the idea that "feast-or-famine conditions during human evolutionary development naturally selected for people whose bodies were efficient in their use of food calories".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/02/10/0963662510391733.full.pdf+html|title="Most people are simply not designed to eat pasta": evolutionary explanations for obesity in the low-carbohydrate diet movement|last=Knight|first=Christine|date=|website=pus.sagepub.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter-gatherers, who used to live under environmental stress, benefit from this trait; there was an uncertainty of when the next meal would be, and they would spend most of their time performing high levels of physical activity. Therefore, those that consumed many calories would store the extra energy as fat, which they could draw upon in times of hunger&lt;ref&gt;Giphart, R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2018). Mismatch: How our stone age brain deceives us every day (and what we can do about it). https://www.amazon.com/Mismatch-Stone-Brain-Deceives-Every/dp/B077BQ8VTX&lt;/ref&gt;.
.

However, modern humans have evolved to a world of more sedentary lifestyles and convenience foods. People are sitting more throughout their days, whether it be in their cars during rush hour or in their cubicles during their full-time jobs. Less physical activity in general means fewer calories burned throughout the day. Human diets have changed considerably over the 10,000 years since the advent of agriculture, with more processed foods in their diets that lack nutritional value and lead them to consume more sodium, sugar, and fat. These high calorie, nutrient-deficient foods cause people to consume more calories than they burn. Fast food combined with decreased physical activity means that the "thrifty gene" that once benefit human predecessors now works against them, causing their bodies to store more fat and leading to higher levels of obesity in the population.

Obesity is one consequence of mismatched genes. Known as "[[metabolic syndrome]]", this condition is also associated with other health concerns, including insulin resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-29716-3|title=Evolutionary Thinking in Medicine - Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-29716-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the body no longer responds to insulin secretion, so blood glucose levels are unable to be lowered, which can lead to [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].

==== Osteoporosis ====

Another human disorder that can be explained by mismatch theory is the rise in [[osteoporosis]] in modern humans. In advanced societies, many people, especially women, are remarkably susceptible to osteoporosis during aging. Fossil evidence has suggested that this was not always the case, with bones from elderly hunter-gatherer women often showing no evidence of osteoporosis. Evolutionary biologists have posited that the increase in osteoporosis in modern Western populations is likely due to our considerably sedentary lifestyles. Women in hunter-gatherer societies were physically active both from a young age and well into their late-adult lives. This constant physical activity likely lead to peak bone mass being considerably higher in hunter-gatherer humans than in modern-day humans. While the pattern of bone mass degradation during aging is purportedly the same for both hunter-gatherers and modern humans, the higher peak bone mass associated with more physical activity may have led hunter-gatherers to be able to develop a propensity to avoid osteoporosis during aging.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, D.E. 2013. The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease. Pantheon Books, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hygiene hypothesis ====
The [[hygiene hypothesis]], a concept initially theorized by immunologists and epidemiologists, has been proved to have a strong connection with evolutionary mismatch through recent year studies. Hygiene hypothesis states that the profound increase in allergies, autoimmune diseases, and some other chronic inflammatory diseases is related to the reduced exposure of the immune system to antigens. Such reduced exposure is more common in industrialized countries and especially urban areas, where the inflammatory chronic diseases are also more frequently seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garn|first=Holger|last2=Renz|first2=Harald|title=Epidemiological and immunological evidence for the hygiene hypothesis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0171298507000393|journal=Immunobiology|volume=212|issue=6|pages=441–452|doi=10.1016/j.imbio.2007.03.006|pmid=17544829|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prokopakis|first=Emmanuel|last2=Vardouniotis|first2=Alexios|last3=Kawauchi|first3=Hideyuki|last4=Scadding|first4=Glenis|last5=Georgalas|first5=Christos|last6=Hellings|first6=Peter|last7=Velegrakis|first7=George|last8=Kalogjera|first8=Livije|title=The pathophysiology of the hygiene hypothesis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165587613002139|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1065–1071|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.04.036|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent analysis and studies have tied the hygiene hypothesis and evolutionary mismatch together. Some researchers suggest that the overly sterilized urban environment changes or depletes the microbiota composition and diversity. Such environmental conditions favor the development of the inflammatory chronic diseases because human bodies have been selected to adapt to a pathogen-rich environment in the history of evolution.&lt;ref name="Hygiene"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sironi|first=Manuela|last2=Clerici|first2=Mario|date=2010-06-01|title=The hygiene hypothesis: an evolutionary perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S128645791000050X|journal=Microbes and Infection|volume=12|issue=6|pages=421–427|doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies have shown that change in our symbiont community can lead to the disorder of immune homeostasis, which can be used to explain why antibiotic use in early childhood can result in higher asthma risk.&lt;ref name="Hygiene" /&gt; Because the change or depletion of the microbiome is often associated with hygiene hypothesis, the hypothesis is sometimes also called "biome depletion theory".

=== Human behavior ===
Behavioral examples of evolutionary mismatch theory include the abuse of [[Dopaminergic pathways|dopaminergic pathway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and the [[reward system]]. An action or behavior that stimulates the release of [[dopamine]], a neurotransmitter known for generating a sense of pleasure, will likely be repeated since the brain is programmed to continually seek such pleasure. In hunter-gatherer societies, this reward system was beneficial for survival and reproductive success. But now, when there are fewer challenges to survival and reproducing, certain activities in the present environment (gambling, drug use, eating) exploit this system, leading to [[Behavioral addiction|addictive behaviors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37476697/Millenium_Article_Is_there_an_evolutionary_mismatch.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1478597241&amp;Signature=yh5h0Fobfb3V51Jhp0MQUkJ1R2o%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIs_there_an_evolutionary_mismatch_betwee.pdf|title=Is there an evolutionary mismatch between the normal physiology of the human dopaminergic system and current environmental conditions in industrialized countries?|last=Pani|first=L|date=2000|website=|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Lt|access-date=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, N. P., van Vugt, M., &amp; Colarelli, S. M. (2017). The Evolutionary Mismatch Hypothesis: Implications for Psychological Science. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 0963721417731378. https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417731378&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work stress ====
Examples of evolutionary mismatch also occur in the modern workplace. Unlike our hunter-gatherer ancestors who lived in small egalitarian societies the modern work place is large, complex, and hierarchical. Humans spend significant amounts of time interacting with strangers in conditions that are very different from those of our ancestral past. Hunter-gatherers do not separate work from their private lives, they have no bosses to be accountable to, or no deadlines to adhere to. Our stress system reacts to immediate threats and opportunities. The modern workplace exploits evolved psychological mechanisms that are aimed at immediate survival or longer-term reproduction. These basic instincts misfire in the modern workplace, causing conflicts at work, burnout, job alienation and poor management practices.&lt;ref&gt;Li, N. P., van Vugt, M., &amp; Colarelli, S. M.

==== Gambling ====
There are two aspects of gambling that make it an addictive activity: chance and risk. Chance gives gambling its novelty. Back when humans had to forage and hunt for food, novelty-seeking was advantageous for them, particularly for their diet. However, with the development of casinos, this trait of pursuing novelties has become disadvantageous. Risk assessment, the other behavioral trait applicable to gambling, was also beneficial to hunter-gatherers in the face of danger. However, the types of risks hunter-gatherers had to assess are significantly different and more life-threatening than the risks people now face. The attraction to gambling stems from the attraction to risk and reward related activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spinella|first=Marcello|title=EVOLUTIONARY MISMATCH, NEURAL REWARD CIRCUITS, AND PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLING|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|volume=113|issue=4|pages=503–512|doi=10.1080/00207450390162254|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drug addiction ====
Herbivores have created selective pressure for plants to possess specific molecules that deter plant consumption, such as [[nicotine]], [[morphine]], and [[cocaine]]. Plant-based drugs, however, have reinforcing and rewarding effects on the human neurological system, suggesting a "paradox of drug reward" in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=R.

In the last 10,000 years, humans found the [[dopaminergic system]], or reward system, particularly useful in optimizing [[Darwinian fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesse|first1=R.

Human ancestors lived in an environment that lacked drug use of this nature, so the reward system was primarily used in maximizing survival and reproductive success. In contrast, present-day humans live in a world where the current nature of drugs render the reward system maladaptive. This class of drugs falsely triggers a fitness benefit in the reward system, leaving people susceptible to drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durrant|first1=Russil|last2=Adamson|first2=Simon|last3=Todd|first3=Fraser|last4=Sellman|first4=Doug|title=Drug use and addiction: evolutionary perspective|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=10 Dec 2009|volume=43|issue=11|pages=1049–1056|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.3109/00048670903270449?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|accessdate=13 Nov 2016|doi=10.1080/00048670903270449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern-day dopaminergic system presents vulnerabilities to the difference in accessibility and social perception of drugs.

==== Eating ====
In the era of foraging for food, hunter-gatherers rarely knew where their next meal would come from. As a result, filling their stomachs up with lots of food was advantageous since food was scarce. Intense consumption of high-energy foods was selected for when the availability of food was low and it was more difficult to find. Now, food is readily available, and the neurological system that once helped people recognize the survival advantages of essential eating has now become disadvantageous as it promotes overeating. This has become especially dangerous after the rise of processed foods, as the popularity of foods that have unnaturally high levels of sugar and fat has significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666309005339|title=Compulsive overeating as an addiction disorder.

== Non-human examples ==
Evolutionary mismatch can occur any time an organism is exposed to an environment that does not resemble the typical environment the organism adapted in. Due to human influences, such as global warming and habitat destruction, the environment is changing very rapidly for many organisms, leading to numerous cases of evolutionary mismatch.

=== Examples with human influence ===

==== Sea turtles and light pollution ====
Female [[sea turtle]]s create nests to lay their eggs by digging a pit on the beach, typically between the high tide line and dune, using their rear flippers. Consequently, within the first seven days of hatching, hatchling sea turtles must make the journey from the nest back into the ocean. This trip occurs predominantly at night in order to avoid predators and overheating.
[[File:Baby sea turtles make their way toward the water.jpg|thumb|Hatchling sea turtles must make their way back into the ocean.]]
In order to orient themselves towards the ocean, the hatchlings depend on their eyes to turn towards the brightest direction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witherington|first=Blair|last2=Martin|first2=Erik|last3=Trindell|first3=Robbin|year=2014|title=Understanding, assessing, and resolving light pollution problems on sea turtle nesting beaches|url=http://f50006a.eos-intl.net/ELIBSQL12_F50006A_Documents/TR-2Rev2.pdf|journal=Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute Technical Report TR-2|edition=2|publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|volume=7|pages=+ 83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the open horizon of the ocean, illuminated by celestial light, tends to be much brighter in a natural undeveloped beach than the dunes and vegetation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coastal Roadway Lighting Manual: A Handbook of Practical Guidelines for Managing Street Lighting to Minimize Impacts to Sea Turtles.|publisher=Prepared for Florida Power and Light Company|year=1998|isbn=|location=Juno Beach, Florida|pages=5|quote=|via=|author=Ecological Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies propose two mechanisms of the eye for this phenomenon. Referred to as the "raster system", the theory is that sea turtles' eyes contain numerous light sensors which take in the overall brightness information of a general area and make a "measurement" of where the light is most intense. If the light sensors detect the most intense light on a hatchling's left side, the sea turtle would turn left. A similar proposal called the complex phototropotaxis system  theorizes that the eyes contain light intensity comparators that take in detailed information of the intensity of light from all directions. Sea turtles are able to "know" that they are facing the brightest direction when the light intensity is balanced between both eyes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This method of finding the ocean is successful in natural beaches, but in developed beaches, the intense artificial lights from buildings, light houses, and even abandoned fires overwhelm the sea turtles and cause them to head towards the artificial light instead of the ocean. Scientists call this misorientation. Sea turtles can also become disoriented and circle around in the same place.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Numerous cases show that misoriented hatchling sea turtles either die from dehydration, get consumed by a predator, or even burn to death in an abandoned fire. The direct impact of [[light pollution]] on the number of sea turtles has been too difficult to measure. However, this problem is exacerbated because all species of sea turtles are endangered. Other animals, including migratory birds and insects, are also victims to light pollution because they also depend on light intensity at night to properly orient themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Blair; Martin, Erik; Trindell, Robbin (2014).

==== Dodo bird and hunting ====
[[File:Dodo reunion-Rothschild.jpg|thumb|Dodo birds became completely extinct due to hunting.]]
The [[Dodo|Dodo bird]] lived on a remote Island, [[Mauritius]], in the absence of predators. Here, the Dodo evolved to lose its instinct for fear and the ability to fly. This allowed them to be easily hunted by Dutch sailors who arrived on the island in the late 16th century. The Dutch sailors also brought foreign animals to the island such as monkeys and pigs that ate the Dodo bird's eggs, which was detrimental to the population  growth of the slow breeding bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oksanen|first1=Markku|title=Species Extinction and Collective Responsibility|journal=The Proceedings of the Twenty-First World Congress of Philosophy|volume=3|pages=179–183|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=wcp21&amp;id=wcp21_2007_0003_0179_0183|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their fearlessness made them easy targets and their inability to fly gave them no opportunity to evade danger. Thus, they were easily driven to extinction within a century of their discovery.

The Dodo's inability to fly was once beneficial for the bird because it conserved energy. The Dodo conserved more energy relative to birds with the ability to fly, due to the Dodo's smaller pectoral muscles. Smaller muscle sizes are linked to lower rates of maintenance metabolism, which in turn conserves energy for the Dodo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNab|first1=Brian K.|title=Energy Conservation and the Evolution of Flightlessness in Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 January 1994|volume=144|issue=4|pages=628–642|jstor=2462941|accessdate=|doi=10.1086/285697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking an instinct for fear was another mechanism through which the Dodo conserved energy because it never had to expend any energy for a stress response. Both mechanisms of conservation of energy was once advantageous because it enabled the Dodo to execute activities with minimal energy expenditure. However, these proved disadvantageous when their island was invaded, rendering them defenseless to the new dangers that humans brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Elisabeth|last2=Wilson|first2=David Sloan|last3=Sober|first3=Elliott|year=2011|title=Evolutionary Mismatch And What To Do About It: A Basic Tutorial|url=https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mismatch-Sept-24-2011.pdf|journal=Evolutionary Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peppered moths during the English Industrial Revolution ====
Before the English [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries the most common phenotypic color of the [[peppered moth]] was white with black speckles. However, that changed when the Industrial Revolution produced high levels of pollution. Due to the Industrial Revolution the trees blackened in urban regions, causing the original phenotype to stand out significantly more to predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cofnas|first=Nathan|date=2016-01-01|title=A teleofunctional account of evolutionary mismatch|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|volume=31|pages=507–525|doi=10.1007/s10539-016-9527-1|issn=0169-3867|pmc=4901103|pmid=27358505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection then began favoring the rare dark peppered carbonaria moth in order for the species to camouflage and prevent attacks. The dark moth's population expanded rapidly and by the 1950s vast amounts of England saw carbonaria frequencies rise above 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=20a9c499-64e3-45a3-baee-18a01a2cef60@sessionmgr1|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The once favorable white speckled phenotype quickly became mismatched in the new environment.

However, in the late 1900s, the English made efforts to reduce air pollution, causing the trees to turn back to their normal shade. The change in color lead the dark skin phenotype to revert from beneficial to disadvantageous. Once again, the moth was not able to adapt fast enough to the changing environment and thus the carbonaria phenotype became mismatched. Since the trees' return to their natural color caused the original phenotype to become advantageous again since it allowed the peppered moth to hide from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=L.

==== Giant jewel beetle and beer bottles ====
[[File:Buprestidae - Julodimorpha bakewelli.JPG|thumb|232x232px|The Jewel Beetle has a shiny, brown exterior similar to that of a beer bottle]]
Evolutionary mismatch can also be seen among insects. One such example is in the case of the [[Julodimorpha bakewelli|Giant Jewel Beetle]] (''Julodimorpha bakewelli)''. The male jewel beetle has evolved to be attracted to certain features of the female jewel beetle that allow the male jewel beetle to identify a female as it flies across the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://insects.about.com/od/beetles/ss/The-Giant-Jewel-Beetle-That-Mates-With-Beer-Bottles.htm|title=The Giant Jewel Beetle That Mates With Beer Bottles|newspaper=About.com Education|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features include size, color, and texture. However, these physical traits are seen manifested in beer bottles as well. As a result, male jewel beetles often consider beer bottles more attractive than female jewel beetles due to the beer bottle's large size and attractive coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534702025806|title=Ecological and evolutionary traps|access-date=2016-11-16 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02580-6|volume=17|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|pages=474–480|year=2002 | last1 = Schlaepfer | first1 = Martin A. | last2 = Runge | first2 = Michael C. | last3 = Sherman | first3 = Paul W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer bottles are often discarded by humans in the Australian desert that the jewel beetle thrives in, creating an environment where male jewel beetles prefer  to mate with beer bottles instead of female jewel beetles. This is a situation that is extremely disadvantageous as it reduces the reproductive output of the jewel beetle as fewer beetles are mating. This condition can be considered an evolutionary mismatch, as a habit that evolved to aid in reproduction has become disadvantageous due to the littering of beer bottles, an anthropogenic cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Bruce A|last2=Chalfoun|first2=Anna D|date=2016-12-01|title=Evolutionary traps as keys to understanding behavioral maladapation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154616301577|journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences|series=Behavioral ecology|volume=12|pages=12–17|doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== House finches and the introduction of the MG disease ====

Evolutionary mismatch occurs in [[Finch|house finches]] when they are exposed to infectious individuals. Male house finches tend to feed in close proximity to other finches that are sick or diseased. This is due to the fact that sick individuals are less competitive than usual, in turn increasing the chances of the healthy male to win an aggressive interaction if it happens. To ensure that there is a lower possibility of losing a social confrontation, healthy finches are inclined to forage near individuals that are lethargic or listless due to disease.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouwman|first=Karen M.|last2=Hawley|first2=Dana M.|date=2010-08-23|title=Sickness behaviour acting as an evolutionary trap?

Since this disease is infectious, healthy finches will be in danger of contraction if they are in the vicinity of individuals that have previously developed the disease. The relatively short duration of the disease's introduction has caused an inability for the finches to adapt quickly enough to avoid nearing sick individuals, which ultimately results in the mismatch between their behavior and the changing environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Exploitation of earthworm's reaction to vibrations ====
[[Worm charming]] is a practice used by people to attract [[earthworm]]s out of the ground by driving in a wooden stake to vibrate the soil. This activity is commonly performed to collect fishing bait and as a competitive sport. Worms that sense the vibrations rise to the surface. Research shows that humans are actually taking advantage of a trait that worms adapted to avoid hungry burrowing moles which prey on the worms. This type of evolutionary trap, where an originally beneficial trait is exploited in order to catch prey, was coined the "rare enemy effect" by [[Richard Dawkins]], an English evolutionary biologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catania|first=Kenneth|date=2010-01-01|title=Worm Charmers|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v302/n3/full/scientificamerican0310-72.html|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=302|issue=3|pages=72–76|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0310-72|bibcode=2010SciAm.302c..72C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trait of worms has been exploited not only by humans, but by other animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5180">{{about-distinguish2|the fictional religion in ''Babylon 5''|[[Foundationalism]], a concept in epistemology}}
'''Foundationism''' is a fictional religion in depicted in the 1993 – 1998 American [[Science fiction on television|science fiction television series]] ''[[Babylon 5]]''. It is presented as an [[Earth]] religion, one of several that appeared around the time the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] aliens made [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with the humans of the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] in 2156.&lt;ref name=ItSoZ&gt;[[In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
The intent behind the new religion was to get back to the roots of all Earth religions, past disparate doctrines to the core foundations of each belief system to find out what they have in common, proposing that they are more similar than might be expected. It further asserted that the core foundations of these religions often get obscured by politics, money, nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meditations on the Abyss]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core tenets of Foundationism is that God is too big to be defined by words and that the closer one gets to defining God, the further away one gets: a principle Foundationists compare with [[Zeno's paradox]].&lt;ref name=ItSoZ /&gt;

Foundationism also teaches that, if careless, one can (metaphorically) lose oneself in the world. A person can become too busy living someone else's agendas, fighting someone else's battles, and doing work others expect them to be doing. Eventually the person will come to a fork in the road and, because they are distracted, will lose themselves. Part of the person goes right, and the rest, the really important part, goes left. The person will not realize they have done this until they finally discover that they do not have any idea who they are when they are not doing all those things. To deal with this crisis, Foundationism adopted the [[Aboriginal Australian]] rite of passage known as "[[Walkabout]]". The person having lost oneself would leave everything and start walking and keep on walking until they (metaphorically) meet themselves. The person would then sit down and have a long talk with their "self", about everything they have learned and felt, until they run out of words. The latter is vital on the principle that truly important things cannot be said. If the person is lucky, they will look up and just be themselves. Then they can go home.&lt;ref name=WkAbt&gt;[[Walkabout (Babylon 5)|Walkabout]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known adherents==
* '''[[Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)|Stephen Franklin]]''': In 2260, following an addiction to stims and the realisation that he did not know who he was when he was not being a doctor and decided to go walkabout. The experience did not go as he expected, though he did come to the realisation that the core of his problems was his tendency to define himself based on what he was not, rather than what he was. When asked what he was he said: ''"Alive. everything else is negotiable."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Shadow Dancing (Babylon 5)|Shadow Dancing]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Andre Sabot''': A former priest in the foundationist church, who went on to join the [[doomsday cult]] Sacred Omega.&lt;ref name=RftT&gt;[[Ruling from the Tomb]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Leon Henderson''': A doctor and a foundationist priest who inspired Trace Miller to study for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=RftT /&gt;
* '''Trace Miller''': Began his association with the foundationist church by doing scutwork as a way to make ends meet, though over time, Leon Henderson made him think a lot about doing God's work and inspired him to begin studying to be a foundationist priest. That was until he and God had, in his words, a "falling out."&lt;ref name=RftT /&gt;

==Behind the scenes==
* [[J.

__ForceTOC__
== Life==
Dallmayr was born on October 18, 1928 in [[Ulm]], Germany and raised in [[Augsburg]], Germany. World War II had a profound impact on his intellectual and political development. “I feel that, in large measure, I can trace my persistent opposition to war and violence—especially aggressive warfare—to this youthful experience.”&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, ''On the Boundary: A Life Remembered'', Lanham, MD: Hamilton Books, 2017, 10. {{ISBN|9780761869566}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he received the degree of Doctor of Law from the University of Munich. In 1954–1957, he attended the Institute of European Studies (Istituto Universitario di Studi Europei) in Turin, Italy, under the mentorship of [[Norberto Bobbio]]. In 1955–1956, he studied at [[Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], USA. In 1957, he was admitted to Duke University, North Carolina, USA, taking the PhD in Political Science in 1960. He taught at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor and Associate Professor (1963–1971), and then as Professor and Head of Department of Political Science (1973–1978). Since 1978, he has taught at Notre Dame, and is currently Packey J. Dee Professor of Government emeritus. He has been a visiting Professor at the [[University of Hamburg]], Germany (1971–72, 1976, and 1986). He has also been Werner Marx Visiting Professor in Philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York (1988), a Fellow at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], and a Fulbright research scholar, at the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]] (MSU), Vadodara, Gujarat, India (1991–1992). During trips to India, China, Japan, Malaysia, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries, he established close collaborative relationships with many prominent philosophers and has been able to learn in-depth their cultural and philosophical traditions. He has maintained dialogues with philosophers such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Paul-Michel Foucault]], as well as [[Karl-Otto Apel]], William McBride, [[Seyla Benhabib]], [[Iris Marion Young]], [[David M. Rasmussen]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Bhikhu Parekh]], [[Ashis Nandy]], and [[Tu Weiming]], among others.

== Major philosophical themes==
Dallmayr's research interests include contemporary philosophy and political theory; especially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]; [[hermeneutics]]; [[critical theory]]; [[deconstruction]]; democratic theory; [[intercultural philosophy]]; and non-Western philosophical and political thought.  He has written on G. W. F. Hegel, [[Martin Heidegger]], Gadamer, [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]]; [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Karl-Otto Apel]], [[Louis Althusser]], Foucault, Derrida, [[Paul Tillich]], [[Raimon Panikkar]], and [[Enrique Dussel]]. Dallmayr's philosophy is characterized by the transformative impulse, fostering both the change that takes place in the development of philosophy and the role of philosophy in understanding and transforming human beings in their cultural manifestations and in social interactions.

Dallmayr's philosophy and political theory favors self-other relations over ego, dialogue over monologue, relationality over static identity, ethical conduct over the abstract knowledge of normative rules, equal democratic lateral relationships over hierarchies of domination, and intercultural and cosmopolitan perspectives over chauvinistic hegemonism. He has been a critic of liberal democracy, and has elucidated alternative conceptions of “apophatic” democracy or “democracy to come.”&lt;ref&gt; Fred Dallmayr, “Apophatic Democracy?” in ''Democracy to Come: Democracy as Relational Praxis.'' Oxford University Press, 2017. e-book. {{ISBN|9780190670986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to the dichotomies of Western philosophy, Dallmayr's overall perspective aims to steer a course between [[universalism]] and particularism, between [[globalism]] and localism, between Western modernity and tradition, and between Western and non-Western traditions of philosophical and religious thought. He firmly upholds the transcendent or trans-mundane status of the ideas of truth, goodness and justice, while simultaneously insisting on the need to interpret these ideas and to translate them into a commitment to justice and peace among people in this world.   

In developing his philosophy, Dallmayr acknowledges his debt to phenomenology, hermeneutics, critical theory, and deconstructionism. From his earliest works, Dallmayr has consistently confronted Cartesian ''cogito'' and its oppositions (subject and object, human being and world). He criticizes the egocentrism of modern Western thought, including its “anthropocentric and subjectivist thrust” and “possessive individualism.”&lt;ref&gt; Fred Dallmayr,  “Beyond Possessive Individualism” in  ''Twilight of Subjectivity: Contributions to a Post-Individualist Theory''. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press,1981, 8ff. {{ISBN|9780870233142}} .&lt;/ref&gt; Yet this critique does not mean anti-humanism and the “end of man,” as advocated by some postmodern thinkers. He does not disregard the individual subject, but rather revises it as an emergent and relational being capable of transformation. To the metaphysical paradigm rooted in individual subjectivity he opposes the emerging outlook emphasizing human connectedness, anchored in (Heideggerian) “care” (''Sorge'') and “solicitude” (''Fürsorge''). Dallmayr outlines a post-individualist theory of politics, which does not simply reject individualism but seeks to divest it of its anthropocentric, “egological,” and “possessive” connotations. Dieter Misgeld noted that Dallmayr has “a post-individualist theory of politics and post-liberal moral and political thinking as his themes, as well as a theory of embodied intersubjectivity meant to be foundational for a theory of politics.”&lt;ref&gt; Dieter Misgeld, “Philosophy and politics: On Fred Dallmayr's ‘Critical Encounters,’” ''Human Studies,'' March 1991, Volume 14, Issue 1: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Dallmayr on Heidegger===
Dallmayr's brings an original interpretation of Heidegger's works. He was among the first in the English-speaking world to realize that Heidegger's philosophical work “was much broader than the particular Nazi episode.”&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''On the Boundary'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He has elucidated Heidegger's work in several of his own major works.&lt;ref&gt;Dallmayr, ''Twilight of Subjectivity'', 56ff.; Fred Dallmayr, ''The Other Heidegger''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9780801429095}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He uncovered fruitful contributions of Heidegger's work, which are relevant to contemporary social and political thought. He also delineated the contours of an alternative political perspective in Heidegger's thought. 

Dallmayr highlights the importance of Heidegger's critique of Western metaphysics, especially Cartesian rationalism with its focus on the ''cogito'', which was the root of the split between mind and matter, subject and object, self and other, humans and the world. In contrast to these divisions, Heidegger's definition of human existence as being-in-the-world conceptualizes “world” in its many dimensions as a constitutive feature of existence as such. In opposition to traditional formulations, being could not be grasped as a substance or fixed concept but needs to be seen as a temporal process or happening, an ongoing disclosure (and sheltering) of meaning in which all beings participate.&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''On the Boundary'', 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
With Heidegger, Dallmayr goes beyond the self-centered type of [[existentialism]]. He interprets ''Dasein'' (human existence) in ''Being and Time''&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time: A Translation of'' Sein und Zeit, translated by Joan Stambaugh. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1953. {{ISBN|9780791426777}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  as not a self-constituted or a fixed substance, but open-ended and potentially transformative, “a being moved by ‘care’ (''Sorge'')  in an ongoing search for meaning and truth.”&lt;ref&gt; Fred Dallmayr, ''Against Apocalypse: Recovering Humanity’s Wholeness''. Lexington Books, 2017, 83. {{ISBN|9781498524469}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He also explicates Heidegger’s other key concepts, such as letting-be (''Seinlassen''), event (''Ereignis''),&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Das Ereignis'' (Event), edited by Friedrich-Wilhelm von Hermann. Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 2009. {{ISBN|9783465036418}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and dwelling (''wohnen''), to move his political philosophy beyond the traditional paradigm, rooted in individual subjectivity, toward a view of human beings and society that emphasizes human connectedness and relationality. Above all, he shows that for Heidegger every substance is marked by division, every unity or community by “difference” (''Unterschied'').   The central issue is how togetherness and separation, unity and difference “belong together.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Identität und Differenz''. Neske, Pfullingen 1957, 1978. {{ISBN|3788501146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dallmayr relates what he learns from Heidegger to political philosophy, asking questions, such as: “What is the status of individualism and of traditional Western humanism?” and “How should one construe the relations between self and other human beings bypassing the options of contractual agreement and simple rational convergence?”&lt;ref&gt;Dallmayr, ''On the Boundary'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He focuses on the status of the individual as political agent; the character of the political community; the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and the problem of an emerging cosmopolis, or world order, beyond the confines of Western culture.&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''The Other Heidegger''; Fred Dallmayr, ''Between  Freiburg and Frankfurt: Toward a Critical Ontology''. Amherst, University of Massachusetts Press, 1991. e-book. {{ISBN|9780585178783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He articulates from a philosophical perspective the relevance of Heidegger's diagnosis of the condition of contemporary society characterized by mass culture, the depersonalized “they” (''das Man''), the instrumental reason, oppressive power (''Macht'') and manipulative domination or machination (''Machenschaft''). Dallmayr shows the relevance of Heidegger as a thinker who was able to realize the dramatic situation of Western civilization and to see the root causes of its problems, which continued to escalate ever since. The qualitatively new perspective, highlighted by Dallmayr, is that contradictions and perilous tendencies in Western society are now escalating to the level of being global problems, which put us at the precipice of self-destruction—nuclear or ecological.

===Dialogue and intercultural philosophy===
Dallmayr sees the problems of Western modernity in the monologic mindset, which was rooted in Cartesian ''ego cogito'' and became an instrumental rationality coupled with egocentric will to power and domination. He advocates for dialogue in theory and practice, as a means to overcome monologic unilateralism and for establishing the relationships of mutual understanding and collaboration, aiming for peaceful coexistence and justice. He has elucidated the dialogical motifs in the works of [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]], Gadamer, [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and Panikkar, among others. 

Starting with the etymology of the word “dialogue,” which comes from the Greek and is composed of two parts: “dia” and “logos,” Dallmayr explains that “dia-logue” means that reason or meaning is not the monopoly of one party but emerges in the intercourse or communication between parties or agents. In the twentieth century, the turn towards dialogue can be seen as part and parcel of the so-called linguistic turn. He writes, “Associated prominently with the names of [[Wittgenstein]], Heidegger, Gadamer, and Bakhtin, this turn has placed into the foreground the necessarily ‘relational’ or dialogical character of human thought and conduct.”&lt;ref&gt; Fred Dallmayr, ''Mindfulness and Letting Be: On Engaged Thinking and Acting''. London: Lexington Books, 2014, 104. {{ISBN|9780739199862}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his words, dialogue means to approach alien meanings of life-forms in a questioning mode conducive to a possible learning experience.  In the political arena, this turn has led to the re-invigoration of the public sphere and the expansion of the public domain in a global and cross-cultural direction.

Dallmayr believes in the fundamental character of dialogue and its indispensability for a proper human interaction. He emphasizes Gadamer’s idea that every inter-personal encounter and every interpretation of texts involves dialogue in search for the meaning, and that the ethical precondition to genuine dialogue is to have good will and the recognition of the other as equal. As Dallmayr pointed out in an interview with Ghencheh Tazmini, “Genuine dialogue requires not only talking but a great deal of listening”.&lt;ref&gt; "Fred Dallmayr in conversation with Ghencheh Tazmini," in ''22 Ideas to Fix the World: Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers''. Edited by Piotr Dutkiewicz and Richard Sakwa, 286-301. New York: New York University Press, 2013, 286. {{ISBN|9781479860982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He stresses the importance of an authentic dialogue and elaborates on Panikkar's conception of “dialogical dialogue” and interreligious dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, ''Spiritual Guides:  Pathfinders in the Desert''. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2017. e-book. {{ISBN|9780268102593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His appreciation of the dialogical trends in Western thought served as “possible springboards to broader, cross-cultural or trans-cultural explorations.”&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''On the Boundary'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Dallmayr broadened his intercultural horizon through engagement in dialogue with the philosophical traditions of India, China, and the Islamic world.  His encounters with Eastern philosophical cultures resulted in a transformative turn in Dallmayr's philosophical path. This strengthened his critical views of Eurocentric self-enclosure, anthropocentrism, and cognitive self-sufficiency. At the same time, it deepened his appreciation of the best in Europe's philosophical traditions. This helped to the development of his intercultural philosophy. 

===Cross-cultural political theory=== 
Dallmayr is engaged in rethinking some of the central concepts of Western political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt; See Stephen K. White, ed. ''Life-World and Politics: Between Modernity and Postmodernity: Essays in Honor of Fred R. Dallmayr''. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1989. {{ISBN|9780268012892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He challenges the predominance of a “subjectivity” and anthropocentric individualism, articulating alternative post-individualist or post-egocentric conceptions of selfhood and of politics as relational praxis. He elaborates on the post-anthropocentric and relational conception of the political community, viewing it as a differentiated wholeness combining both freedom and solidarity.

He contributes to the development of “critical phenomenology.” In Kenneth Colburn Jr's words, “Fred Dallmayr is without doubt one of the leading theoretical phenomenologists of our time in the social sciences.”&lt;ref&gt; Kenneth Colburn Jr. “A critical encounter with Fred Dallmayr: Introduction,” ''Human Studies'', March 1991, Volume 14, Issue 1: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] tries to relate the subject and the world of phenomena through an act of focused intention, and when combined with the resources of critical theory, it produces a critical phenomenology of politics. In it, phenomenology orients toward concrete human experience, while critical theory focuses on critiquing the effects of domination and exploitation in that experience.&lt;ref&gt; Fred Dallmayr, ''Beyond Dogma and Despair: Toward a Critical Phenomenology of Politics''. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981. {{ISBN|9780268006617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farah Godrej, “Dallmayr is widely acknowledged to be one of the primary forces behind the inauguration of this field of cross-cultural theory, also called ‘comparative political theory.’”&lt;ref&gt; Farah Godrej, “Introduction,” in ''Fred Dallmayr: Critical Phenomenology, Cross-Cultural Theory, Cosmopolitanism''. Edited by Farah Godrej, 1-9. New York: Routledge, 2017, 3-4. {{ISBN|9781138955936}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying his intercultural perspective, he has written extensively on political thought in India, in the Far East, and in Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr and Peter R. Moody, “Non-Western Political Thought,” special issue of ''The Review of Politics'' 59 no. 3 (1997): 421–647; Fred Dallmayr, ''Comparative Political Theory: An Introduction''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010. {{ISBN|9780230618633}};  ''Border Crossings: Toward a Comparative Political Theory'', edited by Fred Dallmayr. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0739100424}}; with Ganesh Devi, ''Between Tradition and Modernity: India's Search for Identity''. Sage Publications India, 1999; with Zhao Tingyang, ''Contemporary Chinese Political Thought''. University of Kentucky Press, 2012. {{ISBN|9780813136424}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach retains a connection with critical theory, involving thinkers such as Gandhi, [[Edward Said]], [[Enrique Dussel]], and [[Tzvetan Todorov]].

===Spirituality===
Dallmayr analyses the philosophical-theological works of some twentieth-century philosophers and theologians, including Tillich, [[Thomas Merton]], and Panikkar, highlighting the commonalities in their thought.&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''Spiritual Guides''.&lt;/ref&gt; All three insisted on the need for radical “''metanoia'',” meaning a “turn around or ''Kehre''” or spiritual “conversion of heart.”&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''Spiritual Guides'', 6, 80 &lt;/ref&gt; They aimed for a holistic recovery from modern fragmentation, and sought to connect—in fruitful tension—the sacred with the secular, theology with philosophy, Christian teachings with the humanities, and the theoretical understanding with social praxis. 
Tillich, Merton, and Panikkar are exemplars of openness to intercultural and interreligious dialogue. Dallmayr examines their intensive interest in Zen Buddhism as distinct cases of the Christian-Buddhist encounter during the past half century: the intersection of Tillich's dialectical theology with Japanese Buddhist thought; the dialogue of Thomas Merton's trans-individualism with Zen Buddhism; and the encounter of Raimon Panikkar's Vedantic thoughts with the Buddhist “silence of God.”

Dallmayr pays special attention to the intercultural-interreligious and spiritual dimensions of Panikkar's works.  His nondualistic views are congenial to those of Panikkar, who expresses nondualism in using the Indian notion of Advaita and who sees our age “as capable to moving beyond the ‘Western dilemma’ of monism/dualism or immanence/transcendence.”&lt;ref&gt; Dallmayr, ''Spiritual Guides'', 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Dallmayr, being critical of both an agnostic immanentism lacking spirituality and a radical transcendentalism indifferent to social-ethical problems, sees in Panikkar’s holism a third possibility, pointing to the potential overcoming of the “transcendence-immanence” conundrum.

Dallmayr points out the connection between personal freedom and the caring for others. For human beings who are free from selfish egocentrism, it is natural to nurture the perfect virtue of compassion (karuna) and to be engaged in caring praxis. He writes, “The Buddha’s own praxis, anchored in his freedom, by no means seeks to advance his own status or influence; his karuna resides in ‘the superabundance of his state of ‘grace.’”&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,136.&lt;/ref&gt; What saves us is “the refusal to entertain any doctrine or ideology that pretends to deliver authoritative ‘knowledge’ of God.’”&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,137.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha’s teaching is directed to a “profound freedom” or total liberation from both external coercion and interior will to power, which, in turn, “paves the way toward a released humanity no longer entrapped in aggressive individual or collective identities.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reflecting on the meaning of spirituality, as it has been expressed in various religious traditions, Dallmayr mentions as the core feature of religion and spiritual experience “the transgression from self to other, from ‘immanence’ to (some kind of) ‘transcendence.’”  Spirituality should “participate in this transgressive or transformative movement,” to be a vessel for “navigating the straits between immanence and transcendence, between the human and the divine.” Spirituality is commonly associated with a certain kind of responsiveness “inside” human beings, a kind of human “inwardness.” Religion cannot simply be an external form but has to find some kind of personal “resonance” among people today: “the heart (the heart-and-mind) might be described as the great ‘resonance chamber’ constantly open or attuned to new religious of mystical experiences.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
=== Democracy to come===
Dallmayr is critical of the form of [[democracy]] currently found in the Western countries, which is characterized as liberal, ''laissez-faire'', or minimalist, because the primary emphasis is on the liberty of individuals or groups to pursue their particular self-interests, while the role of “the people” as a government is minimalized and solely characterized by competitive elections with “slim procedural formalities serving as fig leaves to cover prevailing modes of domination.”&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, ''The Promise of Democracy: Political Agency and Transformation''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2010, 1. {{ISBN|9781438430393}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He applies the ideas of dialogue to the conception of democratic politics as relational praxis, guided by ethical principles and “love of equality.” He challenges democracy that emphasizes the pursuit of individual or collective [[self-interest]], insisting that more ethical conceptions are possible, that different societies should nurture democracy with their own cultural resources, and that a world has to promote “a fair relationality or qualitative equality between citizen, but also between West and non-West.”&lt;ref&gt;Dallmayr, ''Democracy to Come'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt;   

He adopts Derrida's conceptualization of “democracy to come” and further develops his own version of it, which is characterized as relational, enabling potentiality, ethical, and apophatic. He views democracy as a “promise,” meaning that it is not presently an actuality, but it latently exists as a possibility or potentiality, the realization of which requires a process of striving, ethical cultivation, and self-transformation. Democracy is not a finished condition but an open-ended potentiality and creativity. 

Dallmayr explores democratic traditions not only in the West, but also in India, China, and the Middle East. He discusses efforts to build democracy in regions. He examines the relation between democracy and Islam. He discusses Gandhian and Confucian perspectives on democracy as possible correctives to liberal and minimalist democracy. Gandhi's notions of self-governance (''swaraj''), nonviolence, and the struggle for justice allow for the practice of relational care and respect.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Dallmayr presents a vision of democracy as popular self-rule in which civic education, ethical cultivation, and self-transformation make possible a nondomineering political agency. 

===Cosmopolis=== 
Stephen Schneck, characterizing Dallmayr's views of the “civilizing process,” writes: “Not enmity, conflict, and the ‘clash’ cited by so many as the way to a new world arrangement; Dallmayr instead proposes ‘space’ for mutual world-disclosure through dialogue and discursive openness.”&lt;ref&gt; Stephen F. Schneck, “Introduction: Dallmayr's ‘letting be,’” in ''Letting Be: Fred Dallmayr's Cosmopolitical Vision''. Edited by Stephen Schneck, 1-29. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 2006, 23. {{ISBN|9780268041243}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dallmayr refers to cosmopolis as “an emerging global city or community.”&lt;ref&gt; Fred Dallmayr, ''Being in the World: Dialogue and Cosmopolis''. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2013, 47. {{ISBN|9780813141916}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses dissatisfaction with some of the interpretations of [[cosmopolitanism]]: empirical, focused on economic and technological [[globalization]], while hiding ethical deficits; and normative, which refer to [[international law]] and a legal world order, but which ignore local and regional contexts. He favors instead an approach that gives primacy to practice, “pointing to the need for concrete engagements across national, cultural, and religious boundaries” for “the building of a pluralistic and dialogical cosmopolis.”&lt;ref&gt;Dallmayr, ''On the Boundary'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

He views cosmopolitanism not just in legal and institutional terms but in a broader cultural and philosophical sense. It presents an alternative to the status quo. He again finds useful insights in Heidegger's conception of temporality, meaning that human being-in-the-world is constantly “temporalized” in the direction of future possibilities. He also refers to [[John Dewey]]’s [[pragmatism]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]]’s [[process philosophy]], [[hermeneutics]], and some other sources.   Based on these, he develops his conception of “a ‘becoming cosmopolis’ beckoning from the future as a possibility and a promise.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Dallmayr contributes to the development of a “new [[cosmopolitanism]],” as reflexive, critical, democratic, rooted, dialogical, intercultural, and transformative. He develops his conception of cosmopolis in dialogue with the ideas of such theorists of cosmopolitanism as Karl-Otto Apel, [[Daniele Archibugi]], Seyla Benhabib, [[Richard A. Falk]], Raúl Fornet-Betancourt, Habermas, [[David Held]], [[James Ingram]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], and [[Walter Mignolo]], among others. At the same time, his conception of cosmopolis has some distinctive characteristics that are related to his interpretation of being-in-the-world, care, relationality, democratic politics as relational praxis, world maintenance, and spirituality.

'''Gasper Grima''' (''c.''1680&amp;ndash;1745) was a minor Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Grima was born at [[Mdina]], [[Malta]], around 1680. He joined the [[Franciscan]] friars towards the end of the 1690s, and studied philosophy and theology with the [[Franciscans]] at [[Val di Noto]], [[Sicily]]. Grima taught philosophy and theology at [[Sicily]], and even occupied high offices within his religious order. In 1719, he went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to do missionary work for a year. Back from the [[Holy Land]], he settled in Malta. He lectured at the College of Philosophy and Literature which the [[Franciscans]] had at [[Rabat, Malta]] until his retirement and death.

==Extant works==
Three works of Grima survive. They are all in Latin, and held at the archives of the [[Franciscans]] at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. Though no precise dates are known for when these manuscripts were composed, they are believed to come from some time during the period 1720/45. Though they are Aristotelian and Scholastic in style and content, they are not of the Thomistic hue, but rather Scotist. They works are the following:

* '''''Venimecum''''' (''A Compendium''); 86 back to back folios.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first of three volumes which examine [[Aristotle]]’s fundamental philosophy. The writing opens with a prayer and is followed with a drawing by Grima of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]’s ‘Tree’ showing man’s position in the hierarchy of being. Through a series of ‘Questions’ and ‘Parts’, Grima provides a practical and accessible help for the study of Aristotelian logic.
* '''''Disputationes''''' (''Disputations''); 311 back to back folios.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. I, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Grima’s second and largest volume deals with logic and metaphysics. It also includes various drawings by Grima himself concerning Aristotelian cosmology. The work is organised in ‘Disputations’, ‘Chapters’, and ‘Questions’.
* '''''In Universam Aristotelis Metaphysica''''' (''An General Examination of Aristotle’s Metaphysics''); 38 back to back folios.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The third volume of Grima’s works deals with Aristotelian metaphysics, and complements the other two previous volumes. The work opens with an introduction, and then proceeds in ‘Questions’.

'''Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|t|ɔr}} {{respell|KAN|tor}}; {{IPA-de|ˈɡeɔʁk ˈfɛʁdinant ˈluːtvɪç ˈfɪlɪp ˈkantɔʁ|lang}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 3|1845|February 19}}&amp;nbsp;– January 6, 1918&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guinness2000|Grattan-Guinness 2000]], p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[German mathematician]].  He created [[set theory]], which has become a [[foundations of mathematics|fundamental theory]] in mathematics. Cantor established the importance of [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the members of two sets, defined [[infinite set|infinite]] and [[well-order|well-ordered sets]], and proved that the [[real number]]s are more numerous than the [[natural number]]s. In fact, Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an "[[infinity]] of infinities". He defined the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers and their arithmetic. Cantor's work is of great philosophical interest, a fact of which he was well aware.&lt;ref&gt;The biographical material in this article is mostly drawn from [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]]. [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], and [[#Purkert|Purkert and Ilgauds 1985]] are useful additional sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's theory of [[transfinite number]]s was originally regarded as so counter-intuitive&amp;nbsp;– even shocking&amp;nbsp;– that it encountered [[Controversy over Cantor's theory|resistance]] from mathematical contemporaries such as [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben2004|Dauben 2004]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and later from [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[L.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;J. Brouwer]], while [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] raised [[philosophical objections to Cantor's theory|philosophical objections]]. Cantor, a devout [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dauben|first1=Joseph Warren|title=Georg Cantor His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|date=1979|publisher=princeton university press|isbn=9780691024479|pages=introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed the theory had been communicated to him by God.&lt;ref name = "xdpfir"&gt;[[#Dauben2004|Dauben 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;8, 11, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] (particularly [[Neo-Scholasticism|neo-Scholastics]]) saw Cantor's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God&lt;ref name = "nuozkv"&gt;[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 86; [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp.&amp;nbsp;120, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with [[pantheism]]&lt;ref name = "daub77102"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.

The objections to Cantor's work were occasionally fierce: [[Henri Poincaré]] referred to his ideas as a "grave disease" infecting the discipline of [[mathematics]],&lt;ref name="daub266"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leopold Kronecker]]'s public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a "scientific charlatan", a "renegade" and a "corrupter of youth".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben2004|Dauben 2004]], p. 1; [[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89 ''15n''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kronecker objected to Cantor's proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable, and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable, results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum. Writing decades after Cantor's death, Wittgenstein lamented that mathematics is "ridden through and through with the pernicious idioms of set theory", which he dismissed as "utter nonsense" that is "laughable" and "wrong".{{sfn|Rodych|2007}}{{context needed}} Cantor's recurring bouts of depression from 1884 to the end of his life have been blamed on the hostile attitude of many of his contemporaries,&lt;ref name="daub280"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 280: "...the tradition made popular by [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies]] blamed Kronecker's persistent criticism and Cantor's inability to confirm his continuum hypothesis" for Cantor's recurring bouts of depression.&lt;/ref&gt; though some have explained these episodes as probable manifestations of a [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name="bipolar"&gt;[[#Dauben2004|Dauben 2004]], p. 1. Text includes a 1964 quote from psychiatrist Karl Pollitt, one of Cantor's examining physicians at Halle Nervenklinik, referring to Cantor's [[mental illness]] as "cyclic manic-depression".&lt;/ref&gt;

The harsh criticism has been matched by later accolades. In 1904, the [[Royal Society]] awarded Cantor its [[Sylvester Medal]], the highest honor it can confer for work in mathematics.&lt;ref name = "daub248"/&gt; [[David Hilbert]] defended it from its critics by declaring, "No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hilbert|1926|p=170}}: "Aus dem Paradies, das Cantor uns geschaffen, soll uns niemand vertreiben können." (Literally: "Out of the Paradise that Cantor created for us, no one must be able to expel us.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encomium"/&gt;

==Life of Georg Cantor==

===Youth and studies===
[[File:Georg Cantor3.jpg|thumb|left|Cantor, around 1870]]
Georg Cantor was born in 1845 in the western merchant colony of [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, and brought up in the city until he was eleven. Georg, the oldest of six children, was regarded as an outstanding violinist. His grandfather [[Franz Böhm (musician)|Franz Böhm]] (1788–1846) (the violinist [[Joseph Böhm]]'s brother) was a well-known musician and soloist in a Russian imperial orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_music/924/Бём ru: The musical encyclopedia (Музыкальная энциклопедия)].&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's father had been a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Bourse|Saint Petersburg stock exchange]]; when he became ill, the family moved to Germany in 1856, first to [[Wiesbaden]], then to [[Frankfurt]], seeking milder  winters than those of Saint Petersburg. In 1860, Cantor graduated with distinction from the Realschule in [[Darmstadt]]; his exceptional skills in mathematics, [[trigonometry]] in particular, were noted. In 1862, Cantor entered the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]]. After receiving a substantial inheritance upon his father's death in June 1863,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor.html|title=Cantor biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor shifted his studies to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], attending lectures by [[Leopold Kronecker]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Ernst Kummer]]. He spent the summer of 1866 at the [[University of Göttingen]], then and later a center for mathematical research. Georg Cantor was a good student, so in 1867, he received his doctorate degree.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians: the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|year=1999|publisher=U X L|last2=Baker|first2=Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=54|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher and researcher===
Cantor submitted his [[dissertation]] on number theory at the University of Berlin in 1867. After teaching briefly in a Berlin girls' school, Cantor took up a position at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], where he spent his entire career. He was awarded the requisite [[habilitation]] for his thesis, also on number theory, which he presented in 1869 upon his appointment at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=O'Connor, John J |author2=Robertson, Edmund F |year=1998 |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor.html |title=Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor |publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Cantor married Vally Guttmann. They had six children, the last (Rudolph) born in 1886. Cantor was able to support a family despite modest academic pay, thanks to his inheritance from his father. During his honeymoon in the [[Harz|Harz mountains]], Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with [[Richard Dedekind]], whom he had met two years earlier while on Swiss holiday.

Cantor was promoted to extraordinary professor in 1872 and made full professor in 1879.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To attain the latter rank at the age of 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a [[professor|chair]] at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible.&lt;ref name="daub163"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague,&lt;ref name="daub34"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; perceiving him as a "corrupter of youth" for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89 ''15n.''&lt;/ref&gt; Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work ever since he intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication in 1874.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kronecker, now seen as one of the founders of the [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive viewpoint in mathematics]], disliked much of Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Whenever Cantor applied for a post in Berlin, he was declined, and it usually involved Kronecker,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so Cantor came to believe that Kronecker's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle.

In 1881, Cantor's Halle colleague [[Eduard Heine]] died, creating a vacant chair. Halle accepted Cantor's suggestion that it be offered to Dedekind, [[Heinrich M. Weber]] and [[Franz Mertens]], in that order, but each declined the chair after being offered it. Friedrich Wangerin was eventually appointed, but he was never close to Cantor.

In 1882, the mathematical correspondence between Cantor and Dedekind came to an end, apparently as a result of Dedekind's declining the chair at Halle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 2–3; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 354–355.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor also began another important correspondence, with [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]] in Sweden, and soon began to publish in Mittag-Leffler's journal ''Acta Mathematica''. But in 1885, Mittag-Leffler was concerned about the philosophical nature and new terminology in a paper Cantor had submitted to ''Acta''.&lt;ref name="daub138"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; He asked Cantor to withdraw the paper from ''Acta'' while it was in proof, writing that it was "...&amp;nbsp;about one hundred years too soon." Cantor complied, but then curtailed his relationship and correspondence with Mittag-Leffler, writing to a third party, "Had Mittag-Leffler had his way, I should have to wait until the year 1984, which to me seemed too great a demand! ... But of course I never want to know anything again about ''Acta Mathematica''."&lt;ref name="daub139"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor suffered his first known bout of depression on May 1884.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "daub282"/&gt; Criticism of his work weighed on his mind: every one of the fifty-two letters he wrote to Mittag-Leffler in 1884 mentioned Kronecker. A passage from one of these letters is revealing of the damage to Cantor's self-confidence:

{{quote|... I don't know when I shall return to the continuation of my scientific work. At the moment I can do absolutely nothing with it, and limit myself to the most necessary duty of my lectures; how much happier I would be to be scientifically active, if only I had the necessary mental freshness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 136; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 376–377. Letter dated June 21, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This crisis led him to apply to lecture on philosophy rather than mathematics. He also began an intense study of [[Elizabethan literature]] thinking there might be evidence that [[Francis Bacon]] wrote the plays attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] (see [[Shakespearean authorship question]]); this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets, published in 1896 and 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 281–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor recovered soon thereafter, and subsequently made further important contributions, including his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]. However, he never again attained the high level of his remarkable papers of 1874–84, even after Kronecker's death on December 29, 1891.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted.

In 1889, Cantor was instrumental in founding the [[German Mathematical Society]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and chaired its first meeting in Halle in 1891, where he first introduced his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]; his reputation was strong enough, despite Kronecker's opposition to his work, to ensure he was elected as the first president of this society. Setting aside the animosity Kronecker had displayed towards him, Cantor invited him to address the meeting, but Kronecker was unable to do so because his wife was dying from injuries sustained in a skiing accident at the time. Georg Cantor was also instrumental in the establishment of the first [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], which was held in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1897.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

===Later years and death===
After Cantor's 1884 hospitalization, there is no record that he was in any [[sanatorium]] again until 1899.&lt;ref name="daub282"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that second hospitalization, Cantor's youngest son Rudolph died suddenly on December 16 (Cantor was delivering a lecture on his views on [[Baconian theory]] and [[William Shakespeare]]), and this tragedy drained Cantor of much of his passion for mathematics.&lt;ref name="daub283"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903. One year later, he was outraged and agitated by a paper presented by [[Julius König]] at the Third [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. The paper attempted to prove that the basic tenets of transfinite set theory were false.  Since the paper had been read in front of his daughters and colleagues, Cantor perceived himself as having been publicly humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of König's paper see [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 248–250. For Cantor's reaction, see [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 248, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Ernst Zermelo]] demonstrated less than a day later that König's proof had failed, Cantor remained shaken, and momentarily questioning God.&lt;ref name="daub248"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor suffered from chronic depression for the rest of his life, for which he was excused from teaching on several occasions and repeatedly confined in various sanatoria. The events of 1904 preceded a series of hospitalizations at intervals of two or three years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not abandon mathematics completely, however, lecturing on the paradoxes of set theory ([[Burali-Forti paradox]], [[Cantor's paradox]], and [[Russell's paradox]]) to a meeting of the ''Deutsche Mathematiker–Vereinigung'' in 1903, and attending the International Congress of Mathematicians at [[Heidelberg]] in 1904.

In 1911, Cantor was one of the distinguished foreign scholars invited to attend the 500th anniversary of the founding of the [[University of St. Andrews]] in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet [[Bertrand Russell]], whose newly published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' repeatedly cited Cantor's work, but this did not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person.

Cantor retired in 1913, living in poverty and suffering from [[Malnutrition|malnourishment]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="daub284"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium for the last time and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he had spent the last year of his life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mathematical work==
Cantor's work between 1874 and 1884 is the origin of [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 55"&gt;{{Citation |surname=Johnson|given= Phillip E.|year=1972|title=The Genesis and Development of Set Theory|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|jstor=3026799|volume=3|issue=1|page=55|doi=10.2307/3026799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this work, the concept of a set was a rather elementary one that had been used implicitly since the beginning of mathematics, dating back to the ideas of [[Aristotle]]. No one had realized that set theory had any nontrivial content. Before Cantor, there were only finite sets (which are easy to understand) and "the infinite" (which was considered a topic for philosophical, rather than mathematical, discussion). By proving that there are (infinitely) many possible sizes for infinite sets, Cantor established that set theory was not trivial, and it needed to be studied. [[Axiomatic set theory|Set theory]] has come to play the role of a [[foundations of mathematics|foundational theory]] in modern mathematics, in the sense that it interprets propositions about mathematical objects (for example, numbers and functions) from all the traditional areas of mathematics (such as [[algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]]) in a single theory, and provides a standard set of axioms to prove or disprove them. The basic concepts of set theory are now used throughout mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Axiomatic Set Theory|first=Patrick|last=Suppes|authorlink=Patrick Suppes|year=1972|publisher=Dover|isbn=9780486616308|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sxr4LrgJGeAC&amp;pg=PA1|quote=With a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.  ... As a consequence, many fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics may be reduced to questions about set theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his earliest papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cantor|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is "more numerous" than the set of [[natural number]]s; this showed, for the first time, that there exist infinite sets of different [[Cardinality|sizes]]. He was also the first to appreciate the importance of [[one-to-one correspondence]]s (hereinafter denoted "1-to-1 correspondence") in set theory. He used this concept to define [[finite set|finite]] and [[infinite set]]s, subdividing the latter into [[countable set|denumerable]] (or countably infinite) sets and [[uncountable set|nondenumerable set]]s (uncountably infinite sets).&lt;ref&gt;A [[countable set]] is a set which is either finite or denumerable; the denumerable sets are therefore the infinite countable sets. However, this terminology is not universally followed, and sometimes "denumerable" is used as a synonym for "countable".&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor developed important concepts in [[topology]] and their relation to [[cardinality]]. For example, he showed that the [[Cantor set]] is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]], but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the [[Rational number|rationals]] are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense [[total order|linear orders]] without end points are order-isomorphic to the [[rational numbers]].

Cantor introduced fundamental constructions in set theory, such as the [[power set]] of a set ''A'', which is the set of all possible [[subset]]s of ''A''. He later proved that the size of the power set of ''A'' is strictly larger than the size of ''A'', even when ''A'' is an infinite set; this result soon became known as [[Cantor's theorem]]. Cantor developed an entire theory and [[Ordinal arithmetic|arithmetic of infinite sets]], called [[Cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[Ordinal number|ordinals]], which extended the arithmetic of the natural numbers. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph]]) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter ω ([[omega]]). This notation is still in use today.

The ''[[Continuum hypothesis]]'', introduced by Cantor, was presented by [[David Hilbert]] as the first of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three open problems]] in his address at the 1900 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium.&lt;ref name="encomium"&gt;{{Citation |surname=Reid|given= Constance|year=1996|title=Hilbert|place=New York|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-04999-1|page=
177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] praised Cantor's set theory and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, [[Adolf Hurwitz]] and [[Jacques Hadamard]] also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator [[Philip Jourdain]] on the history of [[set theory]] and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.

===Number theory, trigonometric series and ordinals===
Cantor's first ten papers were on [[number theory]], his thesis topic. At the suggestion of [[Eduard Heine]], the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Heine proposed that Cantor solve [[Open problem|an open problem]] that had eluded [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Rudolf Lipschitz]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and Heine himself: the uniqueness of the representation of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] by [[trigonometric series]]. Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices ''n'' in the ''n''th [[derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of a set ''S'' of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with ''S'' as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as its set of zeros, where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of [[limit point]]s of ''S''. If ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k+1''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of limit points of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k+1''&lt;/sub&gt;. Because the sets ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; were closed, they contained their [[Limit point]]s, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets ''S'', ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,... formed a limit set, which we would now call ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ω''&lt;/sub&gt;, and then he noticed that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; would also have to have a set of limit points ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω+1&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ''ω'', ''ω''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, ''ω''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, ...&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Cooke|first1=Roger|title=Uniqueness of trigonometric series and descriptive set theory, 1870–1985|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=45|page=281|year=1993|doi=10.1007/BF01886630|issue=4|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1870 and 1872, Cantor published more papers on trigonometric series, and also a paper defining [[irrational number]]s as [[Sequence space|convergent sequences]] of [[rational number]]s. Dedekind, whom Cantor befriended in 1872, cited this paper later that year, in the paper where he first set out his celebrated definition of real numbers by [[Dedekind cut]]s.  While extending the notion of number by means of his revolutionary concept of infinite cardinality, Cantor was paradoxically opposed to theories of [[infinitesimal]]s of his contemporaries [[Otto Stolz]] and [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], describing them as both "an abomination" and "a cholera bacillus of mathematics".&lt;ref name="Infinitesimal"&gt;{{citation|author=Katz, Karin Usadi and [[Mikhail Katz|Katz, Mikhail G.]] |year=2012|title= A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography|journal= [[Foundations of Science]]|doi=10.1007/s10699-011-9223-1|volume =17|number=1|pages=51–89|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.0375|arxiv=1104.0375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor also published an erroneous "proof" of the inconsistency of [[Infinitesimal|infinitesimals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ehrlich, P.|year=2006|title=The rise of non-Archimedean mathematics and the roots of a misconception.

===Set theory===
[[File:Diagonal argument 2.svg|right|thumb|250px|An illustration of [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] for the existence of [[uncountable set]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This follows closely the first part of Cantor's 1891 paper.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence at the bottom cannot occur anywhere in the infinite list of sequences above.]]
The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is often marked by the publication of [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|Cantor's 1874 paper]],&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 55"/&gt; "Ueber&lt;!--[sic; see 'Talk:Gottlob Frege#Ueber']--&gt; eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen" ("On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cantor|1874}}. English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996]], pp. 840–843.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was the first to provide a rigorous proof that there was more than one kind of infinity. Previously, all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be [[equinumerosity|equinumerous]] (that is, of "the same size" or having the same number of elements).&lt;ref&gt;For example, geometric problems posed by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[John Duns Scotus]] suggested that all infinite sets were equinumerous&amp;nbsp;– see {{Citation |surname=Moore|given= A.W.|date=April 1995|title=A brief history of infinity|journal=Scientific American|volume=272|issue=4|pages=112–116 (114)|url=http://math123.net/hchs/MathDept/MathTalks/2012-13/b-h-inf.pdf|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0495-112|bibcode=1995SciAm.272d.112M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive [[integers]] are not equinumerous. In other words, the real numbers are not [[countable]]. His proof differs from [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] that he gave in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;For this, and more information on the mathematical importance of Cantor's work on set theory, see e.g., [[#Suppes|Suppes 1972]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's article also contains a new method of constructing [[transcendental number]]s. Transcendental numbers were first constructed by [[Joseph Liouville]] in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Liouville, Joseph (May 13, 1844). [http://bibnum.education.fr/mathematiques/theorie-des-nombres/propos-de-lexistence-des-nombres-transcendants A propos de l'existence des nombres transcendants].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor established these results using two constructions. His first construction shows how to write the real [[algebraic number]]s&lt;ref&gt;The real algebraic numbers are the real [[root]]s of [[polynomial]] equations with [[integer]] [[coefficients]].&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[sequence]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.... In other words, the real algebraic numbers are countable. Cantor starts his second construction with any sequence of real numbers. Using this sequence, he constructs [[nested intervals]] whose [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] contains a real number not in the sequence. Since every sequence of real numbers can be used to construct a real not in the sequence, the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence&amp;nbsp;– that is, the real numbers are not countable.  By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers, Cantor produces a transcendental number. Cantor points out that his constructions prove more&amp;nbsp;– namely, they provide a new proof of Liouville's theorem: Every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers.&lt;ref&gt;For more details on Cantor's article, see [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article]] and {{Citation |surname=Gray|given=Robert|year=1994|url=http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Gray819-832.pdf |title=Georg Cantor and Transcendental Numbers|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=101|pages=819–832 |doi=10.2307/2975129}}. Gray (pp. 821–822) describes a computer program that uses Cantor's constructions to generate a transcendental number.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's next article contains a construction that proves the set of transcendental numbers has the same "power" (see below) as the set of real numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor's construction starts with the set of transcendentals ''T'' and removes a countable [[subset]] {''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for example, ''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;n''). Call this set ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''T''&amp;nbsp;= ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&amp;nbsp;= ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;}&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}. The set of reals '''R'''&amp;nbsp;= ''T''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&amp;nbsp;= ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} where ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sequence of real algebraic numbers.  So both ''T'' and '''R''' are the union of three [[pairwise disjoint]] sets: ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and two countable sets. A one-to-one correspondence between ''T'' and '''R''' is given by the function: ''f''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'' if ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Cantor actually applies his construction to the irrationals rather than the transcendentals, but he knew that it applies to any set formed by removing countably many numbers from the set of reals ({{harvnb|Cantor|1879|p=4}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor published a series of six articles in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Leopold Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only if they could be constructed in a [[finitism|finite]] number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of [[actual infinity]] would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole.&lt;ref name="popeleo"&gt;[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor also introduced the [[Cantor set]] during this period.

The fifth paper in this series, "'''''Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre"''''' ("''Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates"''), published in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1883}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was the most important of the six and was also published as a separate [[monograph]]. It contained Cantor's reply to his critics and showed how the [[transfinite number]]s were a systematic extension of the natural numbers. It begins by defining [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal number]]s are then introduced as the order types of well-ordered sets. Cantor then defines the addition and multiplication of the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and ordinal numbers. In 1885, Cantor extended his theory of order types so that the ordinal numbers simply became a special case of order types.

In 1891, he published a paper containing his elegant "diagonal argument" for the existence of an uncountable set. He applied the same idea to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: the [[cardinality]] of the power set of a set ''A'' is strictly larger than the cardinality of ''A''. This established the richness of the hierarchy of infinite sets, and of the [[cardinal arithmetic|cardinal]] and [[ordinal arithmetic]] that Cantor had defined. His argument is fundamental in the solution of the [[Halting problem]] and the proof of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]]. Cantor wrote on the [[Goldbach conjecture]] in 1894.

[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage of Georg Cantor's article with his set definition]]
In 1895 and 1897, Cantor published a two-part paper in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' under [[Felix Klein]]'s editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cantor|1895}}, {{harvtxt|Cantor|1897}}. The English translation is [[#Cantor1955|Cantor 1955]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first paper begins by defining set, [[subset]], etc., in ways that would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of [[well-ordered set]]s and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if ''A'' and ''B'' are sets with ''A'' [[equinumerous|equivalent]] to a subset of ''B'' and ''B'' equivalent to a subset of ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' are equivalent. [[Ernst Schröder]] had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. [[Felix Bernstein (mathematician)|Felix Bernstein]] supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem]].

====One-to-one correspondence====
{{Main|Bijection}}
[[File:Bijection.svg|thumb|A bijective function]]
Cantor's 1874 [[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]] paper was the first to invoke the notion of a [[Bijection|1-to-1]] correspondence, though he did not use that phrase. He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the [[unit square]] and the points of a unit [[line segment]]. In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind, Cantor proved a far [[Mathematical jargon#stronger|stronger]] result: for any positive integer ''n'', there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]]. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: "{{lang|fr|Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas!}}" ("I see it, but I don't believe it!")&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Wallace|given= David Foster|year=2003|title=Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity|place=New York|publisher=W.&amp;nbsp;W. Norton and Company|isbn=0-393-00338-8|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of [[dimension]].

In 1878, Cantor submitted another paper to Crelle's Journal, in which he defined precisely the concept of a 1-to-1 correspondence and introduced the notion of "[[cardinality|power]]" (a term he took from [[Jakob Steiner]]) or "equivalence" of sets: two sets are equivalent (have the same power) if there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between them. Cantor defined [[countable set]]s (or denumerable sets) as sets which can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the [[natural number]]s, and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable. He also proved that ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; has the same power as the [[real number]]s '''R''', as does a countably infinite [[Cartesian product|product]] of copies of '''R'''. While he made free use of countability as a concept, he did not write the word "countable" until 1883. Cantor also discussed his thinking about [[dimension]], stressing that his [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between the [[unit interval]] and the unit square was not a [[continuous function|continuous]] one.

This paper displeased Kronecker and Cantor wanted to withdraw it; however, Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and [[Karl Weierstrass]] supported its publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 69, 324 ''63n''. The paper had been submitted in July 1877. Dedekind supported it, but delayed its publication due to Kronecker's opposition. Weierstrass actively supported it.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle.

====Continuum hypothesis====
{{Main|Continuum hypothesis}}
Cantor was the first to formulate what later came to be known as the [[continuum hypothesis]] or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is ''exactly'' aleph-one, rather than just ''at least'' aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to [[mathematical proof|prove]] it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.&lt;ref name="daub280" /&gt;

The difficulty Cantor had in proving the continuum hypothesis has been underscored by later developments in the field of mathematics: a 1940 result by [[Kurt Gödel]] and a 1963 one by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] together imply that the continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved using standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] plus the [[axiom of choice]] (the combination referred to as "ZFC").&lt;ref&gt;Some mathematicians consider these results to have settled the issue, and, at most, allow that it is possible to examine the formal consequences of CH or of its negation, or of axioms that imply one of those. Others continue to look for "natural" or "plausible" axioms that, when added to ZFC, will permit either a proof or refutation of CH, or even for direct evidence for or against CH itself; among the most prominent of these is [[W. Hugh Woodin]]. One of Gödel's last papers argues that the CH is false, and the continuum has cardinality Aleph-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes====
In 1883, Cantor divided the infinite into the transfinite and the [[Absolute Infinite|absolute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1883|pp=587–588}}; English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996]], pp. 916&amp;ndash;917.&lt;/ref&gt; The transfinite is increasable in magnitude, while the absolute is unincreasable. For example, an ordinal α is transfinite because it can be increased to α&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. On the other hand, the ordinals form an absolutely infinite sequence that cannot be increased in magnitude because there are no larger ordinals to add to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 41&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, Cantor also introduced the well-ordering principle "every set can be well-ordered" and stated that it is a "law of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor extended his work on the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an [[aleph number|aleph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], p. 51. Proof of equivalence: If a set is well-ordered, then its cardinality is an aleph since the alephs are the cardinals of well-ordered sets. If a set's cardinality is an aleph, then it can be well-ordered since there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the well-ordered set defining the aleph.&lt;/ref&gt; First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 166&amp;ndash;169.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor's proof, which is a [[proof by contradiction]], starts by assuming there is a set ''S'' whose cardinality is not an aleph. A function from the ordinals to ''S'' is constructed by successively choosing different elements of ''S'' for each ordinal. If this construction runs out of elements, then the function well-orders the set ''S''. This implies that the cardinality of ''S'' is an aleph, contradicting the assumption about ''S''. Therefore, the function maps all the ordinals one-to-one into ''S''. The function's [[Image (mathematics)|image]] is an inconsistent submultiplicity contained in ''S'', so the set ''S'' is an inconsistent multiplicity, which is a contradiction. Zermelo criticized Cantor's construction: "the intuition of time is applied here to a process that goes beyond all intuition, and a fictitious entity is posited of which it is assumed that it could make ''successive'' arbitrary choices." ([[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 169&amp;ndash;170.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor avoided [[paradox]]es by recognizing that there are two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, [[Bertrand Russell]] treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is [[inconsistent]]. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (which was just mentioned), [[Cantor's paradox]], and [[Russell's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moore1988|Moore 1988]], pp. 52&amp;ndash;53; [[#Moore1981|Moore and Garciadiego 1981]], pp. 330&amp;ndash;331.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell named paradoxes after [[Cesare Burali-Forti]] and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moore1981|Moore and Garciadiego 1981]], pp. 331, 343; [[#Purkert1989|Purkert 1989]], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Zermelo published [[Zermelo set theory|his axiom system for set theory]]. He had two motivations for developing the axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], pp. 158&amp;ndash;160. Moore argues that the latter was his primary motivation.&lt;/ref&gt; Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the [[axiom of choice]], but his proof was criticized for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Moore devotes a chapter to this criticism: "Zermelo and His Critics (1904&amp;ndash;1908)", [[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], pp. 85&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt; His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], pp. 158&amp;ndash;160. [[#Zermelo1908|Zermelo 1908]], pp. 263&amp;ndash;264; English translation: [[#Heijenoort|van Heijenoort 1967]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, [[John von Neumann]] developed an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes by using an approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a [[Class (set theory)|class]] is too big to be a set if it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 288, 290&amp;ndash;291. Cantor had pointed out that inconsistent multiplicities face the same restriction: they cannot be members of any multiplicity. ([[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], p. 286.)&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 291&amp;ndash;292.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Zermelo defined [[Zermelo's models and the axiom of limitation of size|models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zermelo1930|Zermelo 1930]]; English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996]], pp. 1208&amp;ndash;1233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy, religion, literature and Cantor's mathematics==
The concept of the existence of an [[actual infinity]] was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the [[orthodoxy]] of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's.&lt;ref name="daub295"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his ''Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre,'' where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications&amp;nbsp;– he identified the [[Absolute Infinite]] with God,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], p. 13. Compare to the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.&lt;ref name = "xdpfir"/&gt;

Debate among mathematicians grew out of opposing views in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] regarding the nature of actual infinity. Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate, and denied its existence.&lt;ref name="daub225"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians from three major schools of thought ([[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] and its two offshoots, [[intuitionism]] and [[finitism]]) opposed Cantor's theories in this matter. For constructivists such as Kronecker, this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that [[nonconstructive proof]]s such as Cantor's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists, holding instead that [[constructive proof]]s are required. Intuitionism also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality, but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism. Firstly, Cantor's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity, whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions, originating instead in the intuitions of the mind.&lt;ref name="daub266"/&gt; Secondly, the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism, since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|surname=Snapper|given=Ernst|year=1979|url=&lt;!-- http://math.boisestate.edu/~tconklin/MATH547/Main/Exhibits/Three%20Crises%20in%20Math%20A.pdf --&gt;http://www2.gsu.edu/~matgtc/three%20crises%20in%20mathematics.pdf|title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism and Formalism|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=524|pages=207–216|access-date=April 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815055019/http://www2.gsu.edu/~matgtc/three%20crises%20in%20mathematics.pdf#|archive-date=August 15, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians such as [[L.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;J. Brouwer]] and especially [[Henri Poincaré]] adopted an [[intuitionism|intuitionist]] stance against Cantor's work. Citing the paradoxes of set theory as an example of its fundamentally flawed nature, Poincaré held that "most of the ideas of Cantorian set theory should be banished from mathematics once and for all."&lt;ref name="daub266"/&gt; Finally, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s attacks were finitist: he believed that Cantor's diagonal argument conflated the [[intension]] of a set of cardinal or real numbers with its [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], thus conflating the concept of rules for generating a set with an actual set.{{sfn|Rodych|2007}}

Some Christian theologians saw Cantor's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God.&lt;ref name = "nuozkv"/&gt; In particular, [[neo-scholasticism|neo-Thomist]] thinkers saw the existence of an actual infinity that consisted of something other than God as jeopardizing "God's exclusive claim to supreme infinity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Davenport|year=1997|given=Anne A.|title=The Catholics, the Cathars, and the Concept of Infinity in the Thirteenth Century|journal=Isis|volume=88|issue=2|pages=263–295|jstor=236574|doi=10.1086/383692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor strongly believed that this view was a misinterpretation of infinity, and was convinced that set theory could help correct this mistake:&lt;ref name = "daub7785"/&gt; "... the transfinite species are just as much at the disposal of the intentions of the Creator and His absolute boundless will as are the finite numbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cantor|1932|p=404}}. Translation in [[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor also believed that his theory of transfinite numbers ran counter to both [[materialism]] and [[determinism]]&amp;nbsp;– and was shocked when he realized that he was the only faculty member at Halle who did ''not'' hold to deterministic philosophical beliefs.&lt;ref name="daub296"&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Cantor published his correspondence with several philosophers on the philosophical implications of his set theory. In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and authorities to adopt his views, Cantor had corresponded with Christian philosophers such as [[Tilman Pesch]] and [[Joseph Hontheim]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as theologians such as Cardinal [[Johann Baptist Franzelin]], who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name="daub77102"&gt;[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor even sent one letter directly to [[Pope Leo XIII]] himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.&lt;ref name="daub7785"&gt;[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's philosophy on the nature of numbers led him to affirm a belief in the freedom of mathematics to posit and prove concepts apart from the realm of physical phenomena, as expressions within an internal reality. The only restrictions on this [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] system are that all mathematical concepts must be devoid of internal contradiction, and that they follow from existing definitions, axioms, and theorems. This belief is summarized in his assertion that "the essence of mathematics is its freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas parallel those of [[Edmund Husserl]], whom Cantor had met in Halle.&lt;ref&gt;On Cantor, Husserl, and [[Gottlob Frege]], see Hill and Rosado Haddock (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Cantor himself was fiercely opposed to [[Infinitesimal|infinitesimals]], describing them as both an "abomination" and "the cholera bacillus of mathematics".&lt;ref name="Infinitesimal" /&gt;

Cantor's 1883 paper reveals that he was well aware of the [[Controversy over Cantor's theory|opposition]] his ideas were encountering: "... I realize that in this undertaking I place myself in a certain opposition to views widely held concerning the mathematical infinite and to opinions frequently defended on the nature of numbers."&lt;ref name="daub96"&gt;"[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence he devotes much space to justifying his earlier work, asserting that mathematical concepts may be freely introduced as long as they are free of [[contradiction]] and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts. He also cites Aristotle, [[René Descartes]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Bernard Bolzano]] on infinity.

==Cantor's ancestry==
[[File:Blackboard Georg Cantor (11-line V O building 24).jpg|thumb|The title on the memorial plaque (in Russian): "In this building was born and lived from 1845 till 1854 the great mathematician and creator of set theory Georg Cantor", [[Vasilievsky Island]], Saint-Petersburg.]]
Cantor's paternal grandparents were from [[Copenhagen]] and fled to Russia from the disruption of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. There is very little direct information on his grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Grattan-Guinness's only evidence on the grandfather's date of death is that he signed papers at his son's engagement.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cantor was sometimes called Jewish in his lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], art. "Cantor, Georg"; [[Jewish Year Book]] 1896–97, "List of Jewish Celebrities of the Nineteenth Century", p. 119; this list has a star against people with one Jewish parent, but Cantor is not starred.&lt;/ref&gt; but has also variously been called Russian, German, and Danish as well.

Jakob Cantor, Cantor's grandfather, gave his children Christian [[saint]]s' names. Further, several of his grandmother's relatives were in the Czarist civil service, which would not welcome Jews, unless they [[Religious conversion|converted]] to Christianity. Cantor's father, Georg Waldemar Cantor, was educated in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] mission in Saint Petersburg, and his correspondence with his son shows both of them as devout Lutherans. Very little is known for sure about George Woldemar's origin or education.&lt;ref name="pi87"&gt;[[#Purkert|Purkert and Ilgauds 1985]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Maria Anna Böhm, was an [[Austro-Hungarian]] born in Saint Petersburg and baptized [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]; she converted to [[Protestantism]] upon marriage. However, there is a letter from Cantor's brother Louis to their mother, stating:
{{quote|Mögen wir zehnmal von Juden abstammen und ich im Princip noch so sehr für Gleichberechtigung der Hebräer sein, im socialen Leben sind mir Christen lieber ...&lt;ref name="pi87"/&gt;}}

("Even if we were descended from Jews ten times over, and even though I may be, in principle, completely in favour of equal rights for Hebrews, in social life I prefer Christians...") which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see: [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 1 and notes; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 350–352 and notes; [[#Purkert|Purkert and Ilgauds 1985]]; the letter is from {{harvnb|Aczel|2000|pp=93–94}}, from Louis' trip to Chicago in 1863. It is ambiguous in German, as in English, whether the recipient is included.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were documented statements, during the 1930s, that called this Jewish ancestry into question:
{{quote|More often [i.e., than the ancestry of the mother] the question has been discussed of whether Georg Cantor was of Jewish origin. About this it is reported in a notice of the Danish genealogical Institute in Copenhagen from the year 1937 concerning his father: "It is hereby testified that Georg Woldemar Cantor, born 1809 or 1814, is not present in the registers of the Jewish community, and that he completely without doubt was not a Jew&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="pi87"/&gt;}}

It is also later said in the same document:
{{quote|Also efforts for a long time by the librarian Josef Fischer, one of the best experts on Jewish genealogy in Denmark, charged with identifying Jewish professors, that Georg Cantor was of Jewish descent, finished without result. [Something seems to be wrong with this sentence, but the meaning seems clear enough.] In Cantor's published works and also in his [[Nachlass]] there are no statements by himself which relate to a Jewish origin of his ancestors. There is to be sure in the Nachlass a copy of a letter of his brother Ludwig from 18 November 1869 to their mother with some unpleasant antisemitic statements, in which it is said among other things:&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="pi87"/&gt;}}(the rest of the quote is finished by the very first quote above). In Men of Mathematics, Eric Temple Bell described Cantor as being "of pure Jewish descent on both sides," although both parents were baptized.  In a 1971 article entitled "Towards a Biography of Georg Cantor," the British historian of mathematics Ivor Grattan-Guinness mentions ([[Annals of Science]] 27, pp.&amp;nbsp;345–391, 1971) that he was unable to find evidence of Jewish ancestry. (He also states that Cantor's wife, Vally Guttmann, was Jewish).

In a letter written by Georg Cantor to [[Paul Tannery]] in 1896 (Paul Tannery, Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondence, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;306), Cantor states that his paternal grandparents were members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Copenhagen.  Specifically, Cantor states in describing his father: "Er ist aber in Kopenhagen geboren, von israelitischen Eltern, die der dortigen portugisischen Judengemeinde..."  ("He was born in Copenhagen of Jewish (lit: "Israelite") parents from the local Portuguese-Jewish community.")&lt;ref&gt;Tannery, Paul (1934) ''Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondance'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Cantor's maternal great uncle,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; a Hungarian violinist [[Josef Böhm]], has been described as Jewish,&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn, Ezra (ed.) (1993) [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11440061?versionId=13425381 ''Modern Jews and their musical agendas''], Oxford University Press, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; which may imply that Cantor's mother was at least partly descended from the Hungarian Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;''Ismerjük''oket?: zsidó származású nevezetes magyarok arcképcsarnoka'', István Reményi Gyenes Ex Libris, (Budapest 1997), pages 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to Bertrand Russell, Cantor described his ancestry and self-perception as follows:
{{quote|Neither my father nor my mother were of German blood, the first being a Dane, borne in Kopenhagen, my mother of Austrian Hungar descension. You must know, Sir, that I am not a ''regular just Germain'', for I am born 3 March 1845 at Saint Peterborough, Capital of Russia, but I went with my father and mother and brothers and sister, eleven years old in the year 1856, into Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography'', vol. I, p. 229. In English in the original; italics also as in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historiography==
Until the 1970s, the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies]] (1927)&amp;nbsp;– largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler&amp;nbsp;– and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at second and third hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by [[Eric Temple Bell]]'s ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as "perhaps the most widely read modern book on the [[history of mathematics]]"; and as "one of the worst".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as [[Oedipal]], Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell&amp;nbsp;– including one that labels Cantor's father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]] (quotation from p. 350, note), [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 1 and notes. (Bell's Jewish stereotypes appear to have been removed from some postwar editions.)&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Bell's book is contained in [[Joseph Dauben]]'s biography.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dauben79|Dauben 1979]]&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Dauben:
{{quote|Cantor devoted some of his most vituperative correspondence, as well as a portion of the ''Beiträge'', to attacking what he described at one point as the '[[infinitesimal]] Cholera bacillus of mathematics', which had spread from Germany through the work of [[Carl Johannes Thomae|Thomae]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois Reymond]] and [[Otto Stolz|Stolz]], to infect Italian mathematics ... Any acceptance of infinitesimals necessarily meant that his own theory of number was incomplete. Thus to accept the work of Thomae, du Bois-Reymond, Stolz and [[Giuseppe Veronese|Veronese]] was to deny the perfection of Cantor's own creation. Understandably, Cantor launched a thorough campaign to discredit Veronese's work in every way possible.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben, J.: The development of the Cantorian set theory, pp.~181–219. See pp.216–217.

There is an error in this analysis. It states Cantor's Theorem 1 correctly: Algebraic numbers can be counted. However, it states his Theorem 2 incorrectly: Real numbers cannot be counted. It then says: "Cantor notes that, taken together, Theorems 1 and 2 allow for the redemonstration of the existence of non-algebraic real numbers …" This existence demonstration is [[non-constructive]]. Theorem 2 stated correctly is: Given a sequence of real numbers, one can determine a real number that is not in the sequence. Taken together, Theorem 1 and this Theorem 2 produce a non-algebraic number. Cantor also used Theorem 2 to prove that the real numbers cannot be counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13633">'''Gifts in kind''', also referred to as ''in-kind donations'', is a kind of [[alms|charitable giving]] in which, instead of giving money to buy needed goods and services, the goods and services themselves are given. Gifts in kind are distinguished from gifts of [[cash]] or [[stock]].  Some types of gifts in kind are appropriate, others are not.&lt;ref&gt;Moustaffa Osman, [http://odihpn.org/magazine/in-kind-donations-who-benefits "In-kind donations: Who benefits?"], ''Humanitarian Practice Network'', Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of in-kind gifts include goods like food, clothing, medicines, furniture, office equipment, and building materials. Performance of services, such as building an orphanage, providing office space or offering administrative support, may also be counted as in-kind gifts. 

While many attest to the benefits of in-kind over cash gifts, others have argued for their disadvantages, particularly in the context of [[Emergency management|disaster relief]].&lt;ref name="million-shirts-aid-worker-responses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodintents.org/aid-debates/1-million-shirts-campaign|title = 1 million shirts campaign|publisher = Good Intentions are not enough|date = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in-kind-donation-chceklist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodintents.org/core-posts/donating-goods-overseas|title = 6 questions you should ask before donating goods overseas|publisher = Good Intentions are not enough|date = 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of gifts in kind==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2013}}
===Reduce in waste of materials===

Many donated goods are either [[used goods|second hand]] or otherwise surplus. If not donated to people who need them, they might otherwise end up in a [[landfill]]. Thus, it is argued that gifts in kind reduce resource use and pollution. This provides a means, particularly for corporations, of doing social good with things that would otherwise be a liability.

===Use in disaster relief===

During disasters and other humanitarian crises, companies and individuals often want to help with the [[disaster relief]] operations. Some people have argued that giving goods that are already at hand is more cost effective for the donor than giving money to buy these same goods, thus reducing the cost of buying the goods afresh, particularly in the face of shortages.

===Long-term development aid===

Helping with longer term development in impoverished or otherwise distressed areas is a high priority for governments and large [[NGO]]s. It is argued that gifts in kind can be a significant component of a larger humanitarian development strategy.

===Lower susceptibility to corruption===

It has been argued that donated goods are much less susceptible to becoming [[political corruption|graft]] because physical goods are more tangible than money. 

However, the argument may be reversed in the modern context, now that there exist [[mobile phone]]-based payment mechanisms such as [[m-Pesa]] that have been used successfully for [[cash transfer]] programs, making cash transfers less dependent on intermediaries than the shipping of physical goods.

===Great impact for small cost===

Gifts in kind supply a market efficiency which is difficult to attain by other means.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pj.news.chass.ncsu.edu/2012/08/03/benefit-corporate-kind-donations "The Benefit of Corporate In-Kind Donations"], ''Philanthropy Journal'', 2012-08-03&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many charities that provide life-saving medications to people in impoverished nations could not afford to buy these drugs using their cash donations or grants alone. Donated drugs help these organizations to work most effectively at a much lower cost.

===Access to goods which are not readily available===

Some products are simply not available, but are desperately needed nonetheless. An example is anti-malarial drugs. These drugs are unavailable in many areas of the world where they are most needed, and if they are available, the people who need them are not in a position to purchase them. They are not manufactured locally and the costs of setting up local manufacturing facilities would be prohibitive, given the regulations surrounding pharmaceuticals.  There is a high likelihood of locally available drugs being counterfeit, with often fatal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-fatal-consequences-of-counterfeit-drugs-139422027 "The Fatal Consequences of Counterfeit Drugs"], ''Smithsonian magazine'', Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social responsibility===
As more and more companies continue to acknowledge their [[corporate social responsibility]], they are also recognizing the benefits of participating in gifts in kind programs.&lt;ref&gt;'In Kind Gifts'  [http://grantspace.org/Tools/Knowledge-Base/Funding-Resources/Corporations/In-kind-gifts Foundation Center]&lt;/ref&gt; In '' The Business Case for Product Philanthropy, '' a 63-page report published by the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs, authors Justin M. Ross and Kellie L. McGiverin-Bohan argue that businesses can do well by doing good through product philanthropy, as well as explore the advantages of donating goods over the liquidation and/or destruction of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with cash donations on the decrease over the past several years, offering donations of goods and services is a way for corporations to continue pursuing their philanthropic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philanthropy.com/article/Cash-Giving-Is-Flat-at/140257/.html "With Cash Giving Flat, Big Companies Offer Other Aid"], ''The Chronicle of Philanthropy'', 2013-07-14&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the chief criticisms of gifts in kind, particularly in the context of [[disaster relief]] but also in other contexts, is that the things that people are likely to gift may be poorly matched to the immediate needs of recipients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.copori.eu/1369.php | title= In-kind contribution - definitions and handling for scientific cases | publisher= Communication and Policy development for Research Infrastructures | accessdate= 29 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather be influenced by what donors happen to want to dispose of. Some of the possibilities are:&lt;ref name=in-kind-donation-chceklist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelkeizer.com/humourless/2010/the-unkindest-cut-why-gifts-in-kind-are-often-a-bad-idea/|title = The unkindest cut: why gifts in kind are often a bad idea|last = Keizer|first = Michael|date = 2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The donated items may not be needed by the recipients at all.
* The donated items may be needed by the recipients but are available locally and the cost of shipping the items from a remote location is far more than the cost of obtaining them locally. In the context of [[disaster relief]], a large influx of donated goods may clog the [[port]]s making it difficult for needed emergency supplies to reach their recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aidwatchers.com/2010/01/nobody-wants-your-old-shoes-how-not-to-help-in-haiti/|title = Nobody wants your old shoes: How not to help in Haiti|last = Shaikh|first = Alanna|publisher = Aid Watch|date= 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/01/29/what-is-it-with-the-shoes/ |title=What IS it with the shoes? |publisher=Tales from the Hood |date=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827042802/http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/01/29/what-is-it-with-the-shoes/ |archivedate=2012-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The donated items may be needed somewhat by the recipients, but it may be more beneficial if the items were sold to the highest payer and the money thus collected be used to meet other needs of the intended recipients.&lt;ref name=givewell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2010/04/30/who-needs-in-kind-donations-more-the-recipients-or-the-givers/|title = Who needs in-kind donations more: the recipients or the givers?|publisher = [[GiveWell]]|date = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aidthoughts.org/?p=1254|publisher = Aid Thoughts|title = The unkindness of in-kind aid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empowerment of recipients===

In addition to the argument that gifts in kind often do not meet the needs of recipients, it has also been argued that gifts in kind fail to empower the recipients because the recipients don't have as much flexibility on how to spend the gifts as they would with gifts of cash or of public goods that they actively solicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desireeadaway.com/you-have-to-know-me-before-you-can-help-me/|title = You have to know me before you can help me|date = 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, it has been argued that sending gifts in kind without checking on what the recipients may actually need may be disrespectful to the recipients, and in some cases self-centered and narcissistic, being focused on the needs of the donor rather than the recipient.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodandmilk.org/2010/04/28/say-no-to-old-clothes/|title = Say No to Old Clothers|publisher = Blood and Milk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on local economies===

Some critics of gifts in kind argue that, like [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], these have an artificial adverse impact on local industries producing similar goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviewfromthecave.com/2010/04/cash-not-gifts-please.html|title = Cash, not gifts please}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/19/how_not_to_help_haiti|title = How Not to Help Haiti|publisher = ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to criticism==

===Improved communication between recipients and donors===

Some of the downsides of gifts in kind may be mitigated by allowing recipients to communicate their needs to donors, thus helping donors and recipients match up. This has been made possible with the advent of the [[Internet]] as it is now possible to create an [[online marketplace]] for in-kind donations. [[Gifts in Kind International]] operates a network called Good360 that aims to do exactly this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.good360.org/AboutUs/Good360_FAQs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706104348/http://about.good360.org/AboutUs/Good360_FAQs |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-06 |title=Good360 FAQ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers use a sort of [[gift registry]] for this purpose; families and businesses impacted by the storm make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interoccupy.net/occupysandy/registries/|title=Occupy Sandy Registries|accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of online giving marketplaces, including [[GlobalGiving]] and [[DonorsChoose]], however, are focused on cash donations, though the nonprofits seeking these donations usually specify what types of things they intend to buy with a given donation quantity.

===Standards for gifts in kind===

Global Hand has published a series of standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/guidelines/all/document/6558|title = Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for gifts in kind. The principles include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/guidelines/all/document/21008|title = Global Hand Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Need driven: Driven by a genuine and thorough understanding of the needs of the recipients.
* Quality controlled: Goods are carefully chosen, of appropriate quality, and in consultation with the recipient.
* Determined by informed choices.
* Avoiding aid dependency.

and many more.

The Tales from the Hood blog has argued that there are two preconditions for successful gifts in kind.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/04/22/gifts-in-kind/ |publisher=Tales from the Hood |title=Gifts-in-Kind |date=2010-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609031257/http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/04/22/gifts-in-kind/ |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Gifts in kind should not drive the design of the charity program or aid program. Rather, the program should be evaluated based on the evidence and the appropriate gifts should be determined based on that evidence.
* Gifts in kind should not be used to substitute for other needed items if they do not fit the requirements well.

== Charity stores ==

Unlike a disaster relief scenario, the needs of a [[charity shop]] are long-term and more flexible; any item that can be sold at a price higher than the cost of warehousing it could be worthwhile.  Large non-profits, such as [[Goodwill Industries]], are also able to make use of items that cannot be sold in their thrift stores, for example by bundling them and selling them as bulk material or scrap.  These stores refuse donations that cost money to dispose of safely if unwanted, such as [[e-waste]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2076">'''Giulio Cesare la Galla''' (or '''Julius Cæsar Lagalla''' or '''Giulio Cesare Lagalla''') (1576–1624) was a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at the [[Collegio Romano]] in [[Italy]].

He was born in [[Padula, Italy|Padula]], at that time part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Lagalla was educated in philosophy and [[medicine]]. He became the official physician of the [[pope|papal]] [[galley]]s for a period, then came to Rome to lecture in natural philosophy at the [[Collegio Romano]]. He apparently became the leading [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] of the city, and was counted among the opponents of the [[Copernicus|Copernican]] [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]].

Following [[Galileo]]’s observations of the [[Moon]] by means of a [[telescope]], published in ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'', Lagalla published a booklet in response. He participated in the demonstrations of the instrument by Galileo and was not among those who doubted the ability of the instrument. But he did debate Galileo's three-dimensional representation of the Moon based on two-dimensional visual observations.

In his book ''De Phenomenis in Orbe Lunae'' (published in Venice in 1612) he claimed that the untreated stone (known as "lapis solaris" and shown to him by Galileo Galilei) was unable to give off light only after calcination. We now know that the "[[Bolognian Stone]]" was a piece of [[barite]] (barium sulphate).

The crater [[Lagalla (crater)|Lagalla]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

'''Gwon Geun''' (1352–1409) was a [[Korea]]n [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar at the dawn of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], and a student of [[Yi Saek]]. He was one of the first Neo-Confucian scholars of the Joseon dynasty, and had a lasting influence on the rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea.

==Background==
Gwon Geun was a [[Korea]]n Neo-Confucian scholar at the time of the change from the [[Goryeo]] dynasty (during which [[Buddhism]] was a prominent philosophy) to Joseon.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K Ralston, Ideas of Self and Self Cultivation in Korean Neo-Confucianism, PhD diss., UBC, 2001. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Andong]] Gwon clan that was very influential in the Goryeo court. He was a student of [[Yi Saek]], and passed the first level of civil service examinations at the age of fourteen. He later went to [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan China]], and during his six years stay there he passed the second and the third level examinations. After his return to Korea, he became associated with the loyalist faction, and was exiled in 1389 for his defense of the loyalist minister Yi Sungin (1349–1392). While in exile he got involved in the faction’s attempt to prevent the rise of [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seonggye]], by alerting the [[Ming Dynasty]]. His was acquitted when a flood that stopped the trial was accepted as an omen. A year later he returned from his exile and retired to the village of Yangchon, on which he based his pen name. However, king [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]] (R. 1392 - 1398) convinced him to devote his talent for the new dynasty.&lt;ref name="Kalton"&gt;Kalton, Michael C. "The Writings of Kwon Kun: The Context and Shape of Early Yi Dynasty Neo-Confucianism." In Wm. Theodore de Bary and JaHyun Kim Haboush, eds. The Rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea. New York: Columbia University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219–232}}

At first, resentment from [[Jeong Dojeon]]'s faction kept his role minimal, but Jeong Do-jeon and many of his colleagues were wiped out during the succession straggle of 1398. From that point until his death, Gwon Geun became the most important scholar in the government. During this time Gwon Geun directed the education system back toward literary accomplishments.

==Importance==

Gwon Geun lived and served during the dynastic change, and became eventually one of the architects of the Neo-Confucian ideology that provided both reasoning for the change, and ideological framework for the Joseon literati. He introduced Zhu Xi to the Korean audience, and his writings served as the basis for future scholars.

Among his writing on Neo-Confucianism, the most influential is probably the Iphak toseol (Diagrammatic Treatise for Entering upon Learning). He created this book for some students who came with questions in 1390 while he was in exile. He also wrote commentaries on the [[Book of Rites]] – A task entrusted by Yi Saek. He rearranged the text and added his own commentaries as well as those of Chinese contemporaries.  The work began in 1391 but ended only in 1404. Unfortunately his commentaries on the other classics are lost now. Gwon Geun developed a theory of ritual and emphasized the role of ritual in social order. He rearranged the [[Classic of Music]], taking the first part as the original and the second part as a commentary.&lt;ref name="Kalton"/&gt;{{rp|92}}

Gwon Geun was a prolific writer, and he is also known for his contributions to several anti Buddhist texts, including his preface to Jeong Dojeon’s Pulssi chappyeon (Arguments Against Mr. Buddha), as well as a contribution to the standardization of the sacrifices to pacify restless spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Boudewijn Walraven, “Popular Religion in a Confucianized Society,” in Culture and The State in Late Choson Korea, ed. Jahyun Kim Haboush and [[Martina Deuchler]] (Cambridge: Harvard University Asia Center, 1999), 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jakob Frohschammer (1821-1893).jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Jakob Frohschammer]]
'''Jakob Frohschammer''' (6 January 1821 – 14 June 1893) was a [[Germany|German]] theologian and philosopher.

==Biography==

Frohschammer was born at [[Illkofen]], which is now in the municipality of [[Barbing]], near [[Regensburg]]. Destined by his parents for the [[Roman Catholic]] priesthood, he studied [[theology]] at [[Munich]], but felt an ever-growing attraction to [[philosophy]]. Nevertheless, after much hesitation, he took what he himself calls the most mistaken step of his life, and in 1847 entered the priesthood. His keenly logical intellect, and his impatience of authority where it clashed with his own convictions, quite unfitted him for that unquestioning obedience which the Church demanded. It was only after open defiance of [[Valentin Riedel]], the [[bishop of Regensburg]], that he obtained permission to continue his studies at Munich.

He died at [[Kreuth|Bad Kreuth]] in the [[Bavaria]]n Highlands on 14 June 1893.
 
==Academic career==

===Beginnings===

He at first devoted himself more especially to the study of the history of dogma, and in 1850 published his ''Beitraege zur Kirchengeschichte'', which was placed on the Index Expurgatorius. But he felt that his real vocation was philosophy, and after holding for a short time an extraordinary professorship of theology, he became professor of philosophy in 1855. This appointment he owed chiefly to his work, ''Ueber den Ursprung der menschlichen Seelen'' (1854), in which he maintained that the human soul was not implanted by a special creative act in each case, but was the result of a secondary creative act on the part of the parents: that soul as well as body, therefore, was subject to the laws of [[heredity]]. This was supplemented in 1855 by the controversial ''Menschenseele und Physiologie'' ("Physiology and the Soul of Man").

Undeterred by the offence which these work gave to his ecclesiastical superiors, he published in 1858 the ''Einleitung in die Philosophie und Grundriss der Metaphysik'' in which he assailed the doctrine of [[Thomas Aquinas]] that philosophy was the handmaid of theology. In 1861 appeared ''Ueber die Aufgabe der Naturphilosophie und ihr Verhaltnis zu Naturwissenschaft'', which was, he declared, directed against the purely mechanical conception of the universe, and affirmed the necessity of a creative power. In the same year he published ''Ueber die Freiheit der Wissenschaft'', in which he maintained the independence of science, whose goal was truth, against authority and reproached the excessive respect for the latter in the Roman Church with the insignificant part played by the German Catholic in literature and philosophy.

===Denunciation and excommunication===

He was denounced by the [[pope]] himself in an apostolic brief of 11 December 1862 and students of theology were forbidden to attend his lectures. [[Public opinion]] was now keenly excited; he received an ovation from the Munich students, and the king, to whom he owed his appointment, supported him warmly. A conference of Catholic savants, held in 1863 under the presidency of [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger|Döllinger]], decided that authority must be supreme in the Church. When, however, Döllinger and his school in their turn started the Old Catholic movement, Frohschammer refused to associate himself with their cause, holding that they did not go far enough, and that their declaration of 1863 had cut the ground from under their feet.

Meanwhile, he had, in 1862, founded the Athenum as the organ of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Catholicism. For this he wrote the first adequate account in German of the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] theory of [[natural selection]], which drew a warm letter of appreciation from Darwin himself. [[Excommunicated]] in 1871, he replied with three articles, which were reproduced in thousands as pamphlets in the chief [[Europe]]an languages: ''Der Fels Petri in Rom'' (1873), ''Der Primat Petri und des Papstes'' (1875), and ''Das Christenthum Christi und das Christenthum des Papstes'' (1876).

===Other writings===

In ''Das neue Wissen und der neue Glaube'' (1873) he showed himself as vigorous and opponent of the [[materialism]] of [[David Strauss]] as of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]]. His later years were occupied with a series of philosophical works, of which the most important were: ''Die Phantasie als Grundprincip des Welt processes'' (1877), ''Ueber die Genesis der Menschheit und deren geistige Entwicklung in Religion, Sittlichkeit und Sprache'' (1883), and ''Ueber die Organisation und Cultur der menschlichen Gesellschaft'' (1885). His system is based on the unifying principle of imagination (Phantasie), which he extends to the objective creative force of Nature, as well as to the subjective mental phenomena to which the term is usually confined.

In addition to other treatises on theological subjects, Frohschammer was also the author of ''Monaden und Weltphantasie'' and ''Ueber die Bedeutung der Einbildungskraft in der Philosophie Kants und Spinozas'' (1879); ''Ueber die Principien der Aristotelischen Philosophie und die Bedeutung der Phantasie in der selben'' (1881); ''Die Philosophie als Idealwissenschaft und System'' (1884); ''Die Philosophie des Thomas von Aquino kritisch gewürdigt'' (1889); ''Ueber das Mysterium Magnum des Daseins'' (1891); ''System der Philosophie im Umriss, pt. i.'' (1892). His autobiography was published in A. Hinrichsen's ''Deutsche Denker'' (1888).

[[File:Krek.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Janez Evangelist Krek]]
'''Janez Evangelist Krek''' (27 November 1865 – 8 October 1917) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[Christian Socialist]] [[politician]], [[priest]], [[journalist]], and [[author]].

==Life and career==
He was born in a peasant family in the village of [[Sveti Gregor, Ribnica|Sveti Gregor]] (now in the [[Municipality of Ribnica]] in [[Lower Carniola]]), in what was then the [[Austrian Empire]]. His father died when he was a child. After finishing the [[Gymnasium (school)|state gymnasium]] in [[Ljubljana]] in 1884, he entered the [[Roman Catholic]] [[seminary]]. He was consecrated priest in 1888, and sent to the theological faculty in [[Vienna]] by the bishop [[Jakob Missia]]. There, he became acquainted with the new [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Austrian Christian Social]] movement of the charismatic politician [[Karl Lueger]]. Krek graduated in 1892, and was appointed [[vicar]] in the [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Ljubljana|Ljubljana Cathedral]]. From 1985, he taught philosophy at the Catholic seminary.

He soon became involved in politics within the conservative [[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovene People's Party]]. In 1897, he was elected representative to the Austrian Parliament. In 1900, he decided not to run for a second turn. In 1901, he was elected representative in the Provincial Diet of [[Carniola]].

Already in his early Viennese years, Krek had published critical articles against [[liberalism]]. Influenced by the ultra-conservative thought of the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Krk|bishop of Krk]] [[Anton Mahnič]], and by the encyclic ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', he attacked the liberal economic system as being anti-social and anti-democratic. Between 1898 and 1907, Krek organized several peasant and worker's [[co-operatives]], and transformed the Slovene People's Party from a conservative [[cleric]]al party into a mass political movement propagating social emancipation on the basis of Catholic political ideology. As the result such mobilization, the People's Party won by landslide the first elections by [[general suffrage]] in Austria in 1907, gaining 20 of the 24 Slovene seats in the Austrian Parliament. Krek was among those elected.

In the parliament, Krek proved to be a powerful orator. He proposed several measures for social welfare, but was frequently blocked by the conservative leadership of his own party, led by the powerful [[Ivan Šušteršič]]. In 1909, Krek founded the Yugoslav Labor Association (''Jugoslovanska strokovna zveza''), which would become and remain the biggest [[trade union]] in the [[Slovene Lands]] until its dissolution in 1941. 

Already in the late 1890s, Krek convinced the Slovene People's Party to seek a close alliance with [[Ante Starčević]]'s [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]]. Krek's aim was to establish a unified state of [[South Slavs]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] on the basis of the tradition of Croatian historical rights. Krek was a convinced supporter of the idea of the unity of South Slav peoples, and many later commentators, including the historian [[Lojze Ude]] and Communist politician [[Boris Kidrič]], reproached him with "Slavic romanticism" and "Yugoslav nationalism". 

In 1917, Krek became the proposer and leader of the so-called [[May declaration]] ({{lang-sl|Majniška deklaracija}}), which proposed the creation of a state of South Slavs under [[Habsburg]] rule. The declaration developed in a mass movement in the Slovene Lands, and Krek traveled extensively to [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in order to popularize the movement there, too. He died of exhaustion when returning from one of his travels. His ideals were realized only after his death and the collapse of Austria-Hungary, first with the creation of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and then the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].

He was buried in the [[Žale]] cemetery in Ljubljana.

'''Jean Grenier''' (6 February 1898, [[Paris]] – 5 March 1971, Dreux-Venouillet, [[Eure-et-Loir]]) was a French philosopher and writer. He taught for a time in [[Algiers]], where he became a significant influence on the young [[Albert Camus]].

==Biography==

Jean Grenier spent his childhood and adolescence in [[Saint-Brieuc]], [[Brittany]], the birthplace of [[Jules Lequier]], the visionary philosopher to whom Grenier would eventually dedicate his doctoral thesis. These early years, during which he became acquainted with [[Louis Guilloux]], [[Edmond Lambert]] and [[Max Jacob]], are documented in his autobiographical novel ''Les grèves'' (1957). In 1922 Grenier gained a teaching qualification in philosophy and began his academic career at the ''[[Institut français]]'' in [[Naples]], alongside [[Henri Bosco]]. He then spent some time working on the literary journal ''[[La Nouvelle Revue française]]'' (NRF) before returning to teaching as a professor of philosophy in [[Algiers]], the capital of [[Algeria]]. [[Albert Camus]] became a student of Grenier's and a close friendship developed between them. Strongly influenced by ''[[Les Îles]],'' which came out in 1933, Camus dedicated his first book to Grenier: ''[[L'envers et l'endroit]]'', published in Algeria by [[Edmond Charlot]]. His ''[[L'homme révolté]]'' was also dedicated to Grenier, and Camus provided the preface to the second edition of ''Les Îles'' in 1959.

However, the two thinkers followed very different ideological paths. While Camus was drawn to revolution and ultimately the desperate cries of ''[[La Chute]]'', Grenier was more contemplative, adopting the [[Taoist]] principle of [[Wou-Wei]] (non-action) and surreptitiously practising a [[quietist]] version of Christianity.

Grenier's 1938 ''[[Essai sur l'esprit d'orthodoxie]]'' is essentially a distillation of his writings from 1936 and 1937. Although it tackles the burning issues of the day, it was intended to be "a reaction against them". This essay gave rise to a generation of intellectuals divided by their attitudes towards Communism.

Grenier was well known in the intellectual circles of the time and contributed to numerous literary journals, including ''[[L'Œil]]'', ''[[XXe Siècle]]'' and ''[[Preuves]]''. A friend of [[Jean Paulhan]], he frequently wrote for the NRF. Grenier had an arts column in the newspaper ''Combat'' while Camus was editor, and one in ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' under ''[[Jean Daniel]]''. Following a period of teaching in Alexandria and Cairo (where he met [[André Gide]], [[Edmond Jabès]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Étiemble]] and [[Georges Perros]]) as well as teaching at the Faculty of Arts in [[Lille]], Grenier held a chair in [[aesthetics]] and science of art at the [[Sorbonne]] from 1962 to 1968.

Jean Grenier was particularly interested in the development of non-figurative art and wrote mainly on the subject of contemporary painting, including works such as: ''L'esprit de la peinture contemporaine'', ''Essais sur la peinture contemporaine'' and ''Entretiens avec dix-sept peintres non-figuratifs''. A summary of his reflections on the history of aesthetics, written for his students at the Sorbonne, may be found in ''L'art et ses problèmes''.

Until his death in 1971, Grenier regularly published works dealing with a wide range of philosophical questions, among them: ''Le choix'', ''Entretiens sur le bon usage de la liberté'', ''L'esprit du Tao'' and ''L'existence malheureuse''. Somewhat more mundane topics included: ''Sur la mort d'un chien'' and ''La vie quotidienne''. He filled notebooks with details of his relationships with [[Francine Camus]], [[René Char]], [[Louis Guilloux]], [[Jean Giorno]], [[André Malraux]] and [[Manès Sperber]] and with the editorial team of the [[Nouvelle Nouvelle Revue française]], as well as his conversations with numerous contemporary artists who visited him at his home in [[Bourg-la-Reine]]. Towards the end, he also wrote down some surprising definitions of technical terms and made some rather whimsical observations. In November 1968, just after the publication of Albert Camus – souvenirs, Grenier was awarded the ''[[Grand Prix national des lettres]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1763">'''John de Sècheville''' (or John de Sicca Villa) (died 1302) was a philosopher in the thirteenth century; his most famous work was his "De Principiis Naturae".

He was English, of noble stock, and lived the majority of his life in England. Information about his life is scant; it isn't known when he was born, though, he was still alive in 1292 (when [[John Peckham]], Archbishop of Canterbury died).

By 1245, he was already ordained, a Master of Arts and appointed to the Living of Pilham by the Duke of Cornwall. A little later, he is first recorded at the University of Paris, where in 1256 he became the Vice-Chancellor of Faculty of Arts. [[Matthew Paris]] records that John de Sècheville was important within the University and well-respected as an eminent philosopher and scientist.

He was a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] at [[Glasney College|Glasney]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.tesco.net/~k.wasley/Glasney.htm Glasney&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221235105/http://homepages.tesco.net/~k.wasley/Glasney.htm |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cornwall till December 1271, when he was appointed to a [[Prebendary|Prebend]] at [[Crediton]].

'''Juan Manuel Silva Camarena''' ([[Mexico City]], November 6, 1945), is a Mexican [[philosopher]], [[List_of_academic_ranks#Mexico|Cathedratic Professor]] and academic [[functionary]].

==Biography==

Juan Manuel Silva Camarena was born on November 6, 1945, younger son of the candy, chocolate and Mexican cream ([[rompope]]) manufacturer Heladio Silva Chávez (1887–1963) and Refugio Camarena Padilla (1913–2000), born in [[Ciudad Guzmán]], Jalisco.

Camarena read Freud and Schopenhauer before he was 15, and while attending the Junior High School, he read the chapters that Daily El Fígaro published weekly about the Memories of José Vasconcelos, friend of his uncle, José Silva, who was professor in the Faculty of Law of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] ([[UNAM]]).

When he was on High School, he used to visit the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature to listen some Greek or Latin classes, which complemented the compulsory classes of the Preparatoria Número 4 humanities area. There, he personally met the writer [[Juan José Arreola]], who explained in a conference the adventure of his peculiar writing education, awakening in the young Juan Manuel an admiration to his auto-didactic training, as he understood he couldn't study Philosophy by his own, so he should look for a guide or master.

While he was attending the 3rd year on High-School, he published his first article about vocation on the school newspaper: ''La Fragua Universitaria''. In 1969 he was accepted to UNAM in the Philosophy Course.
In 1973 he incorporated Juan Garzón Ontology course in the [[Faculty of Philosophy and Literature (UNAM)|Facultad de Filosofía y Letras]] as help professor, and achieved a professor vacancy for the subject: Ethics and Mankind Knowledge in the recently founded Science and Humanities College too, where he began teaching.
In Paris in 1971 he looked unsuccessfully for [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], but successfully he found [[Gabriel Marcel]]. He visited [[Sorbonne]] (in that days with Pierre Aubenque and his investigations about Aristoteles) and the new [[Paris Nanterre University]] (with Paul Ricoeur and his Will Philosophy, and Emmanuel Levinas and his Subjectivity Defense in his Critic to the Totality Idea).

Back to Mexico in 1972 he was admitted as a member of the Metaphysics Seminar by [[Eduardo Nicol]] who later appointed him Academic Secretary of that Seminar, a post he held until Nicol died in 1990.

===Education and Professional Work===

Juan Manuel Silva Camarena learned and taught in the UNAM: in 1977 he presented a thesis about theoretic methods of philosophic knowledge that the human being has used for his own self-knowledge: Autognosis. In 1978, by own merits and the recommendation of recognized professors Nicol, Ramón Xirau, Juliana González and Wonfilio Trejo, he enjoyed an UNAM scholarship to study the master and doctorate in Philosophy.

In December 1981 he was appointed as professor in the Class of Metaphysics at the Philosophy College of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature. He also taught regularly in that Faculty Philosophic Anthropology, where he started exploring the psychoanalysis as a particular man theory.

His youth interest in psychology and Freud carried him, first, to study as second career the Degree Course in Psychology (1979), and then to make, in 1981, the Master in Psychoanalysis, at the Investigation and Psychoanalytic Studies Center which was directed by Néstor Braunstein and Frida Saal. That year, he redacted his investigation Hacia una metafísica del inconsciente.

He was hired as professor in the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]] in 1985, and for many years he gave courses and conferences, he directed his Philosophic Anthropology Seminar and published works and translations at the Philosophy Magazine that Rubén Sanabria ran.

From 1992 to 1998 he was the first principal of the [[Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} which he founded. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd''' ({{lang-ar|نصر حامد أبو زيد}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈnɑsˤɾe ˈħæːmed aboˈzeːd|IPA}}; also '''Abu Zaid''' or '''Abu Zeid'''; July 10, 1943 – July 5, 2010) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Qur'an]]ic thinker, author, academic and one of the leading liberal theologians in [[Islam]]. He is famous for his project of a [[Humanism|humanistic]] Qur'anic [[hermeneutics]], which  "challenged mainstream views" on the Qur'an sparking "controversy and debate."&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|title=Naṣr Ḥāmid Abū Zayd|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Nasr-Hamid-Abu-Zayd|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not denying that the Qur'an was of divine origin, Zayd argued that it was a "cultural product" that had to be read in the context of the language and culture of seventh century Arabs,&lt;ref name=cook-2000-46/&gt; and could be interpreted in more than one way.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:174/&gt; He also criticized the use of religion to exert political power.&lt;ref name=obitnyt-6-7-10/&gt; In 1995 an Egyptian [[Sharia]] court declared him an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]], this led to threats of death and his [[religious persecution|fleeing]] Egypt several weeks later.&lt;ref name=obitnyt-6-7-10&gt;{{cite news|title=Nasr Abu Zayd, Who Stirred Debate on Koran, Dies at 66|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/world/middleeast/06zayd.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 December 2015|agency=REUTERS|date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He later "quietly" returned to Egypt where he died.&lt;ref name=obitnyt-6-7-10/&gt;)

== Biography ==
Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd was born in Quhafa, a small village some 120&amp;nbsp;km from Cairo, near [[Tanta]], [[Egypt]] on July 10, 1943.
Abu Zayd he went through a traditional religious school system&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:171&gt;[[#FRINHAZ2004|Kermani, "From revelation to interpretation", 2004]]: p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  and was a [[Qāriʾ]] (could recite the Qur'an with the proper rules of recitation) and a [[Hafiz (Quran)|Hafiz]] (had memorized the Quran completely) from a young age.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:169-70&gt;[[#FRINHAZ2004|Kermani, "From revelation to interpretation", 2004]]: p.169-70&lt;/ref&gt;
At the age of 12, Abu Zayd was imprisoned for allegedly sympathising with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. He  was also influenced by the
writings of Muslim Brotherhood revolutionary Islamist [[Sayyid Qutb]], who was executed by the Egyptian state in 1966, but moved away from the ideas of the Brethren and Qutb as he grew older.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:169-70/&gt;  After receiving technical training he worked for the National Communications Organization in Cairo. At the same time, he started studying at [[Cairo University]], where he obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[Arabist|Arabic Studies]] (1972), and later his [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1977) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degrees (1981) in [[Islamic Studies]], with works concerning the interpretation of the [[Qur'an]]. In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Department of Arabic Language and Literature at Cairo University as an assistant professor. He became an associate professor there in 1987. From 1985 to 1989, he worked as a visiting lecturer at [[Osaka University]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:170&gt;[[#FRINHAZ2004|Kermani, "From revelation to interpretation", 2004]]: p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the process of his being considered for promotion to full professor at Cairo University morphed from a routine academic process into a "legal nightmare for him and his wife."&lt;ref name=cook-2000-46&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Michael|title=The Koran : A Very Short Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUEe1twiimUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Koran+:+A+Very+Short+Introduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitj-XA2NvJAhWM4yYKHSF6CykQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Koran%20%3A%20A%20Very%20Short%20Introduction&amp;f=false |isbn=0192853449|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was eventually promoted, he was sued by conservative Muslims and a Court of Appeals declared him an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]] and divorced him from his wife. This was followed by calls for his death and exile to Europe where he obtained the position of Visiting Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Leiden University.&lt;ref name=OISO/&gt; (see [[Nasr Abu Zayd#The Nasr Abu Zayd case|below]])

In Europe he held the Ibn Rushd Chair of Humanism and Islam at the University for Humanistics, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands, while still supervising MA and PhD students at the University of Leiden as well. He also participated in a research project on Jewish and Islamic Hermeneutics as Cultural Critique in the Working Group on [[Islam and modernity]] at the Institute of Advanced Studies of Berlin (Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin). In 2005, he received the [[Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought]], Berlin. His wife returned several times to [[Egypt]] for discussion on MA and [[PhD]] theses at the French department at [[Cairo University]]. Dr. Abu Zayd also returned several times to [[Egypt]] after 1995, but mostly to visit family. During a visit in Indonesia he was infected by an unknown virus, and was hospitalized in Cairo. He died at a Cairo hospital on July 5, 2010 at the age of 66.  He was buried in his birthplace, on the same day.

== The Nasr Abu Zayd case ==
Zayd's academic work on the [[Qur'an]] led to a lawsuit against him by conservative Muslim scholars. The subsequent a [[hisbah]] trial led to him being  declared an apostate (''murtadd'') by an Egyptian court. Since under [[Sharia]] law it was not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married to a non-Muslim man, the court also declared he could not remain married to his wife—Cairo University French Literature professor Dr. Ibtihal Younis.&lt;ref&gt;Karim Alrawi, "Letter from Cairo", ''New Statesman &amp; Society'', London,  June 25, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision, in effect, forced him out of his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (8 August 2009) "The battle for a religion's heart" ''The Economist'' 392(8643): pp. 52&amp;ndash;53, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection of promotion ===
The Nasr Abu Zayd case began when he was refused a promotion for the post of full professor. In May 1992, Dr. Abu Zayd presented his academic publications to the Standing Committee of Academic Tenure and Promotion for advancement. Among his thirteen works in Arabic and other languages were ''Imam Shāfi'ī and the Founding of Medieval Ideology'' and ''The Critique of Religious Discourse''.  The committee presented three reports, two were in favor of the promotion of Dr. Abu Zayd. But the third one, written by Abdel-Sabour Shahin, a professor of Arabic linguistics at the Cairo Dar al- 'Ulum, and a committee member, accused Abu Zayd of "clear affronts to the Islamic faith," and rejected the promotion.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:170/&gt;

Despite the two positive reports, the Tenure and Promotion Committee voted against the promotion (seven votes to six), arguing that his works did not justify a promotion. The Council of the Arabic Department stated against the committee's decision, and The Council of the Faculty of Arts criticized the committee report. Despite all that, the Council of Cairo University confirmed the decision of the committee report on 18 March 1993.

Not content with blocking the promotion, at the pulpit at Amr Ibn Al-`Aas Mosque where he was a preacher, Shahin publicly denounced Abu Zayd as an apostate (murtadd).{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=204}}
Shortly thereafter a "flood of vitriolic articles accusing him of heresy" appeared in the "mainstream, semi -state press".&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:170/&gt;

Critics of the case have noted that Shahin's interest in the beliefs of Abu Zayd may have been motivated by factors other than piety.  In addition to being preacher during Friday Services at Cairo's oldest mosque and a host of a number of television and radio programs about Islam, Shahin was active in Egypt's ruling party as chairman of its religious committee,{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=203}} and

&lt;blockquote&gt;a consultant in the late 1980s to the Rayyan Investment Company. Rayyan had touted itself as an Islamic financial outfit, appealing to pious Muslims who believed that Islam forbids them to receive interest. It promised to pay them instead with Islamically sanctioned `dividends.` Badly run, the firm went bankrupt, depriving thousand of Egyptians of their life savings. In his book, Abu Zaid cited Rayyan as an example of how some Islamists used religious discourse for ulterior motives and material gain. Shahin had not been pleased with the criticism.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=203}}&lt;ref&gt;see also: `The Case of Abu Zaid,` ''Index on Censorship'' 4 (1996) 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: Loutfi Al Khouli, `University and Academic Freedom,` ''Al Ahram Weekly'', April 8–14, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Forced divorce proceedings ===

In June (April according to another account{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=204}}), the case moved beyond Cairo University when a group of Islamists led by the former state official, Muhammad Samida Abu Samada and including Shahin, filed a lawsuit before the Giza Lower Personal Status Court (family court) in Cairo demanding the nullification of the marriage between Abu Zayd and his wife, Dr. Ibtihal Younis, arguing that Islamic law forbids a marriage between a Muslim woman and an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]]. (The couple were not notified but heard about the case first in the tabloid newspapers.)&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:170/&gt;
The court case was filed through personal status law for divorce because in this area "the Islamic Shari'a is still in force" in Egyptian law.&lt;ref name=Agrama-2012-45&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agrama|first1=Hussein Ali|title=Questioning Secularism: Islam, Sovereignty, and the Rule of Law in Modern Egypt|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press.|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRx_40HIxy4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Nasr+Abu+Zayd+apostasy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizwuneutLJAhVDJiYKHYkCBXoQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nasr%20Abu%20Zayd%20apostasy&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filing cases of ''[[hisbah]]'' against Muslims who violated a  "right of God" and thus disturbed the public order was at one time the function of an official known as the ''muhtasib'' before that function had lapsed. The lawsuit by the Islamists resurrected ''hisbah'' and had the advantage that the plaintiffs did not have to be directly affected by a defendant's alleged wrongdoing.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=204}}
The ''hisbah'' principles are stated in Article 89 and 110 of the Regulations Governing Sharia Courts in Egypt but were amended in 1998, too late to help Abu Zayd.&lt;ref name=OISO&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shepard|first1=William E.|title=Abu Zayd, Nasir Hamid|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0919|website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to conservative Islamist scholars cited against Abu Zayd by the plaintiffs, the professor was an `ignorant proponent of the Enlightenment `who understand[s] freedom of thought to mean freedom to lead the people to infidelity`. Another called Abu Zayd's work `cultural AIDS` and `intellectual terrorism.` (This critic was himself assailed as an apostate several years later for his own religious writings.)&lt;ref name=Kurzman-119&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=The Missing Martyrs: Why There Are So Few Muslim Terrorists|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA.|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpW7hmBQ_mYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=abu+zayd+islamism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1WYA-WqVRq&amp;sig=0OyygQhS-e8dHC8IMsbryry6DU4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJx7WglNzJAhVLJR4KHYkBBLoQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=abu%20zayd%20islamism&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 1994, the Giza Personal Status Court rejected the demand because the plaintiff had no direct, personal interest in the matter. However, on June 14, 1995 Cairo's Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling in favor of the plaintiff, judge  'Abd al-'Alim Musa (who had worked for several years in Saudi Arabia) found Abu Zayd to be an apostate, and declaring the marriage of Abu Zayd and Ibtihal Younis null and void.

;Reasoning of judgement
Among other things the court declared that the verse authorizing the discriminatory [[jizya]] tax on non-Muslims `is not subject to discussion.` and that owning slave women is allowed under certain conditions by `clear` Qur'anic verses `that we must follow`.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=206}}&lt;ref name=CHRLA1996:12&gt;[[#CHRLA1996|CHRLA1996, '' Dossier 14-15'', 1996]]: p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p.16 of the judicial opinion"&gt;p.16 of the judicial opinion&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Zayd was also accused on not believing in ''[[jinn]]'' (genies).&lt;ref name=cook-2000-47&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Michael|title=The Koran : A Very Short Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUEe1twiimUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Koran+:+A+Very+Short+Introduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitj-XA2NvJAhWM4yYKHSF6CykQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Koran%20%3A%20A%20Very%20Short%20Introduction&amp;f=false |isbn=0192853449|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgement stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the defendant's proposition that the requirement of Christians and Jews to pay ''[[jizyah]]'' (poll tax) constitutes a reversal of humanity's efforts to establish a better world is contrary to the divine verses on the question of ''jizyah'', in a manner considered by some, inappropriate, even for temporal matters and judgments notwithstanding its inappropriateness when dealing with the Qur'an and [[Sunnah]], whose texts represent the pinnacle of humane and generous treatment of non-Muslim minorities. If non-Muslim countries were to grant their Muslim minorities even one-tenth of the rights accorded to non-Muslim minorities by Islam, instead of undertaking the mass murder of men, women, and children, this would be a step forward for humanity. The verse on ''jizyah'', verse 29 of Surat al-Tawbah, which the defendant opposes, is not subject to discussion.&lt;ref name=CHRLA1996:12/&gt;&lt;ref name="p.16 of the judicial opinion"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The judgment stated that the questioning by Abu Zayd of the permissibility of the ownership of slave girls, a principle considered "religiously proven without doubt", is "contrary to all the divine texts which permit such provided that the required conditions are met".&lt;ref name="p.16 of the judicial opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHRLA1996:13&gt;[[#CHRLA1996|CHRLA1996, '' Dossier 14-15'', 1996]]: p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Court of Appeals head Judge 'Abd al- 'Alim Musa and his fellow jurists declared Abu Zayd to be "a threat to national security, saying that by attacking Islam, he had attacked the state on which it is founded."{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=207}}&lt;ref&gt;see also: excerpts from the appeals court ruling come from a translation in `People's Rights,` June 1995, pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative religious interpretation of the court was evidenced a month after the ruling, when Judge Alim told an Egyptian magazine that Muslims are required to believe in spirits, devils, and the throne of God.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=320}}&lt;ref&gt;Reuters Cairo, July 13, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In examining Abu Zayd's work and the charge against him of disbelieving in Jinn, scholar [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] notes that Abu Zayd did not explicitly deny the existence of ''[[jinn]]'', but explained their reason for being in the Qur'an as part of an appeal "to existing Arab conceptions of communication between genies and humans". Since jinn "were part of the culture of the Arabs at the time when the Quran was revealed" (and still are very much a part of Arab folk culture), without their inclusion "the notion of divine revelation" would have been difficult to accept.&lt;ref name=cook-2000-47/&gt;

;Promotion at Cairo University
The irony of the story occurred when Cairo University promoted Abu Zayd to full professor and the academic committee wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After reviewing the works submitted by Dr. Abu-Zeid in his application for promotion, examining them both individually and as a whole, we have reached the following conclusion: his prodigious academic efforts demonstrate that he is a researcher well-rooted in his academic field, well-read in our Islamic intellectual traditions, and with a knowledge of all its many branches — Islamic principles, theology, jurisprudence, Sufism, Qur'anic studies, rhetoric and linguistics — He has not rested on the laurels of his in-depth knowledge of this field, but has taken a forthright, critical position. He does not attempt to make a critique until he has mastered the issues before him, investigating them by way of both traditional and modern methodologies. In sum he is a free thinker, aspiring only to the truth. If there is something urgent about his style, it stems from the urgency of the crisis which the contemporary Arab-Islamic World is witnessing and the necessity to honestly identify the ills of this world in order that an effective cure be found. Academic research should not be isolated from social problems, but should be allowed to participate in current debates and to suggest solutions to current dilemmas by allowing researchers to investigate and interpret as far as possible.&lt;ref name=CHRLA1996:3&gt;[[#CHRLA1996|CHRLA1996, '' Dossier 14-15'', 1996]]: p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Reaction to decision ===
The decision provoked a great debate, criticism abroad because of the violation of fundamental human rights but anger against Abu Zayd and death threats in Egypt. Abu Zayd himself lamented, "it took one week for my name to be cursed all over Egypt. Even in my village they were saying I was teaching heresies to the students ...."{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=204}}

====Death threats====
Shortly after the verdict was issued,  a group of professors at [[al-Azhar University]], the "theological centre of Egypt", issued a joint statement calling for Abu Zayd's execution.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:170/&gt;  The [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization (which assassinated Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981 and was engaged in a guerrilla war with the government at the time) issued a statement saying the professor should be killed for abandoning  his Muslim faith. But calls for his death were not limited to insurgents. Even a newspaper published by the ruling political party of the ostensibly secular anti-fundamentalist regime, ''The Islamic Banner'',  declared that `execution` was a fitting penalty if Abu Zayd failed to repent.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=204}}&lt;ref&gt;from April 15 and 22, 1993 issues of ''Islamic Banner'' as quoted in Index on Censorship p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Abu Zayd received threats in the mail, one promising "No matter how much the police tries to protect you, you will not get away.".{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=204}}

Dr. Nasr Abu Zayd was protected by the police, but belief in his apostasy was so widespread that even a police officer guarding his house referred to him as a "kafir" when asked about the situation by a neighbor of Abu Zayd.&lt;ref name=Whitaker-2009-127&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitaker|first1=Brian|title=What's Really Wrong with the Middle East|date=2009|publisher=Saqi|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta0sAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=abu+zaid+neighbor+kafir&amp;dq=abu+zaid+neighbor+kafir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhk-WP-NHJAhUMJCYKHYYgCHsQ6AEIHDAA|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case against decision====
The Court case was based on the alleged apostasy of Nasr Abu Zayd, hence the decision was based on Qur'anic punishment. But the Egyptian Penal Code did not recognize apostasy, and Civil Law restricts the proof of apostasy to two possibilities: either a certificate from a specialized religious institution certifying that the individual has converted to another religion, or a confession by the individual that he has converted. Neither had been provided. Nasr Abu Zayd never declared himself to be an apostate. In an interview, he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm sure that I'm a Muslim. My worst fear is that people in Europe may consider and treat me as a critic of Islam. I'm not. I'm not a new Salman Rushdie, and don't want to be welcomed and treated as such. I'm a researcher. I'm critical of old and modern Islamic thought. I treat the Qur'an as a ''naṣṣ'' (text) given by God to the Prophet Muhammad. That text is put into a human language, which is the Arabic language. When I said so, I was accused of saying that the Prophet Muhammad wrote the Qur'an. This is not a crisis of thought, but a crisis of conscience.&lt;ref name=WtPCT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abou El-Magd|first1=Nadia|title=When the professor can't teach|url=http://www.arabworldbooks.com/news10.html|website=arabworldbooks.com|agency=Al-Ahram Weekly |issue=15–21 June 2000|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, a number of rulings by the Egyptian Court of Cassation seem to contradicted the verdict:

*"Since a Muslim inherits his/her religion from his/her parents, he/she does not need to re-announce his/her Faith".&lt;ref&gt;Court of Cassation, 5/11/1975 &amp;ndash; Court decisions 1926, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
*"It is stated that for a person to be a Muslim it is enough that he articulates his belief in Allah and the Prophet Mohamed. The judge may not look into the seriousness of incentives behind the confession. It is not necessary to make a public confession".&lt;ref&gt;Justice Azmy El Bakry, The Encyclopædia of Jurisprudence and the Judiciary in Personal Status, 3rd Edition, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;
*"In accordance with the established course of this court, religious belief is considered to be a spiritual matter, and consequently is to be judged only by what is explicitly declared. Therefore, a judge is not to investigate the sincerity nor the motive of such declared statement".&lt;ref&gt;Cassation 44, judicial year 40, session 26 January 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
*"This court has always taken the course established by the law that religious belief is among matters in which the judgment should be based on declared statement, and by no means should the sincerity or motives of this statement be questioned".&lt;ref&gt;Cassation 51, judicial year 52, session 14 June 1981 (Both rulings in Azmy al-Bakry, p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exile ====

On 23 July 1995, the couple fled their homeland for an indefinite sabbatical.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=208}} They flew to [[Madrid]], then decided to go from [[Spain]] to the [[Netherlands]], where he was invited to teach as a Visiting Professor at the [[Leiden University]].
Abu Zayd explained, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I couldn't take more than two months of around the clock security. Whenever someone came to visit they had to be cleared. Whenever I wanted to go out I had to coordinate with security. I couldn't just go to a coffee shop with my friends and play a round of backgammon. What kind of life was that?&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,260766,00.html Lives torn apart in battle for the soul of the Arab world], [[Mona Eltahawy]], October 20, 1999, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though his books were not officially banned in Egypt, they were pulled from the library shelves of his alma mater.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=208}}

On November 8, 1999, he filed a suit against the Egyptian justice minister, demanding that the 1996 ruling which annulled the marriage be declared illegal.

===Legacy===
The Egyptian government "strived to ignore" the case. There were only brief mentions of it in the state-run media and no government official spoke in his defense. However, in 1998, the regulations governing Sharia courts in Egypt were amended making it impossible for individuals to file lawsuits accusing someone of [[apostasy]], leaving the issue to the prerogative of the prosecution office.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=209}}

The action against Abu Zayd was not isolated. During the 1990s there were several assaults on liberal intellectuals and artists in Egypt and elsewhere in the Muslim world. Ahmed Sobhy Mansour was dismissed from [[Al-Azhar University]] and imprisoned for six months. This was based on a verdict reached by the university itself on the grounds that he rejected a fundamental tenet of [[Islam]] in his research of truth of some of [[Muhammad]]'s sayings, or [[Hadith]]. Egyptian [[Nobel laureate]] [[Naguib Mahfouz]] was stabbed in the neck by an [[Islamist]] in 1994, leaving him incapable of using his hand to write. Egyptian courts were the theatre of different lawsuits brought against intellectuals, journalists, and university professors such as Atif al-Iraqi, Ragaa al-Naqash, Mahmoud al-Tohami, and [[Youssef Chahine]] (for his film ''El-Mohager'', ''The Emigrant'').

Abu Zayd's case has been described as demonstrating the "coercive impulse behind much [[Islamism]], as well as the unintended consequences of making concessions in its direction",&lt;ref name=McHugo-2013-231&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHugo|first1=John|title=Concise History of the Arabs|date=2013|publisher=The New Press|isbn=978-1-595589507|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those conservatives calling for his killing included religious figures and media supposedly co-opted by the regime. Other became suspicious of "collusion" between "violent rebels and the conservative Islamists" who held "senior positions in some of Egypt's public institutions."{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=210}}  [[Gilles Kepel]]) noted the case as a demonstration of how moderate and extremists Islamists could "complemented one another's actions". Rather than the moderates undermining the extremists as some had hoped, "moderates" (such as Abdel-Sabour Shahin and The Islamic Banner) would singled out victims as "apostates"  who were then executed (or in Zayd's case provided with a very credible threat of murder) by the extremists (such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad). The "moderates" would deplore fanaticism of the extremists in public, but plead "attenuating circumstance" on their behalf when the need arose.&lt;ref name=Kepel-2002-288&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|date=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris.|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=showed+how+the+moderates+and+the+extremists+complemented+one+anothers+actions,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vBEF_7MUP5&amp;sig=u1dObeMzwaGVQX2px5xqaPkJNHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBuK76odLJAhVIrB4KHWeKBOIQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=showed%20how%20the%20moderates%20and%20the%20extremists%20complemented%20one%20anothers%20actions%2C&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His case has been compared to controversies over interpretation of the Quran involving [[Taha Hussein]] in the 1920s and [[Muhammad Ahmad Khalafallah]] in the 1940s. The fact that a well established/respected scholar like Abu Zayd "suffered more concretely" than the other two is an illustration of "the gains made by Islamists in the last half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=OISO/&gt;

== Thought ==
According to scholar [[Navid Kermani]] "three key themes" emerge from Abu Zayd's work:
#to trace the various interpretations and historical settings of the single Qur'anic text from the early days of Islam up to the present;
#to demonstrate the "interpretational diversity" (''al-ta 'addud alta 'wili'') &lt;ref&gt;''Mafhum al-nass: dirasa fi 'ulum al-Qur'an''. Cairo, 1990. '', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; that exists within the Islamic tradition;
#and to show how this diversity has been "increasingly neglected" across Islamic history.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:174&gt;[[#FRINHAZ2004|Kermani, "From revelation to interpretation", 2004]]: p.174&lt;/ref&gt;
Abu Zayd saw himself as an heir to the [[Muʿtazila]], "particularly their idea of the created Qurʿān and their tendency toward metaphorical interpretation."&lt;ref name=OISO/&gt;

===Quran as text===
Abu Zayd strongly opposed the belief in a "single, precise and valid interpretation of the Qur'an handed down by the Prophet for all times".&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:173&gt;[[#FRINHAZ2004|Kermani, "From revelation to interpretation", 2004]]: p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

In his view, the Quran made Islamic Arab culture a `culture of the text` (''hadarat al-nass'') par excellence, but because the language of the Quran is not self-explanatory, this implied Islamic Arab culture was also a culture of interpretation (''hadarat al-ta'wil'').&lt;ref name="FRINHAZ2004:171"/&gt;    Abu Zayd emphasized "intellect" (''`aql'') in understanding the Quran, as opposed to "a hermeneutical approach which gives priority to the narrated traditions [ [[hadith]] ]" (''naql''). As a reflection of this Abu Zaid used the term ''ta'wil'' (interpretation) for efforts to understand the Quran, while in the Islamic sciences, the literature that explained the Quran was referred to as  ''tafsir'' (commentary, explanation).&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:172&gt;[[#FRINHAZ2004|Kermani, "From revelation to interpretation", 2004]]: p.172&lt;/ref&gt;

For Abu Zaid, interpretation goes beyond explanation or commentary, "for without" the Qur'an would not have meaning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [Qur'anic] text changed from the very first moment - that is, when the Prophet recited it at the moment of its revelation - from its existence as a divine text (''nass ilahi''), and became something understandable, a human text (''nass insani''), because it changed from revelation to interpretation (''li-annahu tahawwala min al-tanzil ila al-ta'wil''). The Prophet's understanding of the text is one of the first phases of movement resulting from the text's connection with the human intellect.&lt;ref name=FRINHAZ2004:172/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naqd al-hhitab al-dini, p. 93., translated by  {{cite book |url=http://blog.malakut.org/nkermani(cut).pdf |chapter=From revelation to interpretation: Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd and the Literary study of the Qur'an |first=Navid |last=Kermani |title=Modern Muslim Intellectuals and the Qur'an|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |page=172 |editor1-first=Suha |editor1-last=Taji-Farouki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Humanistic hermeneutics of the Quran===
From the beginning of his academic career, Abu Zaid developed a renewed [[hermeneutic]] view (the theory and methodology of text interpretation) of the [[Qur'an]] and further Islamic holy texts, arguing that they should be interpreted in the historical and cultural context of their time. The mistake of many Muslim scholars was "to see the [[Qur'an]] only as a text, which led conservatives as well as liberals to a battle of quotations, each group seeing clear verses (when on their side) and ambiguous ones (when in contradiction with their vision)". But this type of controversy led both conservatives and liberals to produce authoritative [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name=FaPoI-2009-166/&gt; This vision of the [[Qur'an]] as a text was the vision of the elites of Muslim societies, whereas, at the same time, the Qur'an as "an oral discourse" played the most important part in the understanding of the masses.

Nasr Abu Zayd called for another reading of the holy book through a "humanistic hermeneutics", an interpretation which sees the Qur'an as a living phenomenon, a discourse. Hence, the Qur'an can be "the outcome of dialogue, debate, despite argument, acceptance and rejection". This liberal interpretation of [[Islam]] should open space for new perspectives on the religion and social change in Muslim societies.&lt;ref name=FaPoI-2009-166&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Philosophy of Islam |date=2009 |publisher=Gyan Publishing House |isbn=978-81-7835-719-5 |pages=166–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMiQMWGhoScC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=which+led+conservatives+as+well+as+liberals+to+a+battle+of+quotations&amp;hl=en |accessdate=12 December 2015 |chapter=10. Reformers. Reformers in the Modern Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Zayd's analysis finds several "insistent calls for social justice" in the Qur'an . One example is when [[Muhammad]]—busy preaching to the rich people of [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]—failed to pay attention to a poor blind fellow named [[Abd-Allah ibn Umm-Maktum|Ibn Umm Maktūm]] who came asking the [[Prophet]] for advice. The Quran strongly criticizes [[Muhammad]]'s attitude. ([[Quran 80]]:10) &lt;ref&gt;({{cite quran|80|10|s=ns}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FaPoI-2009-166/&gt;

Abu Zayd also argued that while the Qur'anic discourse was built in a patriarchal society, and therefore the addressees were naturally males, who received permission to marry, divorce, and marry off their female relatives, it is "possible to imagine that Muslim women receive the same rights", and so the Quran  had a "tendency to improve women's rights". The classical position of the modern ''[[ulama|'ulamā']]'' about that issue is understandable as "they still believe in superiority of the male in the family".&lt;ref name=FaPoI-2009-166/&gt;

Abu Zayd's critical approach to classical and contemporary Islamic discourse in the fields of [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[politics]], and [[humanism]], promoted modern Islamic thought that might enable [[Muslim]]s to build a bridge between their own tradition and the modern world of [[freedom of speech]], equality ([[minority rights]], [[women's rights]], [[social justice]]), [[human rights]], [[democracy]] and [[globalisation]].&lt;ref name=FaPoI-2009-166/&gt;

'''Oswald Hanfling''' (21 December 1927 &amp;ndash; 25 October 2005) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] who worked from 1970, until his death, at the [[Open University]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Johann Glock |author-link=Hans-Johann Glock |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/nov/29/guardianobituaries.obituaries |title=Obituary: Oswald Hanfling |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=29 November 2005 |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Oswald Hanfling was born in [[Berlin]] in 1927. His parents were [[Judaism|Jewish]] and when their business was vandalised on [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, he was sent to [[England]] by [[Kindertransport]] and lived in [[Bedford]] with a foster family. After the [[Second World War]], he traced his family to [[Israel]], with the help of the [[Red Cross]].

Hanfling left school at 14 to become an "office boy". For the next 25 years he worked in business, eventually running his own [[employment agency]] for [[au pair]]s. He told his students that he had picked up the English language through reading comics as a young boy.

==Education==
Bored by business, Hanfling studied [[Advanced Level (UK)|'A' levels]] and then enrolled on a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[philosophy]] by [[Distance education|correspondence]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. He gained a [[First class honours#First Class Honours|first]], then embarked on a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], which he completed in 1971.

==Academic work==
Hanfling was appointed as a [[lecturer]] at the [[Open University]] in 1970, and worked there until retiring as a [[professor]] in 1993. His biggest influence was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

==Trivia==
It was impossible to tell, either from his conversation or from his writings, that Hanfling was not a native [[English language|English]] speaker.  He once commented to [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] that he found it strange that Wittgenstein had continued to write in [[German language|German]] throughout his life. Anscombe, who must have assumed that Hanfling was English, replied that only someone who wasn’t able to read Wittgenstein in German could have made that remark.

He was greatly admired by his students. He taught a number of Williams College students, who went to Oxford University as part of the Williams-Exeter program. He was passionate about Wittgenstein's later works and a strong advocate of ordinary language philosophy. He was averse to jargon and insisted on the use of ordinary prose in writing and speech. He was so particular about grammar and the use of words that he would often ask his students to explain their use of a comma in a particular place.

==Personal life==
Hanfling spent the rest of his life in England with his wife Helga, a fellow German refugee and an acclaimed painter, and their two daughters.

In 2007 a one-day conference on Wittgenstein was held, at the Walton Hall Campus on the OU, [[Milton Keynes]], in honour of Hanfling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/philos/hanfling-conf.htm |title=Wittgenstein: a one-day conference in honour of Oswald Hanfling, Department of Philosophy, The Open University |publisher=Open.ac.uk |date=20 July 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Oswald Hanfling wrote many books, amongst the most popular and significant are:
*''Logical Positivism'', [[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell]], 1981, {{ISBN|978-0-631-12853-3}} (his first book)

{{Nihongo|'''''Otaku'''''|おたく/オタク}} is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, particularly in [[anime and manga fandom|anime and manga]]. Its contemporary use originated with [[Akio Nakamori]]'s 1983 essay in ''[[Manga Burikko]]''.&lt;ref name="transscript of original essay text (Japanese)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burikko.net/people/otaku01.html |script-title=ja:『おたく』の研究（１） 街には『おたく』がいっぱい 中森明夫 （1983年6月号） |publisher=Burikko.net|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English translation of original essay text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neojaponisme.com/2008/04/02/what-kind-of-otaku-are-you/ |title=Otaku Research #1 "This City is Full of Otaku" by Nakamori Akio (Translated by Matt Alt) |publisher=Néojaponisme}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Otaku'' may be used as a pejorative; its negativity stems from a stereotypical view of otaku and the media's reporting on [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], "The Otaku Murderer", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku,&lt;ref name="mynavi"/&gt; both in Japan and elsewhere.

Otaku subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of otaku traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, after the release of works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' before it branched into [[Comic Market]]. The definition of otaku subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of otaku emerged. In 2005, the Nomura Research Institute divided otaku into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single otaku interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, [[Japanese idol|idol]] and electronics otaku. The economic impact of otaku has been estimated to be as high as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).&lt;ref name=money /&gt;

==Etymology==
''Otaku'' is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:お宅|お宅]],}} ''otaku''). This word is often used metaphorically, as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is "you". For example, early in the anime ''[[Macross]]'', first aired in 1982, the characters [[Hikaru Ichijyo]] and [[Lynn Minmay]] use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better.&lt;ref name="NRI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SDFMeps3and4"/&gt; The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (おたく), [[katakana]] (オタク or, less frequently, ヲタク) or rarely in [[rōmaji]], first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]]. His 1983 series {{nihongo|''Research for "Otaku"''|『おたく』の研究|"Otaku" no Kenkyū}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]'', applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Shōji Kawamori]] had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="NRI"/&gt; Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans.&lt;ref name="NRI"/&gt; Morikawa Kaichirō, an author and lecturer at [[Meiji University]], identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.&lt;ref name="essay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Otaku Encyclopedia|author=Patrick W. Galbraith|date=2009|publisher=Kodansha|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author [[Motoko Arai]], who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 ''Variety'' magazine essay.&lt;ref name="greece"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|The source contains an excerpt of the introduction of the book ''Otaku Spaces'' by Patrick W. Galbraith. Published Spring 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9844576-5-6}}. This source was not consulted directly for this citation. An except also exists on Androniki Christodoulou's blog, the photographer of the book.}}&lt;ref name="Otaku Spaces Book"/&gt;

In 1989, the case of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], "The Otaku Murderer", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention.&lt;ref name="essay" /&gt; Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and [[slasher film]]s that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine ''Bessatsu Takarajima'' dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of otaku. It was called {{nihongo|''Otaku no Hon''|おたくの本|lit. The Book of Otaku}} and delved into the subculture of otaku with 19 articles by otaku insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.&lt;ref name="Nippon_Foundation"/&gt;

==Usage==
In modern Japanese slang, the term ''otaku'' is mostly equivalent to "[[geek]]" or "[[nerd]]", but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt; However, it can relate to any [[Fan (person)|fan]] of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt; "When these people are referred to as otaku, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an “otaku” as a person unable to relate to reality".&lt;ref name="Otaku: Is it a dirty word?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"/&gt;  The word entered English as a [[loanword]] from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a [[Fan (person)|fan]] of [[anime]]/[[manga]] but can also refer to Japanese video games or Japanese culture in general. The American magazine ''[[Otaku USA]]'' popularizes and covers these aspects.&lt;ref name="Home - Otaku USA Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan /&gt; The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of ''[[Gunbuster]]'', which referred to anime fans as otaku. Gunbuster was released officially in English in March 1990. The term's usage spread throughout rec.arts.anime with discussions about [[Otaku no Video]]'s portrayal of otaku before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed.&lt;ref name="fan"/&gt; The term was also popularized by [[William Gibson]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Idoru]]'', which references otaku.&lt;ref name="Modern boys and mobile girls"/&gt;

==Sub-culture==
Morikawa Kaichirō identifies the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product of the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a [[caste system]], but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society identifies the value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt;

Even prior to the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the subculture were identified in a 1981 issue of ''Fan Rōdo'' (Fan road) about "culture clubs".&lt;ref name="essay"/&gt; These individuals were drawn to anime, a counter-culture, with the release of hard science fiction works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''. These works allowed a congregation and development of obsessive interests that turned anime into a medium for unpopular students, catering to obsessed fans. After these fans discovered [[Comiket|Comic Market]], the term was used as a self-confirming and self-mocking collective identity.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt;

The 1989 "Otaku Murderer" case gave a negative connotation to the fandom from which it has not fully recovered. The usage of "(interest) otaku", however, is used for teasing or self-deprecation, but the unqualified term remains negative.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt; The identification of otaku turned negative in late 2004 when [[Kaoru Kobayashi (murderer)|Kaoru Kobayashi]] kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist [[Akihiro Ōtani]] suspected that Kobayashi's crime was committed by a member of the [[figure moe zoku]] even before his arrest.&lt;ref name="picnic2004"/&gt; Although Kobayashi was not an otaku, the degree of social hostility against otaku increased. Otaku were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in otaku materials.&lt;ref name="Otaku harassed as sex-crime fears mount"/&gt;

Not all attention has been negative. In his book, ''Otaku'', [[Hiroki Azuma (critic)|Hiroki Azuma]] observed: "Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan", citing the fact that "[i]n 2003, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] won the [[Academy Award]] for his ''[[Spirited Away]]''; around the same time [[Takashi Murakami]] achieved recognition for otaku-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the [[9th International Architecture Exhibition|2004 International Architecture exhibition]] of the [[Venice Biennale]] ([[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Biennale Architecture]]) featured “otaku”. In 2005, the word ''moe'' - one of the keywords of the present volume - was chosen as one of the top ten  “buzzwords of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Azuma |first=Hiroki |date=April 10, 2009 |title=Otaku |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/otaku |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press | chapter= Preface |page = xi|isbn=978-0816653515 |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Tarō Asō|Taro Aso]] has also claimed to be an otaku, using this subculture to promote Japan in foreign affairs.&lt;ref name="Otaku uses manga and anime to improve Foreign Affairs"/&gt; In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of otaku. This study suggests that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many.&lt;ref name="mynavi"/&gt;

===Places===
The district of [[Akihabara]] in Tokyo, where there are [[maid café]]s featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for otaku. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles.&lt;ref name="Akihabara"/&gt; Another popular location is [[Otome Road]] in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In [[Nagoya]], students from [[Nagoya City University]] started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the otaku culture to attract more otaku to the city.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt;

===Subtypes===
There are specific terms for different types of otaku, including {{nihongo|Fujoshi|腐女子||lit. "rotten girl"}}, a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of [[yaoi]], which focuses on [[homosexual]] male relationships.&lt;ref name="Mari"/&gt; ''[[Reki-jo]]'' are female otaku who are interested in [[Japanese history]]. Some terms refer to a location, such as ''[[Akiba-kei]]'', a slang term meaning "[[Akihabara]]-style" which applies to those familiar with Akihabara's culture. Another is {{Nihongo|[[Wotagei]] or otagei|ヲタ芸 or オタ芸}}, a type of cheering that is part of Akiba-kei. Other terms, such as {{nihongo|[[Itasha]]|痛車}}, literally "painful car", describe vehicles who are decorated with fictional characters, especially [[bishōjo game]] or [[eroge]] characters.&lt;ref name="Itasha: Japan's Creepiest Car Fetish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Behold. A Fleet of Cars Owned by Nerds."/&gt;

===Media===
Otaku often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku are the subject of numerous self-critical works, such as [[Otaku no Video]], which contains a live-interview [[mockumentary]] that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes [[Gainax]]'s own staff as the interviewees.&lt;ref name="Buried Treasure - In Praise of Nerdiness"/&gt; Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as ''[[Genshiken]]'' and ''[[Comic Party]]''. A well-known novel-come-manga-come-anime is ''[[Welcome to the N.H.K.]]'', which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the [[hikikomori]] and [[NEET]]s. Works that focus on an otaku character include ''[[WataMote]]'', the story of an unattractive and unsociable [[otome game]] otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status.&lt;ref name="animenewsnetwork"/&gt; Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, ''[[Otaku Unite!]]'', focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.&lt;ref name="animenewsnetwork2004"/&gt;

==Types and classification of Japanese otaku==
[[File:Railfantokyo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Railfan]]s taking photos of trains at an annual depot open-day event in Tokyo in August 2011]]
The Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has made two major studies into otaku, the first in 2004 and a revised study with a more specific definition in 2005.&lt;ref name="nri2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nri2005"/&gt; The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of otaku interests. Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, with 350,000 individuals and ¥83 billion market scale. [[Japanese idol|Idol]] otaku were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and ¥61 billion. Travel otaku with 250,000 individuals and ¥81 billion. PC otaku with 190,000 individuals and ¥36 billion. Video game otaku with 160,000 individuals and ¥21 billion. Automobile otaku with 140,000 individuals and ¥54 billion. Animation (anime) otaku with 110,000 individuals and ¥20 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment otaku, with 70,000 individuals and ¥8 billion; Audio-visual equipment otaku, with 60,000 individuals and ¥12 billion; camera otaku, with 50,000 individuals and ¥18 billion; fashion otaku, with 40,000 individuals and ¥13 billion; and railway otaku, with 20,000 individuals and ¥4 billion.&lt;ref name="nri2005" /&gt; These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the "unique psychological characteristics" of otaku used in the 2005 study.&lt;ref name="nri2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nri2005" /&gt;

NRI's 2005 study also put forth five archetypes of otaku. The first is the family-oriented otaku, who has broad interests and is more mature than other otaku; their object of interest is secretive and they are "closet otaku". The second is the serious "leaving my own mark on the world" otaku, with interests in mechanical or business personality fields. The third type is the "media-sensitive multiple interest" otaku, whose diverse interests are shared with others. The fourth type is the "outgoing and assertive otaku", who gain recognition by promoting their hobby. The last is the "fan magazine-obsessed otaku", which is predominately female with a small group of males being the "[[Moe (slang)|moe]] type"; the secret hobby is focused on the production or interest in fan works.&lt;ref name="nri2005" /&gt; The Hamagin Research Institute found that moe-related content was worth ¥88.8 billion ($807 million) in 2005, and one analyst estimated the market could be as much as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; Japan based ''Tokyo Otaku Mode'' a place for news relating to Otaku has been liked on Facebook almost 10 million times.&lt;ref name="Tokyo Otaku Mode has 10 million Facebook fans but now what"/&gt;

Other classifications of otaku interests include vocaloid, cosplay, figures and professional wrestling as categorized by the Yano Research Institute. Yano Research reports and tracks market growth and trends in sectors heavily influenced by otaku consumerism. In 2012, it noted around 30% growth in [[dating sim]] and online gaming otaku, while [[vocaloid]], [[cosplay]], idols and [[Maid café|maid services]] grew by 10%, confirming its 2011 predictions.&lt;ref name="Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2011"/&gt;

'''Recep Tayyip Erdoğan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛər|d|ə|w|æ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/erdogan "Erdoğan"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-tr|ɾeˈdʒep tɑjˈjip ˈæɾdo(ɰ)ɑn|lang|Recep_Tayyip_Erdogan,_Turkish_pronunciation.ogg}}; born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as [[President of Turkey]] since 2014. 

Erdoğan previously served as [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] from 2003 to 2014 and as [[List of mayors of Istanbul|Mayor of Istanbul]] from 1994 to 1998. He founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002]], [[Turkish general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Turkish general election, 2011|2011]] before standing down upon his [[Turkish presidential election, 2014|election as President]] in 2014. Coming from an [[Islamism|Islamist]] political background and as a self-described [[Conservative democracy|conservative democrat]], he has promoted [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] and [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic]] policies in his administration.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/21/turkey-davutoglu-expected-to-be-docile-prime-minister-with-erdogan-calling/|title=Turkey's Davutoglu expected to be a docile Prime Minister with Erdogan calling the shots|agency=Associated Press|publisher=''Fox News''|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his administration, Turkey has experienced [[democratic backsliding]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Erdoğan played [[Association football|football]] for [[Kasımpaşa S.K.|Kasımpaşa]] before being [[Turkish local elections, 1994|elected]] in 1994 as the Mayor of [[Istanbul]] from the Islamist [[Welfare Party]]. He was stripped of his position, banned from political office, and imprisoned for four months, for reciting a poem that promoted a religious point of view of government during a speech in 1998.&lt;ref name="erdogan-imprisoned"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Tale of Two Mayors: Courts and Politics in Iran and Turkey |first=Hootan|last=Shambayati|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0020743804362057|date=May 2004|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=36|issue=2|pages=253–275|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan abandoned openly Islamist politics and established the moderate conservative AKP in 2001. 
Following the AKP's landslide victory in 2002, the party's co-founder [[Abdullah Gül]] became Prime Minister, until [[Cabinet Gül|his government]] annulled Erdoğan's ban from political office. Erdoğan became Prime Minister in March 2003 after winning a [[Siirt Province by-election, 2003|by-election]] in [[Siirt (electoral district)|Siirt]].&lt;ref name="Kumbaracibasi2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arda Can Kumbaracibasi|title=Turkish Politics and the Rise of the AKP: Dilemmas of Institutionalization and Leadership Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZLL9cg--u0C&amp;pg=PA2|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-87629-9|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan's government oversaw [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|negotiations for Turkey's membership]] in the [[European Union]], an economic recovery following a [[2001 Turkish economic crisis|financial crash in 2001]], changes to the constitution via referenda in [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2007|2007]] and [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2010|2010]], a [[Neo-Ottomanism|Neo-Ottoman]] foreign policy, and investments in infrastructure including [[List of highways in Turkey|roads]], [[List of airports in Turkey|airports]], and a [[High-speed rail in Turkey|high-speed train network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/18/us-turkey-constitution-idUSBRE91H0C220130218|title=Erdogan's ambition weighs on hopes for new Turkish constitution|author=Nick Tattersall|date=28 February 2013|publisher=Stratejik Boyut|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrogroup.de/internet/site/ts_turkey/print/234842/Len/index.html |title=Growing consumption|date=24 November 2011 |work=Metro Group|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally the [[Turkish currency and debt crisis, 2018|Turkish currency and debt crisis of 2018]].&lt;ref name=e101&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/25/erdogan-is-a-mad-economist-and-turkey-is-his-laboratory/|title=Erdogan Is Failing Economics 101|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Foreign Policy|author=Borzou Daragahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=challenge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/79317f20-67f5-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec|title=Inflation rise poses challenge to Erdogan as election looms|date=5 June 2018|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/13/turkeys-economy-looks-like-its-headed-big-crash/|title=Turkey's economy looks like it's headed for a big crash|date=13 July 2018|publisher=Washington Post|author=Matt O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the [[Gülen movement|Cemaat Movement]] led by preacher [[Fethullah Gülen]], Erdoğan was able to [[Civil–military relations during the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government|curb the power]] of the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] through the ''[[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Sledgehammer]]'' and ''[[Ergenekon trials|Ergenekon]]'' court cases. In late 2012, his government began [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] with the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) to end the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|ongoing PKK insurgency]] that began in 1978. The ceasefire broke down in 2015, leading to a [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|renewed escalation in conflict]]. In 2016, a [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|coup d'état was unsuccessfully attempted]] against Erdoğan and Turkish state institutions. This was followed by [[2016 Turkish purges|purges]] and an ongoing state of emergency.

Political scientists no longer consider Turkey as a fully fledged democracy, citing the lack of free and fair elections, purges and jailing of opponents, curtailed press freedom, and Erdoğan's efforts to broadening his executive powers and minimize his executive accountability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/08/is-there-still-hope-for-turkish-democracy/|title=Is there still hope for Turkish democracy?|last=Yildirim|first=A.

==Early political career==
While studying business administration{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and playing semi-professional football, Erdoğan engaged in politics by joining the National Turkish Student Union, an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] action group. In 1974, he wrote, directed and played the lead role in the play ''Maskomya'', which presented [[Freemasonry]], [[Communism]] and [[Judaism]] as evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism in the Turkish Media (Part III): Targeting Turkey's Jewish Citizens|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1388.htm|publisher=''[[Middle East Media Research Institute]]''|accessdate=5 September 2011|date=6 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, he became the head of the [[Beyoğlu]] youth branch of the Islamist [[National Salvation Party]] (MSP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=the-making-of-tayyip-erdogan-2010-10-31|title=The making of Turkey's prime minister|work=Hürriyet Daily News|author=Mustafa Akyoldate=31 October 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later promoted to chair of the Istanbul youth branch of the party.

After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'etat|1980 military coup]], Erdoğan followed most of [[Necmettin Erbakan]]'s followers into the [[Islamic revival|Islamist]] [[Welfare Party]]. He became the party's Beyoğlu district chair in 1984, and in 1985 he became the chair of the Istanbul city branch. He was elected to parliament in 1991, but barred from taking his seat.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Mayor of Istanbul (1994–98)===
In the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|local elections of 27 March 1994]], Erdoğan was elected [[Mayor of Istanbul]], with a plurality (25.19%) of the popular vote. He was pragmatic in office, tackling many chronic problems in Istanbul including [[water shortage]], pollution and [[traffic|traffic chaos]]. The water shortage problem was solved with the laying of hundreds of kilometers of new pipelines. The garbage problem was solved with the establishment of state-of-the-art recycling facilities. While Erdoğan was in office, air pollution was reduced through a plan developed to switch to natural gas. He changed the [[Transit bus|public buses]] to environmentally friendly ones. The city's traffic and transportation jams were reduced with more than fifty bridges, viaducts, and highways built. He took precautions to prevent corruption, using measures to ensure that municipal funds were used prudently. He paid back a major portion of Istanbul [[Metropolitan Municipality]]'s two billion dollar debt and invested four billion dollars in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/participants/recep-tayyip-erdo%C4%9F|title=Recep Tayyip Erdoğan participated in the World Leaders Forum event, Turkey's Role in Shaping the Future, in November 2008|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609035001/http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/participants/recep-tayyip-erdo%C4%9F|archivedate=9 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan initiated the first roundtable of mayors during the [[Habitat II|Istanbul conference]], which led to a global, organized movement of mayors. A seven-member international jury from the United Nations unanimously awarded Erdoğan the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-HABITAT]] award.&lt;ref name="unhabitat3" /&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2014}}

===Imprisonment===
In 1998, the [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Welfare Party]] was declared unconstitutional on the grounds of threatening the [[Secularism in Turkey|secularism of Turkey]] and was shut down by the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Turkish constitutional court]]. Erdoğan became a prominent speaker at demonstrations held by his party colleagues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubin|editor1-first=Barry M.|editor2-last=Heper|editor2-first=Meten|title=Political Parties in Turkey|date=3 April 2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B71dAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP5&amp;lpg=PP5&amp;dq=Barry+M.+Rubin.+Political+Parties+in+Turkey#v=onepage&amp;q=Barry%20M.%20Rubin.%20Political%20Parties%20in%20Turkey&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|last=Yesilada|first=Birol A.|chapter=The Virtue Party|page=68|isbn=978-0714682471|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997 in [[Siirt]], Erdoğan recited a poem  from a work written by [[Ziya Gökalp]], a pan-Turkish activist of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Turkey's Most Eluded Prime Minister"&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey's Powerful Prime Minister: Who Can Challenge Erdogan?|author=Walter Mayr|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,495683,00.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recitation included verses translated as "The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers...."&lt;ref name="charismatic" /&gt; which are not in the original version of the poem.

In 2001, Erdoğan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Turkish general election, 2002|The elections of 2002]] were the first elections in which Erdoğan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as [[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]], [[Devlet Bahçeli|Bahceli]], [[Mesut Yılmaz|Yılmaz]] and [[Tansu Çiller|Çiller]], resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdoğan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gül became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and [[Siirt Province by-election, 2003|scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003]]. By this time, party leader Erdoğan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdoğan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gül handed over the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/03/11/turkey.elections/|title=Turkish PM quits for Erdogan|date=11 March 2003|publisher=''CNN''|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in [[Ankara]] to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdoğan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6554851.stm|title=Secular rally targets Turkish PM|publisher=''BBC News''|date=14 April 2007|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated [[Abdullah Gül]] as the AKP candidate in the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/articles/139006/turkish-foreign-minister-to-stand-for-presidency|title=Turkish foreign minister to stand for presidency|publisher=''Al-Jazeera''|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul,&lt;ref name= Reuters29&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2910950920070429|title=One million Turks rally against government|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=30 April 2007|date=29 April 2007|last=De Bendern|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in [[Manisa]] and [[Çanakkale]],&lt;ref name="Milliyet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2007/05/04/guncel/axgun01.html|title=Saylan: Manisa mitingi önemli|work=[[Milliyet]]|language=Turkish|trans-title=Saylan: Important rally in Manisa|last=Avci|first=Ümran|accessdate=4 May 2007|date=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one million in [[İzmir]] on 13 May.&lt;ref name="swissinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Turks_protest_ahead_of_early_elections.html?siteSect=143&amp;sid=7813908&amp;cKey=1179061645000|title=Turks protest ahead of early elections|work=[[Swissinfo]]|date=13 May 2007|accessdate=13 May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222218/http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Turks_protest_ahead_of_early_elections.html?siteSect=143&amp;sid=7813908&amp;cKey=1179061645000|archivedate=30 September 2007|last=De Bendern|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdoğan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mesajı anladık |author=Turan Yılmaz |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/secim/6942407.asp |newspaper=Hürriyet |language=Turkish|trans-title=Message understood |date=23 July 2007 |place=Ankara |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdoğan's governing party.&lt;ref name="akptrial1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7482793.stm|title=Turkish ruling party put on trial|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2009|date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.&lt;ref name="akptrial2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7533414.stm|title=Turkey's ruling party escapes ban|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2009|date=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 2011 elections, Erdoğan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdoğan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/116073/turkey-39-s-ruling-ak-party-wins-elections-with-49-83-percent-vote.html|title=Turkey's Ruling AK Party Wins Elections with 49.83 Percent Vote|work=The journal of Turkish Weekly|accessdate=6 December 2014|date=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209195647/http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/116073/turkey-39-s-ruling-ak-party-wins-elections-with-49-83-percent-vote.html|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdish issue===
{{See also|Solution process}}
In 2009, Prime Minister Erdoğan's government announced a plan to help end the quarter-century-long [[Turkey–Kurdistan Workers' Party conflict]] that had cost more than 40,000 lives. The government's plan, supported by the [[European Union]], allowed the [[Kurdish language]] to be used in all broadcast media and political campaigns, and restored Kurdish names to cities and towns that had been [[Geographical name changes in Turkey|given Turkish ones]].&lt;ref name="Arsu"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/world/europe/14kurds.html|title=Turkey Plans to Ease Restrictions on Kurds and Help End Decades of Conflict|work=New York Times|date=13 November 2009|accessdate=17 November 2009|first=Sebnem|last=Arsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan said, "We took a courageous step to resolve chronic issues that constitute an obstacle along Turkey's development, progression and empowerment".&lt;ref name="Arsu"/&gt; Erdoğan passed a partial amnesty to reduce penalties faced by many members of the Kurdish guerrilla movement [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] who had surrendered to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108054.html?pageno=4|title=Attempts to Improve the Government|publisher=infoplease.com|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 November 2011, during a televised meeting of his party in Ankara, he apologised on behalf of the state for the [[Dersim massacre]], where many [[Alevi]]s and [[Zaza people|Zazas]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey apologises for 1930s killing of thousands of Kurds|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/8910369/Turkey-apologises-for-1930s-killing-of-thousands-of-Kurds.html|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=24 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenian Genocide===
Prime Minister Erdoğan expressed multiple times that Turkey would acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide|mass killings of up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Armenians during World War I]] as [[genocide]] only after a thorough investigation by a joint Turkish-Armenian commission consisting of historians, [[archaeologists]], [[political scientists]] and other experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/14395/conversation_with_recep_tayyip_erdogan_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530032729/http://www.cfr.org/publication/14395/conversation_with_recep_tayyip_erdogan_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 May 2012|title=A Conversation with Recep Tayyip Erdogan|date=27 September 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erdoganspeech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqcjaPsJHXI|title=Turkish Prime Minister talks about Armenian genocide|date=9 February 2008|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2013}} In 2005, Erdoğan and the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|main opposition]] party leader [[Deniz Baykal]] wrote a letter to [[Armenian President]] [[Robert Kocharian]], proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishembassy.com/ii/O/ErdogantoKocaryan.htm|title=Letter sent by H.E.

It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/18/armenian-genocide-apology-turkish-rebuttal|title=Turkish PM dismisses apology for alleged Armenian genocide|newspaper=''The Guardian''|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=1 July 2011|last=Tait|first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, he said, "it is not possible for those who belong to the Muslim faith to carry out genocide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sudanese President Bashir's visit to Turkey in limbo|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=a-muslim-can-never-commit-genocide-erdogan-defends-bashir-2009-11-08|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=''[[Hürriyet Daily News]]''|date=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Freedman|first=Seth|title=Erdogan's blind faith in Muslims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/11/erdogan-muslims-turkish-sudan-gaza|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monument to Humanity by Mehmet Aksoy in Kars, Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|250px|In 2011, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ordered the Monument to Humanity, a statue dedicated to fostering Armenian and Turkish relations, to be destroyed.]]
In 2011, Erdoğan ordered the tearing-down of the [[Statue of Humanity]], a Turkish-Armenian friendship monument in [[Kars]], which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdoğan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a "monument to humanity" but "humanity itself". The demolition was not unopposed; among its detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of them, the painter Bedri Baykam and his associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turkish-painter-stabbed-at-meeting-for-8216humanity-movement8217-2011-04-18|title=Turkish painter stabbed in Istanbul after 'humanity monument' meeting|date=18 April 2011|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=Hürriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2014, Erdoğan's office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. The statement described the mass killings as the two nations' shared pain and said: "Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey offers condolences to Armenia over WWI killings|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27131543|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=3 June 2014|publisher=''BBC''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Erdoğan's time as Prime Minister, the far-reaching powers of the [[Anti-terrorism legislation#Turkey|1991 Anti-Terror Law]] were reduced and the [[Democratic initiative|Democratic initiative process]] was initiated, with the goal to improve democratic standards in general and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in particular.

[[Reporters Without Borders]] observed a continuous decrease in Freedom of the Press during Erdoğan's later terms, with a rank of around 100 on the [[Press Freedom Index]] during his first term and a rank of 154 out of a total of 179 countries in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2013,1054.html |title=Press Freedom Index 2013 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |publisher=[[Reporters without Borders]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215183842/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2013%2C1054.html |archivedate=15 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] saw a slight recovery in later years and awarded Turkey a Press Freedom Score of 55/100 in 2012 after a low point of 48/100 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2012/turkey|title=Freedom of the Press 2012|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/english/freedom-of-expression/128639-freedom-house-critic-of-press-freedom-in-turkey|title=Freedom House Critic of Press Freedom in Turkey|work=Bianet|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/english/world/135713-turkey-loses-ground-again-in-world-press-freedom-index|title=Turkey Loses Ground again in World Press Freedom Index|work=Bianet|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/130376/press-freedom-39-terrible-39-in-turkey-watch-group.html|title=Press Freedom 'Terrible' in Turkey: Watch Group|work=Journal of Turkish Weekly|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Erdoğan inherited a [[Turkish economy]] that was beginning to recover from a recession as a result of reforms implemented by [[Kemal Derviş]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjpme.org/DisplayDocument.aspx?DocumentID=2163&amp;SaveMode=0|title=The Turkish Model of Government|date=March 2012|publisher=Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East|accessdate=28 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324095757/http://www.cjpme.org/DisplayDocument.aspx?DocumentID=2163&amp;SaveMode=0|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan supported Finance Minister [[Ali Babacan]] in enforcing macro-economic policies. Erdoğan tried to attract more foreign investors to Turkey and lifted many government regulations. The cash-flow into the Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita; considerably higher numbers were commonly advertised but these did not account for the inflation of the US dollar between 2002 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodrik|first=Dani|url=http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2013/06/how-well-did-the-turkish-economy-do-over-the-last-decade.html|title=How well did the Turkish economy do over the last decade|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=20 June 2013}}{{Self-published inline|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual growth in GDP per capita was 3.6%. The growth in real GDP between 2002 and 2012 was higher than the values from developed countries, but was close to average when developing countries are also taken into account. The ranking of the Turkish economy in terms of GDP moved slightly from 17 to 16 during this decade. A major consequence of the policies between 2002 and 2012 was the widening of the current account deficit from 600 million USD to 58 billion USD (2013 est.)&lt;ref&gt;Central Intelligence Agency. "The CIA World Factbook 2015", Skyhorse Publishing, p. 753.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1961, Turkey has signed 19 IMF loan accords. Erdoğan's government satisfied the budgetary and market requirements of the two during his administration and received every loan installment, the only time any Turkish government has done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.Xr1ajJU15A | title=Erdogan's IMF Aversion, Budget Raise Business Qualms | work=Bloomberg L.P.|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=1 February 2009 | last1=Holland | first1=Ben | last2=Bryant | first2=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5&amp;nbsp;billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=flirting-with-imf-comes-to-an-end-2010-03-10|title=Turkey's flirting with IMF comes to an end|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=10 March 2010|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, five-year [[credit default swap]]s for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5&amp;nbsp;billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2&amp;nbsp;billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership, inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004. Since then, Turkish inflation has continued to fluctuate around 9% and is still one of the highest inflation rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/13381334.asp|title=Enflasyon 2009'u 39 yılın 'dibinde' bitirdi|language=Turkish|trans-title=2009 inflation finished at 39-year low|work=Hürriyet|first=Nilgün|last=Karatas|date=5 January 2010|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish public debt as a percentage of annual GDP declined from 74% in 2002 to 39% in 2009. In 2012, Turkey had a lower ratio of public debt to GDP than 21 of 27 members of the European Union and a lower budget deficit to GDP ratio than 23 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Erdogan Proving Right as Debt Ratings Go Unheeded: Turkey Credit |author=Benjamin Harvey |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-27/erdogan-proving-right-as-debt-ratings-go-unheeded-turkey-credit#p2 |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Erdoğan's government pushed through the Labor Act, a comprehensive reform of Turkey's labor laws. The law greatly expanded the rights of employees, establishing a 45-hour workweek and limiting overtime work to 270 hours a year, provided legal protection against discrimination due to sex, religion, or political affiliation, prohibited discrimination between permanent and temporary workers, entitled employees terminated without "valid cause" to compensation, and mandated written contracts for employment arrangements lasting a year or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossborderemployer.com/post/2012/11/28/Turkey-Continues-Its-Reform-Of-Labor-And-Employment-Laws-Despite-Waning-Enthusiasm-For-EU-Membership.aspx|title=Turkey Continues Its Reform of Labor And Employment Laws Despite Waning Enthusiasm For EU Membership|author=Roland De Monte|date=|work=crossborderemployer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/investmentguide/investorsguide/employeesandsocialsecurity/Pages/TermsOfEmployment.aspx|title=Terms of Employment  – Invest in Turkey|author=|date=|work=invest.gov.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Erdoğan increased the budget of the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of Education]] from 7.5&amp;nbsp;billion lira in 2002 to 34&amp;nbsp;billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bir numaralı bütçe Eğitim'e|author=Haberi Yazdir|url=http://www.yenisafak.com.tr/politika/bir-numarali-butce-egitime-151265|newspaper=Yeni Şafak|language=Turkish|trans-title=The number one budget to education|date=31 August 2008|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his prime ministership the military received the highest share of the national budget.

({{lang-tr|Haydi Kızlar Okula!}}). The goal of this campaign was to close the gender-gap in primary school enrollment through the provision of a quality basic education for all girls, especially in southeast Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/turkey/pdf/ge6a.pdf|title=Haydi Kızlar Okula!

The Prime Minister kept his campaign promises by starting the [[f@tih project]] in which all state schools, from preschool to high school level, received a total of 620,000 smart boards, while tablet computers were distributed to 17 million students and approximately one million teachers and administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM Erdoğan realizes a world's first in education|url=http://www.usasabah.com/EnglishNews/2012/02/08/pm-erdogan-realizes-a-worlds-first-in-education|newspaper=Sabah|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 a draft proposal by the ministry of education was approved by Erdoğan, in which the curriculum for schools excluded the teaching of the theory of [[Darwinism|evolution of Charles Darwin]] by 2019. From then on the teaching will be postponed and start at undergraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/23/turkey-will-stop-teaching-evolution-schools-education-ministry/ |title=Turkey will stop teaching evolution in schools, education ministry says  |last=Sanchez |first=Raf |date=23 June 2017 |website=telegraph.co.uk |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice===
In March 2006, the [[Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors]] (HSYK) held a press conference to publicly protest the obstruction of the appointment of judges to the high courts for over 10 months. The HSYK said Erdoğan wanted to fill the vacant posts with his own appointees. Erdoğan was accused of creating a rift with Turkey's highest court of appeal, the ''[[Yargıtay]]'', and high administrative court, the ''[[Danıştay]]''. Erdoğan stated that the constitution gave the power to assign these posts to his elected party.&lt;ref name="erdogancourtelection"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_rift-deepens-between-govt-top-court-with-pms-heavy-criticism_344553.html|title=Rift deepens between government, top court with PM's heavy criticism|date=13 April 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=''Today's Zaman''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052922/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_rift-deepens-between-govt-top-court-with-pms-heavy-criticism_344553.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the head of Turkey's High Court asked prosecutors to consider whether Erdoğan should be charged over critical comments regarding the election of [[Abdullah Gül]] as President.&lt;ref name="erdogancourtelection"/&gt; Erdoğan said the ruling was "a disgrace to the justice system", and criticized the [[Constitutional Court]] which had invalidated a presidential vote because a boycott by other parties meant there was no [[quorum]]. Prosecutors investigated his earlier comments, including saying it had fired a "bullet at democracy". [[Tülay Tuğcu]], head of the Constitutional Court, condemned Erdoğan for "threats, insults and hostility" towards the justice system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6705241.stm|title=Turkish court condemns PM Erdoğan|publisher=''BBC News''|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish parliament agreed to reduce the [[age of candidacy]] to the parliament from 30 to 25 and abolished the death penalty in all instances, including war time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Women and demographics===
Erdoğan supported the continuation of Turkey's high population growth rate and, in 2008, commented that to ensure the [[Turkish population]] remained [[Population ageing|young]] every family would need to have at least three children.&lt;ref name="three_children"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/8401981.asp|title=Erdoğan: En az üç çocuk doğurun|language=Turkish|work=Hürriyet|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=3 December 2014|trans-title=Erdogan: Birth at least three children|last1=Çetik|first1=Arzu|last2=Gültekín|first2=Turan|first3=Yavuz|last3=Kusdemir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="three_children2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/438418.asp|title=Başbakan'dan kadınlara '3 çocuk' mesajı|publisher=''NTVMSNBC''|date=10 March 2008|accessdate=3 December 2014|language=Turkish|trans-title=Prime Minister '3 children' message to women|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706032009/http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/438418.asp|archivedate=6 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this statement on numerous occasions.&lt;ref name="three_children_again"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/535469-basbakan-yine-uc-cocuk-istedi|title=Başbakan yine üç çocuk istedi|publisher=''HaberTurk''|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=3 December 2014|trans-title=Prime Minister again asks for three children|language=Turkish|first1=Bülent|last1=Civenoğlu|first2=Uğur|last2=Uslubas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Turkey's population was estimated at 73,700,000, with a growth rate of 1.21% per annum (2009 figure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=8428|publisher=Turkish Statistical Institute|title=Address based population registration system results of 2010|date=28 January 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2012, answering the question of a reporter after a UN conference on population and development in Turkey, Erdoğan said that abortion is murder, saying, "You either kill a baby in the mother's womb or you kill it after birth. In many cases [not all], there's no difference."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/fury-turkeys-women-pm-likens-abortion-murder|title=Fury of Turkey's women as PM likens abortion to murder|publisher=Radio Netherlands worldwide|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=10 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208201609/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/fury-turkeys-women-pm-likens-abortion-murder|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan has stated that he opposes Turkey's high and growing rate of [[caesarean section]] births because he believes that they reduce the fertility of Turkish women, and he is in favor of limiting the number of such births in Turkish hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bianet.org/english/people/138684-why-do-we-need-caesarean-section-and-abortion|title=Why Do We Need Caesarean Section and Abortion?|author=Nilay Vardar|date=28 May 2012|publisher=Bianet|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Number of C-section births on rise in Turkey, causing concerns|author=İpek Üzüm|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=282315|newspaper=''Today's Zaman''|date=3 June 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604130349/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=282315|archivedate=4 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Democratic initiative#Roundtable meetings|a 2010 meeting]] with women NGO representatives, asked why he kept addressing them exclusively as mothers, Erdoğan said: "I do not believe in the equality of men and women. I believe in equal opportunities. Men and women are different and complementary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Deniz Kandiyoti]] |title=A tangled web: the politics of gender in Turkey |work=[[openDemocracy]] |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/deniz-kandiyoti/tangled-web-politics-of-gender-in-turkey |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he addressed the Istanbul ''Women and Justice Summit'' of the [[Women and Democracy Association]] ({{lang-tr|Kadın ve Demokrasi Derneği}}, or KADEM): "Our religion [Islam] has defined a position for women [in society]: motherhood. You cannot explain this to feminists because they don't accept the concept of motherhood." Calling for "equivalency" between the genders, he stated: "You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different," while reaffirming that full equality regardless of gender before the law should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Turkish president Erdogan: Women are not equal to men, should accept motherhood as societal role |newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Edogan-Women-are-not-equal-to-men-should-accept-motherhood-as-societal-role-382701 |date=24 November 2014 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
After assuming power in 2003, Erdoğan's government embarked on a sweeping reform program of the Turkish healthcare system, called the Health Transformation Program (HTP), to greatly increase the quality of healthcare and protect all citizens from financial risks. Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides health benefits to the poor, was expanded in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1410433?rss=searchAndBrowse&amp;|title=MMS: Error|volume=373|issue=14|pages=1285|author=|date=|work=nejm.org|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1410433|year=2015|last1=Atun|first1=Rifat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state-run healthcare, which, along with long queues in state-run hospitals, resulted in the rise of private medical care in Turkey, forcing state-run hospitals to compete by increasing quality.

In April 2006, Erdoğan unveiled a social security reform package demanded by the [[International Monetary Fund]] under a loan deal. The move, which Erdoğan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|work=''Today's Zaman''|date=19 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places. Erdoğan is outspokenly anti-smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2010/turkiye/02/04/erdogan.sigara.terorden.tehlikeli/562365.0/|accessdate=24 October 2011|trans-title=Erdoğan: Smoking is more dangerous than terror|publisher=CNN Türk|date=4 February 2010|language=Turkish|title=Erdoğan: "Sigara terörden tehlikeli"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 and 2010 Constitutional Referendums===
{{Main|Turkish constitutional referendum, 2007|Turkish constitutional referendum, 2010}}
After the opposition parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AKP proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by president Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The Turkish constitutional court did not find any problems in the packet and 68.95% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.&lt;ref name="official results"&gt;{{cite web | title = Official Results – 21 October 2007 Constitutional Referendum | publisher = Supreme Election Board (YSK) | accessdate = 12 September 2010 | url = http://www.ysk.gov.tr/ysk/docs/2007Referandum/Sonuc/sonucgrafik.pdf|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reforms consisted of: electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament, reducing the presidential term from seven years to five, allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term, holding general elections every four years instead of five and reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.

Reforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign. The main opposition party CHP was not interested in altering the Constitution on a big scale, making it impossible to form a [[Constitutional Commission]] (''Anayasa Uzlaşma Komisyonu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/475685.asp|title=AKP'nin Anayasa hedefi 15 madde|language=Turkish|trans-title=AKP targets article 15 of the Constitution|work=NTVMSNBC|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=17 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090218223617/http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/475685.asp|archivedate=18 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments lacked the two-thirds majority needed to instantly become law, but secured 336 votes in the 550 seat parliament – enough to put the proposals to a referendum. The reform package included a number of issues such as the right of individuals to appeal to the highest court, the creation of the [[ombudsman]]'s office, the possibility to negotiate a nationwide labour contract, gender equality, the ability of civilian courts to convict members of the military, the right of civil servants to go on strike, a privacy law, and the structure of the Constitutional Court. The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Government of Turkey, Supreme Election Board (YSK) | title = Official Results – 12 September 2010 Constitutional Referendum | date = 12 September 2010 | url = http://www.ysk.gov.tr/ysk/docs/2010Referandum/KesinSonuc/SonucGrafik.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced by the largest mass protest in a decade, Erdoğan made this controversial remark in a televised speech: "The police were there yesterday, they are there today, and they will be there tomorrow."

===2013 corruption arrests===
{{main|2013 corruption scandal in Turkey}}
In December 2013, Turkish police detained more than 50 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2013/1217/Once-staunch-ally-turns-on-Erdogan-in-Turkish-corruption-probe|title=Once-staunch ally turns on Erdoğan in Turkish corruption probe|author=Alexander Christie-Miller|date=17 December 2013|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested 16 others, including the general manager of [[Halkbank]] and the sons of three government ministers, on charges of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/world/middleeast/16-more-arrested-as-corruption-inquiry-in-turkey-widens.html|title=Turkish Premier Blames Foreign Envoys for Turmoil|author=Tim Arango|date=21 December 2013|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erdoğan blamed foreign ambassadors and pro-Erdoğan newspapers accused the United States or Israel of a plot, outside analysts attribute the arrests to a power struggle between the Prime Minister and [[Fethullah Gülen]]. Gülen, who lives in the U.S., leads a religious movement that had supported the AKP's rise to power. In late 2013, Erdoğan's government proposed shutting down Turkish private schools, many of which are funded by Gülen. Gülen's supporters are believed to have wide influence in the police and judiciary in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/16/us-turkey-erdogan-gulen-idUSBRE9BF0AB20131216|title=Enigmatic Turkish cleric poses challenge to Erdogan's might|author=Humeyra Pamuk|date=16 December 2013|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December, ''Hürriyet'' and ''Yeni Şafak'' papers published comments by Erdoğan stating that he believes he is the ultimate target of a corruption and bribery probe of his allies. The Turkish Prime Minister told journalists that anyone attempting to enmesh him in the scandal would be "left empty handed." Erdoğan reshuffled his Cabinet on 25 December, replacing 10 ministers hours after three ministers, whose sons were detained in relation to the probe, resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Turkish PM Says He Is Target of Graft Probe |url=http://intimated.com/turkish-pm-says-he-is-target-of-graft-probe/ |publisher=Intimated |accessdate=26 December 2013 |date=26 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227111258/http://intimated.com/turkish-pm-says-he-is-target-of-graft-probe/ |archivedate=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone recordings and social media===
{{see also|Censorship in Turkey}}
A file containing five audio recordings of conversations between Erdoğan and his son from a 26-hour period beginning 17 December 2013, in which he appeared to be instructing his son to conceal very large amounts of money, was posted to YouTube and widely discussed on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/02/supporters-deny-taped-conversation-erdogan-son.html|title=The Erdogan tapes|last=Çandar|first=Cengiz|publisher=al-Monitor|date=24 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322172531/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/02/supporters-deny-taped-conversation-erdogan-son.html|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f08_1393301418|title=Corruption !

An analysis by [[Joshua Marpet]] of the United States, published by ''[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]]'', concluded that the recordings were "probably real", and if not, the fabrication was done with a sophistication he had not previously seen.&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/02/26/6192244/erdogan-recordings-appear-real.html|title=Erdogan recordings appear real, analyst says, as Turkey scandal grows|author=Roy Gutman|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 26 February 2014, Turkey's Parliament, dominated by Erdoğan's [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], passed a bill that allowed the government the power to block Internet sites, subject to court review within three days, and granting it access to Internet traffic data. Another bill previously approved by a parliamentary committee would grant the [[MİT]] intelligence service access to data held by the government, as well as private institutions and courts. The following day President [[Abdullah Gül]] approved placing an investigative agency that appoints judges and prosecutors under the control of Erdoğan's justice minister.&lt;ref name = Gutman /&gt;

On 20 March, Erdoğan made a speech promising to "rip out the roots" of the Twitter service. Hours later the telecommunications regulator [[Information and Communication Technologies Authority|BTK]] blocked [[DNS]] service to the site, citing four court orders the Turkish government had made requiring them to remove content to preserve privacy that had not been heeded. Sources covering the story attributed this to the use of Twitter to share links to the Erdoğan recordings on YouTube.&lt;ref name="Turkey Blocks Twitter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister|title=Turkey blocks use of Twitter after prime minister attacks social media site|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 March 2014|author=Kevin Rawlinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan also threatened to ban Facebook.

Relations between [[Greece]] and Turkey were normalized during Erdoğan's tenure as prime minister. In 2007, Erdoğan and Greek Prime Minister [[Kostas Karamanlis]] inaugurated the Greek-Turkish natural gas pipeline giving Caspian gas its first direct Western outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/world/europe/19greece.html|title=Greece and Turkey Open Gas Pipeline|work=The New York Times|date=19 November 2007|accessdate=1 February 2009|first=Anthee|last=Carassava}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan and his party strongly supported the [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendum, 2004|EU-backed referendum]] to reunify Cyprus in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3656919.stm|title=Analysis: Turkey's Cyprus gamble|publisher=BBC News|date=25 April 2004|accessdate=1 February 2009|first=Jonny|last=Dymond}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations about Turkey's possible EU membership came to a standstill in 2009 and 2010, when Turkish ports were closed to Cypriot ships in "revenge" for the economic isolation of the internationally unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] and the failure of the EU to end the isolation, as it had promised in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogdani|first=Mirela|year=2010|title=Turkey and the Dilemma of EU Accession: When Religion Meets Politics|journal=I.B.

Erdoğan condemned the [[Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain]] and characterized the Saudi movement as "a new [[battle of Karbala|Karbala]]." He demanded withdrawal of Saudi forces from [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhadrakumar|first1=M.K.|title=Asia Times Online :: Middle East News, Iraq, Iran current affairs|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MC25Ak02.html|work=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan visited [[Egypt]] on 12 September 2011, soon after Turkey had ejected Israeli ambassadors, cutting off all diplomatic relations with Israel because Israel refused to apologize for the [[Gaza flotilla raid]] which killed eight Turkish and one Turco-American.&lt;ref name="cnn_egypt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkish prime minister arrives for visit to Egypt as role widens |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/12/turkey.diplomacy/ |publisher=CNN |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011|last1=Watson|first1=Ivan|last2=Fahmy|first2=Mohamed Fadel}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first visit to Egypt by a Prime Minister of Turkey after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref name="cnn_egypt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_egypt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey-Egypt talks stoke Israeli fears of political isolation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/turkey-egypt-israel-political-isolation|work=The Guardian |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011 |first=Harriet |last=Sherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan stated in a 2011 interview that he supported secularism for Egypt, which generated an angry reaction among Islamic movements, especially the Freedom and Justice party – the political wing of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name="democrati"&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt and Turkey, an Axis against Democracy? |url=http://democrati.net/2011/09/30/egypt-and-turkey-an-axis-against-democracy/ |publisher=democrati.net|author=T.

During Erdoğan's term of office, diplomatic relations between Turkey and Syria significantly deteriorated. In 2004, President [[Bashar al-Assad]] arrived in Turkey for the first official visit by a Syrian President in 57 years. In late 2004, Erdoğan signed a free trade agreement with Syria. Visa restrictions between the two countries were lifted in 2009, which caused an economic boom in the regions near the Syrian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2004/01/06/son/sontur16.html|title=Türkiye, Suriye ile İsrail arasında kolaylaştırıcı rol üstlenebilir|publisher=''Milliyet''|date=6 January 1990|accessdate=8 September 2010|language=Turkish|trans-title=Turkey could play a role in facilitating Syria and Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the relationship became strained following the outbreak of conflict in Syria in 2011.

===2014 presidential campaign===
{{Main|Recep Tayyip Erdoğan presidential campaign, 2014}}
On 1 July 2014, Erdoğan was named the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]]'s presidential candidate in the [[Turkish presidential election, 2014|Turkish presidential election]]. His candidacy was announced by the Deputy President of the AKP, [[Mehmet Ali Şahin]].

Erdoğan made a speech after the announcement and used the 'Erdoğan logo' for the first time. The logo was criticised because it was very similar to the logo that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] used in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Erdoğan'ın seçim logosu sosyal medyayı karıştırdı |trans-title=Erdoğan's logo stirs social media |author=Zeynep Gürcanlı |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/26720140.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan was elected as the President of Turkey in the first round of the election with 51.79% of the vote, obviating the need for a run-off by winning over 50%. The joint candidate of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]], [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] and 13 other opposition parties, former [[Organisation of Islamic Co-operation]] general secretary [[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu]] won 38.44% of the vote. The pro-Kurdish [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]] candidate [[Selahattin Demirtaş]] won 9.76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Yurt içi, yurt dışı ve gümrük sandıkları dahil cumhurbaşkanı seçim sonucu |trans-title=Presidential election results including domestic, foreign and customs ballot boxes |url=http://www.ysk.gov.tr/ysk/content/conn/YSKUCM/path/Contribution%20Folders/HaberDosya/2014CB-Kesin-416_d_Genel.pdf |publisher=[[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey]] |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral fraud===
Erdoğan's government developed the SEÇSİS secure vote counting system ostensibly in order to reduce fraud. However, it has been criticised for being prone to manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guncelmeydan.com/pano/bu-secim-sistemiyle-akp-bin-yil-daha-secilir-secsis-hileleri-t27362.html|title='Bu seçim sistemiyle, AKP bin yıl daha seçilir' (SEÇSİS Hileleri)|language=Turkish|trans-title=With this electoral system, AKP can be elected for 1000 years|date=30 August 2007|last=Kavcar|first=Neval|publisher=Guncel Meydan|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular controversy was generated by the fact that the system was developed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurtaricisizsiniz.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/bu-hileli-secim-sistemiyle-secsis-akp.html|title=Bu hileli seçim sistemiyle (seçsis) AKP, 100 yıl daha iktidarda|language=Turkish|trans-title=The fraudulent system that could give AKP 100 years in power|date=22 February 2013|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant cases of misconduct were documented in [[Yalova]], [[Ankara]], [[Antalya]] and [[Ağrı]]. The [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey|Supreme Electoral Council]] ordered a repeat of the election in Yalova and Ağrı, both of which the AKP had initially narrowly lost to the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]] and [[Democratic Regions Party|BDP]] respectively.

Despite strong surveillance by citizens during the [[Turkish presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], no serious cases of fraud were documented during the voting or counting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.todayszaman.com/news-342821-citizens-have-right-to-monitor-elections-for-fraud-free-voting-says-activist.html|title=Citizens have right to monitor elections for fraud-free voting, says activist|work=''Today's Zaman''|date=23 March 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014|first=Yonica|last=Puyraz Dogan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113144954/https://www.todayszaman.com/news-342821-citizens-have-right-to-monitor-elections-for-fraud-free-voting-says-activist.html|archivedate=13 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Erdoğan was still heavily scrutinised over what was perceived to be excessive media bias in his favour during the campaigning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140811/even-without-any-voting-fraud-turkeys-elections-arent-a-fair-fight|title=Even without any voting fraud, Turkey's elections aren't a fair fight|work=Los Angeles Daily News|last=Resneck|first=Jacob|date=11 August 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2018, in a video that was leaked to the public, President Erdogan is caught calling his party members to resort to electoral fraud, by "marking" the votes of an opposition party, HDP, in a bid to consolidate a better position for his own party at the 2018 June elections in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/leaked-video-showing-erdogan-calling-for-tight-marking-of-hdp-goes-viral-133305|title=Leaked video showing Erdoğan calling for 'tight marking' of HDP goes viral|work=Hurriyet Daily News|date=14 June 2018|accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Split section |Presidency of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|discuss=Talk:Recep Tayyip Erdoğan#Split proposed |date=April 2017}}
Erdoğan took the oath of office on 28 August 2014 and became the 12th president of Turkey. He administered the new Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]]'s oath on 29 August. When asked about his lower-than-expected 51.79% share of the vote, he allegedly responded, "there were even those who did not like the [[Muhammad|Prophet]].

===Domestic Policy===
====Presidential palace====
[[File:Ak Saray Ankara 2014 002.JPG|thumb|left|New [[Presidential Complex|Presidential Palace]] in [[Ankara]]]]

Erdoğan has also received criticism for the construction of a new palace called [[Ak Saray]] ''(pure white palace),'' which occupies approximately 50 acres of [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo|Atatürk Forest Farm]] (AOÇ) in [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogans-ak-saray-likened-to-alamut-castle-ceausescus-palace.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=73936&amp;NewsCatID=338# Erdoğan's 'Ak Saray' likened to Alamut Castle, Ceausescu's Palace](www.hurriyetdailynews.com, retrieved on 9 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/europe/erdogan-uses-conflict-to-consolidate-power.html?referrer|title=Turkis Leader, Using Conflicts, Cements Power|author=Tim Arango|work=The New York Times|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the AOÇ is protected land, several court orders were issued to halt the construction of the new palace, though building work went on nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/11/01/turkish-president-drops-350m-on-new-palace/|title=Turkish President drops $350m on new palace|author=Christopher Cameron|work=The Real Deal: New York Real Estate News|date=1 November 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition described the move as a clear disregard for the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/136319/Erdogan_dan__Kac-Ak_Saray__icin_yorum.html|title=Erdoğan'dan 'Kaç-Ak Saray' için yorum|language=Turkish|trans-title=How Erdoğan's 'illegal palace' looks|date=1 November 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=Cumhuriyet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was subject to heavy criticism and allegations were made; of corruption during the construction process, wildlife destruction and the complete obliteration of the zoo in the AOÇ in order to make way for the new compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_critical-media-block-imposed-on-ak-saray-opening-amid-graft-concerns_362922.html|title=Critical media block imposed on 'Ak Saray' amid opening graft concerns|work=''Today's Zaman''|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125103048/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_critical-media-block-imposed-on-ak-saray-opening-amid-graft-concerns_362922.html|archivedate=25 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the palace is technically illegal has led to it being branded as the 'Kaç-Ak Saray', the word ''kaçak'' in Turkish meaning 'illegal'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/video/video/136120/Kac-Ak_Saray_a_mehterli_tanitim.html|work=Cumhuriyet|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Kaç-Ak Saray'a mehterli tanıtım|language=Turkish|trans-title="Illegal" palace promotional material}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ak Saray was originally designed as a new office for the Prime Minister. However, upon assuming the presidency, Erdoğan announced that the palace would become the new Presidential Palace, while the [[Çankaya Köşkü]] will be used by the Prime Minister instead. The move was seen as a historic change since the Çankaya Köşkü had been used as the iconic office of the presidency ever since its inception. The Ak Saray has almost 1,000 rooms and cost $350&amp;nbsp;million (€270&amp;nbsp;million), leading to huge criticism at a time when mining accidents and workers' rights had been dominating the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_ak-saray-alman-basininda_2254265.html|title='Ak-Saray' Alman basınında|language=Turkish|trans-title=Ak Saray in the German press|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=Zaman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201150226/http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_ak-saray-alman-basininda_2254265.html|archivedate=1 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/turkey-erdogan-white-palace-presidential-residence.html##ixzz3GQJqZp00|title=Erdogan's $350m presidential palace|work=Al-Monitor|author=Kadri Gursel|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2014, Erdoğan was due to hold a [[Republic Day (Turkey)|Republic Day]] reception in the new palace to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the Republic of Turkey and to officially inaugurate the Presidential Palace. However, after most invited participants announced that they would boycott the event and a mining accident occurred in the district of [[Ermenek]] in [[Karaman]], the reception was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/27477903.asp|title=29 Ekim resepsiyonu iptal|language=Turkish|trans-title=29 October reception cancelled|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coup d'état attempt====

On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was attempted by the military, with aims to remove Erdoğan from government.

Erdoğan, as well as other government officials, have blamed an exiled cleric, and once an ally of Erdoğan, [[Fethullah Gülen]], for staging the coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/turkey-military-coup/who-u-s-based-cleric-fethullah-gulen-blamed-turkey-coup-n610681|title=This U.S.-Based Cleric Is Being Blamed for Coup Attempt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suleyman Soylu, Minister for Labor in Erdoğan's government, accused the US of planning a coup to oust Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/215046|title=US government behind Turkish coup attempt, Turkish minister says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the coup attempt, over 200 journalists were arrested and over 120 media outlets were closed. ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'' journalists were detained in November 2016 after a long-standing crackdown on the newspaper. Subsequently, [[Reporters Without Borders]] called Erdoğan an "enemy of press freedom" and said that he "hides his aggressive dictatorship under a veneer of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporters Without Borders labels Erdogan as 'enemy of press freedom'|url=http://www.dw.com/en/reporters-without-borders-labels-erdogan-as-enemy-of-press-freedom/a-36228949|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=13 November 2016|date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2017 Erdoğan's administration began an internal [[Internet block]] of all of the [[Wikipedia]] online encyclopedia site via Turkey's domestic Internet filtering system.  This blocking action took place after the government had first made a request for Wikipedia to remove what it referred to as "offensive content". In response, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] replied via [[Twitter|a post on Twitter]] stating, "Access to information is a fundamental human right.  Turkish people, I will always stand with you and fight for this right."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/europe/turkey-purge-wikipedia-tv-dating-shows.html?

===2017 Constitutional Referendum vote===
On Sunday, 16 April 2017, a [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|constitutional referendum]] was held, where the voters in Turkey (and Turkish citizens abroad) voted on a set of 18 proposed amendments to the Constitution of Turkey. The amendments include the replacement of the existing [[parliamentary system]] with a [[presidential system]]. The post of [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] would be abolished, and the presidency would become an [[executive president|executive post]] vested with broad executive powers. Parliament would be increased from 550 seats to 600 seats. The referendum also called for changes to the [[Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38883556 |title=Why is Turkey holding a referendum? |website=www.bbc.com |date=10 February 2017 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish currency and debt crisis, 2018|Turkish currency and debt crisis of 2018]] was caused by the Turkish economy's excessive [[current account]] deficit and foreign-currency debt, in combination with  Erdoğan's increasing [[authoritarianism]] and his unorthodox ideas about [[interest rate]] policy.&lt;ref name=e101 /&gt;&lt;ref name=challenge /&gt;&lt;ref name=crash /&gt; Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the unfolding crisis as "a classic currency-and-debt crisis, of a kind we've seen many times", adding: "At such a time, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a great deal. You need officials who understand what's happening, can devise a response and have enough credibility that markets give them the benefit of the doubt. Some emerging markets have those things, and they are riding out the turmoil fairly well. The Erdoğan regime has none of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/opinion/turkey-trump-erdogan.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region|title=Turmoil for Turkey's Trump|date=24 May 2018|author=Paul Krugman|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As President, Erdoğan has been a strong advocate of an [[executive presidency]] that would boost his own powers and has maintained an active influence over political affairs despite the symbolic nature of his office. In 2016, he was accused of forcing the resignation of Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] due to his scepticism over the proposed presidential system, resulting in his replacement by close ally [[Binali Yıldırım]]. He has also come under fire for constructing [[Ak Saray]], the world's largest palace on [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] for his own use as President and has been repeatedly accused of breaching the constitutional terms of his office by not maintaining political neutrality.

In March 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated to the Turks in Europe "Make not three, but five children. Because you are the future of Europe. That will be the best response to the injustices against you."

In December 2017, President Erdoğan issued a warning to [[Donald Trump]], after the U.S. President acknowledged [[Jerusalem]] as Israel's capitol.

===Authoritarianism===
In response to criticism, Erdoğan made a speech in May 2014 denouncing allegations of dictatorship, saying that the leader of the opposition, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who was there at the speech, would not be able to "roam the streets" freely if he was a dictator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/76193/Kilicdaroglu__Uc_gun_sussa_huzur_olur.html|title=Kılıçdaroğlu: Üç gün sussa huzur olur|language=Turkish|trans-title=Kılıçdaroğlu: Three days peace is suspect|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kılıçdaroğlu responded that political tensions would cease to exist if Erdoğan stopped making his polarising speeches for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chp.org.tr/?p=148819|title=Genel Başkan Kılıçdaroğlu, 'Diktatörlerin ortak özelliği çok korkak olmalarıdır' dedi ve 'Diktatör değilim' diyen Erdoğan'a, o zaman diktatör bozuntususun" diye seslendi|language=Turkish|trans-title=President to 'The common features of dictators is that they are too cowardly'|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observer said it was a measure of the state of Turkish democracy that Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] could openly threaten, on 20 December 2015, that, if his party did not win the election, Turkish Kurds would endure a repeat of the era of the "white Toros", the Turkish name for the Renault 12, "a car associated with the gendarmarie's fearsome intelligence agents, who carried out thousands of extrajudicial executions of Kurdish nationalists during the 1990s."&lt;ref name = "NYRB CdeB"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= de Bellaigue |first= Christopher |authorlink= Christopher de Bellaigue |year= 2015 |title= The Sultan of Turkey |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/erdogan-sultan-turkey/ |journal= [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume= 62 |number= 20 |pages= 85–87 |accessdate= 28 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, a 13-year-old was arrested after allegedly criticising Erdoğan on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilk-kursun.com/haber/218880/13-yasindaki-cocuk-erdogana-hakaretten-ifade-verdi/|title=13 yaşındaki çocuk, Erdoğan'a hakaretten ifade verdi – İlk Kurşun Gazetesi|author=|date=|work=ilk-kursun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a waiter was arrested for not serving tea to Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/650617/_Erdogan_a_cay_vermem__dedigi_icin_tutuklanan_kantin_sorumlumuz_Senol_Buran_TBMM_gundeminde.html/|title='Erdoğan'a çay vermem' dediği için tutuklanan kantin sorumlumuz Şenol Buran TBMM gündeminde |author=|date=|work=Cumhuriyet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the President of the Constitutional Court, [[Haşim Kılıç]], accused Erdoğan of damaging the credibility of the judiciary, labelling Erdoğan's attempts to increase political control over the courts as 'desperate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1a4b7676-cc7e-11e3-9b5f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3KwGSkViN|title=Turkey's top judge accuses Erdogan of damaging rule of law|work=Financial Times|date=25 April 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014|first=Daniel|last=Dombey}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the chaotic [[Turkish presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]], the military issued an [[E-memorandum]] warning the government to keep within the boundaries of secularism when choosing a candidate.

Several opposition politicians, journalists and military officers also [[Ergenekon trials|went on trial]] for allegedly being part of an ultra-nationalist organisation called [[Ergenekon (allegation)|Ergenekon]].

When Gülen withdrew support from the AKP government in late 2013, a [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|government corruption scandal]] broke out, leading to the arrest of several family members of cabinet ministers. Erdoğan accused Gülen of co-ordinating a "[[parallel state]]" within the judiciary in an attempt to topple him from power. He then removed or reassigned several judicial officials in an attempt to remove Gülen's supporters from office. Erdoğan's 'purge' was widely questioned and criticised by the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/21/brussels-turkey-prime-minister-erdogan-rewrite-law-judiciary-police|title=Brussels urges Turkish PM Erdogan to redraft law purging police and judiciary|last1=Traynor|first1=Ian|last2=Letsch|first2=Constanze|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, a new law was passed by parliament giving the government greater control over the judiciary, which sparked public protest throughout the country. International organisations perceived the law to be a danger to the [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.cnnturk.com/video/2014/01/17/programlar/dort-bir-taraf/turkiye-deki-yargi-sistemi-hsyk-yasasinin-gelecegi-ve-17-aralik-sureci-dort-bir-taraf-16-01-2014/2014-01-16T2130/index.html|title=Türkiye'deki yargı sistemi, HSYK 'nın yapısı ve 17 Aralık sürecinde paralel devlet ve yolsuzluk iddiaları masaya yatırıldı.|language=Turkish|trans-title=The judicial system in Turkey|work=CNN Türk|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several judicial officials removed from their posts said that they had been removed due to their secularist credentials. The political opposition accused Erdoğan of not only attempting to remove Gülen supporters, but supporters of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s principles as well, in order to pave the way for increased politicisation of the judiciary. Several family members of Erdoğan's ministers who had been arrested as a result of the 2013 corruption scandal were released, and a judicial order to question Erdoğan's son Bilal Erdoğan was annulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haberfedai.com/haber/12792/bilal-erdogan-artik-yakalanmayacak|title=Bilal Erdoğan artık 'yakalanmayacak'|language=Turkish|trans-title=Bilal Erdogan is no longer under arrest|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=haberfedai|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113150045/http://www.haberfedai.com/haber/12792/bilal-erdogan-artik-yakalanmayacak|archive-date=13 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy erupted when it emerged that many of the newly appointed judicial officials were actually AKP supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/37959/Hakim_ve_savcilar_AKP_li_cikti_.html|title=Hakim ve savcılar AKP'li çıktı!|language=Turkish|trans-title=Judges and prosecutors outed as AKP|work=cumhuriyet|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; İslam Çiçek, a judge who ejected the cases of five ministers' relatives accused of corruption, was accused of being an AKP supporter and an official investigation was launched into his political affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samanyoluhaber.com/gundem/Reza-Zarrabi-tahliye-eden-hakimin-Facebook-bilgileri-sasirtti/1042852/|title=Tahliye kararı veren hakim İslam Çiçek, Facebook'ta Uzun Adam hayranı çıktı!

===Accusations of antisemitism===
Erdoğan referred to the Turkish novelist and Islamist ideologue, [[Necip Fazıl Kısakürek]], as his muse.

Erdoğan has been criticised for his politicisation of the media, especially after the 2013 protests. The opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) alleged that over 1,863 journalists lost their jobs due to their anti-government views in 12 years of AKP rule.&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/1863-turkish-journalists-fired-during-akp-rule-opposition-report-says.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=73547&amp;NewsCatID=339|title=1,863 Turkish journalists fired during AKP rule, opposition report says|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=27 October 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians have also alleged that intimidation in the media is due to the government's attempt to restructure the ownership of private media corporations. Journalists from the [[Cihan News Agency]] and the Gülenist [[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman newspaper]] were repeatedly barred from attending government press conferences or asking questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yavuz-baydar/barring-coverage-assaults_b_6135640.html|title=Barring Coverage, Assaults and Fear: New Reports Signal SOS for Turkish Media|last=Baydar|first=Yavuz|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=10 November 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several opposition journalists such as [[Soner Yalçın]] were controversially arrested as part of the [[Ergenekon trials]] and [[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Sledgehammer coup investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bianet.org/english/media/143140-soner-yalcin-imprisoned-journalist-released|title=Soner Yalçın, Imprisoned Journalist, Released|work=bianet|date=27 December 2012|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veli Ağbaba, a CHP politician, has called the AKP the 'biggest media boss in Turkey.'&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com"/&gt;

In 2015, 74 US senators sent a letter to US Secretary of State, John Kerry, to state their concern over what they saw as deviations from the basic principles of democracy in Turkey and oppressions of Erdoğan over media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/print/2015/03/19/U-S-Senators-urge-Kerry-to-speak-against-Turkey-media-crackdown-.html|title=U.S. Senators urge Kerry to speak against Turkey media crackdown |work=[[Al Arabiya]]|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable cases of media censorship occurred during the 2013 anti-government protests, when the mainstream media did not broadcast any news regarding the demonstrations for three days after they began. The lack of media coverage was symbolised by [[CNN International]] covering the protests while [[CNN Türk]] broadcast a documentary about penguins at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/turkey-mainstream-media-penguins-protests|title=Why Turkey's mainstream media chose to show penguins rather than protests|work=The Guardian|first=Kerem|last=Oktem|date=10 June 2013|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RTÜK|Radio and Television Supreme Council]] (RTÜK) controversially issued a fine to pro-opposition news channels including [[Halk TV]] and [[Ulusal Kanal]] for their coverage of the protests, accusing them of broadcasting footage that could be morally, physically and mentally destabilising to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/23486445.asp|title=RTÜK'ten Halk TV ve Ulusal Kanal'a ceza|language=Turkish|trans-title=Penalties for public TV and national channel RTUK|date=12 June 2013|last=Özgenç|first=Meltem|work=Hürriyet|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan was criticised for not responding to the accusations of media intimidation, and caused international outrage after telling a female journalist ([[Amberin Zaman]] of ''[[The Economist]]'') to know her place and calling her a 'shameless militant' during his [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan presidential campaign, 2014|2014 presidential election campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/know-your-place-you-shameless-militant-turkish-prime-minister-tells-female-journalist-9656896.html|title=Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan tells female journalist: 'Know your place, you shameless militant'|date=8 August 2014|last=Dearden|first=Lizzie|work=The Independent|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Turkish presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]] was not subject to substantial electoral fraud, Erdoğan was again criticised for receiving disproportionate media attention in comparison to his rivals. The British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' commented that between 2 and 4 July, the state-owned media channel [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] gave 204 minutes of coverage to Erdoğan's campaign and less than a total of 3 minutes to both his rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/turkce/haberler/2014/07/140731_erdogan_trt_times.shtml |title=Times: TRT'den Erdoğan'a 204, rakiplerine 3 dakika |publisher=''BBC'' Turkey|date=31 July 2014|language=Turkish|trans-title=TIMES: TRT gave Erdogan 204, 3 to his opponent|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite extensive censorship, Erdoğan has become the world's most insulted president, according to [[Burak Bekdil]] writing in the ''[[Gatestone Institute]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekdil|first1=Burak|title=Erdogan: The World's Most Insulted President|journal=Gatestone Institute|date=20 April 2016|url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7883/erdogan-insulted-president|accessdate=2 May 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insults have been punished with prison sentences; for example, in May 2016, former [[Miss Turkey]] model [[Merve Büyüksaraç]] was sentenced to more than a year in prison for allegedly insulting the president.&lt;ref name="twsBBC1"&gt;{{cite web | date= 31 May 2016| publisher= BBC| url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36419723| title= Ex-Miss Turkey sentenced for insulting Erdogan| accessdate= 31 May 2016| quote=...Merve Buyuksarac, 27, was found guilty of insulting a public official for postings she made on social media.

===Mehmet Aksoy lawsuit===
In 2009, Turkish sculptor [[Mehmet Aksoy]] created the ''[[Statue of Humanity]]'' in [[Kars]] to promote reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia. When visiting the city in 2011, Erdoğan deemed the statue a "freak", and months later it was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey-Armenia friendship symbol being demolished|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13199787|accessdate=5 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aksoy sued Erdoğan for "moral indemnities", although his lawyer said that his statement was a critique rather than an insult. In March 2015, a judge ordered Erdoğan to pay Aksoy 10,000 lira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erdem|first1=Umut|title=Artist 'to party with' Erdoğan's money|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/artist-to-party-with-erdogans-money.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=79207&amp;NewsCatID=341|accessdate=5 March 2015|work=[[Hürriyet]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland of Cremona''' (1178–1259) was a Dominican theologian and an early [[scholastic philosopher]]. He was the first Dominican [[regent]] at [[Paris, France]] (1229–1230).&lt;ref name=soul&gt;''The Early Scholastics'', ''The Problem Of The Soul In The Thirteenth Century'', Richard C. Dales, E.J. Brill,
1995,  pp. 36 ''-'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the most enthusiastic of those who made use of the newly translated [[Aristotle]] in the early 13th century.

==Composition of the soul==

Roland of Cremona did not say as much about the soul as [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris]]. He believed that the soul was the body's perfection. He affirmed the matter-form composition of the soul, unlike William. The two men agreed that there was a single soul in man and that its nature was simple. The vegetative, sensitive, and rational faculties are all performed by this single entity. The soul is dependent on the body according to Roland of Cremona. Humans differ from angels in having souls which require bodies. They have a natural inclination and dependence on the body, seeking to be joined to it. When the soul leaves the body it is not longer a soul, but becomes a spirit. This is because it no longer has the relationship to the body by which it is deemed a soul.&lt;ref name=soul/&gt;

Like [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]], he denied that embryos possess pre-rational souls. Roland of Cremona attributed the growth and development of the soul to the soul of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;''A Polarization Of Views'', ''The Problem Of The Rational Soul In The Thirteenth Century'', Richard C. Dales, E.J. Brill, 1995, pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

He joined the [[Dominican order]] at [[Bologna]] in 1219. He was a lecturer at the medieval [[University of Toulouse]] from its foundation in 1229, and preached against the [[Cathars]] in the city. In 1231 he led a party of [[friar]]s and [[priest]]s to exhume from a cemetery the body of a man rumoured to have died a [[Heresy|heretic]]. This precipitate action led to protests from the consuls of [[Toulouse]], and Roland left the city soon afterwards.

'''Ronald Joel Daniels''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born 1959) is the current president of [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]], a position which he assumed on March 2, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/newpresident/news.html |title=News |publisher=Web.jhu.edu |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Daniels was the vice-president and [[Provost (education)|provost]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/article.php?id=785 |title=Ronald J.

In December 2016, Daniels was named a [[Member of the Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/order-canada-newest-appointees-2016-150-1.3916634 "Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist"]. [[CBC News]], December 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/election-new-members-2018-spring-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership at Johns Hopkins University ==
Since March 1, 2009, Ronald J. Daniels has served as the 14th president of [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]], a [[Baltimore]], Md.-based global research institution with a fully integrated academic medical center and health system.

Daniels has focused his leadership on three overarching themes – enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, increased student access, and strengthened community engagement. These themes are the backbone of the Ten by Twenty, the university’s strategic vision through 2020.

Under Daniels’ leadership, the university has launched a series of transformative, cross-disciplinary initiatives that seek to address some of society’s most vexing issues, and created major faculty research awards for multidisciplinary discovery and early-career investigators. Drawing on a $350 million gift from Johns Hopkins alumnus [[Michael Bloomberg]], the university is currently recruiting 50 new [[Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships|Bloomberg Distinguished Professors]], whose appointments to two or more divisions create bridges between diverse disciplines.

Daniels’ focus on strengthening the undergraduate experience – part of the Ten by Twenty strategic plan – has encompassed innovations in the gateway science curriculum; the development of a comprehensive online educational strategy that generates $75 million in annual revenue; and a dramatic increase in financial aid, access and selectivity – resulting in a doubling of undergraduate applications from 12,000 in 2009 to nearly 25,000 in 2015.

Daniels has been widely recognized for strengthening Johns Hopkins' ties to Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://community.jhu.edu|title = Hopkins + Baltimore Community Website|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/administration/president/hcpi/|title = JHU Office of the President Website|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a strategic leveraging of Hopkins’ resources to produce more than $325 million of off-campus private investment in neighborhood revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/03/26/st-paul-project-groundbreaking|title = The Hub|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contiguous to its health campus, Daniels leads Hopkins' involvement in the $1.8 billion, 88-acre East Baltimore Development Initiative, one of the country's largest mixed-use urban redevelopment projects, including Hopkins’ development and operation of the first new public school in East Baltimore in 20 years, the K-8 Henderson-Hopkins School.

Daniels serves as the chair of the executive committee of Johns Hopkins Medicine – the entity linking the [[Johns Hopkins Health System]] and the university’s [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. Daniels has worked closely with health system leadership through several strategic acquisitions and partnerships across health-related industry sectors. The Board of Trustees has voted to extend Daniels’ appointment for an additional five years, through June 2024.

== Prior to Johns Hopkins University ==
Previously, Daniels was provost and professor of law at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and dean and James M. Tory Professor of Law at the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law|University of Toronto]]. He has advised several Canadian governments on a host of policy issues, including chairing the Ontario Panel of the Future of Government, the Market Design Committee (defining market structure of new competitive electricity markets in Ontario), and the Ontario Government Task Force on Securities Regulation and the Reform of Accounting Standards; he also served on the Toronto Stock Exchange Committee on Corporate Governance in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/administration/president/about/cv.html|title = Ronald J.

The '''Tassajara Zen Mountain Center''' in the [[Ventana Wilderness]] area of the [[Los Padres National Forest]], southeast of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]], is the oldest [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monastery in the [[United States]]. The Center is very isolated, more than {{convert|16|mi}} from the nearest paved road, and only accessible via a narrow, steep, one-lane dirt road.  During the winter months, practitioners live alone on site. During the summer months, the Center is opened to day and overnight guests. The hot springs have been developed into Japanese-style baths. It is the first Zen [[monastery]] established outside Asia.&lt;ref name="sfzc.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Tassajara – San Francisco Zen Center|url=http://sfzc.org/tassajara/display.asp?catid=4,35&amp;pageid=2604|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The name is a corruption of ''Tasajera'', a Spanish-American word derived from an indigenous [[Esselen language|Esselen]] word, which means ‘place where meat is hung to dry.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gudde|first=Erwin G.|title=California Place Names: the Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-0-520-24217-3|edition=fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fullwood"/&gt;

The 126-acre mountain property surrounding the [[Tassajara Hot Springs]] was purchased by the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] in 1967 for the below-market price&lt;ref name=beckinterview&gt;{{cite web|title=INterview with Robert Beck|accessdate=29 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215060338/http://cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/interviews/beck.html|archivedate=February 15, 2009|date=February 19, 2002|url=http://cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/interviews/beck.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; of $300,000&lt;ref name="Fullwood"/&gt;  from Robert and Anna Beck.&lt;ref name="ChadwickBeck"/&gt; They improved the property and renamed it The Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, or Zenshinji (Zen Mind Temple),&lt;ref name="Crews"/&gt; during [[Shunryu Suzuki]]'s tenure as its first [[abbot]].&lt;ref name="ChadwickBeck"/&gt; When it was purchased in 1967, it was the first Zen monastery outside Asia.&lt;ref name="sfzc.org"/&gt;

Tassajara was threatened by the 2016 [[Soberanes Fire]], but escaped damage. The Center was closed to guests for the remainder of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfzc.org/tassajara/ Zen center News], "Because of the ongoing smoky conditions and the risk of fire, we have taken the difficult decision to close the Tassajara 2016 guest season". Accessed 9/8/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendars and schedules==
===Practice periods===
A practice period (''[[ango]]''  in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) denotes a period of intensive [[Monastery|monastic]] practice.  During the fall (September–December) and spring (January–April) practice periods, Tassajara is closed to the public.  The rigorous schedule is a defining feature.  Activity revolves around [[zazen]] ([[meditation]]), study, and work.&lt;ref name="Guidelines"/&gt;

===Guest season===
After the practice periods, Tassajara is open to the public from mid-April through early September.&lt;ref name="SummerGuidelines"/&gt;  For students, this period also allows them to earn credits toward the fall and spring practice periods.  The guest season, with less rigorous daily schedules,&lt;ref name="SummerPractice"/&gt;  is a cornerstone of Tassajara's economic well-being.&lt;ref name="Crews"/&gt;

The guest program includes a major kitchen operation. Tassajara is renowned for its [[vegetarian]] cuisine.&lt;ref name="Liddle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;  Tassajara [[Human resources|personnel]] also founded the Tassajara Bakery in [[Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California|Ashbury Heights]]&lt;ref name="Sinton"/&gt;  and [[Greens Restaurant]] at [[Fort Mason]] in the [[Marina District, San Francisco, California|Marina District]]&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;  in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].  [[Edward Espe Brown]]'s ''Tassajara Bread Book'',&lt;ref name="Hodgman"/&gt;  published by [[Shambhala Publications]] in 1970 and revised in 1986 and 1995,&lt;ref name="Breadbook"/&gt;  is often credited as a major catalyst for the popularity of artisanal baking in the United States, while his ''Tassajara Recipe Book''&lt;ref name="Recipebook"/&gt;  is the best known of several books of general vegetarian cuisine produced by authors connected with the Center.

Eagleton has published over forty books, but remains best known for ''Literary Theory: An Introduction'' (1983), which has sold over 750,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/a-theoretical-blow-for-democracy/160508.article|title=A theoretical blow for democracy|date=31 May 2001|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work elucidated the emerging [[literary theory]] of the period. He has also been a prominent critic of [[postmodernism]], publishing works such as ''The Illusions of Postmodernism'' (1996).

Formerly the [[Thomas Warton|Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature]] at the [[University of Oxford]] (1992–2001) and [[John Edward Taylor|John Edward Taylor Professor of Cultural Theory]] at the University of Manchester (2001–2008), Eagleton has held visiting appointments at universities around the world including Cornell, Duke, Iowa, Melbourne, Trinity College in Dublin, and Yale.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/english/profiles/Terry-Eagleton/|title=Terry Eagleton - English &amp; Creative Writing - Lancaster University - Lancaster University|first=Lancaster|last=University|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Eagleton was born to Francis Paul Eagleton and his wife, Rosaleen (née Riley).&lt;ref&gt;"EAGLETON, Prof. Terence Francis" at [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U14520, ''Who's Who 2012'', A &amp; C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2011; online edn November 2011; accessed 23 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a working-class [[Irish Catholic]] family in [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], with roots in [[County Galway]]. His mother's side of the family had strong [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republican]] sympathies. He served as an altar boy at a local [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] convent where he was responsible for escorting novice nuns taking their vows, a role referred to in the title of his memoir ''The Gatekeeper''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andrews|first=Kernan|date=18 December 2008|title=Terry Eagleton – taking on the capitalists and atheists in Galway|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/6353|work=Galway Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academia==
He was educated at [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle College]], a Roman Catholic grammar school in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]].&lt;ref name="Smith2013" /&gt; In 1961 he went to read English at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from where he graduated with a First.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He later described his undergraduate experience as a "waste of time".&lt;ref name="Smith2013" /&gt; In 1964, he moved to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where as a junior research fellow and doctoral student, he became the youngest fellow at the college since the 18th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; He was supervised by [[Raymond Williams]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; It was during this period that his leftist convictions began to take hold, and he edited a radical Catholic leftist periodical called ''[[Slant (journal)|Slant]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In 1969 he moved to the [[University of Oxford]] where he became a fellow and tutor of [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]] (1969–1989), [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]] (1989–1993) and [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]], becoming Thomas Warton Professor of English in 1992. At Wadham, Eagleton ran a well-known seminar on Marxist literary theory which, in the 1980s, metamorphosed into the radical pressure group [[Oxford English Limited]] and its journal ''[[News from Nowhere: Journal of the Oxford English Faculty Opposition]]'', to which he contributed several pieces. In 2001 Eagleton left Oxford to occupy the [[John Edward Taylor]] chair of [[culture theory|Cultural Theory]] at the [[University of Manchester]].

==Career==
He began his literary studies with the 19th and 20th centuries, then conformed to the stringent academic Marxism of the 1970s. He then published an attack on his mentor Williams's relation to the Marxist tradition in the pages of the ''[[New Left Review]]'', in the mode of the French critic [[Louis Althusser]]. In the 1960s, he became involved with the left-wing Catholic group ''[[Slant (journal)|Slant]]'', authoring a number of theological articles (including ''A Marxist Interpretation of [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benediction]]''), as well as a book ''Towards a New Left Theology''. A major turning point was his ''Criticism &amp; Ideology'' (1976) in which Eagleton discusses various theorists and critics from F.R. Leavis and (his tutor) Raymond Williams to Pierre Macherey. This earliest response to Theory is critical and substantive with Eagleton supplying a dense web of categories for "a materialist criticism" which situates the author as well as the text in the general mode of production, the ''literary'' mode of production and particular ideologies. In Chapter 4 he gives a thorough overview of one theme in the English context - "organicist concepts of society" or "community" - as worked by petty-bourgeois Victorian writers, from George Eliot to D.H. Lawrence, and how this determines textual form in each instance.

===''Literary Theory'' and ''After Theory''===
In ''Literary Theory: an Introduction'' (1983, revised 1996), Eagleton surveys the history of theoretical approaches to literature, from its beginnings with Matthew Arnold, through Formalism, Psychoanalysis, and Structuralism, to Post-structuralism. In the process, he demonstrates what is the thesis of the book: that theory is necessarily political. Theory is always presented as if it is unstained by point of view and is neutral, but in fact it is impossible to avoid having a political perspective. Peter Barry has said of the book that it "greatly contributed to the 'consolidation' of literary theory and helped to establish it firmly on the undergraduate curriculum".&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. Manchester University Press, 2009, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleton's approach to literary criticism is one firmly rooted in the Marxist tradition, though he has also incorporated techniques and ideas from more recent modes of thought as [[structuralism]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian analysis]] and [[deconstruction]]. As his memoir ''The Gatekeeper'' recounts, Eagleton's Marxism has never been solely an academic pursuit. He was active in the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|International Socialists]] (along with [[Christopher Hitchens]]) and then the [[Workers' Socialist League]] whilst in Oxford. He has been a regular contributor to the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/terry-eagleton LRB archive]. But only six contributions from 2014 to 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

''After Theory'' (2003) was written two decades later, after the end of the great period of High Theory—the cultural theory of Foucault, the postmodernists, Derrida, et al.  Looking back, Eagleton evaluates its achievements and failures, and proposes new directions needing to be pursued.  He considers that among the great achievements of Theory were the expansion of objects of study (to include gender, sexuality, popular culture, post-colonialism, etc.), and the wide-ranging self-reflective criticism of traditional assumptions.  But in Eagleton’s estimation there were also many serious mistakes, for instance: the assault on the normative and the insistence on the relativity of truth leaves us powerless to criticize oppression; the rejection of objectivity and (excessively) of all forms of essentialism bespeak an unrecognized idealism, or at least a blindness to our human materiality, ultimately born of an unconscious fear of death; and cultural studies has wrongly avoided consideration of ethics, which for Eagleton is inextricably tied to a proper politics.  It is virtue and politics and how they may be realized, among other things, that Eagleton offers as new avenues needing to be explored by cultural studies.  And that is the link to his previous work, ''Literary Theory,'' which proposed that all theory is ultimately political.  ''After Theory'' fleshes out this political aspect, tied to ethics, growing out of the fact that humans exist in neediness and dependency on others, their freedom bounded by the common fact of death.

===Dawkins, Hitchens and the New Atheism===
Eagleton has become a vocal critic of what has been called the [[New Atheism]]. In October 2006, he published a review of [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''. Eagleton begins by questioning Dawkins's methodology and understanding: "Imagine someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is the ''Book of British Birds'', and you have a rough idea of what it feels like to read Richard Dawkins on theology". Eagleton further writes, "Nor does [Dawkins] understand that because God is transcendent of us (which is another way of saying that he did not have to bring us about), he is free of any neurotic need for us and wants simply to be allowed to love us."&lt;ref name="Terry Eagleton"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|journal=[[London Review of Books]]|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/eagl01_.html|volume=28|issue=20|date=19 October 2006|accessdate=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes by suggesting Dawkins has not been attacking organised faith so much as a sort of rhetorical [[straw man]]: "Apart from the occasional perfunctory gesture to 'sophisticated' religious believers, Dawkins tends to see religion and fundamentalist religion as one and the same. This is not only grotesquely false; it is also a device to outflank any more reflective kind of faith by implying that it belongs to the coterie and not to the mass. The huge numbers of believers who hold something like the theology I outlined above can thus be conveniently lumped with rednecks who murder abortionists and malign homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|title=Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching|journal=London Review of Books|date=19 October 2006|volume=28|issue=20|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terry and Gifford Lectures====
In April 2008 Eagleton delivered [[Yale University]]'s [[Terry Lectures]], with the title ''Faith and Fundamentalism: Is belief in Richard Dawkins necessary for salvation?'', constituting a continuation of the critique he had begun in ''The London Review of Books''. Introducing his first lecture with an admission of ignorance of both theology and science, Eagleton goes on to affirm: "All I can claim in this respect, alas, is that I think I may know just about enough theology to be able to spot when someone like Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens{{mdash}}a couplet I shall henceforth reduce for convenience to the solitary signifier ''Ditchkins''{{mdash}}is talking out of the back of his neck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Terry Eagleton (lecturer)|date=1 April 2008|title=Christianity Fair and Foul|url=http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/eagleton.html|format=rm|medium=Podcast|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=4 August 2009|time=6:23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806031121/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/eagleton.html|archivedate=6 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|title=Faith and Fundamentalism: Is Belief in Richard Dawkins Necessary for Salvation?|work=[[Dwight H.

===Football===
Eagleton sees football as a new [[opium of the people]] distracting ordinary people from more serious, important social concerns. Eagleton is pessimistic as to whether this distraction can be ended. 
{{cquote|For the most part football these days is the opium of the people, not to speak of their crack cocaine. Its icon is the impeccably Tory, slavishly conformist Beckham. [[Manchester United F.C.|The Reds]] are no longer the Bolsheviks. Nobody serious about political change can shirk the fact that the game has to be abolished. And any political outfit that tried it on would have about as much chance of power as the chief executive of [[British Petroleum|BP]] has in taking over from [[Oprah Winfrey]]. |||Terry Eagleton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/15/football-socialism-crack-cocaine-people|title=Football: a dear friend to capitalism - Terry Eagleton|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|date=15 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism of Martin and Kingsley Amis==
{{Recentism|section|date=December 2013}}
[[File:T.Eagleton &amp; Wang Jie.jpg|thumbnail|right|Eagleton in 2012]]
In late 2007, a critique of [[Martin Amis]] included in the introduction to a 2007 edition of Eagleton's book ''Ideology'' was widely reprinted in the British press. In it, Eagleton took issue with Amis' widely quoted writings on "[[Islamism]]", directing particular attention to one specific passage from an interview with [[Ginny Dougary]] published in the ''Times'' on 9 September 2006. {{quote|What can we do to raise the price of them doing this? There's a definite urge – don't you have it? – to say, 'The Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order.' What sort of suffering? Not letting them travel. Deportation – further down the road. Curtailing of freedoms. Strip-searching people who look like they're from the Middle East or from Pakistan ... Discriminatory stuff, until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children ... It's a huge dereliction on their part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ginnydougary.co.uk/the-voice-of-experience/|title=The voice of experience|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Eagleton criticised Amis and expressed surprise as to its source, stating: "[these are] not the ramblings of a [[British National Party]] thug ... but the reflections of Martin Amis, leading luminary of the English metropolitan literary world." He drew a connection between Amis and his father (the novelist [[Kingsley Amis]]). Eagleton went on to write that Martin Amis had learned more from his father – whom Eagleton described as a reactionary "racist, anti-Semitic boor, a drink-sodden, self-hating reviler of women, gays and liberals" – than merely "how to turn a shapely phrase." Eagleton added there was  "something rather stomach-churning at the sight of those such as Amis and his political allies, champions of a civilisation that for centuries has wreaked untold carnage throughout the world, shrieking for illegal measures when they find themselves for the first time on the sticky end of the same treatment."&lt;ref name=eagle-kink/&gt;

The essay became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' in British literary circles. [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]], a commentator for ''[[The Independent]]'', wrote an article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alibhai-Brown|first=Yasmin|title=It's time for civilised and honest engagement|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-its-time-for-civilised-and-honest-engagement-394480.html|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the affair, to which Amis responded via open letter, calling Eagleton "an ideological relict ... unable to get out of bed in the morning without the dual guidance of God and Karl Marx."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/amis-launches-scathing-response-to-accusations-of-islamophobia-396670.html|title=Amis launches scathing response to accusations of Islamophobia|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amis said the views Eagleton attributed to him as his considered opinion was in fact his spoken description of a tempting urge, in relation to the need to "raise the price" of terrorist actions. Eagleton's personal comments on [[Kingsley Amis]] prompted a further response from Kingsley's widow, the novelist [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]]. Howard wrote to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', noting that for a supposed "anti-semitic homophobe", it was peculiar that the only guests at the Howard-Amis nuptials were either Jewish or gay.&lt;ref name="amisfamily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cockcroft|first=Lucy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1565696/Family-defends-racist-Sir-Kingsley-Amis.html|title=Family defends 'racist' Sir Kingsley Amis|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 October 2007|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Howard explained, "Kingsley was never a racist, nor an anti-Semitic boor. Our four great friends who witnessed our wedding were three Jews and one homosexual." In a later interview, Howard added: "I have never even heard of this man Eagleton. But he seems to be a rather lethal combination of a Roman Catholic and a Marxist ... He strikes me as like a spitting cobra: if you get within his range he'll unleash some poison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Geoffrey|title=Spicier than a novel, the literary feud raging between the Amis dynasty and the Marxist critic|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-486941/Spicier-novel-literary-feud-raging-Amis-dynasty-Marxist-critic.html|date=11 October 2007|work=[[Mail Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Howard, Howard's homosexual brother, called Prof Eagleton "a little squirt", adding that Sir Kingsley, far from being homophobic, had extended an affectionate friendship to him and helped him come to terms with his sexuality.&lt;ref name="amisfamily"/&gt;

Eagleton defended his comments about Martin and Kingsley Amis in ''[[The Guardian]]'', claiming the main bone of contention – the substance of Amis' remarks and views – had been lost amid the media furore.&lt;ref name=eagle-kink&gt;{{cite news|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/10/comment.religion|title=Rebuking obnoxious views is not just a personality kink|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 October 2007|accessdate=1 July 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reactions==
[[William Deresiewicz]] wrote of ''After Theory'', Eagleton's book, as follows:
: [I]s it that hard to explain what Eagleton's up to? The prolificness, the self-plagiarism, the snappy, highly consumable prose and, of course, the sales figures: Eagleton wishes for capitalism's demise, but as long as it's here, he plans to do as well as he can out of it. Someone who owns three homes shouldn't be preaching self-sacrifice, and someone whose careerism at Oxbridge was legendary shouldn't be telling interviewers of his longstanding regret at having turned down a job at the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deresiewicz|first=William|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/business-theory/|title=The Business of Theory|work=[[The Nation]]|date=29 January 2004|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist and critic [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], writing in the May 2004 ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' on ''[[Literary theory|Theory]]'' and ''After Theory'', concluded:
:Some of Theory's achievements are genuine and permanent additions to knowledge, or intellectual self-knowledge. Eagleton is quite right to assert that we can never go back to a state of pre-Theory innocence about the transparency of language or the ideological neutrality of interpretation ... But like all fashions it was bound to have a limited life of novelty and vitality, and we are now living through its decadence without any clear indication of what will supersede it. Theory has, in short, become boringly predictable to many people who were once enthusiastic about it, and that ''After Theory'' is most interesting when its focus is furthest from its nominal subject is perhaps evidence that Terry Eagleton is now bored by it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lodge|first=David|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/may/27/goodbye-to-all-that/|title=Goodbye to All That|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|format=fee required|date=27 May 2004|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Eagleton is married to his second wife, an American academic, Willa Murphy, with whom he has three children. The couple live in [[Northern Ireland]] where Murphy is a lecturer at the [[University of Ulster]]. Eagleton has two other sons by his first marriage, which ended in 1976 after ten years.&lt;ref name="vallely"/&gt;

==Reception==
=== Positive reviews ===
In a review for ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Michael Sargent said that "In their new book, epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett extend this idea" (of the harm caused by status differences) "with a far-reaching analysis of the social consequences of income inequality. Using statistics from reputable independent sources, they compare indices of health and social development in 23 of the world's richest nations and in the individual US states. Their striking conclusion is that the societies that do best for their citizens are those with the narrowest income differentials—such as Japan and the Nordic countries and the US state of New Hampshire.

In the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer [[David Runciman]] said that the book fudged the issue of its subtitle thesis of its UK first edition, and asked whether it is that “in more equal societies almost everyone does better, or is it simply that everyone does better on average?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Runciman |author1-link=David Runciman |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n20/david-runciman/how-messy-it-all-is |title=How messy it all is |journal=London Review of Books |volume=31 |issue=20 |pages=3-6 |date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the review he stated that, "More equality is a good thing and it’s an idea that’s worth defending." Richard Wilkinson responded to the review in a letter, claiming that "while pointing out that we do not have evidence on the fraction of one percent who are very rich, we show that people at all other levels of the social hierarchy do better in more equal societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Wilkinson |date=21 October 2009 |url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/lrb-letter |title=Letter to the London Review of Books |website=The Equality Trust |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306125605/http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/lrb-letter |archivedate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd Tonkin, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', described it as "an intellectual flagship of post-crisis compassion, this reader-friendly fusion of number-crunching and moral uplift has helped steer a debate about the route to a kinder, fairer nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=29 January 2010|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-spirit-level-by-richard-wilkinson--kate-pickett-1882275.html|first1=Boyd|last1=Tonkin|accessdate=2010-03-12 | location=London | title=The Spirit Level, By Richard Wilkinson &amp; Kate Pickett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Hutton]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' described it as "A remarkable new book ...the implications are profound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=15 March 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/15/equality-economy-will-hutton|first1=Will|last1=Hutton|author1-link=Will Hutton|accessdate=2010-03-12 | location=London | title=Look no further than inequality for the source of all our ills}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Hattersley]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' called it "a crucial contribution to the ideological argument",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=26 March 2009|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/03/spirit-level-wilkinson-pickett|title=Last among equals|first1=Roy|last1=Hattersley|author1-link=Roy Hattersley|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed it as one of their top ten books of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=10 December 2009 |title=Top 10: books of the decade|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/12/160-staff-chosen-world-book|accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
[[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] in ''[[The Financial Times]]'' said that "the evidence presented in the book is mostly a series of scatter diagrams, with a regression line drawn through them. No data is provided on the estimated equations, or on relevant statistical tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=John|last1=Kay|newspaper=The Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/77b1bd26-14db-11de-8cd1-0000779fd2ac.html|title=The Spirit Level|author1-link=John Kay (economist)|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=2010-02-10}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance tests and correlation coefficients were included in the November 2010 revised paperback edition of the book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Richard |last2=Pickett |first2=Kate |date=2010 |title=The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone |language=English |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03236-8 |pages=284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also appear on the Equality Trust website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/notes-statistical-sources-and-methods |title=Notes on Statistical Sources and Methods |author=&lt;!-- no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!-- unknown; redirected from previous URLs--&gt; |website=The [[Equality Trust]] |access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where source data is also available and there is an explanation for the omission that "the book's intended readership was not confined to those with statistical training".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/what-about-statistical-tests-relationships-between-inequality-and-social-problems |title=What about statistical tests of the relationships between inequality and social problems? |author=&lt;!-- no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!-- unknown--&gt; |website=The [[Equality Trust]] |access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Reeves in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the book "a thorough-going attempt to demonstrate scientifically the benefits of a smaller gap between rich and poor", but said there were problems with the book's approach. "Drawing a line through a series of data points signals nothing concrete about statistical significance ... since they do not provide any statistical analyses, this can't be verified." He later noted that, "''The Spirit Level'' is strongest on Wilkinson's home turf: health. The links between average health outcomes and income inequality do appear strong, and disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Richard Reeves|date=5 April 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/05/spirit-level-richard-wilkinson|title=In search of the truth about equality in Britain|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''European Sociological Review'', sociologist [[John Goldthorpe]] argued that the book relied too heavily on [[income inequality]] over other forms of inequality (including broader [[economic inequality]]), and demonstrated a one-dimensional understanding of [[social stratification]], with [[social class]] being in effect treated as merely a marker for income. He concluded that much more research was needed to support either the Wilkinson and Pickett "account of the psychosocial generation of the contextual effects of inequality on health or the rival neo-materialist account".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldthorpe |first1=John H. |author1-link=John Goldthorpe |date=2010 |url=http://esr.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/6/731.abstract |title=Analysing Social Inequality: A Critique of Two Recent Contributions from Economics and Epidemiology |journal=European Sociological Review |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=731-744 |doi= 10.1093/esr/jcp046 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' declared it to be "more a socialist tract than an objective analysis of poverty".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 9 February 2010, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/7193991/Inequality-is-not-a-social-illness-to-be-cured.html Inequality is not a social illness to be 'cured']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Hassan]] in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' maintained against Wilkinson and Pickett's claim that "more equal societies almost always do better" that it "is not possible to make the claim that everyone gains from greater equality", and suggests one of the book's "central weaknesses" is the "absence of the importance of politics.... They let neo-liberalism and free market fundamentalism off the hook".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Hassan]], [[The Scotsman]], 31 July 2010, [http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Gerry-Hassan-The-Spirit-Level.6449994.jp 'The Spirit Level lacks all balance to be correct']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Re-analyses and alleged failures to replicate ====
In 2010, Tino Sanandaji and others wrote an article for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in which they said, "when we attempted to duplicate their findings with data from the U.N. and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ([[OECD]]), we found no such correlation".&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB127862421912914915|title=Un-Level Ground|author= Nima Sanandaji , Tino Sanandaji , Arvid Malm and [[Christopher Snowdon]] |newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickett and Wilkinson addressed the ''Wall Street Journal'' article in a letter to the ''Journal''&lt;ref name="wsj-reply" /&gt; and published a response to the Taxpayers Alliance report on their own site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/response-to-tax-payers-alliance.pdf "The authors' individual response to The Spirit Illusion a critical analysis of how The Spirit Level compares countries" pdf], Accessed: 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In their response to the Wall Street Journal they said ,"...we use income inequality data from the United Nations, rather than the OECD, because the OECD data were not intended primarily for cross-national comparisons. However, even if we test our results using the OECD measures we find 28 of 29 relationships are still significant".'&lt;ref name="wsj-reply" /&gt;

[[Peter Robert Saunders]], Professor Emeritus of Sociology at [[Sussex University]], published a report for the think tank [[Policy Exchange]] questioning the statistics in ''The Spirit Level''. He claimed that only one of the correlations in the book—that between infant mortality and income inequality—stood up to scrutiny, and that the rest were either false or ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders (2010), "[http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/Beware_False_Prophets_Jul_10.pdf Beware False Prophets: Equality, the Good Society and the Spirit Level]", [[Policy Exchange]], 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson and Pickett published a response defending each of the claims in the book and accusing Saunders in turn of flawed methodology.&lt;ref name="response"/&gt; Saunders' statistical analysis was also assessed by Hugh Noble, who published an article explaining statistical inference in "The Spirit Level" and assessing the critique offered by Peter Saunders. Noble concluded that the critical analysis of The Spirit Level offered by Peter Saunders 'cannot be taken seriously because it contains so many serious technical flaws'.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2010), "[http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/docs/hughnobletslrevisited.pdf The Spirit Level Revisited - Regression Lines, Correlation, Outliers and Multivariate Analysis]", 24 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Snowdon]], an independent researcher and adjunct scholar at the [[Democracy Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;''Velvet Glove, Iron Fist'' website, [http://www.velvetgloveironfist.com/index.php?page_id=4 About the author], accessed 8 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TaxPayers' Alliance]], [http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/research/2010/07/factchecking-the-spirit-level.html Taxpayers' Alliance website accessed 20 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; published a book largely devoted to a critique of ''The Spirit Level'', entitled, ''The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact-checking the Left's New Theory of Everything''.&lt;ref&gt;Snowdon, Christopher (2010), ''The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact-checking the Left's New Theory of Everything'', [[Democracy Institute]]/Little Dice, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  One of its central claims is that the authors have cherry-picked throughout.  Snowdon suggests that Wilkinson excludes certain countries from his data without justification, such as South Korea and the Czech Republic.  The book includes homicide, but excludes suicide.  Prison population is included, but not the crime rate or crime survey data.  Government foreign aid is included, but (private) charitable giving is not. Datasets are selected or rejected to support the thesis of the authors.  Likely cultural confounding factors are not taken into account.  Regression lines are drawn which are dependent on a very small number of outlying countries, but this is not explained in the text.  Correlation is confused with causation throughout.  It also argues that Wilkinson and Pickett falsely claim the existence of a scientific consensus when much of the literature disagrees with their findings.   Snowdon's book also asserts that some of Wilkinson's previous publications have been criticized on the basis that "the strength of the association...seems quite sensitive to which countries are included".  Finally, in a reductio ad absurdum, the methods of TSL are used to show that the suicide rate is linked to the recycling rate.
Wilkinson and Pickett released a response to questions from Snowdon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/response-to-snowdon.pdf "The authors' individual response to The Spirit Level Delusion: fact-checking the left's new theory of everything" pdf], Accessed: 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and responded to similar criticisms in the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name="wsj-reply"&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor: The Spirit Level|first1=Kate|last1=Picket|first2=Richard|last2=Wilkinson|date=21 July 2010|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703724104575378630669014128}}.  A longer version of the letter was at {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306125532/http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/391|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/391|title=Letter to the Wall Street Journal|date=21 July 2010|archive-date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowdon has in turn responded to their response on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;Spirit Delusion blog, http://spiritleveldelusion.blogspot.com/2010/04/20-questions-for-richard-wilkinson-kate.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism of the book, Wilkinson and Pickett posted a note on the Equality Trust website which stated: "Almost all of the research presented and synthesised in ''The Spirit Level'' had previously been [[Peer review#Peer|peer-reviewed]], and is fully referenced therein. In order to distinguish between well founded criticism and unsubstantiated claims made for political purposes, all future debate should take place in peer-reviewed publications."&lt;ref name="response"/&gt; A Postscript chapter was also written in response to critics and is available in the US and UK second editions of ''The Spirit Level''.

In 2011 the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] commissioned an independent review of the evidence about the impact of inequality, paying particular attention to the evidence and arguments put forward in ''The Spirit Level''. It concluded that the literature shows general agreement about a correlation between income inequality and health/social problems, though suggested there is less agreement about whether income inequality causes health and social problems independently of other factors.  It argued for further research on income inequality and discussion of the policy implications.&lt;ref&gt;'Does income inequality cause health and social problems?', http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/income-inequality-health-social-problems&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3264">'''Themistoclea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|θ|ɛ|m|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|k|l|iː|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Θεμιστόκλεια}} ''Themistokleia''; also '''Aristoclea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|r|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|k|l|iː|ə}}; Ἀριστοκλεία ''Aristokleia''), '''Theoclea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|θ|iː|ə|ˈ|k|l|iː|ə}}; Θεοκλεία ''Theokleia''); fl. 6th century BCE) was a [[priest]]ess at [[Pythia|Delphi]].

==Life==
According to surviving sources Themistoclea was [[Pythagoras]]’ teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x7ngECDpxmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Mary Ellen Waithe, ''Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.–500 A.D.'', p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biography of Pythagoras in his ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes Laërtius]] (3rd century CE) cites the statement of [[Aristoxenus]] (4th century BCE) that Themistoclea taught Pythagoras his [[moral]] doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=8:chapter=1&amp;highlight=themistoclea Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'']&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aristoxenus says that Pythagoras got most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (233–305 CE) calls her Aristoclea (''Aristokleia''), although there is little doubt that he is referring to the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Ménage, (1984), ''The history of women philosophers'', page 48. University Press of America. "The person who is referred to as Themistoclea in Laertius and Theoclea in Suidas, Porphyry calls Aristoclea."&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry repeats the claim that she was the teacher of Pythagoras:&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm ''Life of Pythagoras''], 41&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;He (Pythagoras) taught much else, which he claimed to have learned from Aristoclea at Delphi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 10th-century ''[[Suda]]'' encyclopedia calls her Theoclea (''Theokleia'') and states that she was the sister of Pythagoras, but this information probably arises from a corruption and misunderstanding of the passage in Diogenes Laertius.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;db=REAL&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=pi,3124 Suda On Line, ''Pythagoras'', π3124, and footnote 25]: "This information suffers from a corruption in the text, arising from a misunderstanding of a source. Diogenes Laertius' passage actually reads, as the Suda does, Θεοκλείας ἀδελφῆς, but the whole remark is related to the legend of Pythagoras receiving his doctrine from a priestess in Delphi, whose name is Θεμιστόκλεια. Diogenes himself gives the correct information in a previous passage of the Life: cf. 8 παρὰ τῆς Θεμιστοκλείας τῆς ἐν Δελφοῖς."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''train of thought''' or '''track of thought''' refers to the interconnection in the sequence of ideas expressed during a connected [[discourse]] or [[thought]], as well as the sequence itself, especially in discussion how this sequence leads from one idea to another.

When a reader or listener "loses the train of thought" (i.e., loses the relation between consecutive sentences or phrases, or the relation between non-verbal concepts in an argument or presentation), [[reading comprehension|comprehension]] is lost of the expressed or unexpressed thought.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;Edward Parmelee Morris, "On Principles and Methods in Latin Syntax" (1901), Chapter VI: ''Parataxis''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "train of thoughts" was introduced and elaborated as early as in 1651 by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', though with a somewhat different meaning (similar to the meaning used by the British [[Association of Ideas|associationists]]):
{{Quotation|By Consequence, or train of thoughts, I understand that succession of one thought to another which is called, to distinguish it from discourse in words, mental discourse.&lt;br&gt;
When a man thinketh on anything whatsoever, his next thought after is not altogether so casual as it seems to be. Not every thought to every thought succeeds indifferently.|Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [[s:Leviathan/The First Part#Chapter III: Of the Consequence or Train of Imagination|The First Part: Of Man, Chapter III: Of the Consequence or Train of Imagination]]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14231">'''Values scales''' are psychological inventories used to determine the values that people endorse in their [[personal life | lives]].  They facilitate the understanding of both work and general [[values]] that individuals uphold.  In addition, they assess the importance of each value in people's lives and how the individual strives toward fulfillment through work and other life roles, such as parenting.&lt;ref name="SuperDonald"&gt;Super, Donald and Dorothy D. Nevill.  "Brief Description of Purpose and Nature of Test." ''Consulting Psychologists Press'.' 1989:  3-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scales have been normalized and can therefore be used cross-culturally for [[vocational]], [[marketing]], and [[counseling]] purposes, yielding unbiased results.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;Beatty, Sharon E., et al. "Alternative Measurement Approaches to Consumer Values: The List of Values and the Rokeach Value Survey." Psychology and Marketing. 1985: 181-200. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychologists]], [[political scientists]], [[economists]], and others interested in defining values, use values scales to determine what people value, and to evaluate the ultimate function or purpose of values.&lt;ref&gt;
Johnston, Charles S. "The Rokeach Value Survey: Underlying Structure and Multidimensional Scaling."  ''The Journal of Psychology''. 1995: 583-597. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

Values scales were first developed by an international group of [[psychologists]] whose goal was to create a unique [[self-report]] instrument that measured [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] values for use in the lab and in the clinic.  The psychologists called their project the [[Work Importance Study]] (WIS).  The original values scale measured the following values, listed in alphabetical order:  ability utilization, achievement, advancement, [[aesthetics]], [[altruism]], [[authority]], [[autonomy]], [[creativity]], [[cultural identity]], economic rewards, economic security, life style, personal development, [[physical activity]], physical prowess, prestige, [[risk]], [[social interaction]], [[social relations]], variety, and [[working conditions]].  Some of the listed values were intended to be inter-related, but conceptually differentiable.&lt;ref name="SuperDonald" /&gt;

Since the original Work Importance Study, several scientists have supplemented the study by creating their own scale or by deriving and improving the original format.  Theorists and psychologists often study values, values scales, and the field surrounding values, otherwise known as [[axiology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Kopelman, Richard E., et al. “The Study of Values: Construction of the fourth edition.” ''Journal of Vocational Behavior.'' 2003: 203-220. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  New studies have even been published recently, updating the work in the field.  Dr. Eda Gurel-Atay published an article in the ''Journal of Advertising Research'' in March 2010, providing a glimpse into how social values have changed between 1976 and 2007.  The paper explained how “self-respect” has been on the upswing, while “a sense of belonging” has become less important to individuals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1976"&gt;Gurel-Atay, Eda. “Changes in Social Values in the United States: 1976-2007, Self-Respect is on the Upswing as “A Sense of Belonging” Becomes Less Important.”  ''Journal of Advertising Research.'' 2010: 57-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rokeach ===

According to social psychologist [[Milton Rokeach]], [[human values]] are defined as “core conceptions of the desirable within every individual and society.  They serve as standards or criteria to guide not only action but also judgment, choice, attitude, evaluation, argument, exhortation, rationalization, and…attribution of causality.”&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. “The Nature of Human Values.” ''The Free Press.'' NY: Free Press. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1973 publication, Rokeach also stated that the consequences of human values would be manifested in all phenomena that social scientists might consider worth investigating.  In order for any type of research to be successful, regardless of the field of study, people’s underlying values needed to be understood.  To allow for this, Rokeach created the [[Rokeach Value Survey]] (RVS), which has been in use for more than 30 years.  It provides a theoretical perspective on the nature of values in a cognitive framework and consists of two sets of values – 18 instrumental and 18 terminal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Clawson, C. J., &amp; Vinson, D. E. (1978). Human Values: a Historical and Interdisciplinary Analysis. ''North America - Advances in Consumer Research'', ''5'', 396–402. Retrieved from http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=9454&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental values are beliefs or conceptions about desirable modes of behavior that are instrumental to the attainment of desirable end points, such as honesty, responsibility, and capability.  Terminal values are beliefs or conceptions about ultimate goals of existence that are worth surviving for, such as happiness, self-respect, and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Piirto, Jane. “I Live in My Own Bubble: The Values of Talented Adolescents.” ''The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education.'' 2005: 106-118. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The value survey asks subjects to rank the values in order of importance to them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The actual directions are as follows: “Rank each value in its order of importance to you.  Study the list and think of how much each value may act as a guiding principle in your life.”&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. “The Nature of Human Values.” ''The Free Press''. NY: Free Press. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Rokeach Value Survey has been criticized because people are often not able to rank each value clearly.  Some values may be equally important, while some values may be equally unimportant, and so on.  Presumably, people are more certain of their most extreme values (i.e. what they love and what they hate) and are not so certain of the ones  “in between.”  Further, [[C.J. Clawson]] and [[Donald E. Vinson]] showed that the Rokeach Value Survey omitted a number of values that a large portion of the population holds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

=== Schwartz ===
[[Image:Shalom H Schwartz.jpg|thumb|alt=Shalom_H_Schwartz|Frame|Shalom H. Schwartz]]
[[Shalom H. Schwartz]], social psychologist and author of ''[[The Structure of Human Values: Origins and Implications]]'' and ''[[Theory of Basic Human Values]]'', has done research on [[universal values]] and how they exist in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S.H. "Are There Universal Aspects in the Content and Structure of Values?" ''Journal of Social Issues.'' 1994: 19-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his work addressed broad questions about values, such as: how are individuals’ priorities affected by social experiences?  How do individuals’ priorities influence their behavior and choices?  And, how do value priorities influence [[ideologies]], attitudes, and actions in political, religious, environmental, and other domains?  Through his studies, Schwartz concluded that ten types of universal values exist: achievement, benevolence, conformity, [[hedonism]], power, security, self-direction, stimulation, tradition, and [[universalism]].  Schwartz also tested the possibility of [[spirituality]] as an eleventh universal value, but found that it did not exist in all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Shalom H. “Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries.”  ''Advances in Experimental Psychology.'' 1992: 1-65. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz's value theory and instruments are part of the biennial [[European Social Survey]].

=== Allport-Vernon-Lindzey ===

[[Gordon Allport]], a student of American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] [[Eduard Spranger]],&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W. “Becoming: Basic Considerations for a Psychology of Personality.” Yale University Press.  1955. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that an individual’s [[philosophy]] is founded upon the values or basic convictions that a person holds about what is and is not important in life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Pomeroy, Leon and Rem B. Edwards. ''The New Science of Axiological Psychology.'' New York, NY: 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Spranger’s (1928) view that understanding the individual’s value philosophy best captures the essence of a person, Allport and his colleagues, Vernon and Lindzey, created the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values.  The values scale outlined six major value types: theoretical (discovery of truth), economic (what is most useful), aesthetic (form, beauty, and harmony), social (seeking love of people), political (power), and religious (unity).  Forty years after the study’s publishing in 1960, it was the third most-cited non-projective personality measure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

By 1980, the values scale had fallen into disuse due to its archaic content, lack of religious inclusiveness, and dated language. Richard E. Kopelman, et al., recently updated the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values. The motivation behind their update was to make the value scale more relevant to today; they believed that the writing was too dated.  The updated, copyrighted version was published in ''[[Elsevier Science]]'' in 2003.  Today, permission is required for use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; (volume 62)

=== Hartman ===

[[Philosopher]] [[Robert S. Hartman]], creator of the [[Science of Value]], introduced and identified the concept of [[systematic values]], which he believed were an important addition to the previously studied intrinsic and extrinsic values.  He also made an illuminating distinction between ''what'' people value and ''how'' people value.  How people value parallels very closely with systematic values, which Hartman operationally defined as conceptual constructs or cognitive scripts that exist in people’s minds.  [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]]s, [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, standards, rules, doctrines, and [[logic systems]] are all examples of systematic values.  If someone’s [[cognitive script]] is repetitively about violent actions, for instance, then that person is more likely to act vengefully and less likely to value peace.  With that additional idea in mind, Harman combined intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic concepts to create the [[Hartman Value Profile]], also known as the [[Hartman Value Inventory]]. The profile consists of two parts. Each part contains 18 paired value-combination items, where nine of these items are positive and nine are negative.  The three different types of values, intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic, can be combined positively or negatively with one another in 18 logically possible ways.  Depending on the combination, a certain value is either enhanced or diminished. Once the rankings are completed, the outcome is then compared to the theoretical norm, generating scores for psychological interpretation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

== Applications to psychology ==

Research surrounding understanding values serves as a framework for ideas in many other situations, such as counseling. [[Psychotherapists]], [[behavioral scientists]], and social scientists often deal with intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic values of their patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, M.D. “Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck’s Values Orientation Theory.” ''Online Readings in Psychology and Culture.'' 2002. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; A primary way to learn about patients is to know what they value, as values are essential keys to personality structures.  This knowledge can pinpoint serious problems in living, aide immensely in planning therapeutic regimens, and measure therapeutic progress with applications of values scales over time, especially as [[social environments]] and [[social norms]] change.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

== Applications to business and marketing ==

Values are important in the construction of personal [[morality]] and as a basis for living life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt; Recent literature suggests that social values are reflected in a large variety of advertisements and can influence audience reactions to advertising appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Hornikx, J., &amp; O’Keefe, D. J. (2009). Adapting consumer advertising appeals to cultural values: A meta-analytic review of effects on persuasiveness and ad liking. ''Annals of the International Communication Association, 33 (1),'' 38-71&lt;/ref&gt; When a choice is tied to a value, that choice then becomes more attractive to people who share that value.  [[Means-end chain analyses]] often find that consumers select products with attributes that deliver consequences, which in turn contribute to value fulfillment.  In short, people’s values resonate in and are observable throughout their daily lives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; An example, presented in the ''[[Journal of Advertising Research]]'' by [[Eda Gurel-Atay]], is coffee.  People who endorse fun and enjoyment in life may want a cup of coffee for its rich, pleasant taste.  Meanwhile, people who value a sense of accomplishment may rather use coffee as a mild stimulant.  People who value warm, loving relationships with others may want a cup of coffee to share in a social manner.  Perspective and personal beliefs greatly influence behavior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1976"/&gt;

Clawson and Vinson (1978) further elaborated on this idea by explaining how values are one of the most powerful explanations of, and influences on, [[consumer behavior]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Values scales are helpful in understanding several aspects of [[consumption areas]] and consumer behavior, including [[leisure]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[gift giving]].  People who endorse certain values more highly than others engage in certain activities, prefer certain programs or magazines, or give gifts differently from others. Values scales and the study of values could also be of interest to companies who are looking to build or strengthen their [[customer relationship management]].

'''''Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers''''' is a 2001 book by [[BBC]] journalists [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and [[John Eidinow]] about events in the history of [[philosophy]] involving Sir [[Karl Popper]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], leading to a confrontation at the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club]] in 1946. The book was a bestseller and received positive reviews.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/books/ludwig-has-left-the-building.html?pagewanted=all |title= Ludwig Has Left the Building |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Jim |last=Holt |date=December 30, 2001 |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/04/01/020401crat_atlarge |title=A Critic at Large: The Porcupine |first=Adam |last=Gopnik |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=Condé Nast Publications |date=April 1, 2002 |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
On 25 October 1946, Popper (then at the [[London School of Economics]]), was invited to present a paper entitled "Are There Philosophical Problems?" at a meeting of the Moral Sciences Club, which was chaired by Wittgenstein. The two started arguing vehemently over whether there existed substantial problems in philosophy, or merely linguistic puzzles—the position taken by Wittgenstein. In Popper's, and the popular account, Wittgenstein used a fireplace poker to emphasize his points, gesturing with it as the argument grew more heated. When challenged by Wittgenstein to state an example of a moral rule, Popper (later) claimed to have replied "Not to threaten visiting lecturers with pokers", upon which (according to Popper) Wittgenstein threw down the poker and stormed out. ''Wittgenstein's Poker'' collects and characterizes the accounts of the argument, as well as establishing the context of the careers of Popper, Wittgenstein and [[Bertrand Russell]], also present at the meeting.

The book follows three narrative threads, each pivoting off the 1946 confrontation at Cambridge; the first is a documentary investigation into what precisely took place and the controversy over the differing accounts from observers; the second, a comparative personal history of the philosophers, contrasting their origins in Vienna and their differing ascents to philosophical prominence; and thirdly an exploration of the philosophical significance of the disagreement between the two and its relevance for the great debates in the [[20th century philosophy|early 20th century]] concerning the [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

'''''Word and Object''''' is a 1960 work by philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in which the author expands upon the line of thought of his earlier writings in ''From a Logical Point of View'' (1953), and reformulates some of his earlier arguments, such as his attack in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" on the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]].&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book |author= Quine, Willard Van Orman |editor= |title=The Time of My Life: An Autobiography |publisher=MIT Press |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1985 |page=392 |isbn= 978-0262670043 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought experiment of [[radical translation]] and the accompanying notion of [[indeterminacy of translation]] are original to ''Word and Object'', which is Quine's most famous book.&lt;ref name="Gibsonarticle" /&gt;

Quine emphasizes his [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], the doctrine that philosophy should be pursued as part of natural science.&lt;ref name="Hookway772"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hookway, C.

Central to Quine’s philosophy is his linguistic [[behaviorism]]. Quine has remarked that one may or may not choose to be a behaviorist in psychology, but one has no choice but to be a behaviorist in linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Quine'', Roger F. Gibson, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

This influence can be seen in ''Word and Object''. In chapter 2 a linguist has to translate a native's unknown language into English. What is so specifically behavioristic there is that the linguist has nothing to go on but verbal behavior from the native and the visible environment the native interacts with. The same view is displayed in chapter 3 where Quine describes how a baby learns its first words. In this chapter Quine also mentions [[B.F. Skinner]], a well known behaviorist, as one of his influences.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation and meaning==
{{Main|Radical translation}}
In the second chapter of ''Word and Object'', Quine investigates the concept of meaning. He shows to what extent his own, empirical, notion of meaning can give an account for our intuitive concept of meaning: 'what a sentence shares with its translation'.&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 29"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Quine also introduces his famous principle of ''indeterminacy of translation'', with the help of the [[thought experiment]] of [[radical translation]], i.e. translation of a hitherto unknown language (called Jungle by Quine) into English. The point of this thought experiment is to show that a [[Behaviorism|behavioristic]] account of meaning does not allow for the determination of the right manual for translating one language into another, as there is no such single right translation manual.&lt;ref name="QuineComp"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harman, G.|editor=Harman, G. |editor2=Lepore, E. |title=A Companion to W.V.O. Quine|publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2013 |pages=236–237 |isbn=9781118607992 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A linguist desiring to translate Jungle has to set up his translation manual based only on the events happening around him/her, the stimulations, combined with the verbal and non-verbal [[behaviour]] of Jungle natives.&lt;ref name="Hookway740"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hookway, C. J. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=740 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguist can thus only use empirical information, therefore, radical translation will tell us which part of our language can be accounted for by stimulus conditions. In the experiment, Quine assumes that functional Jungle equivalents of 'Yes' and 'No' are relatively easy to be found. This allows the linguist to actively query the utterances of the natives, by repeating words (s)he has heard the native utter, and to subsequently record the native's reaction of assent or dissent.

In determining the translation of the Jungle sentence 'Gavagai' (whose English equivalent would be 'Look, a rabbit'), the linguist first has to determine which [[stimulation]] prompt the native to assent, and which prompt him to dissent to the linguist uttering 'Gavagai'. For example, if the linguist sees a rabbit, and the native says ‘Gavagai’, the linguist may think that ‘Gavagai’ means ‘Rabbit’. (S)he will then try the sentence ‘Gavagai’ in different situations caused by the stimulation of a rabbit, to see whether the native assents or dissents to the utterance. The native’s reaction is elicited by the linguist’s question and the prompting stimulation together. It is the stimulation that prompts the assent or dissent, not the object in the world, because an object in the world can be replaced by a replica, but then the stimulation stays the same.
'The class of all the stimulations [..] that would prompt his assent'.&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 29"/&gt;  is the ''affirmative stimulus meaning'' of a certain sentence for a given speaker. ''Negative stimulus meaning'' is defined likewise, with assent and dissent interchanged. Quine calls these affirmative and negative stimulus meaning combined the ''stimulus meaning'' of the sentence. However, since we want to account for the fact that a speaker can change the meaning of a concept, we add the ''modulus'' to the definition of ''stimulus meaning'': the time frame in which the stimulations take place. Once the ''stimulus meaning'' has been found, the linguist can then compare it to the stimulus meanings of sentences in English. The English sentence with (near-) identical stimulus meaning to 'Gavagai' functions as a translation of 'Gavagai'.

After Quine has set out the concept of stimulus meaning, he continues by comparing it with our intuitive notion of meaning.&lt;ref name="Becker, E. 2012 p.100"&gt;Becker, E. (2012). ''The Themes of Quine's Philosophy: Meaning, Reference, and Knowledge''. Cambridge University Press, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; For this, he distinguished two kinds of sentences:
''occasion sentences'' and ''standing sentences''. ''Occasion sentences'' are the sentences that are only affirmed or dissented after an appropriate stimulation,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. 'Look, a rabbit walks by!' On the other hand, there are ''standing sentences'', which do not rely on stimulation for assent or dissent; they can be prompted by stimulation, but they don't have to be, e.g. 'Rabbits are mammals'. Thus, the stimulus meaning is less useful to approximate the intuitive meaning of standing sentences. However, the difference between occasion and standing sentences is only a gradual difference. This difference depends on the modulus because ‘an occasion sentence modulo n seconds can be a standing sentence modulo n – 1’.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;
Since stimulus meaning cannot really account for the intuitive concept of meaning for standing sentences, the question remain whether it can account for the intuitive concept of meaning for observation sentences. Quine approaches this question by investigating whether, for occasion sentences, the intuitive notion of synonymy (sameness of meaning) is equivalent to the notion of stimulus synonymy (sameness of stimulus meaning).&lt;ref name="Becker, E. 2012 p.100"/&gt; For this question, he uses the notion of ''observationality''. A special subclass of occasion sentences are the ''observations sentences''. Their stimulus meaning is least influenced by ''collateral information'', extra information that is hidden for the linguist, and does not vary over the population. Therefore, observation sentences belong to the sentences that are directly translatable by the linguist.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Robert. (2004). "Indeterminacy of Translation". In: Roger F. Gibson, Jr (ed.) ''The Cambridge Companion to Quine''. pp. 151-180. Cambridge Companions to Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is exactly this point of collateral information that poses problems for equating the intuitive notion of synonymy with the notion of stimulus synonymy. For even sentences that are supposedly highly observational, like 'Gavagai!', can be affected by collateral information. Quine uses the example of a rabbit-fly: assume that there is a fly that is unknown to the linguist, that only occurs in the presence of rabbits. Seeing such a rabbit-fly in the grass would thus make the native assent to the sentence 'Gavagai', because the native can be sure that there is a rabbit nearby. However, the rabbit-fly is not part of the stimulus meaning of 'Rabbit' for the linguist. Thus, even for the most observational occasion sentences, it is not possible to equate the intuitive notion of synonymy with  stimulus synonymy. From this, Quine concludes that we cannot make sense of our intuitive notions of meaning. As Becker&lt;ref&gt;Becker, E. (2012). ''The Themes of Quine's Philosophy: Meaning, Reference, and Knowledge''. Cambridge University Press, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; formulates it: '' 'From Quine's perspective, the conclusion to be drawn from our failure to reconstruct intuitive semantics is not that the attempt was misconceived but that our ordinary notions about meaning cannot be made intelligible. More particularly, intuitive semantics is committed to a distinction - between semantic information, information about meanings, and factual (or collateral) information, information not about meanings - which we cannot make sense of even in the case of sentences like 'Rabbit', let alone for sentences in general.' ''

===Indeterminacy of translation===
{{Main|Indeterminacy of translation}}
Having taken the first steps in translating sentences, the linguist still has no idea if the term 'gavagai' is actually synonymous to the term 'rabbit', as it is just as plausible to translate it as 'one second rabbit stage', 'undetached rabbit part', 'the spatial whole of all rabbits', or 'rabbithood'. Thus, the identical stimulus meaning of two sentences 'Gavagai' and 'Rabbit' does not mean that the terms 'gavagai' and 'rabbit' are synonymous (have the same meaning). In fact, we cannot even be sure that they are coextensive terms,&lt;ref&gt;Becker, E. (2012). ''The Themes of Quine's Philosophy: Meaning, Reference, and Knowledge''. Cambridge University Press, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; because ‘terms and reference are local to our conceptual scheme’,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be accounted for by stimulus meaning. It appears therefore impossible to determine a unique correct translation of the term 'gavagai', since the linguist can take any of the mentioned possibilities and have it correspond to the stimulus meaning through adaptation of logical connectives. This implies there is no matter of fact to which the word refers. Quine calls this the [[inscrutability of reference]].&lt;ref name="Marsoobian" /&gt;

This inscrutability leads to difficulties in translating sentences, especially with sentences that have no direct connection to stimuli. For example, the tautological Jungle sentence 'Gavagai xyz gavagai' could be translated (in accordance with stimulus meaning) as 'This rabbit is the same as this rabbit'. However, when 'gavagai' is taken as 'undetached rabbit part' and 'xyz' as 'is part of the same animal as', the English translation could also run 'This undetached rabbit part is part of the same animal as this undetached rabbit part'. The Jungle sentence and its two English translations all have the same stimulus meaning and truth conditions, even though the two translations are clearly different. Quine concludes that the linguist can set up his translation manual in different ways, that all fit the native's speech behaviour yet are mutually incompatible,&lt;ref name="QuineWO"&gt;{{cite book |author= Quine, Willard Van Orman |editor= |title=Word and Object |publisher=MIT Press |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2013 |page=24 |isbn= 9780262670012 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is called [[holophrastic indeterminacy]]. There is no one correct translation of Jungle: translation is indeterminate.&lt;ref name="Marsoobian "&gt;{{cite book |author=Marsoobian, A. T., Ryder, J. |editor=Marsoobian, A. T. |editor2=Ryder, J. |title=The Blackwell Guide to American Philosophy |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= Hoboken, NJ |year=2003 |page=251 |isbn= 978-0-631-21623-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical hypotheses===
Quine sums up the first steps of the radical translation:'' '(1) Observation sentences can be translated. There is uncertainty, but the situation is the normal inductive one. (2) Truth functions can be translated. (3) Stimulus-analytic sentences can be recognized. So can the sentences of the opposite type, the “stimulus-contradictory” sentences, which command irreversible dissent. (4) Questions of intrasubjective stimulus synonymy of native occasion sentences even of non-observational kind can be settled if raised, but the sentences cannot be translated.' '' To go beyond these boundaries of translation by stimulus meaning, the linguist uses analytical hypotheses, in which he uses the steps (1) - (4) to equate parts of the native sentences to English words or phrases. Using the analytical hypotheses the linguist can form new sentences and create a translation manual.

=={{Not a typo|Reference}}==
In Chapter 2 of ''Word and Object'', Quine shows that the total apparatus of grammatical and semantic devices in a language is not objectively translatable into foreign languages. Therefore, in Chapter 3, he proposes to investigate a language’s devices relative to each other. For this, he first describes a child’s process of acquiring reference, by showing the order in which children learn grammatical devices. In Chapter 4 he then turns away from language acquisition, to investigate the vagaries of reference in a particular language (English). In Chapter 5, Quine proposes a system for regimentation, which should help us understand how reference in language works and should clarify our conceptual scheme. He calls this system the ''canonical notation''; it is a system with which we can investigate the grammatical and semantic devices of English by paraphrase.

===Acquiring reference===
In order to learn a language, a child has to learn how the language expresses reference grammatically. Quine presents a behavioral theory in which the child acquires language through a process of [[operant conditioning|conditioning]] and ostension.&lt;ref&gt;Murphey, M. ''The Development of Quine’s Philosophy''. Springer, 2011. Web. Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; This process consists of four phases.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, pp. 98-100&lt;/ref&gt; In the first phase the child starts babbling. This behavior gets rewarded or not, dependent on the situation in which it occurs. Terms are learned by a process of reinforcement and extinction. In this phase, the child is not aware yet of objects, it just reacts to stimulations. This is a form of [[operant conditioning]]. In the second phase, the child acquires ''general terms'', and ''demonstrative singular terms'' (this, that) and ''singular description'', sentences that name (or purport to name) only one object. In this phase the child also learns terms that do not have reference, like ‘unicorn’. Furthermore, the child learns divided reference of general terms (that general term refer to more than one object), and with that it has access to a conceptual scheme that includes ‘enduring and recurring objects’.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the child has acquired the important distinction between singular and general terms. This distinction entails that a singular term 'purports to refer to one object' while a general term does not purports to refer to an object.&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 87"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; As Quine points out: 'The basis combination in which general and singular terms find their contrasting roles is that of ''predication''.'&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 87"/&gt; Predication combines general terms with singular terms, in a sentence that is true or false just as the general term (‘F’) is true or false of the object to which the singular term (‘a’) refers. Predication is thus logically represented as ‘Fa’. In the third phase, the child learns ''composite general terms'', which are formed by joining two general terms. In the fourth phase, the child learns how to talk about new objects. The child can now apply ''relative terms'' to singular or general terms. A relative term is a term that is true of two (or more) objects in relation to each other, like ‘bigger than’. The child can now make terms that refer to objects that cannot be seen, for example ‘smaller than that speck’ to refer to a neutrino.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This phase thus gives a new dimension to the child’s conceptual scheme.

===Vagaries of reference and referential transparency===
In Chapter 4 of ''Word and Object'', Quine looks at the indeterminacies of reference that are inherent to the (English) language system. A term is ''vague'' if the boundaries of its reference are not clear. For a singular term this means that the boundaries of the object it refers to are not clear, e.g. with the ‘mountain’: for two neighboring mountains it is not clear where the first mountain stops and the second one begins. General terms can be vague in this same way, but also in yet another way, namely that there are some objects of which it is not clear whether or not they should be included in the reference of the term. For example, the term ‘blue’ is vague insofar as it is not clear whether or not some objects are blue or green. A second vagary of reference is ''ambiguity''. Ambiguity differs from vagueness in that for a vague term the (boundaries of) its reference are unsettled, whereas ambiguous terms do refer to clearly to objects, however they are clearly true and clearly false of the same objects. For example, the term ‘light’ is clearly true of a dark feather, but at the same time clearly false of it. Quine also introduces the term ''referential transparency''. Quine wants to make explicit the ambiguities in language, and to show different interpretations of sentences, therefore, he has to know where the terms in a sentence refer to. A term is used in ''purely referential position'' if its only purpose is to specify its object so that the rest of the sentence can say something about it. If a term is used in purely referential position, it is subject to substitivity of identity: the term can be substituted by a coextensive term (a term true of the same objects) without changing the truth-value of the sentence. In the sentence, ‘Amsterdam rhymes with Peter Pan’ you cannot substitute ‘Amsterdam’ with ‘the capital of the Netherlands’. A construction, a way in which a singular term or a sentence is included in another singular term or sentence, has ''referential transparency'': it is either referentially transparent or referentially opaque. A construction is referentially transparent if it is the case that if an occurrence of a term is purely referential in a sentence then it is purely referential also in the containing sentence. However, Quine's goal is to make clear which positions in a sentence are referentially transparent, not to make them all transparent.

===Canonical notation===
In Chapter 5 of ''Word and Object'' Quine proposes a system of regimentation: the paraphrasing of sentences into a ‘canonical notation’, that we can use to understand how reference works in a language. Since we use language for science, the reductions that we make in the complicity of the structure of sentences will also simplify the conceptual schema of science. In the canonical notation, a sentence S is paraphrased as S’. S’ is a paraphrase of S that should clarify its reference, which means that it often resolves ambiguities, and is therefore by definition not synonymous with S. However, S’ should express the intended meaning of the speaker. Therefore, it should always be the original speaker who does the paraphrasing. The canonical notation consists of: atomic sentences (sentences that do not have sentences as a part) that have a general term in the predicate position, with one or more variables: ‘Fa’ or ‘Fab,’ etc. Non-atomic sentences are built from atomic sentences by using truth functions, quantifiers, and some other devices, like the four variable-binding operators. Quine drops tense, and instead uses the present as temporally neutral. We can express time with the use of ‘a at t’, where x is a spatiotemporal object. In his canonical notation, Quine has eliminated all singular terms other than variables. This greatly simplifies his logical theory, in the sense that there is economy in the roots of the theory: there is a very limited number of elements. In some situations, however, short paraphrases are very useful, for example in mathematic deductions. For these cases, Quine introduces ''definitions'': we can define singular terms relative to the canonical notation. In that way, we can still use singular terms, without having to include them in our theory.

==Semantic ascent and cosmic exile==
In the last paragraph of ''Word and Object'',&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, §56"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Quine asks the question why, in a book titled ''Word and Object'', we have talked more about words than about objects. He comes to the conclusion that this has to do with the distinction [[Rudolf Carnap]] makes between a material mode of speech and a formal one.&lt;ref name="Carnap, Rudolf 2015, §§63-64"&gt;Carnap, Rudolf, ''Logical Syntax of Language'' [1960]. The International Library of Philosophy: Philosophy of Mind and Language, Routledge, Reprint edition, 2010, pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; In the material mode we talk about objects themselves and usually this is unproblematic. However, when two people with completely different ideas of whether or not there are such entities as miles, are discussing miles as the objects itself this discussion will be fruitless. It is in these instances that we see what Quine calls 'Semantic Ascent',&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, pp. 249-254"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, pp. 249-254.&lt;/ref&gt; the shift from the material mode of language to the formal one. In the formal mode of language we are at a different level. Rather than talking about miles as objects we are talking about what this word 'mile' even means, what it refers to and if it even refers at all. In the formal mode, people with different conceptual schemes might be able to have a reasonable discussion because they are talking about something their conceptual schemes have in common: language. Quine differs from Carnap in applicability of semantic ascent.&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 250"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap believes that talking in a formal mode is something that can only be done to some effect in philosophy. Quine, however, believes that semantic ascent is used in science as well. He argues that Einstein's theory of relativity wasn't just accepted by the scientific community because of what it had to say about 'time, light, headlong bodies and the perturbations of Mercury'&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 251"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; in the material mode, but also because of its simplicity compared to other theories in the formal mode. The formal mode allows for a more distant approach to certain problems; however, we are not able to reach a vantage point outside of our conceptual scheme, to Quine 'there is no such cosmic exile'.&lt;ref name="Quine, Willard Van Orman 2015, p. 254"&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman, ''Word and Object'' [1960]. New edition, with a foreword by Patricia Churchland, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2015, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;
