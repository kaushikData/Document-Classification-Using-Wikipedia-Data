'''Alfred J. Eggers, Jr.''' (June 24, 1922 &amp;ndash; September 22, 2006) was [[NASA]]'s Assistant Administrator for Policy and devoted efforts to determine the influence of aviation technology in world peace and lectured widely.

Eggers specialized in hypersonic and spaceflight research including the development of new [[wind tunnel]] and ballistic range facilities.  He went to work for the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] at [[Ames Research Center|Ames Aeronautical Laboratory]] in 1944 after completing the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].&lt;ref name="v-12-program"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001586.html |title=GRIN Great Images in NASA - Alfred J.

==Biography==

In 1954, he became Division Chief of the Vehicle Environment Division, which was composed of a physics branch, an entry simulation branch, a structural dynamics branch, the 3.5 foot [[hypersonic wind tunnel]] branch and the hypervelocity ballistic range branch.  In 1958, Eggers headed up the Manned Satellite Team, which was to design a practical system for a satellite while recommending a suitable research program. This ultimately lead to Ames developing and managing the [[Pioneer program]] of planetary exploration probes. Although Eggers is most famous for his pioneering work on atmospheric reentry with a blunt body, arguably his greatest achievement was his work on supersonic interference lift.  This work lead directly to the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] supersonic bomber.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In May 1964, Eggers was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology.  He became Assistant Administrator for Policy in January 1968, and served until March 1971.&lt;ref name="v-12-program"/&gt; From 1969 to 1970, Eggers was a visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mit.edu/~cousot/MintaMartinLecture/index.html|title=P. Cousot, Minta Martin Lecture, Friday May 13, 2005|date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=March 21, 2010|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his career at NASA, Eggers took a position as Assistant Director for Research Applications at the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="v-12-program"/&gt;

His assistant, [[Clarence A. Syvertson|C. A. "Sy" Syvertson]] became Director of NASA Ames Research Center during probably its most productive years.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} A close friend of both was the legendary aerodynamicist, R. T. Jones.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

He died on 13 December 2017.

==Political interference==

Charges of corruption and mismanagement of the government in Lebanon caused Haddad excitement in 2002.{{clarify|date=December 2017}} He extended his allegation that denounced the waste of public money and accused government officials of using money for personal reasons and private greed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katolsk.no/nyheter/2002/08/12-0012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avon Hudson''' (born 1939) is a South Australian [[RAAF]] ex-serviceman, nuclear weapons testing [[whistle-blower]] and co-author of the 2005 book ''[[Beyond belief (book)|Beyond Belief]]'' which he wrote with academic and historian, Roger Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beyond Belief - The British bomb tests: Australia's veterans speak out|last = Cross|first = Roger|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 2005|isbn = 1862546606|location = Kent Town, South Australia|pages = |last2 = Hudson|first2 = Avon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson was assigned to work at the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga testing range]] during the period of minor trials which included the explosive scattering of [[plutonium]]. At risk of incarceration for exposing Commonwealth secrets, Hudson disclosed undertakings of the British nuclear weapons testing period in South Australia (1956-1963) making multiple appearances in mainstream media from the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110914877|title = Killen must explain Maralinga: Scholes|last = |first = |date = 1978-10-08|work = |access-date = 2015-02-14|newspaper = The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; through 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2776517.htm|title = British nuclear test veterans still seeking compensation|last = Haxton|first = Nance|date = 2009-12-19|work = AM|access-date = 2015-02-14|publisher = ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.60minutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8240313|title = Nuclear time bomb|last = Bartlett|first = Liam|date = 2011-04-22|work = 60 Minutes|access-date = 2015-02-14|publisher = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His disclosures delayed the return of the testing range to their traditional custodians, the [[Anangu]] people due to the inadequacy of clean-up measures, persistent contamination and associated health risks of [[ionizing radiation]]. He gave testimony to the [[Royal Commission into British nuclear tests in Australia|Royal Commission]] into British nuclear testing in Australia in 1984 and 1985 and has continued to work as a spokesperson for nuclear veterans in South Australia since that time. Avon is an [[anti-nuclear activist]] and educator committed to explaining [[Ionizing radiation#Health effects|radiological hazards]] in accessible English- knowledge he has acquired over many decades of private study. After six years with the RAAF, Hudson left the armed services and instead worked on the civil space program in Australia. Avon Hudson has also served as an elected member of the [[Wakefield Regional Council]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.plainsproducer.com.au/?p=462 |title=Central ward councillor Avon Hudson says there are …"Too many councillors" |last=Redpath |first=Lisa |date=2009-04-30 |work= |access-date=2015-02-14 |newspaper=Plains Producer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214035619/http://www.plainsproducer.com.au/?p=462 |archivedate=2015-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as a councilor, Hudson formally established the region, which includes his hometown of [[Balaklava, South Australia|Balaklava]], as a "[[nuclear free zone]]".

== ''Portrait of a Whistleblower'' exhibition 2015 ==
Avon Hudson's life is the subject of a public exhibition which opened on February 13, 2015, as part of the [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]] in Balaklava, South Australia. The exhibition ''Portrait of a Whistle-blower'' presents artifacts and images which trace his journey from childhood through his RAAF service and his subsequent life as a nuclear whistle-blower. The exhibition is curated by photo-media artist [[Jessie Boylan]], who also contributed images to the exhibition including reproductions of artifacts and portraiture of Hudson. The artifacts on display include photographs from Hudson's own collection, a piece of vitrified earth from Maralinga, a red umbrella Hudson once used to evade an undercover government agent who was following him, and two cathode-ray tube televisions displaying TV news broadcasts and documentary film footage.

The exhibition was launched as part of an expanded event called ''10 Minutes to Midnight'', presented by Alphaville and [[Nuclear Futures]]. The event combined history, art and discussion and was supported by the [[Australia Council for the Arts]] and [[Arts SA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nuclearfutures.org/blog/tenminutestomidnight/|title = 10 Minutes to Midnight|date = |accessdate = 2015-02-14|website = Nuclear Futures|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured three stages, including a projected video installation which created an impression of the nuclear test program and its effects and an open discussion with Boylan and Hudson. The event attracted a public audience which included nuclear veterans and their relatives who were able to share their experiences and ask questions. Additional contributing artists included Teresa Crea, [[Linda Dement]], [[John Romeril]], Nic Mollison and Luke Harrald.

"Baran fit the classic profile of an easy target. He was small, gay, effeminate, and a convicted pedophile — and he swore his innocence. His survival depended on negating these attributes as best he could. Ironically, the easiest one to change would have been his stance of innocence, the one he clung to the hardest."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt, Katha. 2000-02-03. "[http://www.thenation.com/article/justice-bernard-baran Justice for Bernard Baran]" [[The Nation]]."Baran has maintained his innocence through his imprisonment, making him ineligible for parole."&lt;/ref&gt; Baran was accused, tried and convicted within a three-month period and sentenced to three life sentences in January 1985. In 2009, the Massachusetts Appeals Court vacated the convictions, deeming the case "notorious,"&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Massachusetts Appeals Court Docket 07-P-1096. 2009-05-15. Introduction. "Trial by jury in this notorious case followed within three months; Baran was convicted on January 30, 1985, of three counts of rape of a child and five counts of indecent assault and battery.(1) He was sentenced to concurrent life sentences for each of the rape convictions and to concurrent eight- to ten-year sentences on each of the indecent assault and battery convictions, the latter to be served concurrently with the life sentences."&lt;/ref&gt; and citing the behavior of the original prosecutor as "troubling."&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Massachusetts Appeals Court Docket 07-P-1096. 2009-05-15. Page 17 C.Other Issues. 2. Prosecutorial misconduct. The motion judge did not address the defendant's contention that prosecutorial misconduct independently warranted a new trial, see Commonwealth v. Smith, 387 Mass. at 912, and made few findings relevant to the issue. In his motion, the defendant had called attention to prosecutorial vouching for government witnesses, improper closing argument, the failure to disclose significant exculpatory evidence in the government's possession, and intentionally presenting false and misleading evidence to the grand jury. Notwithstanding the absence of findings, the record provides support for certain of these contentions, as we have already noted in our discussion of vouching and improper argument. The record is less clear on the remaining points, though nonetheless troubling in certain respects.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its importance as the first successful conviction, the Baran case is notable amongst the day-care cases for the level of [[homophobia]] present in the court record of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, page 32. "The defendant claims that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel in many ways, such as by his failure to properly investigate the alleged offenses, his failure to seek meaningful discovery from the Commonwealth and any assistance from experts in child psychology, failed to properly prepare for trial, failed to develop evidence that would support the defense that the evidence was unreliable and was the creature of an unfair climate of hysteria, homophobia and suggestion."&lt;/ref&gt; The Baran case is the subject of the 2010 documentary film ''[[Freeing Bernie Baran]]''.

==Background==
Bernard Baran took a job as a teacher's aide in 1983 at the Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) in his hometown of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], the county seat of [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire County]] in [[Western Massachusetts]]. Shortly before his employment, social workers placed a four-year-old boy at ECDC due to the child's home environment. Eventually the child ended up in the classroom where Baran worked. In September 1984 the [[Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial|Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool case]] broke and made news across Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the parents of the boy complained to the board of directors of ECDC that they "didn't want no homo" working with their child.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years.]"  2009-08-09. Associated Press / MSNBC. "His case had followed a tortured path — the first complaint came from a drug-addicted couple, acting as narcotics informants, who told their police connection they "didn't want no homo" watching their son."&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors held a meeting on September 12, 1984, to specifically discuss Baran's [[homosexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/10/10/why-is-daniel-ford-still-a-massachusetts-judge/|title=Why is Daniel Ford still a Massachusetts judge?|date=October 10, 2014|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possibility of terminating his employment because of it. Baran retained his job after being questioned about his homosexuality by his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Background, page 6." In 1984, Baran worked at the Early Childhood Development Center ("ECDC") as a teacher's assistant. The allegations in this case emanate from his contact with pre-school children who were enrolled in this facility. The first family to bring accusations against Mr. Baran was that of Boy A. (A-94-95.) Previously, the boy's father had filed a complaint with ECDC objecting to Mr. Baran being allowed to work with children because he was a homosexual. (A-94.) On September 12, 1984, the ECDC Board of Directors discussed Mr. Baran's sexual orientation and his possible termination."&lt;/ref&gt;

==First allegation==
On October 1, 1984, the parents of the boy in question removed him from ECDC in protest of Baran's continued employment. The parents were drug addicts and police informants. On October 5, 1984, they called their connection at the Pittsfield police department drug control unit.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years.]" 2009-08-09. Associated Press / MSNBC. "His case had followed a tortured path — the first complaint came from a drug-addicted couple, acting as narcotics informants, who told their police connection they "didn't want no homo" watching their son."&lt;/ref&gt; They alleged that Bernard Baran molested their son at ECDC that day, three days after they had removed the child from the day care. The following day the police began an investigation at ECDC and validated this claim of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Background, page 6. "On October 5, 1984, this family contacted the police to report that Mr. Baran had molested their child. (A-94-95.) The next day, this child was brought to the Berkshire Medical Center for an examination."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hysteria==
Word of the first allegation broke shortly after the investigation began. Within days the day care center had sponsored a puppet show to facilitate other children's ability to talk about abuse. The day care also notified all the parents that a child at the day care had gonorrhea. After multiple children were interviewed with anatomically correct dolls at both of ECDC's locations, one where Baran worked and one where he did not, Baran was indicted on 3 counts of rape and 5 counts of indecent assault on November 5, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Background, page 7-8."That night, the mother of Girl B got a telephone call informing her about the pending investigation against Mr. Baran. (Tr. 4/131-32, 4/144-45.) She was on the ECDC board when the complaints were made about Mr. Baran's homosexuality. (Tr. 4/132.) Additionally, this woman had previously been abused herself. (A-474.) She contacted a friend who was a captain on the police department and reported that her daughter may have been molested. (A-96-97.) This captain in turn contacted two other detectives who, with Department of Social Services ("DSS") worker Brian Cummings, eventually visited this residence that same night at 10:50 p.m. Id. Mr. Baran was arrested the next day on two counts of indecent assault and battery upon these two children. (A-99-100.) Beginning on October 9, 1984, these accusations became well publicized through local and state print media. (See generally A-164-170.) The DSS held a "good touch, bad touch" puppet show at ECDC on October 11, 2005. No verbatim account or transcript has ever been obtained and no one has ever said that such account was believed to exist; it is known that the puppet show was attended by many of the children who were the subject of DSS investigations, including some of the children that testified against Mr. Baran. Around the same time, ECDC sent several letters to parents about the accusations, arranged for various parent and child support groups, and advised parents on how to question their children about the possibility of having been abused and about the threat of gonorrhea. (A-630-647.) Following these events, there were four more children who made allegations against Mr. Baran, which became the subject of further police investigation, and who eventually testified at trial: Boys C and D, and Girls E and F."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Baran's case went from arrest to trial in 105 days, convening in court on January 23, 1985, receiving significant local media attention. The court room was closed to the public and the press during the children's testimony without any hearing into the necessity for closing the court, which Baran claimed violated his 6th Amendment right to a public trial.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Massachusetts Appeals Court Docket 07-P-1096. 2009-05-15. Other Issues, page 15. "6. Failure to protect the defendant's right to a public trial. The record reflects and the parties appear to agree that, during the testimony of the children, the courtroom was closed to the public. Nothing in the record suggests that this was done upon motion of the Commonwealth or after any hearing at which the necessity of such action, or its impact on the rights of the defendant, was considered."&lt;/ref&gt; Baran was positioned in the court room so that he could not even hear the testimony of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt, Katha. 2000-02-03. "[http://www.thenation.com/article/justice-bernard-baran Justice for Bernard Baran]" [[The Nation]]."In the courtroom Baran was placed not only where the children could not see him but where he could not even hear what was going on."&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 1985, he received three life sentences for three counts of [[rape]] of a child and five counts of [[sexual assault|indecent assault and battery]]. His conviction held up on appeal in 1986. The law firm that handled his appeal eventually destroyed his defense case file.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Page 4. "Defense counsel also sought to reconstruct, as best as he was able, the files and information that was or would have been available to the defendant's trial and appellate counsel, given the report that their files had been destroyed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion for new trial==
In 1999 a new legal team took Baran's case. In a series of hearings from 1999 to 2005, the original defense file was recreated from the contents of the civil suits filed against ECDC after the Baran conviction. The [[motion (law)|motion]] for a new trial contained over 300 flawed items in the original trial, including [[prosecutorial misconduct]], [[ineffective assistance of counsel]], and the use of suggestive interviewing techniques with the children. The motion rested in June 2005.

==Release and freedom==
Baran was granted a new trial in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Edecio. 2009-08-10 CBS News. "Video Kept From Defendant Finally Sets Him Free, 21 Years Later." "In 2006, at age 42, Baran walked out of prison after serving 21 years. A judge overturned his conviction and ordered a new trial, citing the incompetence of his trial lawyer and the videotapes, which had recently resurfaced after years of being lost among boxes of evidence."&lt;/ref&gt; The Berkshire County District Attorney's office appealed the granting of a new trial in 2008. In 2009 the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the 2006 ruling and set aside the 1984 convictions.

In 2010, Baran's lawyers began the process of suing multiple parties in civil court on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=20079&amp;sid=121 Memorandum of Decision and Order on the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss]. Docket No. 10-0106 Civil Action. 2010-07-06. "The plaintiff, Bernard Baran, filed this action against the defendants, the estate of Leonard Conway, David O. Burbank, and Cain, Hibbard, &amp; Myers, P.C., in January 2010 alleging criminal malpractice."&lt;/ref&gt; Even though a $400,000.00 settlement was reached in 2010 the state has denied liability and thus has yet to expunge his record.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130412022517/http://www.thetranscript.com/ci_22676342/man-whose-molestation-conviction-was-overturned-wants-his] "Bernard Baran Jr. wants his record wiped clean. During a hearing Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court, Assistant Attorney General David Hartnagel argued that under state law, criminal records can be expunged only after a defendant receives a judgment in his favor against the state in his erroneous conviction cases. Baran reached a $400,000 settlement with the state, but the state denied liability in that settlement."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Baran died suddenly on September 1, 2014, at his home in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lindsay |first=Dick |date=2014-09-03 |url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/ci_26460338/bernard-baran-cleared-child-molestation-charges-dead-at |title=Bernard Baran, cleared of child molestation charges, dead at 49 |newspaper=[[Berkshire Eagle]]  |accessdate=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had worked extensively with the charitable organization in the past, helping raise money to provide surgeries for children with treatable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cure.org/blog/2014/07/national-christian-radio-host-joins-cure-international/|title=National Christian Radio Host Joins CURE International|website=Cure.org|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 12, 2014, in his new podcast ''The Brant &amp; Sherri Podcast'', he announced that he would have a new daily radio show starting in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://branthansen.com/2014/08/12/on-robin-williams-the-new-radio-show-and-where-are-the-single-men/|title=On Robin Williams, the New Radio Show, and Where are the Single Men…?|date=12 August 2014|website=Branthansen.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2014, Hansen launched ''The Brant Hansen Show'', a national radio show sponsored by [[CURE International]], and syndicated by [[WSCF-FM|Christian FM]]. Co-hosted with Sherri Lynn, Hansen describes the show as "one of the top radio shows in the country that team a white Midwestern nerd with a form of autism and a very patient African-American lady from Pittsburgh… we're at least one of the top five in that category."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/132991/brant-hansen-returns-to-radio-syndicated-by-christ|title=Brant Hansen Returns To Radio, Syndicated By Christian FM|website=Allaccess.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2015, ''The Brant Hansen Show'' is syndicated in 32 states, on over 200 radio stations including [[WAY-FM Network|WAY-FM]], [[WBYO|Word FM]], [[WONU|Shine FM]], [[Liberty University]]'s [[WRVL|The Journey FM]], and [[NGEN Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://branthansen.com/stations/|title=Radio Station List|date=15 October 2014|website=Branthansen.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
Hansen has authored a number of blogs, many of which were associated with the radio station he was working at the time. Some of these are Letters From Kamp Krusty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://branthansen.typepad.com/|title=Letters from Kamp Krusty|website=Letters from Kamp Krusty|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brant's Blog of Awesomeness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brantsblogofawesomeness.typepad.com/|title=Brant's Blog of Awesomeness|website=Brant's Blog of Awesomeness|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brant's Air1 Blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air1.com/blog/brant |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103181531/http://www.air1.com/blog/brant/ |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular recurring posts across multiple blogs by Hansen are excerpts from the fictional book ''The 417 Rules of Awesomely Bold Leadership'', a satirical look at leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://branthansen.typepad.com/letters_from_kamp_krusty/help_for_visionary_leaders_of_leading_leaders/|title=Letters from Kamp Krusty|website=Letters from Kamp Krusty|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Krusty Sage is another popular character that Hansen uses to express opinions that can be offensive to some people, but allows Hansen to express them in a tone to which people might be more receptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air1.com/blog/brant/post/2013/02/19/The-Krusty-Sage-on-Sheltering-Your-Kids.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809200319/http://www.air1.com/blog/brant/post/2013/02/19/The-Krusty-Sage-on-Sheltering-Your-Kids.aspx |archive-date=2014-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen had an article published on CNN's religion blog, titled "Mr. Spock Goes To Church. How One Christian Copes With Aspergers Syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/19/mr-spock-goes-to-church-how-one-christian-copes-with-aspergers-syndrome/|title='Mr. Spock goes to church': How one Christian copes with Asperger's syndrome|website=Religion.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hansen wrote a book titled ''Unoffendable: How Just One Change Can Make All of Life Better'', due to release in April 2015. The subject of the book is anger, and according to Hansen, "giving up the 'right' to be offended can be one of the most freeing, healthy, simplifying, relaxing, refreshing, stress-relieving, encouraging things we can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Unoffendable-Just-Change-Make-Better/dp/0529123851|title=Unoffendable: How Just One Change Can Make All of Life Better|date=14 April 2015|accessdate=13 August 2018|website=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cossack]] riots were the pogroms that were held against the [[Jews]] of modern [[Ukraine]] in 1648, during the uprising of the Cossacks and serfs led by [[Bogdan Khmelnitsky]] or the "Hamil of Evil" as he was called by the Jews which were against the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Massacre of the [[Jews of Poland]], [[Belarus]], and today's Ukraine occurred throughout the rebellion, which lasted for many years and during the [[Russo-Polish War]] (1654-1667) and the small northern war with the [[Swedish Empire]] that ignited them. Nevertheless, the sudden destruction of many communities from the beginning of April–May 1648 (Iyar 1848), until the cessation of the Cossacks' progress in November of that year, is the source of the name. According to the historian Adam Teller: "In the Jewish collective memory, the events in the summer and autumn of 1648 define the uprising in general, and therefore the riots were known as the 1848s." Thousands were slaughtered or died of starvation and epidemics, and many others fled, sold into slavery, or converted. The number of Jews killed by the Cossack rebels in 1648 was estimated at a few thousand to 20,000 at most; It is estimated that all the parties - the Cossacks, the Russians, the Swedes, their allies and the Poles themselves who massacred them on suspicion of collaborating with the invaders - died between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews in total Everything, including the dead in '48.

== Background ==
In 1569, with the establishment of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], large land tracts (of today's Ukraine) were transferred from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the rule of the Kingdom of Poland. The aristocracy, which enjoyed independence and even chose the king, controlled the area that had been ruled until then by the [[Tatars]] from the [[Crimea]]. In the territories western to the [[Dnieper River]], tens of thousands of people from the rest of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] came to settle down. The [[Piłsudski family|Piłsudski]] and especially the great [[Magnates]], which most of them were descendants of the local aristocracy, established vast agricultural estates and imposed strict rules on the local Ruthenian peasants.

Among the settlers there were many [[Jews]]. They were pushed from [[Poland]] itself under the pressure of city residents who wanted to reduce the economic competition. Many of the [[Jews]] were employed by the nobility as [[leases]] and estate managers. Dozens of new communities were established in [[Ukraine]], mainly on the right bank (western area) of the [[Dnieper]]. The eastern side was a somewhat wild area. It was closer to the [[Crimea]] and dangerous to settlement, although some estates and cities were there and drew [[Jews]] looking for jobs. Southern to where the river bends, lived the [[Cossacks]] from the  [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a semi-nomadic society that maintained a routine of constant fighting with the [[Tatars]]. The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] maintained strained relations with the [[Cossacks]] and tried to subordinate them to its authority while exploiting them for military usage.

The nobility mercilessly brutalized the general population and especially the [[serfs]]. The economic and social tension, which also led to strong hostility towards Jewish lessees, has gotten worse due to religious reasons. At the end of the 16th century, in the framework of the counter-reformation, the [[Jesuits]] has reached the area. Although they intended to fight any manifestation of Protestantism, they soon turned their attention to the [[Ruthenians]], which almost all were Orthodox Christians. [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (King Sigismund III) was a devout Catholic, as were most of the Polish nobles. Under these pressures, many of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobles converted to Catholicism. Similar attempts, which were also expressed in establishing a local Uniate church and the persecution of Orthodox priests who refused to join it, were made towards the common people. The local's rage for all this was quickly channeled into acts of rebellion led by the [[Cossacks]], who were experienced fighters and they rebelled eight times between 1592 and 1638.

In the 19th century, with the creation of [[Ukrainian nationalism]], many historians tried to describe the conflict between a local [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] independence movement and foreign Polish nobility and its Jewish servants. The great [[Magnates]] in the region were, in fact, mostly Catholics or Unites, but they were descendants of the original inhabitants, such as the [[Ostrogski family]]. The [[Voivode]] [[Jeremi Wiśniowiecki]] (the Vishnotzky Duke of the book " The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)", in Hebrew: יוֵן מְצוּלָה) was the son of a well-known Orthodox family and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. There are reports of cooperation between Jews and locals against the nobility and the Jews participation in Cossack raids. Like all the townspeople in the area, the Jews were obliged to participate in defensing the towns in case of a siege. In the East Bank, many were obliged to carry weapon in case of Tartar attacks.

== The Events ==

=== The Outbreak of the Uprising ===
{{Main|1=Khmelnytsky Uprising}}One of the victims of the landowners was a local junior nobleman named Bogdan Khmelnytsky. In early 1647, his property and his intended fiancé were taken (and according to a single report, his ten-year-old son was murdered) by Daniel Czaplinski, apparently the deputyof the magnate Alexander Koniecpolski. When Bogdan Khmelnytsky turned to the courts and didn’t receive any response, a great rebellion began to develop, which was much bigger the previous ones.

In the spring of 1648, Khmelnitsky, who was appointed to be the Ataman (officer) of the Zapurozi, led an army of Cossacks against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He made an alliance with the Tatars, who provided him with 4,000 cavalry under the command of Tugai Bay. In April he crossed the Dnieper with his army and won two crushing victories against the crown forces, one on the Yellow River on May 15 and the other in Kurson on the 26th.

The news of his victories sparked a huge uprising among the people throughout the country. The Cossacks and the masses massacred the Jews, nobles, Catholics, and Uniattes wherever they reached. The disturbances spread to southern of today's Belarus, and the Cossack troops reached Pinsk. The eastern bank of the Dnieper, where the population was almost entirely Orthodox and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence was weak, fell without a real struggle. The following day after the victory in Kurson, on the first day of Shavuot (a Jewish holiday), on May 27, 1648, began a mass deportation of the Jews in the surrounding districts to the fortified cities, desecrating the holiday. About the same time, Yirmi Vishniewiecki withdrew from his estates in Lubny with his own army and took with him several hundred of Jews along with the other refugees. He kept gathering Jewish people on the way.

Nathan Neta Hanover, whose book " ''The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)'' " is the best-known chronicle of events, described what he heard about the riots in the eastern bank that fell into the hands of the rebels:

{{Quote|text="many communities beyond the Dnieper, and close to the battle field, such as Pereyaslaw, Baryszowka, Piratyn, and Boryspole, Lubin and Lachowce and their neighbors, who were unable to escape, perished for the sanctification of His Name. These persons died cruel and bitter deaths. Some were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chopped off, and their bodies thrown on the highway only to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some has wounds inflicted upon them, and thrown on the street to die a slow death; they writhed in their blood until they breathed their last; others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in the laps of their mothers. They were sliced into pieces like fish. They slashed the bellies of pregnant women, removed their infants and tossed them in their faces. Some women had their bellies torn open and live cats placed in them. The bellies were then sewed up with the living cats remaining within. They chopped off the hands of the victims so that they would not be able to remove the cats from the bellies. The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears, roasted on the fire and then brought to their mothers to be eaten. Many times they used the bodies of Jewish children as improvised bridges upon which they later crossed. There was no cruel device of murder in the whole world that was not perpetrated by the enemies."|sign=[[Nathan Neta Hanover]]|source="[[The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)]]", chapter IV}}

On the first day of June, Khmelnitsky's main camp was stopped at Bila Sarkawa and ceased moving westward. Yet, the masses in the territories that remained under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth control continued to rebel. Some atamans (officers) Cossack, with the most dominant of them all- Maxim Krivonos, used their forces to support the acts of rebellion. On the tenth of June, 1648, Krivonos conquered the city of Nemyriv, where a large Jewish population had fortified. According to Hanover and other record-writers, he pretended to be a friendly force and flew flags of the Crown Army, while Cossack sources reported from inside. As soon as Nemyriv fell, the Cossacks slaughtered all the Catholics and the Jews inside. Hanover reported 6,000 Jews killed, an improbable number which was denied by modern historians but still provides a measure of destruction. Mordechai Nadav noted that events of the size of that in Pinsk, in which several dozen Jews were apparently killed during the invasion, were more typical of the events. Similar massacres took place in many other cities, such as Polona and Bar. In Nemyriv, the Jewish chronologists noted a mass refusal of Jews to offer the slaughterers to convert to Christianity and to be saved, although at the same time the Shakh (Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen) wrote that "many Jews violated the covenant." A group of Jews which swore allegiance to the Cossacks and converted to Christianity rescued itself from the city after a short time, when Nemyriv fell into the hands of Vishniewitzky.

On June 18, Krivonos began a siege of Tulchyn, and broke through the wall on the 21st. The next day the fort fell. Then there was a time-out for several days and on June 26 the massacre took place. Hanover and others argued that the local commander, Duke Janusz Chetvartinsky, betrayed the Jews and gave them to the rioters while trying in vain to save his own life. Israel Halperin determined that there was no evidence of this and Chturtinsky probably tried to release all those who were inside by means of a bribe, but the Cossacks killed them all. He believed that the source of the rumor was because Cheturtinsky belonged to a devout Orthodox family and that is why the Catholics suspected him. Hannover noted that Jews were also offered to convert to Christianity, but they rejected it and chose death for the sanctification of God's Name. The historian Yechezkel Feram rejected Hannover's description and claimed that Hanover based on another person's testimony. Fram believed that the description was a distortion of the story "cliff of the times" about a similar sanction in Hommel that took place at the same time, on the 20th of June, 1648. Meir Meshbreshin reported that several rabbis urged the people to surrender and not to convert, and all of them were slaughtered, but this event is doubted as well.

Others like Hanover tended to link the sanctions of 1848-1988 to the Ashkenazi Kiddush tradition of the middle Ages, from events such as the 1096 decrees of Blois from 1171. The day Nemyriv was conquered, 10 June 1648, is also the Memorial Day In memory of the victims of the Cossacks. Yet, there were no similar events like the mass suicide in the days of the Crusaders in 1650. Historian Jacob Katz tended to associate this to the erosion of the ideal of Kiddush Hashem (the sanctification of God's name through martyrdom) in the past centuries, but Feram wrote that it remained as strong as ever. The difference between the riots was due to external circumstances. Unlike the Crusaders, the rebellious Ruthenians had no organized policy of conversion: they classified anyone who was not Orthodox as an enemy, but did not intended to spread their own faith. Also, there are reports of Jews who converted to Christianity voluntarily and still were killed. The Eastern Church had no direct connection with the rioters. For their part, they dealt with looting and killing for their own sake, nobility, Catholics and Uniattes as Jews. Paul of Aleppo, who visited the country a few years later, told of a desire for extermination. Even the masses, who were not familiar with the halakhic elements of the hour of annihilation but were well aware of the principle of a long tradition, viewed the events as a politic class struggle rather than an attempt to convert them, as many reports indicate, both from the chronicles and from testimonies to the courts after everything happened.

In September the noble armies suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Filabetsi, and in fact, there was no significant force remained until Warsaw itself. Khmelnytsky advanced toward Lviv and Zamość. In Lviv, the city's residents were offered to extradite the Jews in return for lifting the siege, but they refused. As in all other cities, the Jews took part in its defense. At the end of November, fearing a prolonged battle in the winter and after the new Polish-Lithuanian king offered him extensive concessions, Khmelnitsky retreated to Kiev. The fighting resumed at the end of May 1649, and continued intermittently for years to come. Large-scale killings were carried out against the Ukrainian Jews and the parts of Belarus that fell into the hands of the rebels. The amount of people who converted to Christianity, which many of them kept their new religion even after the conquest of their homes by the crown's faithful soldiers, was big enough that on the 2nd of May, 1650, King Jan Kazimierz gave a special order that allows all those who wished it to return to Judaism. Many were captured by the Tartars. Among the Jews it was thought that the Tartars were interested in any Jew in order to sell them in slavery markets. However, they often wanted only slaves who would provide worthwhile price. These included young women, men of working age and children. There were cases in which the Ruthenian masses rejected the attempts to sell them slaves who were not included among these classifications. It was also reported that the elderly and other non-wanted slaves were separated from the captured prisoners and burned alive so that they would not burden the caravans. However, the Tartars did not take part in the massacres known as Tulchyn and Nemyriv; these were the work of Maksym Kryvonis. The Cossacks themselves did not take slaves, but killed those who fell into their hands. The Jewish communities joined forces in the efforts to redeem the Jewish slaves, which were located mainly in the large market in Constantinople. Large donations were made throughout the Jewish world: a special tax was imposed by the Council of Four Lands in areas not affected by the revolt, the Karaites in the Ottoman capital raised donations, and the main help came from a slavery-redeeming company in Venice whose emissaries came as far as Hamburg and Amsterdam to request charity. With these funds and its official delegate, the community of Constantinople redeemed 1,500 people by July 1651, in exchange for a total amount of 150,000 Spanish reais. The stream then decreased and in total there were 2,000 redeemed people in 1648, some in distant markets such as Persia and Algiers.

The number of Jewish victims was evaluated as great. Samuel Ben-Nathan Feidel, in his book from 1650, counted 281 communities destroyed and claimed that six hundred thousand Jews were killed. The Shakh on the other hand, noted that there were one thousand. Menashe Ben Israel wrote to Oliver Cromwell that there were one hundred and eighty thousand. Although in the 20th century, Isaac Schifer estimated that there were three hundred thousand killed or taken prisoner from 1648 to -1655. Modern research has greatly reduced estimates of the victims of the massacres: Professor Shmuel Ettinger estimated the entire Jewish population of Ukraine in 1648 at -51,325 persons, based on documents from that period. Prof. Shaul Stampfer claimed that there were 40,000, stating that "'''at most 50% (20,000) and perhaps much less'''" than those who died at the outbreak of the revolt in 1648.

===  Additional disputes  ===
In 1654 Tsardom of Russia gave Suzerainty to Khmelnytsky and their armies invaded together into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, both in Ukraine and in the north, in Belarus and Lithuania. At the beginning of August 1655 Vilna fell into the hands of the occupier and a mass slaughter was carried out, although the reports showed that most of the Jews had managed to escape in time. In October, Lublin was captured, where the chronicles cite about 2,000 Jews who died. It was the greatest disaster of the new battle. The historian Dov Weinryb, based both on Polish records and on personal reports, stated that the correct number was probably several hundred. The Russians also tended to take many prisoners, and a new wave of Jewish slaves reached the markets in 1665 and 1656. Once again, a great effort began to raise funds for their redemption.

In the summer of 1655 invaded a new enemy to the republic, the Swedish Empire led by King Carl Gustav. This war was the most destructive of all the struggles between Poland and Lithuania. It is still estimated to be worse than World War II in terms of the relative damage caused to the country. In what became known as the "Swedish Flood," the most affluent and populated areas of Poland were completely destroyed. The circumstances led to great hunger that year. Jewish reports staged the invaders as sympathetic towards them. Although they did not take special action against them except for a random killing, many Jews, together with the rest of the people, died of starvation, epidemics and sword. For example, the Jewish quarter of Kazimierz in Kraków was completely destroyed by the siege on the city in September–October 1655 and the survivors fled to Bohemia and Moravia.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was almost collapsing: Many nobles believed that Karl Gustav would do them good and change sides with their armies. The magnate Janusz Radziwiłł swore allegiance in return for protection from the Russians and cut off Lithuania from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. But the scales were tipped by the massacres and looting of the Swedes, and especially by the awakening of Catholic sentiment with the successful defense of the Jesna Gora Monastery since November. The Piłsudski (a family of nobility that originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and increased in notability under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Second Polish Republic) began to resent the Swedish king, who neglected their affairs, and most of them renewed their loyalty to Jan Kazimierz. The masses of the people and the minor nobility, headed by Hetman Stefan Czerniecki, launched a guerilla war against the Lutheran conquerors. In the fall of 1656, the Czar estimated that Sweden might become too strong and started supporting the King of Poland.

The rebels, driven also by the betrayal of the Calvinist Radziwill, ran what they perceived as a struggle for the Catholic Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, neo-Aryans, Orthodox and Jews were all marked as enemies and suspected of collaborating with the Swedes. Different militias and the Crown Forces massacred them frequently. On January 22, 1656, the king confiscated the remains of Kazimierz and gave all the looting that could be extracted from it to the army after declaring that the Jews had cooperated with the enemy. In February 1656, Czerniecki killed 600 Jews, according to the records, when he liberated Sandomierz Castle. Poland, Lithuania and Sweden signed a peace agreement in 1660, and the fighting between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Moscow resumed. It continued on a relatively limited scale until signing the Truce of Andrusovo Agreement in 1667, which brought tranquility to the kingdom for the first time in 19 years. The Lithuanian communities paid a large sum to include in the contract a clause allowing all Jewish prisoners in Russia, with the exception of converts and women who were married, to return home.

The historian Dov Weinryb wrote that according to records about the size of Jewish communities in the 1970s and 1980s, which together with other data indicate that many survived by conversion or immigration, "a reasonable estimate" of all Jews killed - By the sword, by all sides, and by epidemics and famine - during the turbulent period that swept Poland from 1648 to 1677, "will be between 40,000 and 50,000, although historians point to far larger estimates, which are high enough to include between a fifth and a quarter of the Jewish population In Poland and Lithuania on the eve of the uprising. "

===  Following the Sanctions  ===
[[File:Hebrewbooks_org_42621_520.jpg|right|thumb|312x312px|''"El Maleh Rahamim"'' in memory of the victims of the sanctions of 1096 and the sanctions of the Cossack riots.]]
The chaos that was in Poland following the sanctions brought the leaders of the communities and their rabbis into taking steps regarding the welfare of the refugees, both in material aid and in halachic discussions to allow a second marriage to women whose husbands had been lost. The problem of women whose husbands had been lost reached distant courts in communities where captives were redeemed and wanted to remarry. In Cairo, in a case cited in the "Divrei Noam", a group of women sent a messenger to Poland who returned with divorce documents from all their husbands.

The generation who lived at that time debated the question whether the sanctions were shedding clean blood for the sins of the House of Israel or punishment from god. Many adopted the first statement, but pamphlets published in Europe blamed the Polish Jewry of committing sins such as: loan interest, Folk distribution of Kabbalah books to the masses, raising pigs for non-Jews, lawlessness and more. The massive flight to the west also led to the renewed growth of the Holy Roman Empire as an important Torah center, after years of standing in the shadow of its neighbor to the east. Researchers in the past have frequently related the pogroms as a catalyst for the rise of Sabbateanism. Sarah, the wife of Shabtai Zvi, also became orphaned during it. Although this assertion lost its validity over time, Israel Halpern believed that the effort to raise funds for the redemption of captives throughout the continent hastened the horrific news of the events to the entire Diaspora and played an important role.

In memory of the heavy mourning, the rabbis decreed banquets and fancy costumes. Wearing silk and velvet was forbidden for three years. Women were forbidden to wear gold chains and gems for three years. It was forbidden to sing songs of joy for one year, except for wedding ceremonies, and the authority was given by the leaders of each community to extend the validity of the prohibitions for additional years.

In February 1650 The Council of Four Lands assembled in Lublin, where it was declared that the Memorial Day for the sanctions in Blois and for the day that nemyriv fell will be on the 10th of June, 1648 (20th of Sivan- a month from the Jewish calendar) In memory of the victims. Lamentations and special prayers were written to be said on this day. Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller then corrected the lament of ''"Ella Ezekara in Third Tears"'' for those who perished. In addition, various versions of the prayer ''"El Malei Rachamim"'' (a Jewish prayer for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year) were also composed, to be recited on the 20th of Sivan, on Yom Kippur, on the Sabbath preceding Shavuot and on Shabbat Chazon.

Despite its many inaccuracies, ''"Abyss of Despair"'' has become a historical memory because of the high quality of Hanover's writing. It was published in more than twenty editions in several languages, and remained a major source until the 20th century. The sanctions of 1648 are mentioned in several literary works in Hebrew. The most famous of them are: ''"The Slave"'' by Isaac Bashevis Singer, ''"The Nazarene"'' by Shalom Asch, ''"A City In Its Fullness"'' by SY Agnon and the Ballad ''"the Rabbi's daughter"'' by Shaul Tchernichovsky.

'''D. A. Clarke''' (also known as '''De Clarke''' and '''DeAnander''') is a [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] essayist and activist in the [[United States of America]] who has been active since 1980.

== Career ==
Much of Clarke's writing addresses the link between violence against women and [[market economics]], although she may be best known for her 1991 essay "''Justice Is A Woman With A Sword''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Clarke | first = D.A. | title = Justice is a woman with a sword | url = http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/Porn/Justice.html | work = [[Nikki Craft#1990s and onward|NoStatusQuo]] | publisher = [[Nikki Craft]] | date = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that essay, which she has updated twice for editions of the anthology ''Transforming a Rape Culture'', she argues that [[feminist theory]] has taken a [[dogma]]tic approach to [[nonviolence]] and that women's [[self-defense]], violent feminist [[activism]], and the encouragement of positive media portrayals of violent women (such as in ''[[Kill Bill]]'' or ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'') have not been given the serious consideration they should receive and that their dismissal from mainstream feminism, while it may ultimately be desirable, has not been based on a properly thorough analysis.  Her most popular work, however, may be the one least often correctly attributed to her:  the early poem ''privilege'', which has been found on dorm refrigerators and bulletin boards ascribed to 'Anonymous.'&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Clarke | first = D.A. | contribution = privilege | editor-last = Clarke | editor-first = D.A. | title = Banshee | publisher = Peregrine Press | location = Portland, Maine | year = 1981 | contribution-url = http://www.nostatusquo.com/~de/banshee/privilege.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, at least, Anonymous really was a woman.

In addition to being published in print anthologies, much of her work has appeared online.  Clarke also had brief visibility as an amateur/indie musician, with one album "messages" released on cassette in the mid 80's.

[[Image:Yemenites go to Aden.jpg|thumb|[[Yemenite Jews]] on their way to a camp set by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|"Joint]]" in [[Aden]]]]

The '''Day to Mark the Departure and Expulsion of Jews from the Arab Countries and Iran''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''יום לציון היציאה והגירוש של היהודים מארצות ערב ומאיראן''') is a Memorial Day that is marked in [[Israel]] every year starting in 2014, on November 30 with the purpose of marking the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|departure and expulsion of Jews from Arab countries and Iran]]. November 30 is the date that was chosen since it is symbolically the day following November 29, a day the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was adopted, and when many communities of Jews in Arab countries and Iran started to feel the pressure and hostility from their Arab and Persian neighbors and as a result of that were forced to leave their countries. It is based on a law sponsored by MK [[Shimon Ohayon]] ([[Yisrael Beiteinu]]) and passed in the summer of 2014 by the [[Knesset]].

For many [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel]] it is considered to be a belated recognition of their collective trauma, after years of what many of them claimed to be the marking of [[Ashkenazi Jews|European Jewry]] [[Holocaust|suffering]] only from the part of Israel, or the marking of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Nakba]] only from the part of the Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/.premium-1.629226 |title=Israel marks first-ever national day remembering Jewish exodus from Muslim lands |first=Ofer |last=Aderet |date=November 30, 2014 |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knesset established this observance in 2014. The purpose of this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of [[Mizrahi Jews]] during the period around the establishment of the State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison to the suffering of [[European Jewry]] during the [[Holocaust]] and in comparison to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Nakba]]. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/.premium-1.629226 |title=Israel marks first-ever national day remembering Jewish exodus from Muslim lands |first=Ofer |last=Aderet |date=November 30, 2014 |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2008, she was the principal dancer with her partner Peter in the TV1 program ''Duizend Zonnen en Garnalen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Other projects ==

=== Walter Van Beirendonck ===
In July 1997, [[Walter Van Beirendonck]], the famous Belgian fashion designer of the Antwerp Six, asked Ekkart to collaborate with his fashion show for his 1998 summer collection in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Peter Ekkart did the choreography, coordinated the act, and Ellen participated as a dancer and model.

=== Robert Groslot ===
In 2005, she danced 'Tango for Three' on a show with Robert Groslot, choreographed by Marc Bogaerts.

=== Dirk Brossé ===
Also in 2005, she danced and choreographed an act on the show of Dirk Brossé.

=== Dancing in prison ===
From 2005 to 2007, the Federal Antwerp Prison asked Ekkart to give dance lessons in the prison to the inmates, and to choreograph a show with the inmates.

=== Styling ===
From 2009 to 2016, she styled businesspeople, individuals and dancers, making them more confident and professional.

=== BBC Speaking Awards ===
In 2011 and 2013, she coached candidates for the BBC Speaking Awards.

=== The Ballroom Orchestra ===
Wim Jansegers had the idea of touring the Flemish cultural centers with authentic ballroom music. He looked for professional musicians and singers, and for a contact in the ballroom dancing world.  That contact was soon found, and Peter and Ellen Ekkart were attracted as a show couple.  They named the band The Ballroom Orchestra. The show included participation by the public, where musicians, dancers and the public interact with each other. The show toured for two years in 2013 and 2014, and played in all major cities. The highlight was three concerts in the authentic hall De Roma in Antwerp.

=== Wim Vandekeybus ===
For an audition for his show in 2015, [[Wim Vandekeybus]] had to choose from 600 dancers coming from all parts of the world.  He hired Peter and Ellen Ekkart &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Auditions at Ultima Vez - Wim Vandekeybus
| website = Vimeo
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give a session in [[ballroom dancing]], so he could see how quickly the dancers picked up this style.  The fusion of [[contemporary dance]], [[ballet]] and ballroom gave a special mix Vandekeybus which can use in the near future.

== Personal life ==
She married in 2001, and the couple have a son.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">Captain '''Ewen Cameron''' (1811 – April 26, 1843) was an officer in the [[Republic of Texas]] army, and participated in the ill-fated [[Mier Expedition]].

== Biography ==
Cameron, who had migrated from [[Scotland]] to Kentucky, had come to Texas in 1836, arriving just after the [[Texas Revolution]].

In late December 1842, the Mier Expedition was a [[Raid (military)|raid]] on the Mexican border settlement of [[Ciudad Mier]], which turned into the Battle of Mier when the Mexican Army arrived. Cameron and the other Texans were taken prisoner, after inflicting a large number of casualties on the other side.

At a location called El Rancho Salado, a jar containing 159 white beans and 17 black beans was presented to the Texan prisoners. Each man drew a bean from the jar, while blindfolded. The 17 Texan prisoners who drew black beans were executed at dusk by a Mexican firing squad. This is known as the [[Black Bean Episode]] and occurred on March 25, 1843, three months after the Battle of Mier.

Cameron had selected a white bean, which should have saved his life.  Yet he had earned the hostility of Mexican Colonel [[Antonio Canales Rosillo]] for his role in his embarrassing defeat in the battle at Fort Lipantitlán, Texas, in July 1842, and for Cameron's role in leading an escape attempt.  Colonel Canales urged the Mexican dictator [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] to have Cameron executed.

On April 25, 1843, the prisoners who had drawn white beans were being moved to Mexico City.  As they traveled, a courier arrived with orders from Santa Anna for Cameron's execution. Cameron was shot by a firing squad at [[San Carlos Fortress|Perote Prison]] in the state of [[Veracruz]], the next morning, April 26, 1843.  Cameron refused to [[Confession (religion)|confess to a priest]], and declined the offer of a blindfold, declaring, "For the liberty of Texas, Ewen Cameron can look death in the face."  He then opened his hunting shirt and yelled at his executioners, ''"Fuego!"'' (Fire!).

Cameron was presumably buried at [[Perote, Veracruz]]. Therefore, his remains were not among those exhumed a few years later and returned to Texas.

[[Cameron County, Texas]], and [[Cameron, Texas]], are named for Ewen Cameron.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
[[File:F.SionilJosé jf896.JPG|thumb|left|220px|F. Sionil José Bust monument ([[Rosales, Pangasinan]] Presidencia).]]
[[File:F.SionilJosejf897.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Inscription in the Monument (February 23, 2007).]]
José was born in [[Rosales, Pangasinan]], the setting of many of his stories.  He spent his childhood in Barrio Cabugawan, Rosales, where he first began to write. José is of [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] descent whose family had migrated to Pangasinan prior to his birth. Fleeing poverty, his forefathers traveled from [[Ilocos]] towards [[Cagayan Valley]] through the Santa Fe Trail. Like many migrant families, they brought their lifetime possessions with them, including uprooted ''molave'' posts of their old houses and their ''alsong'', a stone mortar for pounding rice.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inquirer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jrank/&gt;

One of the greatest influences to José was his industrious mother who went out of her way to get him the books he loved to read, while making sure her family did not go hungry despite poverty and landlessness.  José started writing in grade school, at the time he started reading.  In the fifth grade, one of José's teachers opened the school [[library]] to her students, which is how José managed to read the novels of [[José Rizal]], [[Willa Cather]]’s ''My Antonia'', [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] and [[Steinbeck]].  Reading about ''Basilio'' and ''Crispin'' in Rizal's ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' made the young José cry, because injustice was not an alien thing to him.  When José was five years old, his grandfather who was a soldier during the Philippine revolution, had once tearfully showed him the land their family had once tilled but was taken away by rich ''[[mestizo]]'' [[landlord]]s who knew how to work the system against [[illiterate]]s like his grandfather.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inquirer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jrank/&gt;

===Writing career===
José attended the [[University of Santo Tomas]] after [[World War II]], but dropped out and plunged into writing and journalism in [[Manila]]. In subsequent years, he edited various literary and journalistic publications, started a publishing house, and founded the Philippine branch of [[International PEN|PEN]], an international organization for writers.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt; José received numerous awards for his work. ''The Pretenders'' is his most popular novel, which is the story of one man's alienation from his poor background and the decadence of his wife's wealthy family.&lt;ref name=Inquirer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jrank/&gt;

[[José Rizal]]'s life and writings profoundly influenced José's work. The five volume Rosales Saga, in particular, employs and integrates themes and characters from Rizal's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josephscalice.com/index.php/2004/12/17/articulating-revolution-rizal-in-f-sionil-joses-rosales-saga/ |last=Scalice |first=Joseph |title=Articulating Revolution: Rizal in F. Sionil José's ''Rosales'' Saga |date=17 December 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214180911/http://josephscalice.com/index.php/2004/12/17/articulating-revolution-rizal-in-f-sionil-joses-rosales-saga/ |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, José's writings espouse social justice and change to better the lives of average Filipino families. He is one of the most critically acclaimed Filipino authors internationally, although much underrated in his own country because of his authentic [[Philippine English|Filipino English]] and his anti-elite views.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inquirer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jrank/&gt;

{{quotation|"Authors like myself choose the city as a setting for their fiction because the city itself illustrates the progress or the sophistication that a particular country has achieved. Or, on the other hand, it might also reflect the kind of decay, both social and perhaps moral, that has come upon a particular people."|'''F. Sionil José'''|BBC.com, 30 July 2003&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;}}

Sionil José also owns Solidaridad Bookshop, which is on Padre Faura Street in [[Ermita, Manila]]. The bookshop offers mostly hard-to-find books and [[Filipiniana]] reading materials. It is said to be one of the favorite haunts of many local writers.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inquirer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jrank/&gt;

In his regular column, ''Hindsight'', in ''[[The Philippine STAR]]'', dated 12 September 2011, he wrote ''"Why we are shallow"'', blaming the decline of Filipino intellectual and cultural standards on a variety of modern amenities, including media, the education system—particularly the loss of emphasis on classic literature and the study of Greek and Latin—and the abundance and immediacy of information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/725822/why-we-are-shallow |first=F. Sionil |last=José |title=Why we are shallow |publisher=The Philippine Star |date=11 September 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Five of José's works have won the [[Palanca Awards|Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature]]: his short stories ''The God Stealer'' in 1959, ''Waywaya'' in 1979, ''Arbol de Fuego'' (Firetree) in 1980, his novel ''Mass'' in 1981, and his essay ''A Scenario for Philippine Resistance'' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palancaawards.com.ph/Testing3/francisco-sionil-jose-speech/ |title=Guest of Honor Introduction - NATIONAL ARTIST FOR LITERATURE – MR. F. SIONIL JOSE |publisher=Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards |year=2011 |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, various award-giving bodies have feted José with awards for his outstanding works and for being an outstanding Filipino in the field of literature. His first award was the 1979 City of Manila Award for Literature which was presented to him by Manila Mayor [[Ramon Bagatsing]]. The following year, he was given the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts. Among his other awards during that period include the Outstanding Fulbrighters Award for Literature (1988) and the Cultural Center of the Philippines Award (Gawad para sa Sining) for Literature (1989).

By the turn of the century, José continued to receive recognition from several award-giving bodies. These include the Cultural Center of the Philippines Centennial Award in 1999, the prestigious Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres in 2000, and the Order of Sacred Treasure (Kun Santo Zuiho Sho) in 2001. In that same year, the Philippine government bestowed upon him the prestigious title of National Artist for Literature for his outstanding contributions to Philippine literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/national-artists-of-the-philippines/f-sionil-jose/ |title=Culture Profile: F.

{{quotation|''"...The reader of his well crafted stories will learn more about the Philippines, its people and its concerns than from any journalistic account or from a holiday trip there.

'''Féng Guózhāng''', ({{Zh|t=馮國璋|s=冯国璋|w=Feng Kuo-chang}}; [[Courtesy name|courtesy]]: '''Huafu''' 華甫 or 華符) (January 7, 1859 – December 12, 1919) was a key [[Beiyang Army]] [[general]] and politician in early [[History of the Republic of China|republican China]]. He held the office of Vice-President and then President of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. He is considered the founder of the [[Zhili Clique]] of Warlords that vied for control of northern China during the chaotic [[Warlord era]].

==Early life==
Feng Guozhang was born to a peasant family in [[Hejian]], [[Hebei]] (then called "[[Zhili Province|Zhili]]"). His family had fallen on hard times and was forced to sell its property to educate its sons; however being the fourth son, Feng was unable to complete his education due to costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Jack|title=Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=169|year=2002|isbn = 978-0-19-870069-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reputedly had to survive part of his early life by playing the violin in disreputable theatres.&lt;ref name="Gray 171"&gt;Gray, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Without much recourse, Feng enlisted  in the army, then undergoing reforms that would eventually create the [[Beiyang Army]] under the command of [[Yuan Shikai]]. Feng performed admirably and came to the notice of a battalion commander, who referred him to the [[Baoding Military Academy]].&lt;ref name="Gray 171"&gt;Gray, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Baoding where he would make key friends and allies who would serve him well later on. In 1895 Feng was sent to Tokyo to serve as a military attaché and came to the attention of Yuan Shikai, who began to groom him to be one of his supporters within the Beiyang Army. However, when Yuan was forced to retire in 1908 by Manchu nobles fearful of his growing power, Feng managed to maintain a good relationship with both sides.&lt;ref name="Gray 171"&gt;Gray, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1911, after the outbreak of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], he was ordered by the Qing Court to suppress the revolution in Wuhan. He held back the Beiyang Army until Yuan Shikai was restored to power and then proceeded to capture Hankou and Hanyang from the revolutionaries in the [[Battle of Yangxia]]. On October 14 he was appointed to command the Second Army (consisting of two divisions) by the imperial court. In the battle he ordered the razing of Hankou. Then, following orders from Yuan Shikai, he halted the Qing military's advance on Wuchang. Yuan then negotiated the abdication of the [[Puyi|Last Emperor]] and became the provisional president of the newly founded  [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912.  Feng followed Yuan into the new government and was honored for his contribution to the [[Xinhai Revolution]], even though he actually took an active part in suppressing it.

==Politics==
Feng broke with [[Yuan Shikai]] when he later attempted to [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|make himself emperor]].  Yuan made Feng a duke, but Feng declined. Yuan then sent an admiral to assassinate Feng but the admiral tipped him off and was himself murdered. Feng then moved to [[Nanjing]], where he joined the [[National Protection War|anti-Yuan opposition]]. His name was prominently missing from the list of proposed successors in Yuan's will.

Feng then served as vice president under [[Li Yuanhong]]. During the occupation of [[Beijing]] by [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]], Feng served as acting president, a position he kept when Li formally resigned.

He was sworn in as [[president of the Republic of China]] on August 1, 1917, but his constitutionality [[Constitutional Protection Movement|was challenged]] as the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] was not reconvened to recognize it.

On August 14 China entered [[World War I]] on the side of the Allies after growing evidence of the [[German Empire]]'s support for Zhang's coup was uncovered, as well as intense lobbying by Premier [[Duan Qirui]]. He sent about 135,000 men in [[labor battalion]]s to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[German East Africa]]. Troops were sent into Russia to assist the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]] in Russia's civil war. [[Sun Yat-sen]] set up a rival government in [[Guangzhou]] during September 1917 and also declared war later that month in a failed attempt to get international recognition. Feng wanted to peacefully resolve the [[Constitutional Protection Movement|north-south conflict]], which led to Duan resigning in protest. Due to pressure from the [[Anhui clique]], he brought Duan back into the premiership. Feng finished the five-year term started by Yuan in 1913 on October 10, 1918, and died in [[Beijing]] of illness.

'''Frederic Henry Hedge''' (December 12, 1805 – August 21, 1890) was a [[New England]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister and [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].  He was a founder of the [[Transcendental Club]], originally called Hedge's Club,&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, Susan. ''American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau; Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work'' (2006). Detroit: Thorndike Press. Large print edition. {{ISBN|0-7862-9521-X}}. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  and active in the development of [[Transcendentalism]]. He was one of the foremost scholars of German literature in the United States.

==Biography==
Born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], Hedge was the son of [[Harvard University]] professor of logic and metaphysics [[Levi Hedge]].  At the age of 12, he traveled to Germany and studied music for five years under the care of [[George Bancroft]]. He then entered Harvard as a junior and graduated in 1825.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Hedge, Levi|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Hedge, Frederic Henry|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His knowledge of German was to serve him well both in hymnody — he translated Luther's "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]") into the most popular English version — and in philosophy, where it allowed him a greater familiarity with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] than most of the Americans of his day.

After graduating as valedictorian, he enrolled in [[Harvard Divinity School]], where he met his intimate friend [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. After graduating from the Divinity School in 1828, Hedge was ordained as a Unitarian minister in 1829, and became minister at a Unitarian church in West Cambridge.  In 1835 he took charge of a church in [[Bangor, Maine]]; in 1850, after spending a year in Europe, he became pastor of the Westminster Church in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and in 1856 of the church in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

He was central to the development of Transcendentalism in the 1830s. On September 8, 1836, Hedge met with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Putnam (minister)|George Putnam]] (1807-1878), and [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] in Cambridge to discuss the formation of a new club.&lt;ref name=Packer47&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 47. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven days later,  Ripley hosted their first official meeting at his house on September 18, 1836; the group would eventually be known as the [[Transcendental Club]]. Its first official meeting was attended by [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Orestes Brownson]], [[James Freeman Clarke]], and [[Convers Francis]] as well as Hedge, Emerson, and Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, Barry. ''The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004: 23. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future members would include [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[William Henry Channing]], [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]], [[Sylvester Judd]], and [[Jones Very]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7–8. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group planned its meetings for times when Hedge was visiting from [[Bangor, Maine]], leading to the early nickname "Hedge's Club".&lt;ref name=Packer47/&gt; Hedge wrote: "There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women", earning the nickname "the brotherhood of the 'Like-Minded'".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 5. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became alienated from the group's more extreme positions in the 1840s and did not publish in the Transcendental journal ''[[The Dial]]'', despite his friendship with its editor [[Margaret Fuller]], saying he did not want to be associated with the movement in print.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 115. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was noted as a public lecturer as well as a pulpit orator. In 1853-1854, he lectured on [[middle ages|medieval]] history before the [[Lowell Institute]].&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

In 1858, Hedge returned to Harvard Divinity School as a professor of ecclesiastical history; that year, he also became editor of the ''[[Christian Examiner]]'', a role he held for three years.&lt;ref name=Packer168&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 168. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Hedge began a four-year term as president of the [[American Unitarian Association]].&lt;ref name=Packer168/&gt; In 1872, he resigned his pastorship in Brookline to become professor of [[German literature]] at Harvard.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; He retained this position until 1881.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; Deeply read in philosophy, ecclesiastical history, and German literature, he ranked as perhaps the foremost German literary scholar in the United States.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Hedge, Frederic Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Besides essays on the different schools of philosophy, notably magazine articles on [[St. Augustine]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], and other contributions to periodicals in prose and poetry, he published:&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

* ''The Prose Writers of Germany'', extracts and biographical sketches (Philadelphia, 1848)
* ''A Christian Liturgy for the Use of the Church'' (Boston, 1856)
* ''Reason in Religion'' (Boston, 1865)
* ''The Primeval World of Hebrew Tradition'' (1870)
* ''Hours with German Classics'' (1886)
* ''Metrical Translations and Poems'' (with [[Annis Lee Wister]]; Boston, 1888)
* ''Martin Luther and Other Essays'' (1888)

He also wrote hymns for the Unitarian church, and assisted in the compilation of a hymn-book (1853), and published numerous translations from the German poets. He translated Martin Luther's A Mighty Fortress is Our God into English from German.

==Legacy==
His chief significance to American thought was his introduction of German scholarship and literature.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

[[Count]] '''Henry III of Nassau-Dillenburg-Dietz''' (12 January 1483, [[Siegen]] – 14 September 1538, [[Breda]]), [[Lord]] (from 1530 [[Baron]]) of [[Breda]], Lord of the [[Lek (manor)|Lek]], of [[Diez, Germany|Dietz]], etc. was a count of the [[House of Nassau]].

He was the son of Count [[John V of Nassau-Dillenburg]] and [[Elisabeth of Hesse-Marburg]].{{sfn|Guenther|1995|p=5}} His younger brother was [[William I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg]] (the father of [[William the Silent]]).

==Career==
In 1499 Henry's uncle, count [[Engelbert II of Nassau-Breda|Engelbert II]], invited Henry to the [[Seventeen Provinces|Burgundian Netherlands]] as his heir.{{sfn|Guenther|1995|p=5}} He travelled with [[Philip the Handsome]] to [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in 1501-1503. Upon the death of his uncle in 1504 Henry inherited the Nassau possessions in the Netherlands, including the wealthy lordship of [[Breda]] in the [[duchy of Brabant]]. The next year he was chosen a [[knight of the Golden Fleece]]. He again travelled to [[Spain]] in 1505-1506. He became a close confidant of the young [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] as well as his [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] (1510), becoming his Upper Chamberlain upon the death of [[William de Croÿ|William of Croÿ-Chièvres]] in 1521. The good relations between Charles and Henry is evident in the fact that Charles did not name a new Upper Chamberlain after Henry's death. Henry was named [[Grand Huntsman of Brabant]], a position at court he held until the end of his life.

In 1519 he was part of the delegation that had Charles chosen [[king of the Romans]]. He was also prominently present at Charles' coronation to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] in [[Bologna]] in 1530. He was a member of the [[Privy Council]] of Charles since 1515 and of the Privy Council of Archduchess [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] between 1525-1526. He temporarily served as [[Stadtholder]] of the conquered parts of [[Guelders]] and was Stadtholder of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]] between 1515 and 1521. Henry was again in Spain between 1522 and 1530 (accompanying Charles) and in 1533-1534 (with his wife and son).

==Military commander==
Henry served as an important military commander in the Netherlands, defending [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] from [[Guelders]] in 1508. He was [[Captain General]] in the war with Guelders between 1511 and 1513, and fought with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]] against [[France]] until 1514, participating in the [[Battle of Guinegate (1513)|battle of Guinegate]] (1513). He again commanded the armies against Guelders and [[France]] between 1516 and 1521, defeating the [[Black Band (landsknechts)|Black Band]], which was in the employ of [[Charles of Guelders]], in 1518 and defeating [[Robert van der Marck]], Lord of [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] in 1521. He also repelled [[Francis I of France]], who invaded [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] that same year. Subsequently Henry conquered [[Tournai]].

==Beliefs==
Although Henry, who attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, was at first not averse to [[Martin Luther]] and his [[Lutheranism|teachings]], he later followed Charles' example and remained a staunch [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]. He didn't approve of the choice of his brother William, who did become a Lutheran, but remained supportive of him throughout his life. He was very impressed with the [[Renaissance]] and especially its arts, examples of which he encountered on his journeys to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. For example, he commissioned Italian [[architect]] [[Tommaso Vincidor|Tomasso Vincidor da Bologna]] to completely rebuild his [[castle]] at Breda in a renaissance style in 1536, one of the first of such buildings north of the [[Alps]]. However, his interests seem to have been superficial. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] only considered him a "[[Platonic love|platonic]] friend of science".

==Family life and death==

Henry married three times:
*On 3 August 1503 Henry III married firstly [[Louise-Françoise of Savoy]] (° bef. 1486 - † 17 September 1511).{{sfn|Guenther|1995|p=5}} They had no children.
*In May 1515 Henry III married secondly [[Claudia of Châlon]] (° 1498 – † 31 May 1521).{{sfn|Guenther|1995|p=5}} They had one son, [[René of Châlon]] (° 5 February 1519 - † 18 July 1544), who became [[prince of Orange]] in 1530 on the death of Claudia's brother [[Philibert of Châlon|Philibert]].
*On 26 June 1524 Henry III married thirdly [[Mencía de Mendoza|Mencia de Mendoza y Fonseca]] (° 30 November 1508 – † 4 January 1554).{{sfn|Guenther|1995|p=5}} They had one son, born in March 1527, who lived only a few hours.

Henry had no further legitimate children, although he is known to have had some illegitimate offspring, amongst them [[Nassau-Corroy|Alexis of Nassau-Corroy]] and Isabelle of Nassau, both legitimised after the death of their father, and both had an impressive descendance. One of his descendants is [[Philippe François de Berghes, 1st Prince of Grimberghen]].

His third marriage to Mencia de Mendoza y Fonseca was mainly encouraged by Charles V, as part of his plan to make the nobility of [[Spain]] and the [[Seventeen Provinces|Low Countries]] mix. Henry was however never really liked by the Spaniards, who regarded him as a loud and barbarian [[German people|German]] [[parvenu]]. Upon his death in 1538 he was succeeded by his only son, but René was himself slain in battle only a few years later in 1544. Henry lies buried beneath the grave monument he had erected for his uncle Engelbert in the {{lang|nl|[[Grote kerk (Breda)|Grote kerk]]}} at Breda.

Prior to that, in the late 1970s he was a [[bassist]] for the band [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]]. In 1989, Johnson's debut solo album, ''[[Blast (album)|Blast]]'', reached number one in the [[UK albums chart]]. Two singles from the album – "[[Love Train (Holly Johnson song)|Love Train]]" and "[[Americanos]]" – reached the top 5 of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In the 1990s he also embarked on writing, painting, and printmaking careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollyjohnson.com/dispatch/?page_id=43|title=strip4.jpg|work=HOLLY JOHNSON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{onesource|section|date=May 2017}}
William (Holly) Johnson was born on 9 February 1960 in [[Liverpool]] to Eric and Pat (née McGlouchlin) Johnson. Johnson was the third of four children and was nicknamed Billy as a child. He started his education in Liverpool at St Mary's Church of England primary school and at age eleven went to the [[Liverpool Collegiate School|Liverpool Collegiate School]] in Everton. At fourteen, Johnson took on the name Holly, inspired by actress [[Holly Woodlawn]], a friend of Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=561|title=Frankie Say See You In Court|work=Blitz Magazine|date=August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=144|title=Frankie Say Come Again|work=Uncut Magazine|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second year at the Liverpool Collegiate, Johnson and his friend were teased and nicknamed "Jolly Johnson" and "Honey Heath". The two shared an interest in [[Marc Bolan]] and [[David Bowie]]. While he attended Liverpool Collegiate, Johnson was actively involved in that city's [[punk rock]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] scene of the late 1970s. Johnson played bass with the local band [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]] and also released two solo singles on the [[Eric's Club|Eric's]] label. Both "Yankee Rose" and "Hobo Joe" failed to chart, however. Johnson met his partner, Wolfgang Kuhle, in the early 1980s. 

Kuhle, Johnson's personal manager, became a successful art dealer and collected paintings by [[Duncan Grant]] and [[Vanessa Bell]]. In 1982, Johnson joined [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and he later found fame as the lead singer and lyricist of the band. In 1987, tension grew between Johnson and the rest of his group. He also had an argument with his record company and won a case in court against them on restraint of trade. He left Frankie Goes To Hollywood and the other members of the band were eventually let go by the label after the court case ''ZTT and Perfect Songs v Holly Johnson''.{{cn|date=October 2017}}  

In 1991, Johnson was diagnosed with [[HIV]] and wrote an autobiography, ''A Bone In My Flute''; he did not expect to live much longer. Johnson remained creative working as a painter and printmaker and writing songs until 1994 when he returned to performing music occasionally. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous bands from Liverpool: Frankie Goes to Hollywood|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/music/unsigned/famous.shtml#frankie|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Johnson's paintings appears as the cover to the [[Kirsty MacColl]] single "Angel".

==Frankie Goes to Hollywood==
{{main|Frankie Goes to Hollywood}}
After gaining some measure of local celebrity from being a member of Big In Japan, Johnson became involved with a group of younger musicians who together would become the nucleus of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Johnson himself named the new band&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''A Bone In My Flute'' (autobiography)&lt;/ref&gt; after seeing the headline of an article about Frank Sinatra. This new band quickly gained a reputation for their stage show which had strong SM overtones. It was during this period that guitarist Brian Nash and backing vocalist Paul Rutherford completed the band's established line up.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Commercial success and fame==
{{moresources|section|date=May 2017}}
After the band's reputation grew large enough to attract record company interest, they were eventually signed to a new record company, ZTT. Johnson became exposed to the general public via the phenomenal success of their debut single Relax, which was a huge, and controversial, hit in 1984. After such success during 1984, when the band spent nearly four months at the top of the singles chart, Johnson was firmly established as a household name. By autumn 1986, his star had faded considerably. Frankie Goes to Hollywood had not released any material since early 1985 and were absent from that year's Live Aid event. 

In addition, he did not perform on the successful charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas" by Band Aid in December 1984. By 1987 his relationship with the rest of the band had broken down irretrievably, not helped by his decision to gain legal rights to exclusive use of the band's name, without consultation with other members.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The UK Intellectual Property Office ruled against Mr Johnson, however, and during a reunion on the TV show ''Bands Reunited'' many years later, refused to perform with them but did not rule out a future possibility. In his own words; "If it happens, we do it properly. We have a reputation. I'm not a wedding singer!"&lt;ref&gt;''Bands Reunited'': "Frankie Goes To Hollywood" (episode)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solo career and later projects==
{{moresources|section|date=May 2017}}
Johnson left Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1987 because of disagreements regarding their musical direction. He became the subject of an [[injunction]] from the group's record company, [[ZTT Records]], and its sister publishing company, [[Perfect Songs]], which cited a [[breach of contract|breach]] of his prior recording and publishing contracts, thus barring him from pursuing a solo career with any other new label.&lt;ref name="Southall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Southall|first=Brian|title=Pop Goes to Court|year=2008|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]], London, UK|pages=114–21|isbn=978-1-84772-113-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He embarked on a two-year legal battle with ZTT, the case being settled in Johnson's favour on 10 February 1988, the judge ruling that the original contracts had constituted an unreasonable [[restraint of trade]], remarking that "Mr. Johnson could be 70 years old and still be bound to this contract".&lt;ref name="Southall"/&gt;

ZTT unsuccessfully [[appeal]]ed against the judge's decision, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Appeal Court]] concluding on 26 July 1989 that the original recording and publishing contracts were "not a fair bargain".&lt;ref name = "SouthallCitedp119"&gt;Cited in Southall (2008), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The result represented a landmark legal outcome, contemporary press reports stating that the result "set a legal precedent which rocked the music business", adding that ZTT had by this time released most of its artists from their original contracts.&lt;ref name="Southall"/&gt;

Johnson's relationship with ZTT owners [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Jill Sinclair]] broke down irretrievably due to the court case: "They, [Horn and Sinclair] have never really forgiven me for winning my freedom in the law courts", the singer said in 2001, adding that the worst part of being in FGTH was "the contract we signed with ZTT."&lt;ref name="Southall"/&gt;

In 1989, Johnson finally made his first solo debut with the album ''[[Blast (album)|Blast]]'', for [[MCA Records]]. Singles "[[Love Train (Holly Johnson song)|Love Train]]", "[[Americanos]]" and "[[Atomic City (song)|Atomic City]]" met with warm reception, the former two both charting in the UK's top 5. Johnson took part in a charity project for the [[Hillsborough disaster]] fund and recorded a popular single "[[Ferry Cross the Mersey]]" with [[Paul McCartney]], [[The Christians (band)|the Christians]] and others. The single reached number 1 in the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1989-06-10|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1990 [[remix album]] ''[[Hollelujah]]'', Johnson released his second solo album in 1991. ''[[Dreams That Money Can't Buy]]'' was a commercial failure and did not chart in the UK, while the singles "[[Where Has Love Gone? (song)|Where Has Love Gone?]]" and "[[Across the Universe (Holly Johnson song)|Across the Universe]]" performed very poorly on UK singles chart. In November 1991, Johnson learned that he was [[HIV]] [[HIV-positive people|positive]]. This triggered a temporary withdrawal from the music business and public life in general, with one of his last TV performances around the time being at the Diamond Record Awards, [[Antwerp]], where he performed "Americanos" and "Where Has Love Gone?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ju6ytP5z4|title=Holly Johnson - 'Americanos' - Diamond Record Awards 1991|publisher=YouTube|date=7 November 2009|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His HIV status was made public during an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in April 1993.&lt;ref name="Southall"/&gt;

In March 1994, Johnson's critically acclaimed autobiography ''A Bone in My Flute'' was published, in which he discusses his struggle with, and acceptance of, his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22holly%20johnson%22%20openly%20gay&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=%22holly%20johnson%22%20openly%20gay&amp;f=false|title=The Advocate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xk4PDUiJ_fsC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22holly%20johnson%22%20comes%20out&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=%22holly%20johnson%22%20comes%20out&amp;f=false|title=Queer Noises|publisher=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TF0Y4uACdMkC&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=%22holly%20johnson%22%20openly%20gay&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q=%22holly%20johnson%22%20openly%20gay&amp;f=false|title=Queers in History|publisher=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he recorded a new single, "[[Legendary Children (song)|Legendary Children (All of Them Queer)]]", whose lyrics referred to famous LGBT people throughout history. During 1994, he performed live at London's Gay Pride show, where he performed "Relax", "Legendary Children" and "The Power of Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXAWWGENWg|title=Holly Johnson @ Gay Pride London 1994 Relax|publisher=YouTube|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month Holly Johnson featured on and co-wrote the single  "Love and Hate"  by Ryuichi Sakamoto (from his Sweet Revenge album)

In April 1998, he performed "The Power of Love" live at the Easter Gay Happening in [[Krefeld]], Germany at Club Königsburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxRHXSgdcA0|title=Holly Johnson - The Power Of Love @ Gay Happening 1998, Königsburg Krefeld|publisher=YouTube|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1990s, Johnson has worked primarily as a painter. His works have been exhibited at the [[Tate Liverpool]] and the [[Royal Academy]]. He has contributed to ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'' and the Paul Smith-sponsored ''Carlos'' magazine. He made a musical comeback in 1999, with a self-released album called ''[[Soulstream (Holly Johnson album)|Soulstream]]'', preceded by the 1998 promo only single "[[Hallelujah! (Holly Johnson song)|Hallelujah!]]". The video for the first available single "[[Disco Heaven]]" featured a cameo performance from [[Boy George]]. However, the album passed fairly unnoticed and didn't chart. The only charting single from ''Soulstream'' was a new version of "[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)#Holly Johnson version (1999)|The Power of Love]]". For the release of ''Soulstream'', Johnson appeared on the Jools Holland Show performing "The Power of Love" and performed the song again in 2004 for ZDF Love Songs.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAH7pUUPtjA|title=Holly Johnson - The Power Of Love (Live on ZDF Love Songs 2004)|date=12 January 2010|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Johnson presented an hour-long show "In the Beginning" on BBC Radio 2 about [[the Beatles]], whilst he also appeared in the new video for Frankie Goes to Hollywood's "Relax" as the DJ. Since then, he has performed ''The Power of Love'' twice in Germany, also performing the song at the opening of Life Ball 2011 in [[Vienna]]. In an interview at the Q Awards, Johnson announced plans for an album of new material. In 2010, Johnson performed "Americanos" on German TV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqPUy4Ok2mU|title=Holly Johnson - Americanos 2010|publisher=YouTube|date=6 July 2010|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Relax" on French TV. During February 2011, Johnson joined [[Jools Holland]] and his band for a version of [[The Animals|the Animals']] "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]" song, a track that Johnson covered on his ''Soulstream'' album. In August 2011, he performed a full set live at the Rewind Festival, using a mix of Frankie Goes to Hollywood songs together with some of his solo hits "Americanos", "Heaven's Here" and "Love Train".

In May 2014, Johnson announced his first UK solo tour, named "Dancing with No Fear". The seven-date tour was preceded by a new solo album, released on 15 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollyjohnson.com/dispatch/?p=35672|title=Announces ‘Dancing With No Fear’ Solo Uk Tour: Unleashed From The Pleasuredome|publisher=Holly Johnson|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, titled ''[[Europa (Holly Johnson album)|Europa]]'', was preceded by a lead single, "Follow Your Heart".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15577-holly-johnson-announces-new-album-europa-follow-your-heart|title=LISTEN: Holly Johnson - Follow Your Heart|publisher=The Quietus|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second single from ''Europa'', "In And Out Of Love", was released on 4 September 2014 with a special pop promo directed by [[Chris Shepherd]].&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; In October 2014 ''[[Europa (Holly Johnson album)|Europa]]'' entered the UK Album Chart at # 63, becoming Johnson's first album to chart in the UK since his debut ''[[Blast (album)|Blast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/albums-chart/ |title=Official Albums Chart Top 100|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131020181851/http://www.officialcharts.com/albums-chart|archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Johnson released a live album, only available as merchandise during the tour and his website titled ''[[Unleashed From the Pleasuredome]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Holly-Johnson-Unleashed-From-The-Pleasuredome-Holly-Johnson-Live/release/6410560|title=Holly Johnson - Unleashed From The Pleasuredome (Holly Johnson Live)|website=Discogs|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Johnson co-wrote a song with [[Gary Barlow]] for the film ''Eddie The Eagle''. The song "Ascension" was released in March 2016 as the focus track for the album Fly (songs inspired by the film Eddie The Eagle) and appears on the end credits for the film. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollyjohnson.rocks/ascension-the-new-single-from-holly-johnson|title=‘Ascension’ the new single from Holly Johnson - HOLLY JOHNSON|website=www.hollyjohnson.rocks|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Elizabeth Conklin''' (July 7, 1831 - 19 December 1914) was a 19th-century American poet and religious writer from [[New York (state)|New York]]. For three years, she served as president of the [[Woman's Relief Corps]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. She enjoyed a reputation as an [[elocutionist]]; and was the author of three volumes of poetry. She was born and died in [[Utica, New York]].

==Early years and education==
Jane Elizabeth Dexter's great-grandfather, Gregor (or George) Grant), chieftain of [[Clan Grant]], from [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy, Scotland]], came to the United States in 1774. He joined the [[Continental Army]] and served during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Dexter's mother was the daughter of William W. Williams, an architect of [[Albany, New York]]. Dexter's father was born in [[Paris, New York]], his parents having removed to that town from [[Mansfield, Connecticut]] in the latter part of the 18th century.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=198-99}}

Conklin was born in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and received her education in the Utica Female Academy and in Mrs. Brinkerhof's School for Young Ladies in Albany. Her first composition was written in verse. When she was 14 years old, her poems were first published, and after that time, she wrote continuously.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=198-99}}

==Career==
While none of her poems were strictly [[hymn]]s, many of them were sung in religious meetings. She was, for many years, a contributor to the Utica ''Gospel Messenger''. She also wrote prose and poetry for a [[New York City]] weekly, and for several local papers. In 1884, she published a book of poems, which was favorably received. In 1897, she was preparing a second volume of poems,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=198-99}} ultimately publishing three books of poetry in total. Conklin was also remembered as an elocutionist.{{sfn|Herringshaw|1904|p=242}}{{sfn|Herman|Tal|1984|p=411}}

==Personal life==
In December, 1865, she married Cramer H. Conklin, a veteran of the [[American Civil War]], and they subsequently lived in [[Binghamton, New York]]. Conklin took great interest in the American Civil War and in the defenders of the Republic.

When the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] post to which her husband belonged formed a Relief Corps of wives and daughters, she was one of the first to sign a call for a charter. Shortly after the Corps was organized, she was elected its president, and for three years, she held that office.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=198-99}} Conklin died at her home in Utica on December 19, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Jane E.D.

[[Image:John Leak Springston, 1870.JPG|right|thumb|200px|John Leak Springston, circa: 1870]]
'''John Leak Springston "Oo ne qua ti" ᎤᏁᏆᏘ (1844–1929)''', a Cherokee, is best known as an Indian activist; during his life he was a Cherokee Interpreter, Editor, Lawyer, and Keetoowah Revivalist. Springston was born in the fall of 1844 in [[Indian Territory]] near Lynch's Mill, five miles east of the present site of Spavinaw Dam in the state of Oklahoma. He was the son of Anderson Springston and Sallie Eliot, Cherokees who walked the [[Trail of Tears]] from Gunter's Landing, Alabama on the [[Tennessee River]], some 600 miles to Indian Territory. After removal, Anderson practiced law in the Cherokee courts of the Delaware and Tahlequah Districts, and as a young boy, John received instruction in [[Tribal sovereignty|tribal law]] and Cherokee culture at his father’s side.

Young Springston, who attended school in the Delaware District, was a native Cherokee speaker, and did not [[English language|learn English]] until age seven. An eloquent speaker and writer, he was employed as a clerk and [[court reporter]] in the Saline District by the age of fifteen and planned to pursue a law degree at [[Shurtleff College]] at [[Alton, Illinois]]. Before he could realize his goals, however, Indian Territory became embroiled in the Civil War, and in response, he volunteered for service in the Union Army. As a member of the Third Regiment, Company I, [[Indian Home Guard]]s under the leadership of Colonel William A. Phillips and the command of Captain Whitecatcher, he spent his entire [[tour of duty]] in and around the Spavinaw vicinity. With Company I, he engaged in two major battles in the region, at Cabin Creek near Vinita and at Honey Springs near Muskogee, yet because of his significant bilingual skills and legal experience, his superiors assigned him to the post of Acting Interpreter at Fort Gibson.

In the postwar years, Springston accepted employment as translator and [[Editing|associate editor]] of the weekly Cherokee Advocate, published at Tahlequah. In this capacity, he worked as an associate of William P. Boudinot, [[William P. Ross]], and other prominent Cherokees whose influence did much to shape his developing [[Ideologies of parties|political ideology]]. His editorial and linguistic capabilities soon attracted the attention of Cherokee tribal officials who offered him the position of Secretary to the Principal Chief and official Executive Translator. His new post afforded him special access to all transactions between the [[Cherokee|Cherokee Nation]] and the federal government, and helped to expand his knowledge about the inner workings of government.

In 1867, Springston married Sarah Eliza Moseley, a Cherokee, with whom he had two daughters, Ruth and Elizabeth, however, Moseley became ill and died in 1872. In 1874, he married a second wife, Amanda Williams, in Tahlequah. His second marriage produced two more daughters, Viola and Wenona. Williams died in 1882. In 1886, he married a third time, to Alice Caroline Gray of [[North Carolina]], with whom he had his only son, William. P. Boudinot Springston.

With his traditional upbringing, Springston favored the views of those who contested [[federal intervention]] in Indian Territory. He shared their perceptions of a reinvigorated, autonomous, and independent Cherokee Nation, and worked tirelessly toward those goals for the rest of his life. He was also a staunch abolitionist. Growing increasingly agitated over the large numbers of interlopers, imposters, and frauds that had been steadily pouring into the Cherokee Nation in search of a fast dollar in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction era]], he supported a revitalization of the ancient Keetoowah Society, a nativist movement that opposed slavery and non-Cherokee interference in tribal matters. Between 1880 and 1890, this [[secret society]] was so powerful in Indian Territory, that it was able to dictate who held positions of authority within the Nation. During this period, Springston served as sheriff of the Saline District, as clerk of the Cherokee senate, and authored several volumes on Cherokee laws and treaties in both Syllabary and English.

He retired from the Advocate staff in 1886; however, he continued his interest in newspaper work by assuming editorship of the Tahlequah Morning Sun. Two years later, he accepted an important appointment as interpreter in the United States court at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], presided over by Judge Isaac C. Parker, the infamous "Hanging Judge of Indian Territory." Parker’s court had exclusive jurisdiction over criminal matters in Indian Territory.

Springston also acted as clerk of the senate and official interpreter throughout the administration of Chief Dennis Bushyhead, 1879 - 1887. Until his retirement in 1925, he continued to practice law and devoted a great deal of his time to pursuing pension claims for Indian veterans of the Civil War and the [[Spanish–American War]].

For some years, the Springston family made their home in Sallisaw where John constructed a large home near the [[Kansas City Southern Railway|Kansas City Southern Railroad]] station. This home, known as the Springston House, later housed the first public school in Sallisaw.

After his third marriage, Springston moved to Vian, where he became one of the principal founders of that town. He spent his declining years with his son in Tulsa, where he died in 1929 at the age of eighty-four years. William. P. Boudinot Springston, his son, donated Springston's important papers to the Oklahoma Historical Society, the [[Gilcrease Museum]], and University of Oklahoma’s Western History Collections for preservation.

'''Arshak Gavafian''', better known by his ''[[nom de guerre]]'' '''Keri''' (1858 &amp;ndash; 15 May 1916), was an [[Armenia]]n [[fedayee]] military commander and member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Antranig Chalabian, General Andranik and the Armenian Revolutionary Movement - Page 583&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Arshak Gavafian was born in [[Erzurum]]. He graduated from the local Armenian school. Gavafian had soon taken part in Armenian resistance activity. In 1895, during the [[Hamidian massacres]] in Erzurum, Gavafian led an armed group to protect Armenian people in the region and soon became their spiritual leader.&lt;ref name="KSK"&gt;K. S. Khudaverdyan, Armenian issue: Encyclopedia, 1991 - 348st; {{ISBN|5897000050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavafian moved to Sasun in 1903 and took part in the [[1904 Sasun uprising]]. After moving to [[Vaspurakan]], he was one of the organizers of the Armenian self-defense of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] (in particular, [[Angeghakot]]) during the [[Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–07|Armenian–Tatar massacres]].&lt;ref name="KSK" /&gt; In the following years he took part in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] from 1908 to 1912 and was an associate of [[Yeprem Khan]]. After Yeprem's death, Gavafian had his killers liquidated in revenge and took the leadership of the Caucasian troops.
[[Image:Pervaya Armyanskaya Drujina 4 battalion 1914.png|200px|thumb|4th Armenian battalion]]
After the declaration of the [[First World War]], Keri became the commander of the [[Armenian volunteer units|4th Armenian volunteer battalion]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in 1914. Keri led the volunteer unit in the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] at the Barduz pass.&lt;ref name="MOL"&gt;Museum of Learning. Explore a Virtual Museum of Knowledge, [http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Arshak_Gafavian Arshak Gafavian]&lt;/ref&gt; Victory was largely determined by the courage of the Armenian soldiers and military genius of Keri, who relieved the besieged Russian and Armenian troops at [[Rowanduz]] in 1916.

{{quotation|The battle of Sarikamish, which the British press boomed as an enormous Russian success, was absolutely won by the courage and determination of the Armenian soldiers in the Russian army, and by the military genius of Arshak Gavafian (familiarly known as Keri), whose gallant life was lost in the battle of Rowanduz, where he inflicted another heavy defeat on the Turks and saved the situation. If it were not for Keri and Armenian soldiers, the Sarikamish battle would have been lost, and the Turkish army would have reached [[Tiflis]]. - [[Diana Abgar]], ''On the Cross of Europe's Imperialism, Armenia Crucified''&lt;ref&gt;Apcar Diana Agabeg, ''On the Cross of Europe's Imperialism, Armenia Crucified'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009 - 57-58(124) {{ISBN|1110748396}}, 9781110748396&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1916, on his way to [[Mosul]] from Rowanduz, Keri and his detachment were surrounded and, while trying to get out, he was killed in battle. After his death, his body was transferred to [[Tiflis]] and buried within the [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi|Armenian Khojivank cemetery]].&lt;ref name="MOL" /&gt;

As a child, Fay and her twin sister marched in "Band of Hope" temperance parades.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=3453423&amp;fcfToken=2b485152752b69352b4f7966394965726f444c6b78472b366542352b356c475350747144316366564e663071346b2b77647378444f5672623563356c68457a71|title=Mrs. Claude De Van Watts: Alcohol is an Anathema to Her|last=Forbes|first=Virginia|date=December 19, 1948|work=|publisher=Sunday American-Statesman|page=55|access-date=2016-09-04|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Fay was a teenager, the family, which by then included a third daughter, moved from Massachusetts to [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She began calling herself Laura, which she felt was a more dignified name than Lala.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fay graduated from Sam Houston State Normal College and became a teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On August 18, 1902, Fay married Major Claude De Van Watts, a veteran of the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwa82|title=WATTS, LALA FAY|last=McArthur|first=Judith N.|date=June 15, 2010|website=|publisher=Texas State Historical Society|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The couple had two children, one boy and one girl.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Activism ==
It was through being a mother that Watts became involved in activism. As a member of the [[Dallas Mothers Counsel]], she asked the mayor of Dallas to put a woman on the welfare board. When he refused and suggested Watts go home and raise her family instead, she became an active suffragette.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

From 1917 to 1919 Watts served as President of the Dallas Council of Mothers, a group affiliated with the [[Texas Congress of Mothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQtt1jFiwecC|title=Creating the New Woman: The Rise of Southern Women's Progressive Culture in Texas, 1893–1918|last=McArthur|first=Judith N.|date=January 1, 1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=9780252066795|location=|pages=108|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She also served as the first President of Dallas' [[Parent-Teacher Association]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3454177/lala_laura_fay_de_van_watts_obituary/|title=Lala Laura Fay Van De Watts – obituary notice|last=|first=|date=November 11, 1971|work=|publisher=The Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller Times|access-date=2016-09-05|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor reform ===
Watts was appointed Texas' first child welfare inspector in 1918.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth296845/m1/1002/|title=The Portable Handbook of Texas|last=Barkley|first=Roy|last2=Odintz|first2=Mark F.|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=University of North Texas Libraries|pages=989|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], child labor laws were not being strictly enforced due to the wartime labor shortage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Watts was one of a group of Children's Year activists who demanded a child welfare inspector be appointed in the state's Bureau of Labor and Statistics to rectify the problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[List of Governors of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[William P. Hobby]] agreed to appoint Watts to the position.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following her appointment, Watts moved from Dallas to [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQtt1jFiwecC|title=Creating the New Woman: The Rise of Southern Women's Progressive Culture in Texas, 1893–1918|last=McArthur|first=Judith N.|date=January 1, 1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=9780252066795|location=|pages=127|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1919, Watts was named chief of the women's division of the Texas Department of Labor. To investigate conditions of factory workers first hand, Watts secured a job sewing overalls for a salary of $3. She joined the [[Garment workers union]] and worked in the factory until her boss discovered she was Mrs. Claude De Van Watts and fired her. Watts reported her findings back to the [[Texas Legislature]] and recommended a series of reforms for working women and children including a mother's pension, compulsory school attendance, increased sanitation, and rest periods.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her work led to the passage of 22 laws or amendments seeking to improve the working condition of women and children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1921, newly elected Governor [[Pat Morris Neff]] ended Watts' tenure in government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Temperance ===
In the 1928 presidential election, Watts, then a leader of the Texas state [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), was an ardent [[Herbert Hoover]] supporter. Republican Hoover was considered an acceptable "dry" candidate while the Democratic nominee Al Smith supported modifying prohibition laws. She spurred WCTU members to form Democratic Hoover clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L715E0l5kQEC|title=Minnie Fisher Cunningham: A Suffragist's Life in Politics|last=McArthur|first=Judith N.|last2=Smith|first2=Harold L.|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195304862|location=|pages=139|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected state president of the WCTU in 1922, a position she would hold for 41 years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Governor [[W. Lee O'Daniel]] nominated Watts to the state Liquor Control Board. The Senate did not confirm her to the position.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Watts had three grandchildren, two boys and a girl.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Death ==
Watts died on November 8, 1971, in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], after a long illness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is buried at Oakwood Annex Cemetery in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2015-02-06/the-five-austin-public-cemeteries/|title=The Five Austin Public Cemeteries|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2015|website= [[Austin Chronicle]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4857">'''Mabel Arcondo''' (1940–1976) was a Paraguayan artist whose work is classified in the art history of Paraguay as being at the intersection between [[primitivism]] and [[surrealism]]. Her work was characterized by intense color and dream themes.

==Biography==

Mabel Arcondo was born in  [[Asunción]], Paraguay, in 1940. At the age of 17, she contracted polio and spent the remainder of her life in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name="Gallarini Sienra (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallarini Sienra|first1=Valeria|title=Dar una Vida Entregando la mía: Mabel Arcondo and Daniel Milessi|url=http://flordecamalote.blogspot.mx/2011/04/dar-una-vida-entregando-la-mia-mabel.html|website=Flor de Camalote|publisher=Flor de Camalote|accessdate=3 May 2015|language=Spanish|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mabel studied commercial art in Buenos Aires and learned the rudiments of painting from Adán Kunos in Asunción,&lt;ref name="Escobar  (2007)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Escobar|first1=Ticio|title=Mabel Arcondo|url=http://www.portalguarani.com/20_mabel_arcondo/4242_obras_de_mabel_arcondo_y_comentario_de_ticio_escobar.html|website=Portal Guarani|publisher=Editorial Servilibro|accessdate=3 May 2015|location=Asuncion, Paraguay|language=Spanish|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she was largely self-taught.&lt;ref name="Cardozo (2005)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardozo|first1=Lisandro|title=Mabel Arcondo|url=http://www.portalguarani.com/20_mabel_arcondo/1282_el_tranvia__oleo_de_mabel_arcondo.html|website=PortalGuarani|publisher=Diccionario de las Artes Visuales del Paraguay|accessdate=3 May 2015|location=Asunción, Paraguay|language=Spanish|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically her work is complex, drawing on a dream-like quality which transforms reality in the manner of [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] and using color schemes of [[fauvism]], but with an original sense of melancholy, according to [[Ticio Escobar]]. Her paintings have strong use of color, good composition and a [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] quality.&lt;ref name="Escobar  (2007)" /&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s in Paraguay, there was a flowering of local painters including Arcondo, [[Carlos Colombino]], [[Ricardo Migliorisi]], [[Ignacio Núñez Soler]], and [[Laura Márquez]], who were able to capture in their works the culture of Paraguay.&lt;ref name=Alonso&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Las Nieves Samaniego Alonso|first1=Osvalda|title=Las Artes Plásticas en Paraguay|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos97/artes-plasticas-en-paraguay/artes-plasticas-en-paraguay.shtml|website=Monografias|accessdate=3 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She began to exhibit her paintings in 1964 and has works in both private collections and the Museo Paraguayo de Arte Contemporáneo (The Paraguayan Museum of Contemporary Art).&lt;ref name="Cardozo (2005)" /&gt; Arcondo's work was seen as revolutionary, on the cusp between primitivism and surrealism.&lt;ref name=Alonso /&gt;

In the mid-1970s, Arconda began a relationship with the artist Ruben Milessi. Though doctors warned her that a pregnancy might jeopardize her health further, she gave birth to her only child, Daniel Milessi, on 3 June 1976. Soon after the birth, she died in Asunción.&lt;ref name="Gallarini Sienra (2011)" /&gt;

She is considered one of the iconic painters of Paraguay. Her works are held and shown in numerous museum collections&lt;ref name="Escobar  (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Museo del Barro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exposición "Persiana"|url=http://museodelbarro.org/exhibicion/exposicion-persiana|website=Museo del Barro|publisher=Museo del Barro|accessdate=3 May 2015|location=Asunción, Paraguay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultima Hora (2015)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Presentarán obras gráficas restauradas del Museo del Barro|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/presentaran-obras-graficas-restauradas-del-museo-del-barro-n891822.html|accessdate=3 May 2015|publisher=Ultima Hora|date=28 April 2015|location=Asunción, Paraguay|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 were part of a discussion and exhibit presented by the International Association of Art Critics Paraguay Chapter.&lt;ref name="Art Critics Tour"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conversatorio y visita guiada|url=https://circuitosacc.wordpress.com/|website=Asunción Circuitos Culturales|publisher=Asunción Circuitos Culturales|accessdate=3 May 2015|location=Asunción, Paraguay|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maggie Cogan''' is a resident of [[New York City]] who became a minor celebrity in the early 1960s when she was the first female [[horse and carriage]] driver in [[Central Park]],&lt;ref name=deseret&gt;{{cite news | title = Jupiter's Wife | author = Chris Hicks | work = Deseret News | location = Salt Lake City | date = April 16, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; working for the [[Plaza Hotel]]. She appeared in a 1967 [[Universal Studios|Universal]] [[newsreel]] with her horse and carriage, and in 1968, also appeared on quiz show [[What's My Line?]], with contestants attempting to guess her occupation.&lt;ref name=deseret /&gt;

After leaving her career briefly in the 1960s, she resumed it in 1970, befriending Lisa Ryan, the daughter of actor [[Robert Ryan]], who had also become a horse-and-carriage driver.&lt;ref name=times001&gt;{{cite news | title = `Jupiter's Wife' a Reality Check for Film Maker | author = Edward Guthmann | work = New York Times | date = November 11, 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, she had had 2 unsuccessful marriages and given birth to two sons, both of whom she gave up when her life began to unravel. In 1977, while living with Ryan, Cogan began to show signs of mental illness and she was eventually committed to a mental hospital by her parents.&lt;ref name=times001 /&gt;

Eventually, she became homeless when she left her career for good. Director [[Michel Negroponte]] discovered her living in Central Park and made the documentary film [[Jupiter's Wife]] about her.

== Early life and career ==
Cogan was raised in a town near New York City, and in [[high school]], she was an active student, participating in cheerleading and dance clubs. After graduating, she attended several colleges but never completed an undergraduate degree. At 19, she began a career with the Palace Hotel, becoming the first ever female Central Park carriage driver.&lt;ref name=deseret /&gt; In 1968, when the city announced that horse-drawn carriages would have to carry meters like [[taxicab]]s, Cogan was quoted in the associated story in the [[New York Times]], saying "Meters! It's ridiculous. In this country, they almost want to meter our minds. It'll be like Coney Island. Tawdry."&lt;ref name=times003&gt;{{cite news | title = Horse-Drawn Cabs Will Carry Meters To Regulate Rates | author = Staff | work = New York Times | date = August 26, 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collapse ==
In the late 1960s, Cogan's life began to unravel. She had two failed marriages, one of which produced two children. After showing increasing signs of being unable to cope with her failed relationships, she left her two children with her parents and moved to Texas for 4 years.  Upon returning, she was unable to reclaim her children.&lt;ref name=times001 /&gt;

Cogan began to exhibit signs of increasing mental instability in the 1970s, while living with Ryan. She developed an infatuation with Ryan's father (actor Robert Ryan) and began sending him odd gifts, such as voodoo dolls attached to love notes.&lt;ref name=times001 /&gt; In 1977, she developed an additional infatuation with serial killer [[David Berkowitz]] and in the same year was [[robbery|mugged]] on the street, with her attacker slashing her face.&lt;ref name=times001 /&gt; According to Ryan, "For the rest of the summer she barricaded herself in her bedroom and wouldn't come out."&lt;ref name=times001 /&gt;

By the end of the summer, Ryan and Cogan were scheduled to move out of their shared apartment.  Cogan's parents arrived, moved her out, and committed her to a [[mental hospital]].&lt;ref name=times001 /&gt;

== Homelessness ==
After losing her job as a carriage driver, Cogan became homeless, living most of the next 15 years in Central Park. To help herself deal with reality, she concocted vivid stories about herself, claiming that SHE was, in fact, Robert Ryan's daughter.&lt;ref name=times002&gt;{{cite news | title = Lost in the City But Found By a Camera | author = Ron Dicker | work = New York Times | date = August 13, 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also claimed to have [[Extra Sensory Perception]].&lt;ref name=times002 /&gt; However, her charm and wit helped her make friends who helped feed and clothe her during this period. She also developed a deep love for animals, adopting several dogs and living with them.

== Jupiter's Wife, obtaining housing ==
In 1989, Michel Negroponte was attempting to make a documentary about his childhood in Central Park when he encountered Cogan and decided to make the film, Jupiter's Wife, about her instead.&lt;ref name=times002 /&gt; He filmed Cogan throughout 1989 until the end of 1991, showing her with her dogs, with friends, moving around Central Park, attending a gymnastics class that was taught by one of her friends, etc.

By the end of the film, a small abandoned maintenance shack she had been living in with her dogs during the winter had been raided and demolished by police and sanitation workers. However, after being able to receive public assistance due to her mental condition, she was able to move into an apartment. The film won a special jury prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=times002 /&gt;

==After October 1995 ==
In 1995, Cogan, with her pets, was evicted from her Long Island City apartment. She moved in with friend Sara Whalen, founder and operator of Pets Alive shelter in Wallkill, NY.&lt;ref name=times999&gt;{{cite news | title = A Safe Haven for All Creatures in Need | author = Evelyn Nieves | work = New York Times | date = October 3, 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times reported that the arrangement was short lived as Cogan returned to Central Park five weeks later.&lt;ref name="nyt1031995"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/03/nyregion/our-towns-looking-back-on-pesky-geese-saved-pets-a-comeback-and-a-scam-victim.html|title=Our Towns; Looking Back on Pesky Geese, Saved Pets, a Comeback and a Scam Victim|last=Nieves|first=Evelyn|date=3 January 1996|work=New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikhail Nikolayevich Loginov''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Никола́евич Ло́гинов}}; November 21, 1903 in village of Ivanishinskiye Gorky (now in [[Staritsky District]], [[Tver Oblast]])&amp;nbsp;– October 28, 1940 in [[Miskhor]], [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean ASSR]]) was a prominent [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designer of anti-tank, air-defense, and other types of artillery, widely used during [[World War II]].

Being a chief of the designer bureau of 8th Kalinin Artillery plant in [[Korolyov (city)|Kaliningrad]] ([[Moscow Oblast]]), he created, among others, [[45-mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K)]], [[76-mm air-defense gun M1938]], [[37-mm air-defense gun M1939 (61-K)]], [[85-mm air-defense gun M1939 (52-K)]], [[25 mm automatic air defense gun M1940 (72-K)]].

For his achievements he was rewarded with [[Order of the Red Star]] (1937), [[Order of Lenin]] (1939), and [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] (1941, after his death).

He frequently served as a judge at international exhibitions and in 1966 was invited to sign the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]];&lt;ref name=bpt/&gt; Bojanowicz was one of very few professional philatelists to be accorded this honour.&lt;ref name=gsm1966&gt;''Gibbons Stamp Monthly'', May 1966, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Bojanowicz was born in Yugoslavia and as a child moved with his parents to Poland.&lt;ref name=gibbons/&gt; He was of Bosnian origin, his original name was Miroslav Bojanović which was polonised to Mirosław Bojanowicz.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076781/00019/6j The Post Rider, No 19, Nov 1986, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war he collected [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for which he won a gold medal in Warsaw in 1936. He later expanded this collection to the whole of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=bpt&gt;[http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/bpt/whowaswho/whowaswho-b.htm British Philatelic Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

== After World War II ==
After the war he formed a collection of the [[postal history]] and stamps of Poland for the period 1938 to 1946 which, in 1966, he donated to the [[British Museum]] (now the British Library). This collection includes Łodz ghetto post, underground posts, Warsaw Scout post, Polish government in exile, prisoner of war mail and Polish Free Forces mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/philatelic/philateliccollections/collectionsoverview/collectionscountry/philcollectionscountry.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland number one ==
He specialised in [[Postage stamps and postal history of Poland#First Polish stamp|Poland No 1]] and probably had one of the largest collection of this stamp in the world. This collection comprised some 1,500 copies of the stamp, over 300 covers and about 600 documents from this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filatelistyka.org/pages/entries/0000000205.html Filatelistyka]&lt;/ref&gt;  He started this collection in 1952.&lt;ref name=pearson&gt;P C Pearson (Chairman of Publications Committee of The Royal London Philatelic Society), in the Foreword of ''The Kingdom of Poland: Poland No 1 and associated Postal History'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of ''The Kingdom of Poland: Poland No 1 and associated Postal History'' (1979).

==Donation==
In 1966 Bojanowicz donated an important collection of Polish stamps and postal history of 1938-1946 to the [[British Library Philatelic Collections]] where it forms the [[Bojanowicz Collection]] and complements the [[Kaluski Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/philatelic/philateliccollections/collectionsoverview/collectionscountry/philcollectionscountry.html The Bojanowicz Collection] British Library Philatelic Collections.

*1961 Grand Prix of the President of Italy at the Merano International Exhibition&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt;

'''Onorato Caetani''' (17 December 1742 - 26 June 1797) was an Italian scholar who was Principal of the Accademia degli Incolti in Rome in 1762. The academy was an institution founded by the Nazareno College originally dedicated to promoting a coherent balanced education. &lt;ref&gt; (In Italian){{cite book|title=CAETANI, Onorato|first=Luigi|last=Fiorani|volume=16|date=1973}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Onorato was a younger son of Michaelangelo Caetani, [[Duke of Sermoneta]], of the noble Caetani family. He studied the classics at tne Nazareno College in addition to mathematics, physics and foreign languages and in 1764 graduated from the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. He chose to follow an ecclesiastic career but never completed his studies. He was nevertheless appointed abbot of [[Valvisciolo Abbey]]. Between 1765 and 1772 he was Regent of the chancellery and in the latter year Pope Clement XIV named him a non-participating apostolic protonotary.

Between 1775 and 1785 he worked to create a large library in the family home. He attended cultural meetings and was a member of various academic societies. He commissioned the Swiss painter [[Angelika Kauffmann]] to paint two canvasses on subjects inspired by episodes of the novel ''[[The Adventures of Telemachus]]'' by [[François Fénelon]]. The resulting paintings are ''[[The Sorrow of Telemachus]]''  and ''[[Telemachus and the Nymphs of Calypso]]'', both now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

The younger Bowlen became wealthy in his own right by becoming a successful lawyer in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. He also worked as an executive for his father's company and as a real estate developer and had major investments in the mining industry.

Bowlen is an initiated member of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] International Fraternity. He was initiated by the University of Oklahoma, Beta Omicron chapter in 1963. He is a member of the bar association and law society of [[Alberta, Canada]]. Bowlen is also one of the largest donors to the [[University of Denver]].

==Denver Broncos ownership==
From 1999 to 2008, Bowlen and the Broncos were involved in several legal battles against one-time owner Edgar Kaiser. In 1998, Bowlen agreed to sell retired football legend [[John Elway]] a share in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Prendergast |first=Alan |date=3 January 2002 |title=Pat's Big Fumble |url=http://www.westword.com/2002-01-03/news/pat-s-big-fumble/full/ |newspaper=[[Westword]] |location=Denver, Colorado |accessdate=23 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bowlen let the existence of the offer slip out to Kaiser while both were at the 1999 [[Bohemian Grove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Branch |first=John |date=15 September 2002 |title=Lawsuit threatens Bowlen/ Former owner Kaiser accuses Broncos boss of violating pact |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-2731823.html |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]] |location=Colorado Springs, Colorado |accessdate=23 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiser sued, claiming a breach of contract. Kaiser asserted that he had a right of first refusal if any deal is made involving franchise ownership. In 2004, a jury ruled in favor of Kaiser and a federal judge decreed that Kaiser was entitled to purchase back 10% of the Broncos using the identical purchase terms offered to Elway. Bowlen appealed the original verdict that ruled in favor of Kaiser and won in 2008, as the appellate court ruled that the structure of the Bowlen-Elway deal did not violate the original right of first refusal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Paton |first=James |date=2 October 2008 |title=Clock runs out for ex-Broncos owner |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/ex-broncos-owner-denied-chance-buy-back-team/ |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |location=Denver, Colorado |accessdate=23 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2008, Broncos head coach and Vice President of Football Operations [[Mike Shanahan]] was fired by Bowlen after a 14-year tenure as the head coach. Bowlen stated he wanted his team to go in a different direction. He undertook a search over two weeks and eventually chose [[Josh McDaniels]], who at the time was the offensive coordinator of the [[New England Patriots]]. Subsequently, after a losing streak in the 2010 season, McDaniels was fired as head coach of the Broncos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klis|first1=Mike|title=McDaniels fired as Broncos coach after controversy, losses pile up|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_16791509|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 2009, Bowlen appointed Brian Xanders as the team's sole general manager and fired Jim Goodman and Jeff Goodman.

Within two weeks of the end of the 2010-11 regular season, Bowlen and the Broncos had hired former [[Carolina Panthers]]' coach [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] to be their new head coach. Although Bowlen had discussions with Fox before the hiring, new front-office executive [[John Elway]] was mostly responsible for the hiring. By late 2009, rumors had begun to emerge that Bowlen had stepped out of the spotlight because of short-term memory loss.&lt;ref&gt;Sources: Pat Bowlen no longer Broncos' major decision maker amid "memory loss" questions, http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2010/11/sources_pat_bowlen_no_longer_broncos_major_decision_maker_amid_memory_loss_questions.php&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[The Denver Post]] columnist [[Woody Paige]] that his memory wasn't what it used to be and that he couldn't recall details of the Broncos back-to-back Super Bowl titles in the late 1990s. Starting in 2010, Bowlen no longer played a major role in the Broncos' decision making, and Executive VP John Elway and President Joe Ellis assumed control. On July 23, 2014, due to complications with [[Alzheimer's disease]], he officially relinquished control of the team to [[Joe Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=Health Problems Lead Owner of Broncos to Cede Control|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/sports/football/pat-bowlen-cedes-control-of-broncos-to-deal-with-alzheimers.html?_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2015, Bowlen was inducted into the Broncos' Ring of Fame, earning him a bronze plaque that stands on the south side of [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Renck, Troy |title=Broncos running game keys upset victory over Packers |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_29057530/broncos-running-game-keys-upset-victory-over-packers |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=November 1, 2015 |accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Bowlen acquired the team in 1984, the Broncos have the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the [[National Football League]] (334 wins, 212 losses, and 1 tie, for a .612 winning percentage), passing the [[San Francisco 49ers]] after the 2015 season.

==Colorado Crush ownership==
Besides being owner and CEO of the Broncos, Bowlen was also part-owner of the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]]'s [[Colorado Crush]]. He shared ownership with Denver-based sports mogul [[Stan Kroenke]] and legendary Broncos quarterback [[John Elway]]. The Crush entered the AFL as an expansion franchise in 2003. After going through a 2-14 season in 2003, the team became a perennial playoff contender and one of the league's top franchises. The Crush won the Arena Football League Championship in 2005.

==Denver Outlaws ownership==
In 2006, [[Major League Lacrosse]] decided to expand adding the [[Denver Outlaws]] to its league of teams. The Denver Outlaws have been the most winning franchise that Bowlen has ever owned, boasting a regular season win percentage of .690 since their creation. The Outlaws have been to the playoffs every year of their existence except one (2015) and advanced to the championship game eight times (2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018), winning the championship in 2014, 2016, and 2018.

==Awards and honors==

&lt;!--Please See naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, do not add details like "Dr." or "PhD"--&gt;'''David Phillip Roe''' (born July 21, 1945) is an American politician and doctor who is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|TN|1}}, serving since 2009. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is based in the [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] area in the northeastern portion of the state. In 2017, Roe became chairman of the [[House Committee on Veterans Affairs]].

== Early life, education, and career ==
Roe was born on July 21, 1945 in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]]. He graduated from [[Austin Peay State University]] in 1967 and earned his Medical Degree from the [[University of Tennessee Medical Center|University of Tennessee College of Medicine]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roe.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=43 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007035336/http://www.roe.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=43 |archivedate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from medical school, Roe served in the [[United States Army Medical Corps]], attached to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] at [[Camp Casey, South Korea]]. He was discharged as a [[major]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roe4congress.com/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926083459/http://www.roe4congress.com/about.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went into [[OB/GYN]] practice in [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], retiring after 31 years, including his work as a physician at State of Franklin Healthcare Associates (SOFHA). SOFHA was founded in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tricities.com/tri/news/election/article/phil_roe/11570/ Phil Roe biography]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from ''[[Bristol Herald Courier]]''&lt;/ref&gt; After first being elected into the U.S. House of Representatives, Roe purchased a 1.8% ownership share of State of Franklin Healthcare Associates Real Estate Partners with property holdings within the Med-Tech Regional Business Park located in the northern section of Johnson City, Tennessee.

== Political career ==
Roe was first elected to the Johnson City Commission in 2003, serving as vice mayor of Johnson City from 2003–2007 and then as mayor from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/memberdistrict/419{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Tennessee District 1 Rep.

===Elections===
;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2008#District 1|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2010#District 1}}
Roe defeated [[incumbent]] congressman [[David Davis (U.S. politician)|David Davis]] in the 2008 [[primary election|primary]] by 500 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Balloch |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/08/roe-slides-past-davis-in-1st-district-house-race/ |title=Roe slides past Davis in 1st District House race|date=August 8, 2008 |work=Knoxville News Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis blamed his loss on votes from Democrats who crossed over to vote for Roe in the open primary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volunteertv.com/home/headlines/26420129.html Rep. Davis blames Democrats for loss in GOP primary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805032327/http://www.volunteertv.com/home/headlines/26420129.html |date=August 5, 2009 }}. [[Associated Press]] via [[WVLT-TV]], August 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Roe had previously run for the seat in 2006 when 10-year incumbent [[Bill Jenkins (politician)|Bill Jenkins]] announced his retirement, but lost to Davis in that year's primary.

Roe defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Rob Russell, director of the Writing and Communication Center at [[East Tennessee State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsu.edu/academicaffairs/wcc/default.aspx ETSU Writing and Communication Center] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081001175257/http://www.etsu.edu/academicaffairs/wcc/default.aspx |date=October 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the November general election with 72 percent of the vote.  However, it was [[tantamount to election|widely presumed]] that Roe had clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary; Republicans have held the 1st District seat continuously since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859.

;2010

Roe won re-election in 2010 with 80.8% of the vote against Democrat Michael Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/2010/maps/#/House/2010/TN|title=The 2010 Results Maps |website=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
The 1st is known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington; Roe was only the eighth person to hold the seat in 88 years. 

Roe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman [[Robin Hayes]], as his chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roe hires chief of staff, will step down as Johnson City mayor |first=Hank |last=Hayes |date=December 17, 2008 |url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9010441 |work=[[Kingsport Times-News]] |accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[National Journal]]’s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nw_20100227_7237.php |title=2009 VOTE RATINGS |date=February 27, 2010 |work=National Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the [[National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress)]] into the House. The bill would authorize the [[National Desert Storm Memorial Association]] to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] or [[Operation Desert Shield]].&lt;ref name=cbo503&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 503|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45267|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roe said "I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward."&lt;ref name=roePRpass&gt;{{cite web|title=Roe Bill to Establish War Memorial Passes House of Representatives|url=http://roe.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=381365|publisher=House Office of Phil Roe|accessdate=May 29, 2014|date=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2013, [[WJHL-TV]] in Johnson City reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors under the Independent Payment Advisory Board argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were "money and greed" and because that decision by Kincaid created a "substantial risk of harm to patients," prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjhl.com/story/22467984/dr-kincaid-begs-judge-for-mercy-congressman-and-sheriff-write-letters-on-his-behalf "Dr. Kincaid begs judge for mercy, congressman and sheriff write letters on his behalf". July 12, 2013. WJHL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roe had initially promised to serve only five terms (10 years) in Congress. However, on February 6, 2018; he announced he would run for a sixth term, saying that he needed to continue the work begun when he became chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Government/2018/02/08/Roe-to-run-for-re-election|title=Roe to run for re-election|publisher=[[Johnson City Press]]|date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Richard Brothers.jpg|thumb|300px|Richard Brothers]]'''Richard Brothers''' (25 December 1757 &amp;ndash; 25 January 1824) was an early believer and teacher of [[British Israelism]], a theory concerning the [[Lost Ten Tribes]] of Israel.  

==Biography==

===Life===
Brothers was born in [[Port Kirwan, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port Kirwan]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] (earlier known as Admiral's  Cove).
He was educated in [[Woolwich]], [[England]]. He entered the [[Royal Navy]] and served under [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Keppel]] and [[George Rodney|Rodney]]. In 1783, he became lieutenant, and was honourably discharged on 28 July 1783, receiving a pension which amounted to half-pay (54 pounds per year). He then travelled on the continent of [[Europe]] and later married Elizabeth Hassall in 1786. His marriage was reported as being "unhappy" and so he returned to service in the Royal Navy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Because he came to believe that military service was not compatible with his new calling to serve [[Christianity]], in 1789 he once again left the Navy. Built upon the principle of individual revelation, Brothers believed that he could not serve the King as head of the [[Church of England]].

In 1791, he began to question the oath he had been required to take for receipt of his military half-pay, and he found himself with little income as a result of his subsequent actions. Brothers then divided his time between the open air and the workhouse, where he developed the idea that he had a special divine commission. Brothers claimed to hear the voice of an attending angel which proclaimed to him the fall of [[Babylon the Great]], which was in fact [[London]]. Apparently upon Brothers's plea for mercy, God decided to spare London for a time and the destruction was halted. Around this time, Brothers was also expectant of a heavenly lady who would descend from the clouds showering him with money, love and happiness. In February 1792 Brothers declared himself a healer and claimed he could restore sight to the blind. He drew large crowds, but not due to his healing ability as much as his small gifts of money to those he prayed for.

===Works===
[[Image:A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophesies and Times.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophesies and Times, 1794'', the most important work of Richard Brothers]]In 1793 Brothers declared himself to be the apostle of a new religion. He began to see himself as possessing a special role in the gathering of the [[Jew]]s back into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in particular, the "Jews" who were hidden amongst the population of Great Britain.  In similarity to modern [[British Israelism|British Israelists]], Brothers asserted that the "hidden Israel" had no notion of its biological lineage and that part of his role would be to teach them of their true identity and lead them to the land of [[Canaan]]. Brothers proclaimed himself to be ''Prince of the Hebrews'', literal descendant of the Biblical [[Davidic line|House of David]], and the ''Nephew of the Almighty'', who would rule over [[Israel]] until the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus Christ]].  Brothers declared he would achieve all this using a rod he had fashioned from a wild rosebush, with which he would perform miracles, as [[Moses]] had done.

All this was declared in the first [[British Israelism|British Israelist]] publication in 1794:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A REVEALED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPHECIES AND TIMES, Book the First, wrote [sic] under the direction of the LORD GOD and published by His Sacred Command, it being the first sign of Warning for the benefit of All Nations; Containing with other great and remarkable things not revealed to any other Person on Earth, the Restoration of the Hebrews to Jerusalem by the year of 1798 under their revealed Prince and Prophet (i.e., Richard Brothers). London, Printed in the year of Christ 1794.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brothers began to attract quite a following, but due to his rejection of organisational work, and eccentric nature, he did not develop any sort of social movement. In consequence of prophesying the death of the King and the end of the monarchy, he was arrested for [[treason]] in 1795, and imprisoned on the grounds of being criminally [[insane]].  His case was, however, brought before Parliament by his ardent disciple, [[Nathaniel Brassey Halhed]], an [[oriental studies|orientalist]] and a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. As a result Brothers was removed to a [[lunatic asylum|private asylum]] in [[Islington]].

While he was in the private asylum Brothers wrote a variety of prophetic pamphlets which gained him many believers. Amongst his supporters was [[William Sharp (engraver)|William Sharp, the engraver]]. Some of his political predictions (such as the violent death of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]) seemed to be proof that he was inspired. But when Brothers predicted that, on 19 November 1795 he would be revealed as ''Prince of the Hebrews'' and ''Ruler of the world'', and the date passed without any such manifestation, Sharp deserted him to become a religious follower of [[Joanna Southcott]]. His followers tended to drift away either disillusioned or embarrassed.

===Death===
Brothers spent the last 30 years of his life designing the flags, uniforms, and palaces of the [[New Jerusalem]]. John Finlayson finally secured his release from the private asylum in 1806, and Brothers moved into his London home, where he died a lonely figure on 25 January 1824. Finlayson then began a financial campaign against the Government, seeking payment of an enormous claim for his maintenance of Richard Brothers prior to his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

By this point, the company had expanded to a total of 13 cities which included [[Chicago]], [[Seattle]], and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In its March 2016 Series B funding, the company raised an additional $35 million.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It had expanded to twenty-two areas in the US, including [[Atlanta]] and [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Soothe had a total of more than 3,200 massage therapists across the nation.

As of April 2016, Soothe’s coverage area also included such cities as [[Houston]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. It had also expanded services to Canada by including [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/travel/airbnb-spas-hotels.html|title=How to Bring the Hotel Spa to Your Airbnb|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=2016-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also began servicing in Europe with [[London]] becoming the first city across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instyle.com/beauty/health-fitness/on-demand-massage-apps|title=I Might Be Addicted to On-Demand Massage Apps|last=Gould|first=Wendy Rose|date=2016-07-27|work=InStyle.com|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the company has signed-up corporate clients like [[Facebook]], [[Hulu]], and [[Microsoft]].

[[File:The Specter of Newby Church.jpg|right|350px]]
'''The Spectre of Newby Church''' (or the "Newby Monk") is the name given to an artifact found on a photograph taken in the [[Church of Christ the Consoler]], on the grounds of [[Newby Hall]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. The image was taken in 1963 by the Reverend Kenneth F. Lord.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite web | title = Real or fake? Mysterious ghost pictures investigated | publisher= news.com.au | date = September 13, 2013 | url = http://www.news.com.au/technology/real-or-fake-mysterious-ghost-pictures-investigated/story-e6frfro0-1226718211697 | accessdate = April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite news | title = World's most famous ghost pictures | newspaper = The People | pages = 4–5 | date = September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the artifact appears to resemble a human, much speculation has been had regarding what type of person might be in the image. Most speculation by believers has concluded that it resembles a 16th-century monk, with a white shroud over his face, possibly to mask leprosy or another disfigurement. Others contend that it is an accomplice in a costume.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt;

Initial claims suggested that the figure would measure at 9 feet tall, but its feet are not visible and it could easily be standing on a box, giving the impression of height.&lt;ref&gt;Bord, J. ''Ghosts''. [[David &amp; Charles]], 1974. P. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

On looking over the image, purported photographic experts{{who|date=May 2016}} have concluded that the image is not the result of double exposure, although Rick Burden, founder of the Ghost Hunters of Australia website, believes to be "probably fake." It resembles many other double exposure hoaxes.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;

The first provisional president of the [[Republic of China]], Sun was a Chinese [[medical doctor]], writer, [[philosopher]], [[Georgism|Georgist]],&lt;ref&gt;Karl Williams, "Sun Yat-sen And Georgism" https://www.prosper.org.au/about/geoists-in-history/sun-yat-sen-and-georgism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archived version: https://web.archive.org/web/20180423084916/https://www.prosper.org.au/about/geoists-in-history/sun-yat-sen-and-georgism/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]]&lt;ref&gt;Tingyou Chen, ''Chinese Calligraphy'', [[Cambridge University Press]] (2011), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; and [[revolutionary]]. As the foremost pioneer and first leader of a Republican China, Sun is referred to as the "[[Father of the Nation]]" in the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the "forerunner of democratic revolution" in the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Sun played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] (the last imperial dynasty of China) during the years leading up to the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. He was appointed to serve as Provisional President of the Republic of China when it was founded in 1912. He later co-founded the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party of China), serving as its first leader.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Benjamin Heater. [1987] (1987). Our world this century. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-913324-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun was a uniting figure in [[post-Imperial China]], and he remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]].

Although Sun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China, his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution and the Han Chinese regaining power after 268 years of living under Manchurian rule ([[Qing dynasty]]), he quickly resigned from his post as President of the newly founded Republic of China to [[Yuan Shikai]], and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the [[warlord era|warlords]] who controlled much of the nation. Sun did not live to see his party consolidate its power over the country during the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]]. His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]], [[Nanjing-Wuhan Split|split into two factions]] after his death.

Sun's chief legacy resides in his developing of the [[political philosophy]] known as the [[Three Principles of the People]]: [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]] ([[Han Chinese]] nationalism: independence from imperialist domination – taking back power from the [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] [[Qing dynasty]]), “rights of the people,” sometimes translated as “democracy,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Principles of the People|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Three-Principles-of-the-People|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people's livelihood ([[just society]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trescott|first=Paul B.|title=Jingji Xue: The History of the Introduction of Western Economic Ideas Into China, 1850–1950|year=2007|publisher=Chinese University Press|pages=46–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkJtJm9L7mQC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=%22basis+of+our+program+OR+reform%22+Leng+sun+yat+sen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jD4Er59--_&amp;sig=9w4ekTvan6dbxPqCw6uW4MIq1z8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_M0mU8b3C8jioASlvYLQAw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22basis%20of%20our%20program%20OR%20reform%22%20Leng%20sun%20yat%20sen&amp;f=false|quote='The teachings of your single-taxer, Henry George, will be the basis of our program of reform.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoppa, Keith R.

== Early years ==

=== Birthplace and early life ===
Sun Yat-sen was born on 12 November 1866 to Sun Dacheng and Madame Yang.&lt;ref name=chron-nathall /&gt; His birthplace was the village of [[Cuiheng]], [[Xiangshan County, Guangdong|Xiangshan County]] (now [[Zhongshan]] City), [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name=chron-nathall /&gt; He had a cultural background of [[Hakka]] (with roots in [[Zijin County|Zijin]], [[Heyuan]], Guangdong)&lt;ref name="作者:门杰丹"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinanews.com/n/2003-12-04/26/376869.html |script-title=zh:浓浓乡情系中原—访孙中山先生孙女孙穗芳博士 |trans-title=Interview with Dr. Sun Yat-granddaughter of Dr. Sun Suifang |language=Chinese |author=门杰丹 |work=www.chinanews.com |date=4 December 2003 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}{{Google translation|en|zh-CN|http://www.chinanews.com/n/2003-12-04/26/376869.html|Translate this Chinese article to English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]].

=== Education years ===
At the age of 10, Sun Yat-sen began seeking schooling,&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; and he met childhood friend [[Lu Haodong]].&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; By age 13 in 1878, after receiving a few years of local schooling, Sun went to live with his elder brother, [[Family tree of Sun Yat-sen|Sun Mei]] ({{lang|zh-hant|孫眉}}) in [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; Sun Mei financed Sun Yat-sen's education and would later be a major contributor for the overthrow of the Manchus.&lt;ref name="Maui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KHON2SunMei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MauiSunPark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MauiCountySunPark" /&gt;

[[File:Sun Yat Sen's family 1901.png|left|thumb|Sun Yat-sen (back row, fifth from left) and his family]]

During his stay in Honolulu, Sun Yat-sen went to [[ʻIolani School]] where he studied English, [[History of the United Kingdom|British history]], [[mathematics]], science, and Christianity.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; While he was originally unable to speak English, Sun Yat-sen quickly picked up the language and received a prize for academic achievement from [[David Kalākaua|King David Kalākaua]] before graduating in 1882.&lt;ref name="DrSenIolaniSchool"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iolani.org/wn_aboutiolani_100305_cc.htm |title= Dr. Sun Yat-Sen (class of 1882) |work= [[ʻIolani School]] website |quote=  |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185610/http://www.iolani.org/wn_aboutiolani_100305_cc.htm |archivedate= 20 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Oahu College]] (now known as [[Punahou School]]) for one semester.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Aug/16/ln/hawaii708160313.html |title= Chinatown park, statue honor Sun Yat-sen|accessdate=17 August 2007 |last=Brannon |first=John |date=16 August 2007  |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |quote=Sun graduated from Iolani School in 1882, then attended Oahu College—now known as Punahou School—for one semester.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 he was sent home to China as his brother was becoming worried that Sun Yat-sen was beginning to embrace Christianity.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt;

When he returned to China in 1883 at age 17, Sun met up with his childhood friend Lu Haodong again at Beijidian ({{lang|zh-hant|北極殿}}), a temple in Cuiheng Village.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; They saw many villagers worshipping the Beiji (literally ''[[North Pole]]'') Emperor-God in the temple, and were dissatisfied with their ancient healing methods.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; They broke the statue, incurring the wrath of fellow villagers, and escaped to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="big5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.chinanews.com:89/hb/2011/04-02/2950599.shtml |script-title=zh:基督教與近代中國革命起源:以孫中山為例 |publisher=Big5.chinanews.com:89 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028210411/http://big5.chinanews.com:89/hb/2011/04-02/2950599.shtml |archivedate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wenweipo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2011/04/02/OT1104020012.htm |script-title=zh:歷史與空間：基督教與近代中國革命的起源──以孫中山為例&amp;nbsp;– 香港文匯報 |publisher=Paper.wenweipo.com |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Hong Kong in 1883 he studied at the [[Diocesan Boys' School]], and from 1884 to 1886 he was at [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|The Government Central School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/yfoh/b5/sun_yat_sen.php |script-title=zh:中山史蹟徑一日遊 |publisher=Lcsd.gov.hk |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Sun studied medicine at the [[Guangzhou Boji Hospital]] under the Christian missionary [[John Glasgow Kerr|John G. Kerr]].&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt; Ultimately, he earned the license of Christian practice as a [[medical doctor]] from the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (the forerunner of [[University of Hong Kong|The University of Hong Kong]]) in 1892.&lt;ref name="singtao1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="book2006" /&gt; Notably, of his class of 12 students, Sun was one of only two who graduated.&lt;ref&gt;HK university.

== Religious views and Christian baptism ==
In the early 1880s, Sun Mei sent his brother to [[ʻIolani School]], which was under the supervision of British Anglicans and directed by an Anglican prelate named [[Alfred Willis]]. The language of instruction was English. Although Bishop Willis emphasized that no one was forced to accept [[Christianity]], the students were required to attend chapel on Sunday. At Iolani School, young Sun Wen first came in contact with Christianity, and it made a deep impression on him. Schriffin writes that Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's whole future political life.&lt;ref name="Sun Yat-sen and Christianity"&gt;[http://www.hsstudyc.org.hk/en/tripod_en/en_tripod_162_05.html#_ftnref2], Sun Yat-sen and Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun was later baptized in Hong Kong (on 4 May 1884) by Rev. [[Charles Robert Hager|C. R. Hager]]&lt;ref&gt;"...At present there are some seven members in the interior belonging to our mission, and two here, one I baptized last Sabbath,a young man who is attending the Government Central School. We had a very pleasant communion service yesterday..." – Hager to Clark, 5 May 1884, ABC 16.3.8: South China v.4, no.17, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...We had a pleasant communion yesterday and received one Chinaman into the church..." – Hager to Pond, 5 May 1884, ABC 16.3.8: South China v.4, no.18, p.3 postscript&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rev. C. R. Hager, 'The First Citizen of the Chinese Republic', The Medical Missionary v.22 1913, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; an American missionary of the Congregational Church of the United States ([[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|ABCFM]]) to his brother's disdain. The minister would also develop a friendship with Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bergère &amp; Lloyd|Bergère]]: 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soong, 1997 p. 151-178"&gt;Soong, (1997) p. 151-178&lt;/ref&gt; Sun attended To Tsai Church ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:zh:合一堂|道濟會堂]]}}), founded by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1888,&lt;ref name="Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum"&gt;{{citation|url=http://hk.drsunyatsen.museum/download/brochure_07_a.pdf |script-title=zh:孫中山先生史蹟徑 |trans-title=Dr Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail |language=Chinese, English |author=中西區區議會 [Central &amp; Western District Council] |work=Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum |publisher=[[Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum|Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum]] |location=Hong Kong, China |date=November 2006 |page=30 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224001159/http://hk.drsunyatsen.museum/download/brochure_07_a.pdf |archivedate=24 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while he studied Western Medicine in [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]]. Sun pictured a revolution as similar to the salvation mission of the [[Christian church]]. His conversion to Christianity was related to his revolutionary ideals and push for advancement.&lt;ref name="Soong, 1997 p. 151-178" /&gt;

In 1924 [[Liao Chongzhen]], a prominent and influential government official of the day, arranged a meeting between Sun and Martha Root, a well-known journalist and traveling teacher of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. In this meeting Sun came into contact with the Teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, expressing his appreciation for the Cause and declaring it "highly relevant to the needs of China."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During the [[Qing Dynasty]] rebellion around 1888, Sun was in Hong Kong with a group of revolutionary thinkers who were nicknamed the [[Four Bandits]] at the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]].&lt;ref name="bard"&gt;Bard, Solomon.

=== Furen and Revive China Society ===
In 1891, Sun met revolutionary friends in Hong Kong including [[Yeung Ku-wan]] who was the leader and founder of the [[Furen Literary Society]].&lt;ref name="Curthoys"&gt;Curthoys, Ann.

In 1894, Sun wrote an 8,000 character petition to Qing [[Viceroy of Zhili|Viceroy]] [[Li Hongzhang]] presenting his ideas for modernizing China.&lt;ref name="Wei"&gt;Wei, Julie Lee.

He left China for Hawaii and founded the [[Revive China Society]], which was committed to revolutionizing China's prosperity. Members were drawn mainly from Chinese expatriates, especially the lower social classes. The same month in 1894 the Furen Literary Society was merged with the Hong Kong chapter of the Revive China Society.&lt;ref name="Curthoys" /&gt; Thereafter, Sun became the secretary of the newly merged Revive China society, which Yeung Ku-wan headed as president.&lt;ref name="yang-bio"&gt;(Chinese) Yang, Bayun; Yang, Xing'an (November 2010).

=== First Sino-Japanese War ===
In 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].  There were two types of responses.  One group of intellectuals contended that the [[Manchu]] Qing government could restore its legitimacy by successfully modernizing.&lt;ref name="Bevir"&gt;Bevir, Mark. [2010] (2010).

== From uprising to exile ==
=== First Guangzhou uprising ===
[[File:Sun Yat-Sen plaque.JPG|thumb|Plaque in London marking the site of a house where Sun Yat-sen lived while in exile]]
[[File:Letter sun yat sen.PNG|thumb|Letter from Sun Yat-sen to [[James Cantlie]] announcing to him that he has assumed the Presidency of the Provisional Republican Government of China, dated 21 January 1912]]

In the second year of the establishment of the Revive China society on 26 October 1895, the group planned and launched the [[Xinhai Revolution#First Guangzhou Uprising|First Guangzhou uprising]] against the Qing in [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref name="gtong146" /&gt; [[Yeung Kui-wan]] directed the uprising starting from Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="yang-bio" /&gt; However, plans were leaked out and more than 70 members, including [[Lu Haodong]], were captured by the Qing government.  The uprising was a failure. Sun received financial support mostly from his brother who sold most of his 12,000 acres of ranch and cattle in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Maui" /&gt; Additionally, members of his family and relatives of the Sun would take refuge at the home of his brother Sun Mei at Kamaole in [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula]], [[Maui]].&lt;ref name="Maui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KHON2SunMei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MauiSunPark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MauiCountySunPark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MauiMagazine" /&gt;

=== Exile in Japan ===
Sun Yat-sen spent time living in Japan while in exile.  He befriended and was financially aided by a democratic revolutionary named [[Miyazaki Toten]]. Most Japanese who actively worked with Sun were motivated by a [[pan-Asian]] fear of encroaching [[Western imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.japanfocus.org/_Sato_Kazuo-Sun_Yat_sen_s_1911_Revolution_had_Its_Seeds_in_Tokyo |title=JapanFocus |publisher=Old.japanfocus.org |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316134631/http://old.japanfocus.org/_Sato_Kazuo-Sun_Yat_sen_s_1911_Revolution_had_Its_Seeds_in_Tokyo |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Japan, Sun also met and befriended [[Mariano Ponce]], then a diplomat of the [[First Philippine Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornber, Karen Laura. [2009] (2009). ''Empire of Texts in Motion: Chinese, Korean, and Taiwanese Transculturations of Japanese Literature''. Harvard university press. pg 404.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the [[Philippine–American War]], Sun helped Ponce procure weapons salvaged from the Imperial Japanese Army and ship the weapons to the [[Philippines]]. By helping the Philippine Republic, Sun hoped that the Filipinos would win their independence so that he could use the archipelago as a staging point of another revolution. However, as the war ended in July 1902, America emerged victorious from a bitter 3-year war against the Republic. Therefore, the Filipino dream of independence vanished with Sun's hopes of collaborating with the Philippines in his revolution in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ocampo|first1=Ambeth|title=Looking Back 2|date=2010|publisher=Anvil Publishing|location=Pasig City|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huizhou uprising in China ===
On 22 October 1900, Sun launched the [[Xinhai Revolution#Huizhou Uprising|Huizhou uprising]] to attack [[Huizhou]] and provincial authorities in Guangdong.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, James Zheng. [2009] (2009).

This time, Sun appealed to the [[Triad (organized crime)|triads]] for help.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bergère &amp; Lloyd|Bergère]]: 86&lt;/ref&gt; This uprising was also a failure.  Miyazaki, who participated in the revolt with Sun, wrote an account of this revolutionary effort under the title "33-year dream" ({{lang|zh-hant|三十三年之夢}}) in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=劉崇稜 |year=2004 |script-title=zh:日本近代文學精讀 |isbn=978-957-11-3675-2 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric, Louis.

=== Further exile ===
Sun was in exile not only in Japan but also in Europe, the United States, and Canada.  He raised money for his revolutionary party and to support uprisings in China. While the events leading up to it are unclear, in 1896 Sun Yat-sen was detained at the [[Embassy of China, London|Chinese Legation in London]], where the Chinese Imperial secret service planned to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sun-Yat-sen|title=Sun Yat-sen {{!}} Chinese leader|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after 12 days through the efforts of [[James Cantlie]], ''[[The Globe (London newspaper)|The Globe]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and the [[Foreign Office]], leaving Sun a hero in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to popular legends, Sun entered the Legation voluntarily, but was prevented from leaving. The Legation planned to execute him, before returning his body to Beijing for ritual beheading. Cantlie, his former teacher, was refused a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' because of the Legation's [[diplomatic immunity]], but he began a campaign through ''[[The Times]]''. The Foreign Office persuaded the Legation to release Sun through diplomatic channels.

He eventually returned to China and from there moved to the British colony of Hong Kong in 1883.

He knew that the only way that China would change and modernize would be to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

According to Lee Yun-ping, chairman of the Chinese historical society, Sun needed a certificate to enter the United States at a time when the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] would have otherwise blocked him.&lt;ref name="sfworldjournal"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:孫中山思想 3學者演說精采 |url=http://sf.worldjournal.com/view/full_sf/12160552/article-孫中山思想-3學者演說精采?instance=top_rec |quote= |work=World journal |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513181852/http://sf.worldjournal.com/view/full_sf/12160552/article-%E5%AD%AB%E4%B8%AD%E5%B1%B1%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3-3%E5%AD%B8%E8%80%85%E6%BC%94%E8%AA%AA%E7%B2%BE%E9%87%87?instance=top_rec |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on Sun's first attempt to enter the US, he was still arrested.&lt;ref name="sfworldjournal" /&gt; He was later bailed out after 17 days.&lt;ref name="sfworldjournal" /&gt; In March 1904, while residing in [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula]], [[Maui]], Sun Yat-sen obtained a Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, issued by the [[Territory of Hawaii]], stating that "he was born in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1870."&lt;ref name="Certificate of Live Birth in Hawaii"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/9830547/Sun-Yatsen-Certification-of-Live-Birth-in-Hawaii |title=Sun Yat-sen: Certification of Live Birth in Hawaii |publisher=[[Scribd]] |location=San Francisco, CA, USA |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smys00honu /&gt; He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.&lt;ref name="smys00honu"&gt;Smyser, A.A.

== Revolution ==

=== Tongmenghui ===
{{Main|Tongmenghui}}
[[File:The document bearing Sun Yat Sen's official seal.png|thumb|A letter with Sun's seal commencing the [[Tongmenghui]] in Hong Kong]]

In 1904, Sun Yat-sen came about with the goal "to expel the [[Tatar]] barbarians (i.e. [[Manchu]]), to revive [[Names of China#Zhongguo and Zhonghua|Zhonghua]], to establish a Republic, and to [[Land reform|distribute land]] equally among the people" ({{lang|zh-hant|驅除韃虜, 恢復中華, 創立民國, 平均地權}}).&lt;ref name="chinahistvol1"&gt;計秋楓, 朱慶葆. [2001] (2001). 中國近代史, Volume 1. Chinese university press. {{ISBN|962-201-987-0}}, {{ISBN|978-962-201-987-4}}. pg 468.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Sun's major legacies was the creation of his political philosophy of the [[Three Principles of the People]]. These Principles included the principle of nationalism (minzu, {{lang|zh|民族}}), of democracy (minquan, {{lang|zh-hant|民權}}), and of welfare (minsheng, {{lang|zh|民生}}).&lt;ref name="chinahistvol1" /&gt;

On 20 August 1905, Sun joined forces with revolutionary Chinese students studying in Tokyo, Japan to form the unified group [[Tongmenghui]] (United League), which sponsored uprisings in China.&lt;ref name="chinahistvol1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/china/history/imperial_china/the_manchu_qing_dynasty_1644-1911/internal_threats.htm |title=Internal Threats&amp;nbsp;– The Manchu Qing Dynasty (1644–1911)&amp;nbsp;– Imperial China&amp;nbsp;– History&amp;nbsp;– China&amp;nbsp;– Asia |publisher=Countriesquest.com |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 the number of Tongmenghui members reached 963 people.&lt;ref name="chinahistvol1" /&gt;

=== Malaya support ===
{{Main|Chinese revolutionary activities in Malaya}}
[[File:Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall 22, Aug 06.JPG|thumb|Interior of the [[Wan Qing Yuan]] featuring Sun's items and photos]]
[[File:Sun Yat-sen Penang Base.JPG|thumb|The [[Sun Yat-sen Museum Penang|Sun Yat-sen Museum]] in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], Penang, Malaysia, where he planned the [[Xinhai Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Streets of George Town, Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giWb_8UjPU4C&amp;pg=PA34|year=2007|publisher=Areca Books|isbn=978-983-9886-00-9|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sun's notability and popularity extends beyond the [[Greater China]] region, particularly to [[Nanyang (geographical region)|Nanyang]] (Southeast Asia), where a large concentration of [[overseas Chinese]] resided in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] ([[Malaysia]] and Singapore).  While in Singapore, he met local Chinese merchants Teo Eng Hock(張永福), Tan Chor Nam(陳楚楠) and Lim Nee Soon(林義順), which mark the commencement of direct support from the Nanyang Chinese. The Singapore chapter of the Tongmenghui was established on 6 April 1906.&lt;ref name="yanq"&gt;Yan, Qinghuang. [2008] (2008). The Chinese in Southeast Asia and beyond: socioeconomic and political dimensions. World Scientific publishing. {{ISBN|981-279-047-0}}, {{ISBN|978-981-279-047-7}}. pg 182–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Though some records claim the founding date to be end of 1905.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt; The [[villa]] used by Sun was known as [[Wan Qing Yuan]].&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wanqingyuan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanqingyuan.org.sg/ |title=Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall |publisher=Wanqingyuan.org.sg |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Singapore was the headquarters of the Tongmenghui.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt;

Thus, after founding the Tong Meng Hui, Dr Sun advocated the establishment of The Chong Shing Yit Pao as the alliance's mouthpiece to promote revolutionary ideas. Later, he initiated the establishment of reading clubs across Singapore and Malaysia, in order to disseminate revolutionary ideas among the lower class through public readings of newspaper stories. The United Chinese Library, founded on 8 August 1910, was one such reading club, first set up at leased property on the second floor of the Wan He Salt Traders in North Boat Quay.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The first actual United Chinese Library building was built between 1908 and 1911 below Fort Canning – 51 Armenian Street, commenced operations in 1912.  The library was set up as a part of the 50 reading rooms by the Chinese Republicans to serve as an information station and liaison point for the revolutionaries. In 1987, the library was moved to its present site at Cantonment Road. But the Armenian Street building is still intact with the plaque at its entrance with Sun Yat Sen's words. With an initial membership of over 400, the library has about 180 members today. Although the United Chinese Library, with 102 years of history, was not the only reading club in Singapore during the time, today it is the only one of its kind remaining.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Siamese support ===
In 1903, Sun made a secret trip to [[Bangkok]] in which he sought funds for his cause in Southeast Asia. His loyal followers published newspapers, providing invaluable support to the dissemination of his revolutionary principles and ideals among [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descant]] in Thailand. In Bangkok, Sun visited [[Yaowarat Road]], in [[Bangkok's Chinatown]]. It was on this street that Sun gave a speech claiming that overseas Chinese were "the Mother of the Revolution". He also met local Chinese merchants Seow Houtseng,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/39825/3/AjiaTaiheiyoTokyu_21_Murashima.pdf|title=The Origins of Chinese Nationalism in Thailand|author=Eiji Murashima|publisher=Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies (Waseda University)|accessdate=30 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180058/https://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/39825/3/AjiaTaiheiyoTokyu_21_Murashima.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose sent financial support to him.

Sun's speech on Yaowarat street was commemorated by the street later being named "Sun Yat Sen Street" or "Soi Sun Yat Sen" ({{lang-th|ซอยซุนยัตเซ็น}}) in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Lim|url=http://www.tour-bangkok-legacies.com/soi-sun-yat-sen.html |title=Soi Sun Yat Sen the legacy of a revolutionary|publisher=Tour Bangkok Legacies |date= |accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zhennanguan uprising ===
On 1 December 1907, Sun led the [[Xinhai Revolution#Zhennanguan Uprising|Zhennanguan uprising]] against the Qing at [[Friendship Pass]], which is the border between [[Guangxi]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Khoo"&gt;Khoo, Salma Nasution.

=== Anti-Sun movements ===
Because of these failures, Sun's leadership was challenged by elements from within the Tongmenghui who wished to remove him as leader.  In Tokyo 1907–1908 members from the recently merged [[Guangfuhui|Restoration society]] raised doubts about Sun's credentials.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt; Tao Chengzhang ({{lang|zh|陶成章}}) and [[Zhang Binglin]] publicly denounced Sun with an open leaflet called "A declaration of Sun Yat-sen's criminal acts by the revolutionaries in Southeast Asia".&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt; This was printed and distributed in reformist newspapers like Nanyang Zonghui Bao.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nanyang Zonghui bao.  The Union Times paper. 11 November 1909 p2.&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to target Sun as a leader leading a revolt for [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]] gains.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt;

The revolutionaries were polarized and split between pro-Sun and anti-Sun camps.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt; Sun publicly fought off comments about how he had something to gain financially from the revolution.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt; However, by 19 July 1910, the Tongmenghui headquarters had to relocate from Singapore to [[Penang]] to reduce the anti-Sun activities.&lt;ref name="yanq" /&gt; It is also in Penang that Sun and his supporters would launch the first Chinese "daily" newspaper, the [[Kwong Wah Yit Poh]] in December 1910.&lt;ref name="Khoo" /&gt;

[[File:Wuchangqiyi paobing.JPG|thumb|left|The Revolutionary Army of the [[Wuchang uprising]] fighting in the [[Battle of Yangxia]]]]

To sponsor more uprisings, Sun made a personal plea for financial aid at the [[1910 Penang conference|Penang conference]] held on 13 November 1910 in [[British Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref name="Bergere188"&gt;[[#Bergère &amp; Lloyd|Bergère]]: 188&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders launched a major drive for donations across the [[Malay Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=Bergere188 /&gt; They raised [[HK$]]187,000.&lt;ref name=Bergere188 /&gt;

On 27 April 1911, revolutionary [[Huang Xing]] led a second Guangzhou uprising known as the [[Yellow Flower Mound revolt]] against the Qing.  The revolt failed and ended in disaster; the bodies of only 72 revolutionaries were found.&lt;ref name="gtong195"&gt;王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 No. 5 清. 中華書局. {{ISBN|962-8885-28-6}}. p 195-198.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionaries are remembered as [[Martyrdom in Chinese culture|martyrs]].&lt;ref name="gtong195" /&gt;

On 10 October 1911, a military [[Wuchang Uprising|uprising at Wuchang]] took place led again by [[Huang Xing]].  At the time, Sun had no direct involvement as he was still in exile.  Huang was in charge of the revolution that ended over 2000 years of imperial rule in China.  When Sun learned of the successful rebellion against the [[List of emperors of the Qing Dynasty|Qing emperor]] from press reports, he returned to China from the United States accompanied by his closest foreign advisor, the American, "General" [[Homer Lea]].  He met Lea in London, where he and Lea unsuccessfully tried to arrange British financing for the new Chinese republic.  Sun and Lea then sailed for China, arriving there on 21 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bergère &amp; Lloyd|Bergère]]: 210&lt;/ref&gt;

The uprising expanded to the [[Xinhai Revolution]] also known as the "Chinese Revolution" to overthrow the last Emperor [[Puyi]].  After this event, 10 October became known as the commemoration of [[Double Ten Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol, Steven. [2009] (2009).

== Republic of China with multiple governments ==
=== Provisional government ===

On 29 December 1911 a meeting of representatives from provinces in [[Nanjing|Nanking (Nanjing)]] elected Sun Yat-sen as the "[[List of leaders of the Republic of China|provisional president]]" ({{lang|zh-hant|臨時大總統}}).&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Roger deWardt.

Rowman littlefield publishing.  {{ISBN|0-7425-5314-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5314-9}}. pg 87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Li Yuanhong]] was made provisional vice-president and [[Huang Xing]] became the minister of the army.  The new [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] was created along with the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]].  Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. His successful merger of minor revolutionary groups to a single larger party provided a better base for all those who shared the same ideals.  A number of things were introduced such as the [[Minguo calendar|republic calendar system]] and new fashion like [[Mao suit|Zhongshan suits]].

=== Beiyang government ===
{{Main|Beiyang government}}
[[Yuan Shikai]], who controlled the [[Beiyang Army]], the military of northern China, was promised the position of President of the Republic of China if he could get the Qing court to abdicate.&lt;ref name="Fu" /&gt; On 12 February 1912 Emperor Puyi did abdicate the throne.&lt;ref name="Well" /&gt; Sun stepped down as President, and Yuan became the new provisional president in Beijing on 10 March 1912.&lt;ref name="Fu" /&gt; The provisional government did not have any military forces of its own, its control over elements of the [[New Army]] that had mutinied was limited and there were still significant forces which still had not declared against the Qing.

Sun Yat-sen sent telegrams to the leaders of all provinces requesting them to elect and to establish the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bergère &amp; Lloyd|Bergère]]: 226&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1912 the legislative assembly moved from Nanjing to Beijing with its 120 members divided between members of [[Tongmenghui]] and a Republican party that supported Yuan Shikai.&lt;ref name="chien"&gt;Ch'ien Tuan-sheng. ''The Government and Politics of China 1912–1949''. Harvard University Press, 1950; rpr. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0551-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0551-6}}. pp. 83–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Many revolutionary members were already alarmed by Yuan's ambitions and the northern based [[Beiyang government]].

=== Nationalist party and Second Revolution ===
Tongmenghui member [[Song Jiaoren]] quickly tried to control the parliament.  He mobilized the old Tongmenghui at the core with the merger of a number of new small parties to form a new political party called the [[Guomindang|Kuomintang]] (Chinese nationalist party, commonly abbreviated as "KMT") on 25 August 1912 at [[Huguang Guild Hall]] Beijing.&lt;ref name="chien" /&gt; The [[Republic of China National Assembly elections, 1912|1912–1913 National assembly election]] was considered a huge success for the KMT winning 269 of the 596 seats in the lower house and 123 of the 274 senate seats.&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;Fu, Zhengyuan. (1993). ''Autocratic tradition and Chinese politics''(Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-44228-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-44228-2}}). pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chien" /&gt; The [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] took place where Sun and KMT military forces tried to overthrow Yuan's forces of about 80,000 men in an armed conflict in July 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Young, "Politics in the Aftermath of Revolution," in John King Fairbank, ed., ''The Cambridge History of China: Republican China 1912–1949'', Part 1 (Cambridge University Press, 1983; {{ISBN|0-521-23541-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-23541-9}}), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt against Yuan was unsuccessful. Sun was forced to seek asylum in Japan with politician and industrialist Fusanosuke Kuhara. In retaliation the national party leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated, almost certainly by a secret order of Yuan, on 20 March 1913.&lt;ref name="Fu" /&gt;

=== Political chaos ===
In 1915 Yuan Shikai proclaimed the [[Empire of China (1915–1916)]] with himself as [[Emperor of China]].  Sun took part in the [[National Protection War|Anti-Monarchy war]] of the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]], while also supporting bandit leaders like [[Bai Lang Rebellion|Bai Lang]] during the [[Bai Lang Rebellion]].  This marked the beginning of the [[Warlord Era]].  In 1915 Sun wrote to the [[Second International]], a socialist-based organization in Paris, asking it to send a team of specialists to help China set up the world's first socialist republic.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. Sun Yat-sen's durable and malleable legacy. 26 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were [[Federalism in China|many theories and proposals]] of what China could be. In the political mess, both Sun Yat-sen and [[Xu Shichang]] were announced as President of the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. 1913–1922. 9 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path to Northern Expedition ==

=== Guangzhou militarist government ===
[[File:Whampoa3.jpg|thumb|(L-R): [[Liao Zhongkai]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Sun Yat-sen and [[Soong Ching-ling]] at the founding of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924]]

China had become divided between different military leaders without a proper central government. Sun saw the danger of this and returned to China in 1917 to advocate [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese reunification]].  In 1921 he started a self-proclaimed military government in [[Guangzhou]] and was elected [[Da Yuan Shuai|Grand Marshal]].&lt;ref name="Bergere273"&gt;[[#Bergère &amp; Lloyd|Bergère &amp; Lloyd]]: 273&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1912 and 1927 three governments had been set up in South China: the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional government in Nanjing (1912)]], the Military government in Guangzhou (1921–1925), and the National government in Guangzhou and later [[Wuhan]] (1925–1927).&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, William C. [2000] (2000). State and economy in republican China: a handbook for scholars, volume 1. Harvard publishing. {{ISBN|0-674-00368-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00368-2}}. pg 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The southern separatist government in the South was established to rival the Beiyang government in the north.&lt;ref name=Bergere273 /&gt; Yuan Shikai had banned the KMT.  The short lived [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] was a temporary replacement for the KMT.  On 10 October 1919 Sun resurrected the KMT with the new name [[Names of China|Chung-kuo]] [[Kuomintang]] ({{zh|t=中國國民黨|s=中国国民党|p=Zhōngguó guómíndǎng}}), or the "Nationalist Party of China".&lt;ref name="chien" /&gt;

=== KMT–CPC cooperation ===
[[File:Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|left|Sun Yat-sen (seated on right) and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]]]

By this time Sun had become convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy.  In order to hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active cooperation with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).  Sun and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Adolph Joffe]] signed the [[Sun-Joffe Manifesto]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name="Tung1"&gt;Tung, William L. [1968] (1968). The political institutions of modern China. Springer publishing. {{ISBN|9789024705528}}. p 92. P106.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun received help from the [[Comintern]] for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT.  Revolutionary and socialist leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] praised Sun and the KMT for their ideology and principles. Lenin praised Sun and his attempts at social reformation, and also congratulated him for fighting foreign Imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2cSSVPogpoC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=lenin+sun+principles+of+the+people&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f3mrTMxCgbvyBsatpYEI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lenin%20sun%20principles%20of%20the%20people&amp;f=false|title=Mao Tse-tung: Ruler of Red China|author=Robert Payne|year=2008|publisher=READ BOOKS|page=22|isbn=1-4437-2521-8|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnOFYI3g-N4C&amp;q=Lenin,+who+viewed+the+revolutionary+struggle+of+the+Chinese+people+with+great+sympathy,+had+a+high+regard+for+Sun+Yat-sen's+work+and+referred+to+him+as+%22a+revolutionary+democrat,+endowed+with+nobility+and+heroism%22&amp;dq=Lenin,+who+viewed+the+revolutionary+struggle+of+the+Chinese+people+with+great+sympathy,+had+a+high+regard+for+Sun+Yat-sen's+work+and+referred+to+him+as+%22a+revolutionary+democrat,+endowed+with+nobility+and+heroism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rHmrTPGmNcP48Abx6rykCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|page=237|isbn=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mF0NAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Lenin,+who+viewed+the+revolutionary+struggle+of+the+Chinese+people+with+great+sympathy,+had+a+high+regard+for+Sun+Yat-sen's+work+and+referred+to+him+as+%22a+revolutionary+democrat,+endowed+with+nobility+and+heroism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aH-rTLOrOcKC8gaFsZCvCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ|title=Great Soviet encyclopedia, Volume 25|author=Aleksandr Mikhaĭlovich Prokhorov|year=1982|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun also returned the praise, calling him a "great man", and sent his congratulations on the [[Russian Civil War|revolution in Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSVK8qxOsG8C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=lenin+sun+principles+of+the+people&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f3mrTMxCgbvyBsatpYEI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=lenin%20sun%20principles%20of%20the%20people&amp;f=false|title=Aunt Mae's China|author=Bernice A Verbyla|year=2010|publisher=Xulon Press|page=170|isbn=1-60957-456-7|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Soviets' help, Sun was able to develop the military power needed for the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] against the military at the north.  He established the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] near Guangzhou with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] as the [[commandant]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA).&lt;ref&gt;Gao. James Zheng. [2009] (2009).

This full collaboration was called the [[First United Front]].

=== Finance concerns ===
In 1924 Sun appointed his brother-in-law [[T. V. Soong]] to set up the first Chinese Central bank called the [[Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)|Canton Central Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. [1990] (1990).

=== Final speeches ===
[[File:Sun and Soong in Kobe.jpg|thumb|Sun (seated, right) and his wife [[Soong Ching-ling]] (seated next to him) in [[Kobe]], Japan in 1924]]

In February 1923 Sun made a presentation to the [[Students' Union]] in [[Hong Kong University]] and declared that it was the corruption of China and the [[peace, order and good government]] of Hong Kong that turned him into a revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, Virgil K.Y.

Edge of Empires:Chinese Elites and British Colonials in Hong Kong. Harvard university press. {{ISBN|0-674-01701-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same year, he delivered a speech in which he proclaimed his [[Three Principles of the People]] as the foundation of the country and the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Five-Yuan Constitution]] as the guideline for the political system and bureaucracy. Part of the speech was made into the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China]].

On 10 November 1924, Sun traveled north to [[Tianjin]] and delivered a speech to suggest a gathering for a "national conference" for the Chinese people.  It called for the end of warlord rules and the abolition of all [[unequal treaties]] with the Western powers.&lt;ref&gt;Ma Yuxin [2010] (2010). ''Women journalists and feminism in China, 1898–1937''.

Among the people he met was the Muslim General [[Ma Fuxiang]], who informed Sun that they would welcome his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elycn.com/gs/lx/015/003.htm |script-title=zh:马福祥,临夏回族自治州马福祥,马福祥介绍---走遍中国|website=www.elycn.com|accessdate=23 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513183437/http://www.elycn.com/gs/lx/015/003.htm|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 1924 Sun traveled to Japan and gave a [[s:Sun Yat Sen's speech on Pan-Asianism|speech on Pan-Asianism]] at [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, Kent; Ye, Min [2010] (2010).

=== Illness and death ===
For many years, it was popularly believed that Sun died of [[liver cancer]]. On 26 January 1925, Sun underwent an [[exploratory laparotomy]] at [[Peking Union Medical College]] Hospital (PUMCH) to investigate a long-term illness. This was performed by the head of the Department of Surgery, Adrian S. Taylor, who stated that the procedure "revealed extensive involvement of the liver by [[carcinoma]]" and that Sun only had about ten days to live. Sun was hospitalized and his condition was treated with [[radium]].

In 1926, construction began on a majestic mausoleum at the foot of [[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Purple Mountain]] in Nanjing, and this was completed in the spring of 1929. On 1 June 1929, Sun's remains were moved from Beijing and interred in the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]].

By pure chance, in May 2016, an American pathologist named Rolf F. Barth was visiting the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (Guangzhou)|Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] in [[Guangzhou]] when he noticed a faded copy of the original autopsy report on display. The autopsy was performed immediately after Sun's death by James Cash, a pathologist at PUMCH. Based on a [[Sampling (medicine)|tissue sample]], Cash concluded that the cause of death was an [[adenocarcinoma]] in the [[gallbladder]] that had [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to the liver. In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than gallbladder cancer and although the incidence rates of either in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at that time, then the original diagnosis by Taylor was a logical conclusion. From the time of Sun's death until the appearance of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5009495/pdf/40880_2016_Article_144.pdf Barth's report]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barth |first1=RF |last2=Chen |first2=J |title=What did Sun Yat-sen really die of?

== Legacy ==

=== Power struggle ===
[[File:NRA Generals Northern Expedition.jpg|thumb|Chinese Generals pay tribute to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Beijing in 1928 after the success of the Northern Expedition. From right to left, are Generals [[He Chengjun|Cheng Jin]] ({{lang|zh|何成浚}}), [[Zhang Zuobao]] ({{lang|zh-hant|張作寶}}), [[Chen Diaoyuan]] ({{lang|zh-hant|陳調元}}), [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Woo Tsin-hang]], [[Yan Xishan]], [[Ma Fuxiang]], [[Ma Sida]] ({{lang|zh-hant|馬四達}}), and [[Bai Chongxi]].]]

After Sun's death, a power struggle between his young protégé [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his old revolutionary comrade [[Wang Jingwei]] split the KMT. At stake in this struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married [[Soong Mei-ling]], a sister of Sun's widow [[Soong Ching-ling]], and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the [[12 April Incident|Communists and the Kuomintang split]] in 1927, marking the start of the [[Chinese Civil War]], each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through World War II.  Sun's widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice-President (or Vice-Chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.

=== Cult of personality ===
A [[personality cult]] in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Chinese Muslim Generals and Imams participated in this cult of personality and [[One-party state|one party state]], with Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] making people bow to Sun's portrait and listen to the national anthem during a [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] and [[Mongol]] religious ceremony for the [[Qinghai Lake]] God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+son&amp;q=genocidal#v=snippet&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20lake%20god%20scarves&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=51|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quotes from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] were used among [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims to justify Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=china+jihad+japan+xue+chengda&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ny-VTPmSKML_lgfw-fCoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=jiang%20hadith%20jieshi%20leader&amp;f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1= Stéphane A.

The Kuomintang's constitution designated Sun as party president.  After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever.  The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927–1975) and a chairman (since 1975), which discharge the functions of the president.

=== Father of the Nation ===
[[File:Sun-jat-sen nanjing 140883.jpg|thumb|Statue in the Mausoleum, [[Kuomintang]] flag on the ceiling]]

Sun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation both in [[mainland China]] and in [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the [[Republic of China]], and is known by the [[posthumous name]] ''[[Father of the Nation]], Mr. Sun Zhongshan'' ({{zh|t=國父　孫中山先生|links=no}}, where the [[Tai tou|one-character space]] is a traditional homage symbol).&lt;ref name="sunbook2" /&gt; His likeness is still almost always found in ceremonial locations such as in front of legislatures and classrooms of public [[Education in Taiwan|schools]], from elementary to senior high school, and he continues to appear in new [[New Taiwan dollar|coinage and currency]].

=== "Forerunner of the revolution" ===
On the [[mainland China|mainland]], Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, proto-socialist, first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the ''Forerunner of the Revolution'' ({{lang|zh|革命先行者}}).&lt;ref name="Tung1" /&gt; He is even mentioned by name in the [[:wikisource:Constitution of the People's Republic of China|preamble]] to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. In recent years, the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering [[Chinese nationalism]] in light of [[Chinese economic reform]] and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan which the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] sees as allies against [[Taiwan independence]]. [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|Sun's tomb]] was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] on their [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosecrance, Richard N.

=== Religious veneration ===
Sun is venerated as a Saint in [[Đạo Cao Đài]], a religion established in [[Vietnam]] in 1926. He, along with the two other Saints [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm]], represented mankind to declare the Alliance (peaceful treaty) with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nguyễn Văn Hồng|title=Cao Đài Từ điển#Tam Thánh ký hòa ước|url=http://caodaism.org/CaoDaiTuDien(v2012)/cdtd-van_T.htm#_Tam_Thánh_ký|website=caodaism.org|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Family tree of Sun Yat-sen}}
[[File:Lumuzhenp.JPG|thumb|[[Lu Muzhen]] (1867–1952), Sun's first wife from 1885 to 1915]]

Sun Yat-sen was born to Sun Dacheng ({{lang|zh-hant|孫達成}}) and his wife, lady Yang ({{lang|zh-hant|楊氏}}) on 12 November 1866.&lt;ref name="family background and schooling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sun.yatsen.gov.tw/content.php?cid=S01_01_02_01 |script-title=zh:孫中山學術研究資訊網&amp;nbsp;– 國父的家世與求學 |trans-title=Dr. Sun Yat-sen's family background and schooling |language=Chinese |work=[sun.yatsen.gov.tw/ sun.yatsen.gov.tw |date=16 November 2005 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time his father was age 53, while his mother was 38 years old.  He had an older brother, Sun Dezhang ({{lang|zh-hant|孫德彰}}), and an older sister, Sun Jinxing ({{lang|zh-hant|孫金星}}), who died at the early age of 4.  Another older brother, Sun Deyou ({{lang|zh-hant|孫德祐}}), died at the age of 6.  He also had an older sister, Sun Miaoqian ({{lang|zh-hant|孫妙茜}}), and a younger sister, Sun Qiuqi ({{lang|zh-hant|孫秋綺}}).&lt;ref name="singtao2" /&gt;

At age 20, Sun had an [[arranged marriage]] with fellow villager [[Lu Muzhen]]. She bore a son, [[Sun Fo]], and two daughters, Sun Jinyuan ({{lang|zh-hant|孫金媛}}) and Sun Jinwan ({{lang|zh-hant|孫金婉}}).&lt;ref name="singtao2" /&gt; Sun Fo was the grandfather of Leland Sun, who spent 37 years working in Hollywood as an actor and [[stuntman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-09/11/c_131132949.htm |title=Sun Yat-sen's descendant wants to see unified China |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=11 September 2011 |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030220844/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-09/11/c_131132949.htm |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Yat-sen was also the godfather of Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, American author and poet who wrote under the name [[Cordwainer Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2010/09/21/tripping-cyborgs-and-organ-farms-the-fictions-of-cordwainer-smith/|title=Tripping Cyborgs and Organ Farms: The Fictions of Cordwainer Smith {{!}} NeuroTribes|date=21 September 2010|work=NeuroTribes|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun's first [[concubine]], the Hong Kong-born [[Chen Cuifen]], lived in [[Taiping, Perak]], [[Malaysia]] for 17 years. The couple adopted a local girl as their daughter. Cuifen subsequently relocated to China, where she passed away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emily2u.com/antong-cafe-oldest-coffee-mill-in-malaysia/|title=Antong Cafe, The Oldest Coffee Mill in Malaysia|accessdate=12 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112160148/http://www.emily2u.com/antong-cafe-oldest-coffee-mill-in-malaysia/|archivedate=12 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 1915 in Japan, Sun married [[Soong Ching-ling]], one of the [[Soong sisters]],&lt;ref name="singtao2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac F. Marcosson, Turbulent Years (1938), p.249&lt;/ref&gt; Soong Ching-Ling's father was the American-educated [[Methodist]] minister [[Charles Soong]], who made a fortune in banking and in printing of Bibles. Although Charles Soong had been a personal friend of Sun's, he was enraged when Sun announced his intention to marry Ching-ling because while Sun was a Christian he kept two wives, Lu Muzhen and Kaoru Otsuki; Soong viewed Sun's actions as running directly against their shared religion.

Soong Ching-Ling's sister, [[Soong Mei-ling]], later married [[Chiang Kai-shek]].

In most major [[Chinese cities]] one of the main streets is named ''Zhongshan Lu'' ({{lang|zh-Hani|中山路}}) to celebrate his memory. There are also numerous parks, schools, and geographical features named after him. Xiangshan, Sun's hometown in Guangdong, was renamed [[Zhongshan]] in his honor, and there is a hall dedicated to his memory at the [[Temple of Azure Clouds]] in Beijing. There are also a series of [[Sun Yat-sen stamps]].

== Controversy ==

=== New Three Principles of the People ===
At one time CPC general secretary and PRC president [[Jiang Zemin]] claimed Sun Yat-sen had a "New Three Principles of the People" ({{lang|zh-hant|新三民主義}}) which consisted of "working with the soviets, working with the communists and helping the farmers" ({{lang|zh-hant|聯俄, 聯共, 扶助工農}}).&lt;ref name="shanghaiist"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Tan |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2011/10/03/granddaughter_of_sun_yat-sen_accuse.php#photo-1 |title=Granddaughter of Sun Yat-Sen accuses China of distorting his legacy |publisher=Shanghaiist |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2011-10-01/58179861.html |script-title=zh:国父孙女轰中共扭曲三民主义愚民_多维新闻网 |language=zh |publisher=China.dwnews.com |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007154343/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2011-10-01/58179861.html |archive-date=7 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lily Sun said the CPC was distorting Sun's legacy in 2001.  She then voiced her displeasure in 2002 in a private letter to Jiang about the distortion of history.&lt;ref name="shanghaiist" /&gt; In 2008 Jiang Zemin was willing to offer US$10&amp;nbsp;million to sponsor a Xinhai Revolution anniversary celebration event.  According to ''[[Ming Pao]]'' she could not take the money because she would no longer have the freedom to communicate the revolution.&lt;ref name="shanghaiist" /&gt; This concept is still currently available on [[Baike Baidu]].

=== KMT emblem removal case ===
In 1981 Lily Sun took a trip to Sun Yat-sen mausoleum in Nanjing, People's Republic of China. The emblem of the KMT had been removed from the top of his sacrificial hall at the time of her visit, but was later restored. On another visit in May 2011, she was surprised to find the four characters "General Rules of Meetings" ({{lang|zh-hant|會議通則}}), a document that Sun wrote in reference to [[Robert's Rules of Order]] had been removed from a stone carving.&lt;ref name="shanghaiist" /&gt;

=== Father of Independent Taiwan issue ===
In November 2004 the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|ROC Ministry of Education]] proposed that Sun Yat-sen was not the father of Taiwan.

'''The Menhaden Chanteymen''' is a musical group based out of [[Carteret County, North Carolina]]. They are a group of retired [[African-American]] [[commercial fishermen]] who publicly perform the [[work songs]] they used when hauling nets. 

Their work draws from the genres of [[hymns]], [[gospel]], [[blues]], and [[barbershop quartet]] songs.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Menhaden Chanteymen|url=http://ncpedia.org/menhaden-chanteymen|website=NCpedia|publisher=NCpedia|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Menhaden Chanteymen recorded a collection of maritime work songs, "Won't You Help Me to Raise 'Em: Authentic Net Hauling Songs from an African-American Fishery," for Global Village Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on Menhaden Fishery and the Chanteymen at North Carolina Maritime Museum in Beaufort|url=http://www.jdnews.com/20140606/spotlight-on-menhaden-fishery-and-the-chanteymen--at-north-carolina-maritime-museum-in-beaufort/306069895|website=JDNews.com|publisher=Jacksonville (NC) Daily News|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[International Refugee Organization]] resettled over 1 million refugees between 1947 and 1951. They were scattered throughout Europe after World War II. 80% of them were resettled outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/510bd3979.pdf|page 4 &lt;/ref&gt; An example for those resettled within Europe are the 150,000 Polish soldiers and their families who were resettled in the UK by 1949.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 72&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Due to the Soviet invasion in Hungary in 1956, 200,000 Hungarians fled to Yugoslavia and Austria. Nearly all 180,000 Hungarians who fled to Austria were resettled to 37 third countries within three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 6ff&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet invasion in Czechoslovakia in 1968 had the same effect; many Czechoslovakians fled their country and were subsequently resettled.
* Most of its Asian minority were [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled from Uganda]] in 1972 and some 40,000 Ugandan Asians were resettled in third countries.
* Following a coup d’état in Chile in 1973, 5,000 refugees from neighbouring countries were resettled.
* 650,000 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Between April 1992 and June 1997, following the first Gulf War, approximately 21,800 Iraqis were accepted for resettlement from Saudi Arabia.
* Between 1992 and July 1993 over 11,000 inmates from places of detention in Bosnia and Herzegovina had left for third countries. By June 1997, UNHCR had been directly involved in resettling some 47,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf| page 50&lt;/ref&gt;
* More than 100,000 refugees from Myanmar have been resettled from the refugee camps in Thailand since 2004 and as many people have been resettled from Malaysia during this same period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==

Precondition for resettlement is to be registered as a refugee with the UNHCR and to have undergone the [[Refugee#Refugee status determination|Refugee Status Determination]] (RSD) process based on the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] refugee definition. Among those refugees the UNHCR or other organisations (e.g. [[RefugePoint]] or [[HIAS]]) make referrals for resettlement if they identify a high level of risk and vulnerability whilst being in the first country of [[right of asylum|asylum]]. Refugees cannot apply for resettlement themselves. Selection procedures can vary between UNHCR offices&lt;ref name="fmreview.org"&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 11&lt;/ref&gt; but the below criteria are generally used:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf%7C | page 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical safety and legal rights are at risk in country of asylum
* past experience of violence and torture
* significant medical needs that cannot be provided for in country of asylum
* sex/gender based risks in country of asylum
* children and adolescents are at risk in country of asylum
* resettlement is the only way of reuniting a family
* resettlement is the only way for building a durable future

If one or more of these criteria are met it still needs to be assessed whether third country resettlement is the most appropriate durable solution compared to [[voluntary return]] and [[Refugee#Integration and naturalisation|local integration]]. After the refugees are referred for resettlement and agree to be resettled they are suggested to suitable countries that run resettlement programmes. Each participating government can select from the referrals and refugees themselves cannot choose their country of resettlement. Even though receiving countries should not select refugees according to their own criteria, it may be that societal and political desires influence which groups of refugees are received.&lt;ref name="fmreview.org"/&gt; Countries make their decisions based on either just a dossier or following an interview with the refugee.

It is also possible for multiple refugees to be submitted for resettlement if they share specific circumstances, such as similar reasons for their flight and no prospects of return. Examples for group resettlement were the [[Lost Boys of Sudan]] from Kenya, Liberians from Guinea and Sierra Leone, Burundians from Tanzania and Eritreans from Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf| page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biases in the selection process===

Receiving countries tend to use their own criteria for selecting refugees for resettlement. Many governments prioritise women and complete families and deprioritise single males. This happens in order to minimise potential security risks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the UNHCR resettlement officers who submit refugees' dossiers to potential receiving countries may themselves bias the selection. For example, it was revealed that UNHCR staff in Nairobi extorted money from refugees for resettlement places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/510bd3979.pdf | page 10 &lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, large families are more likely to be considered for resettlement than singles, because resettlement officers have to work through fewer case files per submitted person when referring large families. Also single men, who are likely to receive a more thorough and time consuming security screening from resettlement states, are less likely to be submitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

To be referred for resettlement may involve a tedious game with refugee chairmen, agency personnel or security guards. Chairmen can help making up stories or can ignore real security issues. The refugees themselves may manipulate the selection process. They may not mention that they have recently married in order not to delay their departure or they make themselves younger or older in order to, putatively, increase their chances for resettlement. They may even exaggerate their level of vulnerability as has been noticed in [[Kakuma]]: men staged violent attacks on themselves or their dwellings and women pretended rapes; they may be hiding their military or rebel past, or change their ethnicity, in order to belong to a certain persecuted group.&lt;ref&gt;Bram J. Jansen, African Affairs, 2008: Between vulnerability and assertiveness: Negotiating resettlement in Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of the resettlement journey==
There are three stages of the resettlement journey: Pre-departure happens from their country of origin, departure is the during the process of resettlement and post-arrival happens in their new country.

===Pre-departure===
After the selection process is completed there may be additional government interviews and security checks, followed by health assessments and a cultural orientation training. The latter should emphasise on the potential challenges for refugees in the receiving country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural orientation trainings do not always happen and they differ in duration and depth. The [[Gateway Resettlement Programme]] for example, used to provide two weeks of cultural orientation when it was launched in 2004; however this has shrunk to three hours in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 17&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to helping refugees begin to prepare for life in a new country, cultural orientation can also contribute to the uncertainty and stress associated with resettlement.

===Departure===
Refugees are assisted to travel into the receiving country, usually by airplane. From being selected for resettlement to actually arriving in the US, it usually takes between 18–24 months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 52&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees who are resettled in the US have to pay back a loan for their flight tickets which is provided by the [[International Organization for Migration|International Organization for Migration (IOM)]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain circumstances, where refugees have to be evacuated immediately from life-threatening situations in the first country of asylum, they can be brought to Emergency Transit Centres (ETC). These provide a temporary safe haven before receiving countries are ready to take them. The [[Timișoara]] Emergency Transit Centre in Romania, that opened in 2008, was Europe’s first evacuation centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr-centraleurope.org/en/what-we-do/resettlement/etc-timisoara.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humenné]] Emergency Transit Centre in Slovakia was opened in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr-centraleurope.org/en/what-we-do/resettlement/etc-humenne.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210220141/http://www.unhcr-centraleurope.org/en/what-we-do/resettlement/etc-humenne.html |archivedate=2017-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ETCs together can only accommodate up to 300 people.

[[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] staff escorts the refugees to the receiving country and can provide a medical escort, if needed. As most refugees have no experience of air travel, the escort assists them with the preparation for the travel and with the journey itself, guiding and monitoring them throughout the journey and until they are handed over to the post-arrival service of the receiving country.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Post-arrival===
Refugees are met at the airport and get immediate integration and orientation support in most countries. Upon arrival in the country refugees have the right to reside in the country and do not need to apply for asylum. Refugees who are resettled to the US have to pay rent after six months.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Once a refugee is resettled in a third country the main focus is to help them become self-sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/information-on-unhcr-resettlement.html|title=Information on UNHCR Resettlement|last=Nuri|first=R.|date=November 2016|website=UNHCR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623013505/http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/information-on-unhcr-resettlement.html|archive-date=2016-06-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement programmes==
In 2012 there were 26 third countries which run specific and ongoing resettlement programmes in co-operation with the UNHCR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/510bd3979.pdf| page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The largest programmes are run by the United States, Canada and Australia. A number of European countries run smaller schemes and in 2004 the United Kingdom established its own scheme, known as the [[Gateway Protection Programme]]&lt;ref name="RIAF Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/OneStopCMS/Core/CrawlerResourceServer.aspx?resource=3140698F-6646-468B-AD6E-217439B9ACB5&amp;mode=link&amp;guid=eca93211dd1d4c9585770f026739c401|title=Understanding Resettlement to the UK: A Guide to the Gateway Protection Programme|date=June 2004|publisher=Refugee Council on behalf of the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial annual quota of 750.&lt;ref name="Gateway"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=Olga|author2=Murray, Rosemary|date=February 2009|title=The Gateway Protection Programme: An evaluation|journal=Home Office Research Report|volume=12|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/horr12c.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414171757/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/horr12c.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest is run by Japan which offers 30 resettlement places per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/510bd3979.pdf| page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In September 2009, the [[European Commission]] unveiled plans for new Joint EU Resettlement Programme. The scheme would involve EU member states deciding together each year which refugees should be given priority. Member states would receive €4,000 from the [[European Refugee Fund]] per refugee resettled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8233187.stm|title=EU plans to admit more refugees|date=2009-09-02|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bulgarian Refugee Children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bulgaria]]n refugee children from [[Gorno Brodi]] after the [[Second Balkan War]] resettled in [[Pestera]]]]

===United States===

Half of the refugees who are resettled each year went to the United States. The United States helped resettle roughly 2 million refugees between 1945 and 1979, when their refugee [[Population transfer|resettlement]] program was restructured. In the U.S. no other travelers undergo such rigorous security screening compared to refugees trying to enter the country and they are screened by six different federal agencies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/factsheets/2017/266447.htm|title=U.S. Refugee Admissions FAQ|last=|first=|date=2017|website=state.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average time it takes from the referral to the arrival of a refugee is 18 to 24 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

The number of refugees resettled to the US is limited by an annual ceiling that the president determines each&amp;nbsp;[[Fiscal year|fiscal year(FY)]]. There is usually around 60,000 to 90,000 refugees resettled each fiscal year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lowers-refugee-resettlement_us_59bfc214e4b02da0e1436613|title=Trump Caps Refugee Resettlement At 45,000, Marking All-Time Low|last=Frej|first=Willa|date=September 27, 2017|website=huffpost.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year (FY 2018) the number is set at 45,000 which is the lowest it has been in history after the brief period after 9/11.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

They now make use of 11 "Voluntary Agencies" ([[VOLAG]]S), which are [[non-governmental organizations]] that assist the government in the resettlement process.&lt;ref name="Taft, North, and Ford"&gt;Julia Vadala Taft, David S. North, David A. Ford, "Refugee Resettlement in the U.S.: Time For a New Focus", (Washington: New TransCentury Foundation, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;  These organizations assist the refugees with the day-to-day needs of the large transition into a completely new culture. Usually, they are not funded by the government, but instead rely on their own resources and volunteers.  Most of them have local offices, and [[caseworker (social work)|caseworker]]s that provide individualized aid to each refugee's situation.  They do rely on the sponsorship of individuals or groups, such as faith-based congregations or local organizations.  The largest of the VOLAGS is the Migration and Refugee Services of the U.S. Catholic Conference.&lt;ref name="Taft, North, and Ford" /&gt;  Others include [[Church World Service]], Episcopal Migration Ministries, the Ethiopian Community Development Council, the [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service]], the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], and [[World Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;"2007 Report to Congress," Office of Refugee Resettlement, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, Administration for Children and Families Office of Refugee Resettlement, pages C-1 – C-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of advantages to the strategy of using agencies other than the government to directly assist in resettlement.  First of all, it has been estimated that for a federal or state bureaucracy to resettle refugees instead of the VOLAGS would double the overall cost.  These agencies are often able to procure large quantities of donations and, more importantly, volunteers.  According to one study, when the fact that resettlement workers often have to work nights, weekends, and overtime in order to meet the demands of the large cultural transition of new refugees is taken into account, the use of volunteers reduces the overall cost down to roughly a quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Wright, "Voluntary Agencies and the Resettlement of Refugees," from International Migration Review Vol. 15, No. ½, Refugees Today (Spring – Summer, 1981), (New York: The Center for Migration Studies of New York), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; VOLAGS are also more flexible and responsive than the government since they are smaller and rely on their own funds.

===South America===

Around 1,100 refugees, mainly Colombians, were resettled within South America between 2005 and 2014 through the "Solidarity Resettlement Programme". However, as many refugees expected to be resettled to the US or Europe 22% of them left again, possibly returning to the country of first asylum or the country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} page 54ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the combined quota of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay together was 230 resettlement places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/510bd3979.pdf | page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resettlement departures===

In terms of resettlement ''departures'', in 2008, 65,548 refugees were resettled in 26 countries, up from 49,868 in 2007.&lt;ref name=Resettlement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a16b1676.html|title=Resettlement: A new beginning in a third country|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of UNHCR-assisted departures were from [[Thailand]] (16,807), [[Nepal]] (8,165), [[Syria]] (7,153), [[Jordan]] (6,704) and [[Malaysia]] (5,865).&lt;ref name=Resettlement/&gt; Note that these are the countries that refugees were resettled from, not their countries of origin.

'''Trezenzonio''' was a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] monk who lived in times of the [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturian monarchy]]. Tradition attributes the deed of seeing and even visiting one of the islands of Paradise to him. His adventures were summoned in the ''Trezenzonii de Solistitionis Insula Magna'', a medieval manuscript written in [[Latin]] in the 12th century.

After Galicia was once again plundered by one of the multiple raids with which the [[Muslims]] devastated the region in the 8th century, Trezenzonio went to the [[Tower of Hercules]] in [[A Coruña]]. There he took a look at the sea, where with the help of the first lights of the daning he could see the '''Great Isle of Solstice''' (''Magna Insula Solistitialis''), which was consecrated to [[Thecla|Saint Thecla]] (''Santa Tecla''). He decided to sail to that place and after having landed in that island he saw an immense prairie where a great basilica stood up, decorated with jewels and gems. In that island, the [[weather]] was delicious and there was plenty of food. Pain, hunger, fear and misfortunes were absent. Trezenzonio remained there for seven years after which an [[angel]] appeared to him and commanded him to return to Galicia.

Because he resisted the divine orders, he was punished with [[lepra]] and had to witness powerless how the proofs of the existence of the Great Isle of Solstice that he had collected on his ship rotted. Trezenzonio repented of his actions. After landing in Galicia, he walked to the city of [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], where he met the local bishop, Adelfio.

'''Yi In-hwa''' ({{Korean|이인화}}; born January 5, 1966) is a South Korean writer, literary critic and professor.&lt;ref name=LTI&gt;"Yi In-hwa (이인화)" at LTI Korea Library or online at: {{cite web|url=http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Yi was born Lyou Chul-gyun in [[Daegu]] in 1966. When young, he was inspired by his father, a professor of Korean Language and Literature at [[Kyungpook National University]], to become a novelist one day. During his high school years, Yi won awards for various national creative writing competitions. However, after entering college, he changed his career path to become a literary critic. There, he made his debut in 1988 with a critical essay called “Study of Yang Guija” (Yang Guija ron) which was published in Literature and Society, a Korean quarterly literary magazine. After this, he was editor for a couple of literary magazines. Several years later, he published his first novel, ''Who Is It That Can Tell Me Who I Am'' (1992), ultimately becoming a novelist.&lt;ref name=LTI /&gt; His pen name, Yi In-hwa, is a character from Korean classical novel writer [[Yom Sang-seop]]'s work, ''Before the Cries of 'Manse''' (1922).

==Career==

Yi first started his career in 1995 as Korean Literature Professor at Ewha Womans University in central Seoul before getting his Ph.D. After spending 10 years in the department of Korean Literature, he changed his concentration to digital storytelling, becoming professor of Division of Digital Media at Ewha Womans University.

Yi was attracted to the field of digital storytelling in that he started to get addicted to [[MMORPG]]. He frequently stated that he was a huge fan of MMORPG [[Lineage (video game)|Lineage]].&lt;ref&gt;KBS TV show &lt;Do Dream&gt;, (26-Jan-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; He applied his creative writing theories to digital storytelling mainly targeted to games. He is considered to be a pioneer in the Korean digital storytelling field.

In 2016, Yi became embroiled in the [[Choi Soon-sil]] scandal when it was alleged that Yi helped Choi Soon-sil's daughter pass a class she never attended, including having his assistants take a final exam for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jung |first=Min-ho |date= 2017-01-02 |title=Choi Soon-sil's daughter caught in Denmark |url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2017/01/116_221275.html|newspaper= The Korea Times |location= Seoul, Korea |access-date=2017-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on January 3.

==Work==

As can be deduced from its title which is taken from [[Hamlet]], ''Who Can Tell Me Who I Am'' (1992) depicts the madness of 1980s Korea and questions whether anyone was able to find his true self in that era. Yi's critical attitude toward the 80s may be a necessary step before ushering in 1990s literature, but it has often been criticized for its one-dimensional belittlement of a painful era in Korean modern history.&lt;ref name=Minumsa&gt;{{cite book |title=Korean Writers The Novelists |publisher=[[Minumsa Press]]|chapter=Lee In-hwa|year=2005 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yi was an unusual author for the era in that he was a supporter of the [[Park Chung-hee]] regime and in his novel ''The Path of Human''(1997-1998) presented Park as an unequivocal hero, a stance that quickly caught the attention of the press. As a member of the so-called [[386 Generation|3-8-6 Generation]] in Korea, Park would have been expected to be anti-dictator and pro-democracy, but he was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Developmental Dictatorship and The Park Chung-Hee Era: The Shaping of Modernity in the Republic of Korea|chapter=|page=318|author=Lee Byeong-Cheon|publisher=Homa &amp; Sekey Books |location=Seoul|year=2005|isbn=978-1931907354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sparked huge controversy among Korean intellectuals, making Yi one of the ultra-conservative novelists. Recently, he is depicted as a rather progressive figure because of his ardent opposition to Korean ruling [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]]'s online game regulation act.

''Everlasting Empire'' (1993), modeled after [[Umberto Eco]]’s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', borrows elements of a detective novel in tracing the mystery surrounding the death of [[Prince Sado]] and his son [[King Jeongjo]]. An entertaining novel with potential for mass appeal, ''Everlasting Empire'' was also embroiled in much controversy due to the author's over-interpretation of history and the conservative statements he made.  Yi's works, in general, shows a strong political leaning: at times, it is as though the author borrows the pages of his own novel to express his political views and promote the awareness of certain socio-political and historical issues.&lt;ref name=Minumsa /&gt; This book is one of Yi's notable works, being million seller nationwide.

His latest fiction, ''Inferno 9'' (2012), was originally developed for the online game under the same name. The book is about intellectually intensified humans going inside a dream world to solve a mystery. The relationship between the real world and dream world is thoroughly described in the story, combined with his fantastic creativity inspired from games.

===Storyhelper===
Yi and his team under the support of [[NCSOFT]] developed a scenario writing-helping software called 'Storyhelper' (2013). Its concept is similar to existing software such as Dramatica. The programs helps writers design the stories and examine how they are similar to existing stories. Storyhelper has accumulated and analyzed existing stories into 205 motives and about 120,000 factors from 1406 movies. Regarding the criticism of Storyhelper invading the writer's ability of being creative their own story, Yi explained that Storyhelper could not create the whole story for you, it just rather helps writers to design and conceive their stories in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kookje.co.kr/news2011/asp/newsbody.asp?code=0300&amp;key=20120927.22028204555|title=박창희 선임기자의 텔·미·스토리 &lt;11&gt; 스토리 헬퍼(Story Helper)|work=국제신문|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
