The ''[[de jure]]'' legal status of '''[[abortion]] in [[Malta]]''' holds that the practice is illegal. Malta is the only country in the [[European Union]] to prohibit abortion entirely.&lt;ref name=MI2014&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2013-07-14/news/malta-now-only-eu-country-without-life-saving-abortion-law-2068054030/ | title=Malta now only EU country apart from Northern Ireland without life-saving abortion law | publisher=Malta Independent | accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, abortions are ''[[de facto]]'' allowed to save the mother's life.&lt;ref name=MI2014 /&gt;

The Criminal Code states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltahumanist.org/faqs/what-does-the-law-actually-say/|title=What does the law actually say?|publisher=Malta Humanist Association|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"(1) Whosoever, by any food, drink, medicine, or by violence, or by any other means whatsoever, shall cause the [[miscarriage]] of any woman with child, whether the woman be consenting or not, shall, on conviction, be liable to [[imprisonment]] for a term from 18 months to three years"; and

"(2) The same punishment shall be awarded against any woman who shall procure her own miscarriage, or who shall have consented to the use of the means by which the miscarriage is procured."

In 2005 [[Tonio Borg]], a Maltese politician, sought to amend the constitution to completely ban abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20050507/local/plans-for-abortion-law-to-be-entrenched-in-constitution.91186|title=Plans for abortion law to be entrenched in Constitution|date=May 7, 2005|newspaper=Times of Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that anywhere between 300 to 400 Maltese women travel abroad to have abortions each year, mostly to the UK (about 60 per year) and Italy, with Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium being some of the other destinations as well.&lt;ref name=TM2018&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-04/local-news/300-to-400-Maltese-women-go-abroad-for-an-abortion-each-year-AD-chairperson-6736184440|title=300 to 400 Maltese Women Go Abroad For An Abortion Each Year|date=February 4, 2018|newspaper=Times of Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate means that Maltese women have abortions about as often as the EU average, despite Malta being the only EU country which bans the procedure (the rate for Malta is between 3.6 and 4.7 per thousand women; the EU average is 4.4).&lt;ref name=TM2018 /&gt;

'''Addis Ababa Zoo''' is a [[zoo]]logical park in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

== History ==
[[File:Lion zoo Addis Ababa 2.jpg|thumb|Male [[lion]] at the zoo]]
The zoo was founded in 1948 by [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie]].&lt;ref name="Brucheetal2012"/&gt;

== Fauna ==
The Addis Ababa Zoo keeps [[ape]]s, [[lesser kudu]]s, [[duck]]s, [[eagle]]s and [[tortoise]]s.&lt;ref name="EthiopianHerald2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gebrezgabiher |first=H. |title=Ethiopia: Addis Tourism Insight - Know the Public Parks |publisher=The [[Ethiopian Herald]] |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201707120819.html |year=2017 |access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[lion]]s kept in the zoo were found to be genetically similar to wild lions from [[Cameroon]] and [[Chad]], but different to lions samples from [[Ngorongoro National Park|Ngorongoro]], [[Serengeti National Park]]s, southwestern Africa and India.&lt;ref name="Brucheetal2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bruche |first=S. |author2=Gusset, M. |author3=Lippold, S. |author4=Barnett, R. |author5=Eulenberger, K. |author6=Junhold, J. |author7=Driscoll, C.

'''Ariel 6''', also known as '''Ariel VI''' and '''UK-6''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] satellite launched in 1979 as part of the [[Ariel programme]]. It was operated by the [[Science and Engineering Research Council|Science Research Council]], which became the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] in 1981. Ariel 6 was used for [[astronomy|astronomical]] research, and operated until February 1982.&lt;ref name="HEASARC"/&gt; It was the last Ariel satellite to be launched.&lt;ref name="NSSDC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ariel 6 Spacecraft Details|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1979-047A|work=NSSDC Master Catalog|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft was manufactured by the [[Marconi Company]], and had a mass of {{convert|155|kg}}. It carried three instruments; two of which were used for [[x-ray astronomy]], and one which was used to detect [[cosmic ray]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="939">The '''Baja Beach Club''' was an exclusive [[nightclub]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

The club made worldwide news in 2004, when it began offering to implant [[VeriChip]]s into its [[VIP]] customers for identification purposes.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTs48E0NFXI][http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3697940.stm] The club was criticised for making the implanted chips difficult to remove.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/10/05/spark.bajabeach/ CNN - The Price to pay for VIP status]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme has drawn strong criticism from civil liberty movements as well as religious organisations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} 

At the location of the Baja Beach Club is now operates the Opium Mar Club, with a different concept.

'''Calisia''' ({{lang-el|ÎÎ±Î»Î¹ÏÎ¯Î±}}, {{lang-la|Calisia}}) was a "station" on so-called "[[Amber Road]]", mentioned by [[Ptolemy]], formerly universally identified with [[Kalisz]] in [[Poland]]. Besides the similarity of the names, the identification was supported by the closeness between the [[latitude]] given by Ptolemy (52Â°50') and the actual latitude of Kalisz (51Â°45'27").

The validity of these arguments is currently in doubt, mainly due to the identification of Ptolemy's Leukaristos, located at a latitude similar to that of Kalisz, with the name Laugaritio/Leugaritio certainly referring to the town of [[TrenÄÃ­n]] in [[Slovakia]] (this identification is confirmed by a rock inscription made in the winter of 179/180 CE by a Roman military unit, and the biography of the unit's commander, M. Valesius Maximianus, carved on his tomb in [[Diana Veteranorum]] in today's Algeria). As TrenÄÃ­n is much further south than the latitude given by Ptolemy, this identification seems to imply that Ptolemy's data on latitude of places north of the Danube had significant errors, hence making the Calisia-Kalisz identification doubtful.

A '''chibouk''' ({{lang-fr|chibouque}}; from the {{lang-tr|Ã§Ä±bÄ±k, Ã§ubuk}} (English: "stick") (Bosnian: "Äibuk"); also romanized ''Äopoq'', ''ciunoux'' or ''tchibouque'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chibouk "chibouk"], ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).'' Random House, Inc. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a very long-stemmed [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[tobacco]] [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]], often featuring a [[clay]] bowl ornamented with precious stones.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Chibouque |volume=6 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stem of the chibouk generally ranges between 4 and 5&amp;nbsp;ft. (1.2 and 1.5 m), much longer than even Western [[churchwarden pipe]]s. While primarily known as a Turkish pipe, the chibouk was once popular in Iran, as well.

Like Chinese [[opium pipe]]s, chibouk are antiquated smoking devices, and are rarely, if at all produced in modern times. Their use in Turkey and the Middle East may have died out with the growing popularity of the [[hookah]] and [[cigarettes]]. Old chibouk and chibouk bowls can still be purchased as antiques.

Similar pipes were once used in [[North Africa]] to smoke [[hashish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword%3DHashish%26offset%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429164631/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Hashish&amp;offset=0 |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }} ''Probert Encyclopedia'' - "Chibouk"&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialized chibouk were produced to act as long, cigarette-holding pipes. Some had detachable mouthpieces.

[[Enver Pasha]] was known to have smoked chibouk,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/8637723@N05/3431525180/ Detail of 1910 CORBIS photo of Enver Pasha smoking a chibouk]&lt;/ref&gt; as was Jirjis al-Jawhari (Moallem Guerguis Koft), a Coptic Egyptian leader appointed the General Steward of all Egypt by Napoleon in 1798.

''The Chibouk Smoker'' by [[ThÃ©obald Chartran]], ''Turc Au Chibouk'' by James Lewis Caw, ''Interieur d'un cafÃ© Turc'' by Chevalier Auguste de Henikstein, and ''Guerrier fumant le Chibouk'' by Johann Hermann are examples of chibouk featured in art and illustration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">The '''Claeys Formula''' is used in [[Belgium]] by the practitioners of social law to evaluate the notice period that has to be respected when an employee is [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]]. This formula derives from a [[statistical analysis]] of the [[case law]] and takes into account three variables: length of service, age and remuneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Age discrimination law in Europe |last=Bartelings |first=Paul |page=32 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Kluwer Law International]] |isbn=978-90-411-3131-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Claeys Formula was revised and updated as the average notice period being granted by the judges in tribunals was shorter than what was granted previously. The formula now reads as follows:

'''for white-collar employees with an annual gross remuneration under 120,000 EUR:
(0.87 Ã length of service) + (0.055 Ã age) + (0.038 Ã annual gross remuneration/1000) - 1.95 = months' notice'''

The analysis of the case law also revealed that where the annual [[remuneration]] equals or exceeds 120,000.00 â¬, the [[coefficient]] for the remuneration has to be modified, thus:

'''for white-collar employees with an annual gross remuneration exceeding 120,000 EUR:
(0.87 Ã length of service) + (0.055 Ã age) â (0.0029 Ã annual gross remuneration/1000) + 2.96 = months' notice'''

There has been a further update to Belgian labour law which allows for new fixed notice periods as from 1 January 2012.  These however only apply to employees hired as of the start date i.e. 1 January 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4135">The '''European Interoperability Framework''' (EIF) is a set of recommendations which specify how [[administration (government)|administrations]], [[business]]es and [[citizen]]s communicate with each other within the [[European Union]] and across [[Member State of the European Union|Member State]] borders.

The EIF 1.0 was issued under the Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens programme (IDABCï¼. The EIF continues under the new [[Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA)|ISA]] programme, which replaced the IDABC programme on 31 December 2009.

EIF in effect is an [[Enterprise architecture framework]] targeted at the largest possible scale, designed to promote integration spanning multiple sovereign [[Nation state|Nation States]], specifically EU Member States.

For further examples of Enterprise Architecture frameworks designed operate at different levels of scale, see also [[The Open Group Architecture Framework#Alternative enterprise architecture frameworks|Alternative Enterprise Architecture Frameworks]]

==Versions==
===EIF Version 1.0===
EIF Version 1.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/2319/5938.html |title=IDABC - EIF - European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment services |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idabc-eif"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/3473.html#finalEIF |title=IDABC - Documentation on the European Interoperability Framework |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Docd552.pdf?id=19529 |title= European Interoperability Framework Version 1.0|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in November 2004.

Further non-technology obstacles that stand in the way of greater EIF adoption include the facts that [[European Union|EU]] [[Member State of the European Union|Member States]] currently differ widely in terms of:
* Scope of government - services provided, degree of state ownership of businesses, scale of armed forces, police and border control operations
* Structure of government - central/local government balance, what departments exist, how departments interact
* Citizen/state interaction models - processes related to key life events (births, marriages, deaths), document issue procedures, support for foreign languages

===EIF Version 2===
Draft Version 2 of the EIF&lt;ref name="idabc-eif" /&gt; was the subject of a [[political debate]], where the main technology/commercial issues relate to the role of lobbying for proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsfe.org/projects/os/eifv2.en.html EIFv2: Tracking the loss of Interoperability], FSFE&lt;/ref&gt;

EIF 2 was adopted by the European Commission as the ''Annex II - EIF (European Interoperability Framework)'' of the ''Communication âTowards interoperability for European public servicesâ'' on 16 December 2010.&lt;ref name=EIFv2&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex 2 to the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions 'Towards interoperability for European public services'|url=http://ec.europa.eu/isa/documents/isa_annex_ii_eif_en.pdf|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='New EIF'===
On 23 March 2017, the ISA2 programme released a new version of EIF. This version dropped version numbers and is simply called 'new EIF' and should include policy changes of the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en|title=New European Interoperability Framework at the website of the European Commission, ISA2 programme|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gambian People's Party''' (GPP) was a [[political party]] in [[the Gambia]]. It was founded by [[Assan Musa Camara]] in February 1986 and formally launched on 29 March 1986. GPP was a splinter group of the governing [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]]. The party got 15.5% of the votes in the [[Gambian general election, 1987|1987 parliamentary elections]] and 7.96% in the [[Gambian general election, 1992|1992 elections]], but it never won a parliamentary seat.&lt;ref name="code"&gt;[http://www.codesria.org/Links/Publications/ad3_2000/edie.pdf Democracy in The Gambia by Carlene J Edie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Camara contested as the presidential candidate of the party in 1987, and got 29,428 votes (14%). In the 1992 presidential election, he got 8% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/gm.html Elections in The Gambia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The party was banned after the 1994 military coup, and its leading members barred from participating in politics.&lt;ref name="code"/&gt;

The '''Girl Guides Association of Zimbabwe''' (GGAZ) is the national [[Girl Guides|Guiding]] organisation of [[Zimbabwe]]. It serves 15,267 members (as of 2003). Founded in 1912, the girls-only organisation became a full member of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] as the '''Girl Guides Association of Rhodesia''' in 1969. The Wayfarers, a sort of Guiding for native African girls began in 1926 after a visit to the colony by [[Olave Baden-Powell]]. In 1935 there were some 600 Wayfarers and 300 Sunbeams, the African equivalent of [[Brownie Guide|Brownies]] in Guiding. In 1940, the two movements started to merge; this process was completed in 1950. The name of the association changed in 1981 from the Girl Guides Association of Rhodesia to the Girl Guides Association of Zimbabwe.

==Programme==
The programme of the Girl Guides Association of Zimbabwe caters for girls from 5 to 21 years of age.
* Sunbeams - ages 5 to 7
* [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]] - ages 7 to 10
* [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Guides]] - ages 10 to 16
* [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Rangers]] - ages 14 to 21

There is also a group of Young Leaders (Flame Rangers) of young women who are not affiliated to any Unit or help in leadership from 17 to 30 years of Age

==Ideals==
[[Scout promise|Guide promise]] (English version):&lt;br/&gt;
I promise that I will do my best &lt;br/&gt;
To do my duty to God &lt;br/&gt;
To serve my country and other people &lt;br/&gt;
And to keep the Guide Law

[[File:Townsend Gryll Grange.jpg|thumb|270px|An illustration by F.H.Townsend from the 1896 edition]]
'''''Gryll Grange''''' is the seventh and final [[novel]] of [[Thomas Love Peacock]], published in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Thomas Love Peacock (1785-1866) | encyclopedia = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | volume = 21 | pages = 22 | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The novel==
The novel first appeared in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1860, showing a remarkable instance of vigour after his retirement from the East India Company. The exuberant humour of his former works may be wanting, but the book is delightful for its stores of anecdote and erudition, and unintentionally most amusing through the author's inveterate prejudices and pugnacious hostility to every modern innovation.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Peacock, Thomas Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's title turns about the belief of its owner, Gregory Gryll, 'though he found it difficult to trace the pedigree, that he was lineally descended from the ancient and illustrious Gryllus, who maintained against [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] the superior happiness of the life of other animals to that of the life of man.' This sapient character was one of the men whom [[Circe in the arts#Reasoning beasts|Circe]] had turned into pigs and resisted being changed back. His family line had now lasted some three thousand years, but the master of Gryll Grange, not having married, was without an heir to prolong the family. Though he had adopted his niece as heir instead, she had turned down innumerable suitors. The business of the novel is how she at last comes to find a man to her taste.&lt;ref&gt;The annotated text of the novel is on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21514/21514-h/21514-h.htm Gutenberg site]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the sixth satellite of the Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; service, and covers the Pacific Ocean Region from the 169Â°&amp;nbsp;East longitude.&lt;ref name=spacenews-20160229 /&gt; It has a mixed [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]&lt;ref name=satbeams-horizons3e /&gt; and was launched in 25 September 2018 on an [[Ariane 5]] rocket.&lt;ref name=tp-20170424 /&gt;

==Satellite description==
'''Horizons-3e''' was designed and manufactured by [[Boeing Satellite Development Center|Boeing]] on the [[Boeing 702|Boeing 702MP]] [[satellite bus]]. It has an estimated launch mass of {{convert|6|tonne|abbr=on}} and a design life of more than 15 years.&lt;ref name=gsp-horizons3e /&gt;

It is powered by two wings, with four panels each, of [[Triple-junction solar cell|triple-junction]] [[Gallium arsenide|GsAs]] [[solar cell]]s.&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-horizons3e /&gt; The 702MP platform was designed to generate between 6&amp;nbsp;kW and 12&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt;

Its payload is the seventh [[High-throughput satellite|high throughput]] Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; deployment. The Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; is characterized by the implementation of frequency reuse thanks to a mix of frequency and polarization in small spot beams. Not only applied to the classical [[High-throughput satellite|HTS]] [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]], but also applying the same technique in [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] and [[C band (IEEE)|C band]]. The Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; series also keep the use of wide beams to offer high throughput and broadcast capabilities in the same satellite.&lt;ref name=intelsat-wpepicngplatform /&gt;

==History==
'''Horizons Satellite''' was originally an equal share [[joint venture]] with [[PanAmSat]]. It ordered its first satellite, [[Horizons-1]]/[[Galaxy 13]] from [[Boeing]] in middle 2001 and successfully launched it on October 1, 2003.&lt;ref name=gsp-galaxy13 /&gt; During 2005, PanAmSat was taken over by [[Intelsat]], but the relationship continued and on August 30, 2005, Horizons Satellite ordered a [[GEOStar-2]] based satellite, [[Horizons-2]], which successfully launched on December 21, 2007.&lt;ref name=gsp-horizons2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=businesswire-20050830005673 /&gt;

In July 2009, [[Intelsat]] became the first customer of the [[Boeing 702|Boeing 702MP]]  platform, when it place an order for four spacecrafts, [[Intelsat 21]], [[Intelsat 22]], [[Intelsat 27]] and the first Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; satellite, [[Intelsat 29e]].&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt;

On June 7, 2012, Intelsat announced the Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; platform. It would improve available bandwidth thanks to the use of frequency reuse and polarization and feature spot and wide beams, enabling high bandwidth and broadcast applications on a backward compatible way. The first two satellites would be Intelsat 29e and Intelsat 33e.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20120607 /&gt; On September 4, 2012, Intelsat and Boeing announced that Intelsat 29e, the first Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; satellite, would be made by Boeing on the 702MP platform, completing the 2009 order of four such satellites.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20120904 /&gt;

In May 2013 Intelsat ordered a further four 702MP-based Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; satellites, [[Intelsat 32e]], [[Intelsat 33e]] and two as of August 2016 unnamed spacecraft. And in July 2014 a sixth Epic was ordered, [[Intelsat 35e]].&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt;&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20140708 /&gt;

In  a deal that took 18 months, on November 4, 2015 Intelsat and JSAT announced their fourth joint satellite, after [[Horizons-1]], [[Horizons-2]] and [[Intelsat 15]]/[[JCSAT-85]], '''Horizons-3e'''. It would be the seventh [[High-throughput satellite|high throughput]] satellite in the Intelsat fleet, and complete Intelsat Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; family of satellites by covering the Pacific Ocean Region with [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]].&lt;ref name=intelsat-pr20151104 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-pr20151112 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satellitetoday-20151104 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satellitetoday-20151116 /&gt;

'''INSAT 3E''' is a defunct [[communication satellite]] built by [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]. It was launched on September 28, 2003 from the [[European Space Agency]]'s spaceport in [[French Guiana]] on board the [[Ariane rocket]]. The satellite had a launch mass of 2750 kilograms. It is the 4th satellite launched in the INSAT-3 series for [[INSAT]]. It was designed for providing high-speed communication, [[Television]], [[VSAT]] &amp; Tele-education services and was an important landmark in Indian Space Programme.

In April 2014, almost eleven years after being launched, the satellite ran out of oxidizer and a few days later, was decommissioned by the ISRO. In a few days time, it will  be moved to a graveyard orbit.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/after-10-years-in-orbit-insat3e-expires/article5859974.ece&lt;/ref&gt;


== Launch ==
INSAT 3E was launched from [[Kourou]], French Guyana on September 28, 2003 on European consortium Ariane space's Ariane 5-V162 launcher along with two other satellites viz. [[Eurobird 3]] of [[Eutelsat]] and [[SMART-1]] of European Space Agency at 4.44 am IST.It was placed into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) 30 minutes after the lift-off, in 3-axis stabilised mode, with a perigee of 649&amp;nbsp;km and an apogee of 35,923&amp;nbsp;km and an inclination of 7 deg. with respect to the equator. Its [[Master Control Facility]](MCF) is at [[Hassan, India|Hassan]],Karnataka(India).

== Payload ==
INSAT 3E payload consists of C-band and extended C-band tranponders. It has 24 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponders, having India beam coverage providing an Edge Of Coverage-[[Equivalent isotropically radiated power|Effective Isotropic Radiated Power]] (EOC-EIRP) of 38.5 dBW and 12 upper extended C-band transponders having India beam coverage providing an EOC-EIRP of 38 dBW.

==Retirement==

On April 1, 2014, [[Dr. K. Radhakrishnan]], while speaking to the Indian English newspaper "[[The Hindu]]", said that INSAT 3E had been decommissioned. The newspaper reported that a few days before, the satellite had run out of the on-board oxidiser, which is essential to burn the fuel that kept it Earth-locked (fixed over India) and running its daily functions. The ISRO had apparently expected that the satellite, positioned at 55 degrees E longitude, would last a few more months and that it would be smoothly replaced with GSAT-16. The Master Control Facility at Hassan is due to move the expired satellite into a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt;

== Services ==
* Television
* VSAT
* Communication
* Tele-education providing education to the poor and needy
* Tele-medicine administering medical services from the metros to villages &amp; remote areas

'''Intelsat IVA F-4''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-353]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IVA F-4 was part of the Intelsat IVA series which consisted of 6 satellites, of which five were successfully placed into orbit. All five satellites in the series were retired and operated an average of almost 4 years beyond their life expectancies. The satellite antenna allowed coverage from the land masses on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] basin with four point beams and had sufficient insulation between the east beams and the western beams that used the same frequencies in the east and west. The separation of the beam by directional [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] allowed this dual use of the frequency, significantly increasing the capacity of satellite communication within an assigned frequency range. Although the initial requirement Intelsat VAT series was only for the Atlantic service, but also was given special attention during the project to provide service on the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]].

The satellite had 20 transponders (individual radio transmitters) compared to 12 on board each Intelsat IV satellite. It had a total height of 22 feet, 11 inches (7.01 meters) and a diameter of 7 feet, 9 inches (2.38 meters). The solar panels, covered with about 17,000 solar cells, provided primary energy of 600 Watts. The weight of the satellite, which had an orbiting life project of 7 years, was about Â£3335 (1,515&amp;nbsp;kg).

The satellite was successfully launched into space on May 26, 1977, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[United States|USA]]. It had a launch mass of 1,515&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 19 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''international financial institution''' ('''IFI''') is a [[financial institution]] that has been established (or chartered) by more than one country, and hence are subjects of [[international law]]. Its owners or shareholders are generally national governments, although other [[international organization|international institutions]] and other organizations occasionally figure as shareholders. The most prominent IFIs are creations of multiple nations, although some bilateral financial institutions (created by two countries) exist and are technically IFIs. The best known IFIs were established after World War II to assist in the reconstruction of Europe and provide mechanisms for international cooperation in managing the global financial system.

Today, the world's largest IFI is the [[European Investment Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hJmkfWRVF68C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Policing the Banks: Accountability Mechanisms for the Financial Sector |author=Maartje van Putten |page=146 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a balance sheet size of â¬573 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;EIB annual report, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to the two components of the World Bank, the IBRD (assets of $358 billion in 2014)&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/20093/WBAR%202014%20FinancialStatements.pdf?sequence%3D15 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321071505/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/20093/WBAR%202014%20FinancialStatements.pdf?sequence=15 |archivedate=2015-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IDA (assets of $183 billion in 2014).&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt; For comparison, the [[List of largest banks|largest commercial banks]] each have assets of c.$2,000-3,000 billion.

==Types==
===Multilateral development banks===
{{duplication|date=June 2013}}

A '''multilateral development bank''' ('''MDB''') is an institution, created by a group of countries, that provides [[financing]] and professional advising for the purpose of [[international development|development]].  MDBs have large memberships including both [[developed country|developed]] donor countries and [[developing country|developing]] borrower countries.  MDBs finance projects in the form of long-term loans at market rates, very-long-term loans (also known as credits) below market rates, and through grants.

The following are usually classified as the main MDBs:
* [[World Bank]]
* [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD)
* [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB)
* [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IsDB)
* [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB)
* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD)
* [[CAF - Development Bank of Latin America]] (CAF)
* [[Inter-American Development Bank]] Group (IDB, IADB)
* [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB)
* [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] (AIIB)

There are also several "sub-regional" multilateral development banks. Their membership typically includes only borrowing nations. The banks lend to their members, borrowing from the international [[Capital Markets|capital markets]]. Because there is effectively shared responsibility for repayment, the banks can often borrow more cheaply than could any one member nation.  These banks include:
* [[Caribbean Development Bank]] (CDB)
* [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] (CABEI)
* [[East African Development Bank]] (EADB)
* [[West African Development Bank]] (BOAD)
* [[Black Sea Trade and Development Bank]] (BSTDB)
* [[Economic Cooperation Organization|Economic Cooperation Organization Trade and Development Bank]] (ETDB)
* [[Eurasian Development Bank]] (EDB)
* [[New Development Bank]] (NDB) (formerly BRICS Development Bank)

There are also several multilateral financial institutions (MFIs).  MFIs are similar to MDBs but they are sometimes separated since they have more limited memberships and often focus on financing certain types of projects.
* [[European Commission]] (EC)
* [[International Finance Facility|International Finance Facility for Immunisation]] (IFFIm)
* [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD)
* [[Nordic Investment Bank]] (NIB)
* [[OPEC Fund for International Development]] (OFID)
* [[Nederlandse Financieringsmaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden NV]] (FMO)
* [[International Investment Bank|International Investment Bank (IIB)]]
* [[Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa]] (BADEA)

===Bretton Woods institutions===
{{main|Bretton Woods system}}
The best-known IFIs were established after [[World War II]] to assist in the reconstruction of Europe and provide mechanisms for international cooperation in managing the [[global financial system]]. They include the World Bank, the IMF, and the [[International Finance Corporation]]. Today the largest IFI in the world is the European Investment Bank which lent 61 billion euros to global projects in 2011.

===Regional development banks===
The regional development banks consist of several regional institutions that have functions similar to the World Bank group's activities, but with particular focus on a specific region. Shareholders usually consist of the regional countries plus the major donor countries. The best-known of these regional banks cover regions that roughly correspond to [[United Nations]] regional groupings, including the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]]; the [[African Development Bank]];  the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]]; and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]. The [[Islamic Development Bank]] is among the leading multilateral development banks. IsDB is the only multilateral development bank after the World Bank that is global in terms of its membership. 56 member countries of IsDB are spread over Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.

===Bilateral development banks and agencies===
A [[bilateralism|bilateral]] development bank is a financial institution set up by one individual country to finance development projects in a [[developing country]] and its [[emerging market]], hence the term [[bilateralism|bilateral]], as opposed to [[multilateralism|multilateral]]. Examples include:
* the [[Netherlands Development Finance Company FMO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmo.nl/smartsite.dws?id%3D46 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905205104/http://www.fmo.nl/smartsite.dws?id=46 |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; headquarters in [[The Hague]]; one of the largest bilateral development banks worldwide.
* the DEG [[German Investment Corporation]] or Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deginvest.de/International-financing/DEG/ |title=Homepage |website=Deginvest.de |date= |accessdate=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in [[KÃ¶ln, Germany]].

===Other regional financial institutions===
Financial institutions of neighboring countries established themselves internationally to pursue and finance activities in areas of mutual interest; most of them are [[central banks]], followed by development and investment banks. The table below lists some of them in chronological order of when they were founded or listed as functioning as a legal entity. Some institutions were conceived and started working informally 2 decades before their legal inception (e.g. the South East Asian Central Banks Centre)

'''[[Africa]]''' has been an important world region for '''[[Japan]]''''s [[Economic relations of Japan|trade and investment]]. Japan had some historical experience with Africa and little interest in economic ties with the region, except for development of raw material supplies.

In 1990 Africa accounted for just over 1% of Japan's imports and for just over 1% of its exports. Japan's largest trading partner in Africa in 1990 was [[South Africa]], which accounted for 30% of Japan's exports to Africa and 50% of Japan's imports from the region. Because of [[Trade sanctions|trading sanctions]] imposed on South Africa by the [[United States]] and other countries, Japan emerged as South Africa's largest trading partner during the 1980s. This position proved embarrassing to Japan and led it to downgrade some diplomatic and economic relations with the country. Despite the fact that South Africa remained Japan's largest trading partner in the region, both exports and imports in 1988 had declined by more than one-third from their value in 1980. With the end of [[Apartheid]] and normalization of international relations of South Africa in 1994 Japan's special role ended.

Africa was the location of [[United States Dollar|US$]]4.6 billion or 2.5% of Japanese foreign direct investment in 1988, of which most (US$3.6 billion) was in [[Liberia]]. As in [[Panama]], this investment was mainly in the form of [[flag of convenience]] shipping.

In 1989, Japan made very large increases in aid to Africa with the announcement of a US$600 million grant program for the next three years.

'''Klaus Jankuhn''' (born 12 January 1965) is a German record producer and musician, considered a pioneer in the early German [[techno]] scene. He mostly worked for the artists of the rave label [[Low Spirit]], producing artists such as [[WestBam]], [[Marusha]] or [[Fabian Lenz|DJ Dick]]. Together with WestBam he also founded the project [[Members of Mayday]].

== Life ==
Klaus Jankuhn grew up in [[MÃ¼nster]], where he befriended with WestBam. Both started producing tracks for the early techno and rave scene. Around 1986 he moved to [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/der-dj-klaus-jankuhn-produziert-mit-seinem-label-low-spirit-seit-jahren-die-hits-der-techno-szene-tschumm--tschu--tschakataka--tschumm--tschu,10810590,9164386.html Tschumm, tschu, tschakataka, tschumm, tschu], berliner-zeitung.de, retrieved 19 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their first tracks  ''17 â This is not a [[Boris Becker]] Song'' was released in 1985 under the moniker ''Cowboy Temple''. Soon after Jankuhn, WestBam, Fabian Lenz and [[William RÃ¶ttger]] founded the label Low Spirit.

Jankuhn and WestBam also produced the anthems for the annual [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday festivals]] (as ''[[Members of Mayday]]'') and [[Love Parade]]s (as ''[[The Love Committee]]'').

Each of the [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] clans in [[Uganda]] has a distinct [[totem]] to represent it based on a characteristic living thing found in the clan's area. Nevertheless, the O'du ([[Leopard]]) is the general [[emblem]] representing all Lugbara and [[Arua]].

'''Lunik''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|l|uË|n|Éª|k}}) is a band from [[Switzerland]]. There are currently three members.

Lunik started in 1997 with Adi Amstutz, Luk Zimmermann, Mats Marti, Walo MÃ¼ller and Anton HÃ¶glhammer. Singer [[JaÃ«l]] joined the band in 1998 and Anton HÃ¶glhammer left the line-up. 1999 saw the release of their debut album ''Rumour'', recorded largely in an atmospheric [[trip hop]] style. Bassist Walo MÃ¼ller left the band after the accompanying tour, and the second album ''Ahead'' (2001) saw the band steering towards a [[pop music|pop]] sound. Oli MÃ¼ller supported the band as bassist in the live performances, and Adi Amstutz left the band.

The third album ''Weather'' (2003) was a huge success in Switzerland, with an acoustic approach from JaÃ«l, Luk, and Mats replacing the electronica of the earlier albums. CÃ©dric Monnier (keyboards) and Jacob Suske (bass) joined the band as supporting players on the acoustic tour for ''Weather''. A live album, ''Life is On Our Side'', appeared in 2004. CÃ©dric Monnier and Jacob Suske joined the official line-up in 2005, and Mats Marti departed at the same time. In the beginning of 2006, Chrigel Bosshard joined Lunik as the new drummer, but left the band at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/LunikBand/posts/10150510528101749 Post on Lunik Facebook group]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Suske (bass) left the band again in September 2008.

In July 2013 the band members announced that they will split up on their own solo careers. A final album with unfinished works will be released under the title "Encore". The band will also tour for one final time.&lt;ref name="aufltaganz"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ana|last=Hebeisen|title=Es ist alles gesagt|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/pop-und-jazz/Es-ist-alles-gesagt/story/12163336|work=Tagesanzeiger.ch|date={{date|2013-07-27}}|accessdate={{date|2013-08-11}}|language=German|trans-title=Everything has been said}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manwel Dimech Bridge''' is a beam bridge at [[San Ä iljan]], [[Malta]]. It is named after [[Manuel Dimech]], and was officially inaugurated on 18 September 1971 by the Minister of Public Works, Lorry Sant. The bridge is approximately 130m long and 32m wide, and spans over Wied GÄ§omor. It is part of [[Michael Anthony Vassalli|Mikiel Anton Vassalli]] Road (popularly known as Regional Road) just beyond the tunnels on the way to [[Paceville]] and [[St. Andrew's, Malta|St. Andrewâs]]. A commemorative plaque close to the bridge reports that the construction of the bridge, the road and the tunnels were aided by the Chinese government. The tunnels are named after [[Sun Yat-sen]], and the bridge on the other side of the tunnels is named after Ä uÅ¼Ã¨ Ellul Mercer. The bridge was thoroughly restored and reinforced in 2008.

There were eight privately owned radio stations in 2004, including [[Radio Isanganiro]], [[Bonesha FM]], and [[African Public Radio]] (RPA); all of these are broadcast in French, Rundi, and Swahili. Some stations receive funding from international donors. Transmissions can be received from [[British Broadcasting]] and [[Radio France Internationale]].

[[File:forgednote.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A Â£5 note ([[White fiver]]) forged by the Jewish [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] prisoners]]
'''Operation Bernhard''' was an exercise by [[Nazi Germany]] to forge British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|bank notes]]. The initial plan was to drop the notes over Britain to bring about a [[economic collapse|collapse]] of the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British economy]] during the [[Second World War]]. The first phase was run from early 1940 by the {{lang|de|[[Sicherheitsdienst]]}} (SD) under the title {{lang|de|Unternehmen Andreas}} (Operation Andreas, Operation Andrew). The unit successfully duplicated the [[cotton paper|rag paper]] used by the British, produced near-identical engraving blocks and deduced the [[algorithm]] used to create the alpha-numeric serial code on each note. The unit closed in early 1942 after its head, [[Alfred Naujocks]], fell out of favour with his superior officer, [[Reinhard Heydrich]].

The operation was revived later in the year; the aim was changed to forging money to finance German intelligence operations. Instead of a specialist unit within the SD, prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps]] were selected and sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] to work under [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Major [[Bernhard KrÃ¼ger]]. The unit produced British notes until mid-1945; estimates vary of the number and value of notes printed, from Â£132.6 million up to Â£300 million. By the time the unit ceased production, they had perfected the artwork for [[Federal Reserve Note|US dollars]], although the paper and serial numbers were still being analysed. The [[counterfeit money]] was [[money laundering|laundered]] in exchange for money and other assets. Counterfeit notes from the operation were used to pay the Turkish agent [[Elyesa Bazna]]âcode named Ciceroâfor his work in obtaining British secrets from the British ambassador in [[Ankara]], and Â£100,000 from Operation Bernhard was used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] in September 1943.

In early 1945 the unit was moved to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in Austria, then to the [[Redl-Zipf]] series of tunnels and finally to [[Ebensee concentration camp]]. Because of an overly precise interpretation of a German order, the prisoners were not executed on their arrival; they were [[Nazi concentration camps#Liberation|liberated]] shortly afterwards by the American Army. Much of the output of the unit was dumped into the [[Lake Toplitz|Toplitz]] and [[Grundlsee]] lakes at the end of the war, but enough went into general circulation that the [[Bank of England]] stopped releasing new notes and issued a new design after the war. The operation has been dramatised in a comedy-drama miniseries ''[[Private Schulz (TV series)|Private Schulz]]'' by the [[BBC]] and in a 2007 film, ''[[The Counterfeiters (2007 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' ({{lang|de|Die FÃ¤lscher}}).

==Background==

===British paper currency===
[[File:Britannia, detail from a 1931 five pound note.jpg|thumb|upright|Vignette of [[Britannia]] that appeared in the top left of the British notes]]
The designs used on British paper currency at the beginning of the [[Second World War]] were introduced in 1855 and had been altered only slightly over the intervening years.{{sfn|Security by Design, 2007|p=4}} The notes were made from white [[cotton paper|rag paper]] with black printing on one side and showed an engraving of [[Britannia]] by [[Daniel Maclise]] of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in the top left-hand corner.{{sfn|Security by Design, 2007|p=4}} The [[Bank of England Â£5 note|Â£5]], also known as the White Fiver, measured {{cvt|7+11/16|Ã|4+11/16|in|mm|round=5&lt;!-- necessary to keep value of 195Ã120 as used in the citation, template outputs 195Ã119 --&gt;}},{{sfn|Withdrawn Banknotes Reference Guide|p=23}} while the [[Bank of England Â£10 note|Â£10]], [[Bank of England Â£20 note|Â£20]] and [[Bank of England Â£50 note|Â£50]] notes measured {{cvt|8+1/4|Ã|5+1/4|in|mm|0}}.{{sfn|Withdrawn Banknotes Reference Guide|pp=29, 35, 43}}

The notes had 150 minor marks that acted as security measures to identify forgeries.

===Origins of the plan===

At a meeting on 18 September 1939 [[Arthur Nebe]], the head of the {{lang|de|Reichskriminalpolizeiamt}}âthe central criminal investigation department of Nazi Germanyâput forward a proposal to use known counterfeiters to forge [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|British paper currency]]. The forged notesâamounting to Â£30 billionâwould then be dropped over Britain, causing a financial collapse and the loss of its [[world currency]] status.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Pirie|1961|pp=2â3}} Nebe's superior officer, [[Reinhard Heydrich]], liked the plan, but was unsure of using the police files to find the available individuals.{{refn|Heydrich was also the head of the [[International Criminal Police Organisation]] (now known as INTERPOL), and was concerned that the use of the files of known criminals would discredit Germany's control over the organisation.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=5}}|group=n}} [[Joseph Goebbels]], the [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]], described it as "{{lang|de|einen grotesken Plan}}", "a grotesque plan", although he saw it had potential.{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=25}} The main objection to the plan came from [[Walther Funk]], the Reich Minister for Economic Affairs, who said it would breach international law.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=3â6}} [[Adolf Hitler]], the [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]], gave the final approval for the operation to proceed.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=27}}{{refn|The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, outlines a story that Hitler wrote in the margin of the proposal "Dollars no. We are not at war with the USA" and signed his name. Malkin relates that although the story has been repeated in a number of histories, there is no evidence that it is true, and the document has never been located.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=27}}|group=n}}

Although the discussion was supposed to be secret, in November 1939 [[Michael Palairet]], [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Greece|Britain's ambassador to Greece]], met a Russian Ã©migrÃ© who gave him full details of the plan discussed at the 18 September meeting; according to the Ã©migrÃ©'s report, the plan was titled "Offensive against Sterling and Destruction of its Position as World Currency". Palairet reported the information to London, who alerted the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] and the Bank of England.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=7â9}} Although the Bank considered the existing security measures were sufficient, in 1940 it released a blue emergency [[Bank of England Â£1 note|Â£1 note]] which had a metal [[security thread]] running through the paper. It also banned the import of pound notes for the duration of the war in 1943, stopped producing new Â£5 notes and warned the public about the danger of counterfeit currency.{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=26}}{{sfn|Security by Design, 2007|p=6}}

===Operation Andreas===
[[File:Alfred Naujocks.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Naujocks]], who oversaw Operation Andreas]]

On receipt of Hitler's go-ahead, Heydrich opened a counterfeiting unit under the operational title {{lang|de|Unternehmen Andreas}} (Operation Andreas).{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=3}}{{refn|{{lang|de|Unternehmen Andreas}} is listed in histories as either Operation Andreas or Operation Andrew.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=27}} The scheme was also known in Nazi command as Production A.{{sfn|Feller|Hamilton|1985|p=1769}}|group=n}} Heydrich's order to set up the unit stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is not to be a forgery or counterfeiting in the usual sense, but authorised facsimile production. The notes must be such a perfect copy of the original that even the most experienced bank-note experts cannot tell the difference.{{sfn|Tiley|2007|p=52}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early 1940 the forgery unit was set up in Berlin within the technical department of the {{lang|de|Sicherheitsdienst}} (SD), headed by [[Alfred Naujocks]], a [[SturmbannfÃ¼hrer|major]] in the paramilitary [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS). Daily operational control fell under the auspices of Naujocks's technical director, Albert Langer, a mathematician and [[cryptography|code-breaker]].{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=21â23}}{{sfn|Pirie|1961|pp=5â6}} The pair broke the task down into three stages: producing identical paper, preparing identical [[Offset printing#Plates|printing plates]] to the British notes, and duplicating the British serial numbering system.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=3}}

The Germans decided to concentrate on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the Â£5.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=42}} Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added [[cellulose]]. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|pp=5â6}} The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the [[HahnemÃ¼hle]] paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched.{{sfn|''The Great Nazi Cash Swindle'', 2004|loc=Event occurs at 12:30â13:20}} When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in [[ultraviolet]] light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised it was because of the chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.{{sfnm|1a1=Feller|1a2=Hamilton|1y=1985|1p=1768|2a1=Pirie|2y=1961|2pp=5â6|3a1=Kahn|3y=1978|3p=300}}

To break the coded arrangement of the alphanumeric serial designation, Langer worked with banking experts, examining records of currency from the previous 20 years in order to replicate the correct order.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=11}} No records were kept by Operation Andreas and the method of how the Germans identified the correct sequences is not known; the paper historian Peter Bower states that it is possible that techniques adapted from those used in [[cryptanalysis]] were used to break the sequences.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=46}} The German engravers working on the engraving plates struggled to reproduce the vignette of Britannia, which they nicknamed "Bloody Britannia" because it was so difficult. After seven months the forgers finished what they thought was a perfect copy, although Kenworthy states that the figure's eyes are incorrect.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=7}}{{sfn|''The Great Nazi Cash Swindle'', 2004|loc=Event occurs at 16:30â16:40}}

By late 1940 Naujocks had been removed from his position after he fell out of favour with Heydrich.{{refn|Sources disagree on the reasons for the falling out. The historian Anthony Pirie relates that Naujocks was running [[Salon Kitty]], a brothel frequented by high-ranking Nazis and foreign dignitaries; he made a practice of recording Heydrich during his visits, until he found out.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|pp=11â13}} Malkin considers the breach between the two came because Heydrich ordered Naujocks to counterfeit a supply of [[Banknotes of the Norwegian krone|Norwegian kroner]] within a week; Naujocks told him it would take a minimum of four months.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=30}}|group=n}} The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around Â£3 million in forged notes;{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=30â31}} the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at Â£500,000.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=13}} Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.{{sfn|Bower|2001|pp=46â47}}

==Revival under KrÃ¼ger==
[[File:BernhardCaptivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[SturmbannfÃ¼hrer|Major]] [[Bernhard KrÃ¼ger]], shown after his capture in 1946]]

In July 1942, following changes in the aim of the plan, {{lang|de|[[ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS|ReichsfÃ¼hrer]]}} [[Heinrich Himmler]] revived the operation.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=32}} Whereas the original plan was to bring about the collapse of the British economy through dropping the notes over the UK, Himmler's new intention was to use the counterfeit money to finance German intelligence operations.{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=27}}{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=74â75}} The security services under Himmler's control were poorly funded, and the counterfeit funds were used to cover the financial shortfalls in revenue from the {{lang|de|[[Reichsbank]]}}.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=74}}

SS Major [[Bernhard KrÃ¼ger]] replaced Naujocks; searching through the offices used daily by Operation Andreas, he found the copper engraving plates and the machinery, although some of the wire gauzes used to make the watermarks were bent.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=71â72}} He was ordered to use the Jewish prisoners incarcerated in the [[Nazi concentration camps]],{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=26}} and set up his unit in blocks 18 and 19 at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]. The blocks were isolated from the rest of the camp by additional barbed wire fences, and a {{lang|de|[[SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde]]}} unit was assigned as guards.{{sfnm|Tiley|2007|1p=52|Bower|2001|2p=47|Pirie|1961|3pp=18â19}}

KrÃ¼ger visited several other concentration camps to assemble the people he needed, primarily [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|selecting those]] with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking.{{sfn|Tiley|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Pirie|1961|pp=18â19}} In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen;{{sfn|Burger|2009|p=143}} 80 more arrived in December. When met by KrÃ¼ger, he called them in the formal and polite form {{lang|de|Sie}}, rather than the more demeaning {{lang|de|du}}, which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of the prisoners selected later reported that KrÃ¼ger had interviewed them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=86, 87, 90â92}} He also provided the prisoners with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a [[ping pong]] table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by the prisoners, with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; KrÃ¼ger provided musicians for musical numbers.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=47}}{{sfn|''The Great Nazi Cash Swindle'', 2004|loc=Event occurs at 21:50â22:15}}

[[File:Sachsenhausen concentration camp 0009.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], where the forgers operated]]
The printing equipment was also delivered in December, and 12,000 sheets of banknote paper a month began to arrive from HahnemÃ¼hle; it was large enough for four notes to be printed on each sheet.{{sfn|Bower|2001|pp=47â48}}{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=96}} Production of counterfeit notes started in January 1943;{{sfn|Burger|2009|p=143}} it took a year for production to return to the levels achieved in Operation Andreas.{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=14}}

Each section of the process was overseen by one of the prisoners, and the day-to-day operations were run by Oscar Stein,{{refn|The name is also given as Oskar Stein.{{sfn|Ruffner|2002|p=42}}|group=n}} a former office manager and bookkeeper.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=48}} Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working.{{refn|Some sources put the number of prisoners involved at nearly 300.{{sfn|Feller|Hamilton|1985|p=1768}}|group=n}} The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the [[deckle]] finish of the British notes.{{refn|Deckle is a paper with a rough or slightly feathered edge.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=104}}|group=n}} The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six [[History of printing#Flat-bed printing press|flat-bed printing presses]].{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=104}}

To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners stood in two columns and passed the notes among them to accumulate dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front â duplicating how a bank teller would mark the value of a bundle.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=49}}{{sfn|Pirie|1961|pp=87â88}} Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.{{sfn|Bower|2001|pp=48â49}}

The Nazi authorities were so pleased with the results of the operation that twelve prisoners, three of whom were Jewish, were awarded the [[War Merit Medal]] while six of the guards received the [[War Merit Cross]], 2nd class.{{sfn|Littlejohn|Dodkins|1968|p=126}}

[[File:100 USD 1934.jpg|thumb|The [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|US $100 note]] ''(obverse of the 1934 series pictured)'' was considered more difficult to counterfeit because of the complex artwork involved.]]
In May 1944 [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], an SS {{lang|de|[[ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer]]}} (general) in the {{lang|de|[[Reich Main Security Office|Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]}} (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA), ordered that the counterfeiting unit begin to produce forged [[Federal Reserve Note|US dollars]].{{sfn|Pirie|1961|p=158}}{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=150}} The artwork on the notes was more complex than that of the British currency and caused problems for the forgers. Additional challenges they faced included the paper, which contained minute silk threads, and the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing process, which added small ridges to the paper.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=150, 151}}

The prisoners realised that if they managed to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives would no longer be safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of KrÃ¼ger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=150â151}}{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=52}} In August 1944 [[Salomon Smolianoff]], a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes.{{sfnm|Malkin|2008|1pp=153, 158|Tiley|2007|2p=53|Bower|2001|3pp=48â49}}{{refn|Bower gives the date of Smolianoff's arrival into Sachsenhausen as January 1943.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=48}}|group=n}} The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to KrÃ¼ger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=48}}

In late 1944 the prisoners had counterfeited the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were producedâwithout the serial number, whose algorithm was still being examinedâand shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically inferior to the genuine notes.{{sfnm|Bower|2001|1pp=52â53|Pirie|1961|2p=163}}{{refn|Dollar bills of the 1940s were half-linen, half-cotton with a transparency standard of 35 per cent; small pinpricks were visible in the paper when it was examined under a microscope.

===Laundering and use of the forged notes===
[[File:Labers Castle - South Tyrol.jpg|thumb|Schloss Labers, the SS-run facility where the money was stored]]
The counterfeit money was transported from Sachsenhausen to Schloss Labers, an SS-run facility in the [[South Tyrol]]. It was put through a money laundering operation run by [[Friedrich Schwend]], who had been running an illegal currency and smuggling business since the 1930s.{{sfnm|1a1=Nachtstern|1a2=Arntzen|1y=2008|1p=27|2a1=Malkin|2y=2008|2pp=74â75|3a1=Burger|3y=2009|3p=153}}{{refn|Schwend (sometimes given as "Fritz" and "Schwendt"), also worked under the aliases of Fritz Klemp and an SS major, Dr Wendig.{{sfn|Ruffner|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Burger|2009|p=153}}|group=n}} He negotiated a deal in which he would be paid 33.3% of the money he laundered; 25% was given to his agents undertaking the workâas payment to them and their sub-agents, and for expensesâleaving him with 8.3%.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=50}} He recruited what he called "salesmen" in various territories, and built a network of 50 agents and sub agents; some of these were Jewish, deliberately selected because there was less chance that the authorities would consider them to be working for the Nazis. He informed his agents that the money had been seized from the banks of occupied countries.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=129â130}}

Schwend was given two objectives: to exchange the counterfeit money for genuine [[Swiss franc]]s or [[United States dollar|US dollars]], and to assist with the funding of special operations, including buying [[black market]] arms from the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] then selling them to pro-Nazi groups in [[Southeast Europe]]. He also arranged for the counterfeit notes to pay the Turkish agent [[Elyesa Bazna]]âcode named Ciceroâfor his work in obtaining secrets from the British ambassador in [[Ankara]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nachtstern|1a2=Arntzen|1y=2008|1p=27|2a1=Ruffner|2y=2002|2p=46}}{{refn|Bazna realised the notes were forgeries after the war; he sued the West German government for compensation, lost, and died in poverty in Munich in 1970.{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=27}}|group=n}} Counterfeit notes with a [[face value]] of Â£100,000 were used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] in September 1943.{{sfn|Bower|2001|pp=51â52}}

==Final stages of the war==
[[File:Toplitzsee.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Toplitz]], Austria, where the SS dumped printing equipment and some of the currency]]
Between late February and early March 1945, with the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|advance of the Allied armies]], all production of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in Austria, arriving on 12 March.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=169â170}} Shortly afterwards KrÃ¼ger arranged for a further transfer to the [[Redl-Zipf]] series of tunnels where they were to restart production.{{sfn|''The Great Nazi Cash Swindle'', 2004|loc=Event occurs at 36:35â38:00}}{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=53}} The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them.{{sfn|''The Great Nazi Cash Swindle'', 2004|loc=Event occurs at 38:30â38:50}} That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the [[Lake Toplitz|Toplitz]] and [[Grundlsee]] lakes.{{sfn|Bower|2001|pp=54â55}}

At the start of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby [[Ebensee concentration camp]]. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips to and from the camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned what had happened to the first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.{{sfn|''The Great Nazi Cash Swindle'', 2004|loc=Event occurs at 40:05â42:00}}{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=177â185}}

Estimates of the number and value of notes printed during Operation Bernhard vary from a total of Â£132,610,945 (of which Â£10,368,445 were sent to the RHSA central office),{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=117}} up to Â£300 million (of which Â£125 million were usable notes).{{sfn|Feller|Hamilton|1985|p=1768}}

==Aftermath and legacy==
KrÃ¼ger hid at his home until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British authorities]]. Forging an enemy's currency was not a [[war crime]]; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was handed over to the French. They attempted to persuade him to forge [[passport]]s for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a [[denazification]] process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the HahnemÃ¼hle paper company.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=194â195}}{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=29}} In 1965 the [[East German]] writer [[Julius Mader]] published {{lang|de|Der Banditenschatz}}, an attack on the [[West German]] government for harbouring KrÃ¼ger.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=226}}

Schwend amassed a fortune from Operation Bernhard. He was captured by American forces in June 1945, who tried to use him to assist in setting up a counterintelligence network in Germany, the [[Gehlen Organization]]. After he was caught trying to defraud the network, he [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|fled to Peru]]. Although he periodically acted as an informant for Peruvian intelligence, he was arrested for currency smuggling and selling state secrets. After a two-year prison sentence, he was deported to West Germany where he was tried for a wartime murder in 1979; he was given a [[suspended sentence]] for [[manslaughter]].{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=192â194}}

[[File:Adolf burger na konferenci 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Burger]], who wrote a memoir of his time as a former concentration camp prisoner involved in Operation Bernhard]]
Lake Toplitz has been the site of several large-scale searches. In 1958 an expedition located several cases of the counterfeit money from Operation Bernhard and a book that detailed the Bank of England's numbering system.{{sfn|SS Secrets in Files Raised from Lake, 1959}}{{sfn|Nazi "Fivers" on Lake Bottom, 1959}} Following the death of a diver in the lake in 1963âhis two companions on the lake included "a former Nazi secret agent and&amp;nbsp;... a German business man mentioned in connection with counterfeit gold coins"âthe Austrian government undertook a month-long search of the lake, during which they recovered more boxes of notes.{{sfn|Hunt Begins for Nazi Treasure, 1963}}{{sfn|Search for Nazi treasure in Lake Toplitz Ends, 1963}} The zoologist Hans Fricke from the [[Max Planck Institute]] searched the lake bottom for several years for rare aquatic life; in 1989 he took KrÃ¼ger in a mini-submarine on one of his exploratory trips.{{sfn|Bassett|1984|p=6}}{{sfn|Malkin|2008|p=195}} In 2000 the submersible that was used to search the wreck of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was used to survey the lake floor, and several boxes of notes were recovered, witnessed by [[Adolf Burger]], a former prisoner involved in the counterfeiting operation.{{sfn|Connolly|2000|p=15}}{{sfn|''Hitler's Lake'', 2000|loc=Event occurs at 5:50â6:00}}

On seeing the quality of the notes, one bank official described them as "the most dangerous ever seen".{{sfn|Security by Design, 2007|p=7}} Counterfeit notes worth Â£15â20 million were in general circulation at the end of the war.{{sfn|Nachtstern|Arntzen|2008|p=25}} With such a volume in general circulation, in April 1943 the Bank of England stopped releasing all notes of Â£10 and above.{{sfn|Bower|2001|p=52}} In February 1957 a new Â£5 banknote was issued; the blue note was printed on both sides and "relied on subtle colour changes and detailed machine engraving" for security.{{sfn|Security by Design, 2007|p=9}} Other denominations were also reintroduced: the Â£10 in February 1964, the Â£20 in July 1970 and the Â£50 note in March 1981.{{sfn|Withdrawn Banknotes Reference Guide|pp=30, 36, 44}}

The ''[[Tilhas Tizig Gesheften]]'', a small group formed from the British Army's [[Jewish Brigade]], obtained a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents. The forged notes were used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], in defiance of the British blockade of the territory.{{sfn|Malkin|2008|pp=186â187}}

Several memoirs have been published by former prisoners, which include the 1949 Norwegian account {{lang|no|Falskmynter i blokk 19}} by Moritz Nachtstern, and ''Des Teufels Werkstatt'', the 1983 German-language account by Adolf Burger.

'''Selim II Girai''', (r.1743â1748) was the Khan of the [[Crimean Khanate]].

==Selim II Giray fountain==
The Selim II Giray fountain, built in 1747, is considered one of the masterpieces of Crimean Khanate's hydraulic engineering designs and is still marvelled at in modern times. It consists of small [[ceramic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]], boxed in an underground stone tunnel, stretching back to the spring source more than 200&amp;nbsp;metres away, and was one of the finest sources of water in [[Bakhchisaray]].

'''Simbi''' (also '''Sim'bi''') is a large and diverse family of serpent [[loa]] in [[Haiti]]an [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]. Some prominent Simbi Loa include '''Simbi Dlo''' (also '''Simbi d'l'eau''' - Simbi of the Water), '''Simbi Makaya''', '''Simbi Andezo''' (Simbi of Two Waters), and '''Gran Simba'''. Traditionally in their [[Kongo people|Kongo]] context they are all associated with water, but in the Haitian Vodoun context they have wide ranging associations. For example, Simbi Makaya is a great [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]], and served in particular in the Sanpwel [[secret societies]]. '''Simbi Anpaka''' is a Loa of plants, leaves, and poisons.

Milo Rigaud (City Lights, NY; c1969; "Secrets of Voodoo") speaks of Simbi as the messenger of [[Legba]]. In this aspect Simbi is the bearer of souls to all places, and the creative principle.

*[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[MichaÃ«lle Jean]] of [[Canada]], who was born in Haiti, bears two simbi as supporters on her coat of arms.

'''Svetlana Pankratova''' (born April 29, 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monacome.com/2008/11/pankratova-longest-legs-world-record.html |accessdate=19 November 2008 |title=Svetlana Pankratova, the woman with the world's longest legs |date=12 November 2008 |work=MONACO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201114816/http://www.monacome.com/2008/11/pankratova-longest-legs-world-record.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Russian woman who formerly recognized, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', as having the [[Largest body part#Records|longest legs]] of any woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-legs-female Longest legs - female] ''Svetlana Pankratova (Russia) has the world's longest legs, verified as measuring 132 cm (51.9 in) in [[Torremolinos]], [[Spain]] on 8 July 2003''.

While she is not the [[List of tallest people#Tallest female|world's tallest woman]], her legs are 132 centimeters
long. Because her upper body is of much more typical dimensions, she is {{height|m=1.95}} tall. She has also very large feet, size 13 (US) / 46 (EU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wowowow.com/post/svetlana-pankratova-worlds-longest-leg-woman-guiness-world-record-139829 |title=Svetlana Pankratova: World's Longest Legs Strut in the City |work=[http://www.wowowow.com wowOwow.com] |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pankratova was born in [[Volgograd]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. She played women's [[basketball]] at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], [[United States|USA]], from 1992 to 1995. She was an impact player, setting two school records which are still unbroken:

No. 1 â Career Blocked Shots, 1992â95 (176)&lt;br /&gt;
No. 1 â Single Season Total Blocked Shots, 1994â95 (75)&lt;br /&gt;
No. 8 â Single Season Field Goals, 1994â95 (178)

Pankratova appeared in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]] on September 16, 2008 with [[He Pingping]], then the smallest man in the world (before his death in March, 2010), to promote the 2009 edition of the ''Guinness World Records''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2008-09-16-shortest-leggiest_N.htm?csp=34 |title=World's shortest man meets leggiest woman |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2008-09-27 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |work=[https://www.usatoday.com/ USAToday.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-on-shortest17-2008sep17-pg,0,5785738.photogallery |title=World's shortest man, leggiest woman |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2008-10-21 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |work=[http://www.chicagotribune.com/ ChicagoTribune.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her native Russian, Pankratova speaks English and some Spanish. She lived in [[Torremolinos]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="guinness"/&gt;

On March 11, 2013 it was reported that Pankratova returned to Virginia after marrying local resident Jack Gosnell. She accepted a position as an assistant coach for the George Mason High girlsâ basketball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/prep-prep-rally/svetlana-pankratova-woman-world-longest-female-legs-now-215332603.html |title=Svetlana Pankratova, woman with the worldâs longest female legs, is now a high school basketball coach |date=2013-03-11 |accessdate=2013-03-11 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |work=[https://www.washingtonpost.com Washington Post]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Pankratova was surpassed by [[Yekaterina Lisina]] (also Russian) for the record of  the woman with the longest legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7 days quiz: What has this woman entered the record books for?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-41193107|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WWV''' is a [[shortwave]] (also known as "[[high frequency]]" (HF)) radio station, located near [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. It is best known for its continuous [[time signal]] broadcasts begun in 1945, and is also used to establish official U.S. government frequency standards, with transmitters operating on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz.&lt;ref&gt;Transmissions at 25 MHz were last conducted in 2014 on an experimental basis. They were discontinued due to solar flux levels dropping below that needed for propagation at upper HF/shortwave frequencies. This deterioration began in the latter years of the current (24th) [[sunspot cycle]].&lt;/ref&gt; WWV is operated by U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), under the oversight of its Time and Frequency Division, which is part of NIST's Physics Laboratory based in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics Lab|url=https://www.nist.gov/physlab/|publisher=NIST|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWV was first established in 1919 by the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., and has been described as the oldest continuously-operating radio station in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/08/25/641835302/what-closing-a-government-radio-station-would-mean-for-your-clocks "What Closing A Government Radio Station Would Mean For Your Clocks"] (transcript), ''Weekend Edition Saturday'', August 25, 2018 (NPR.com)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 it relocated to the first of three suburban Maryland sites, before moving to its current location near Fort Collins in 1966. WWV shares this site with [[longwave]] (also known as "[[low frequency]]" (LF)) station [[WWVB]], which transmits carrier and time code (no voice) at 60 [[kilohertz|kHz]].

NIST also operates the similarly structured [[WWVH]] in [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii]]. Both WWV and WWVH announce the [[Coordinated Universal Time]] each minute, and make [[#Other voice announcements|other recorded announcements]] of general interest on an hourly schedule, including the [[GPS]] satellite constellation status and any severe oceanic weather warnings. Because they simultaneously transmit on the same frequencies, WWV uses a male voice in order to differentiate itself from WWVH, which uses a female voice. 

WWV's future is in doubt, because it, along with WWVB and WWVH, has been recommended for defunding and elimination in the NIST's Fiscal Year 2019 budget request.&lt;ref name="FY2019"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/director/fy-2019-presidential-budget-request-summary/fundamental-measurement-quantum-science-and|author=NIST|work=FY 2019: Presidential Budget Request Summary|title=Fundamental Measurement, Quantum Science and Measurement Dissemination|date=February 12, 2018|access-date=August 20, 2018|quote=[reduction of] $6.3 million supporting fundamental measurement dissemination, including the shutdown of NIST radio stations in Colorado and Hawaii.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
Since 1945 WWV has disseminated "official U.S. time", as provided by government entities such as [[NIST]] and [[United States Naval Observatory]] (USNO), to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world. WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge beyond the cost of the receiving equipment.

The time signals generated by WWV allow time-keeping devices such as [[radio clock|radio-controlled clocks]] to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment. These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - including shipping, transport, technology, research, education, military, public safety and [[telecommunication]]s. It is of particular importance in broadcasting, whether it be commercial, public, or private interests such as [[amateur radio]] operators.

WWV broadcasts over six transmitters, each one dedicated for use on a single frequency. The [[Carrier wave|transmitting frequencies]] and time signals of WWV, WWVB and WWVH, along with the four [[Atomic clock|atomic (cesium) clocks]] from which their time signals are derived, are maintained by NIST's Time and Frequency Division, which is based in nearby [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics Lab: Time and Frequency Division|url=https://www.nist.gov/physlab/div847/index.cfm|publisher=NIST|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWVB's carrier frequency is maintained to an accuracy of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; and can be used as a frequency reference.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lombardi|first=Michael A.|last2=Nelson|first2=Glenn K.|date=|title=WWVB: A Half Century of Delivering Accurate Frequency and Time by Radio|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/119/jres.119.004.pdf|journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|volume=119|pages=|doi=10.6028/jres.119.004|pmc=4487279|pmid=26601026|quote=The stability of the time scale now allows the station time to be typically kept within Â±0.02 Î¼s (20 ns) of the national time standard in Boulder, and to agree to within 1 Ã 10&lt;sup&gt;â14&lt;/sup&gt; in frequency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ko4bb.com/Timing/FrequencyReference.php|title=Timing, Precision Frequency Reference|website=www.ko4bb.com|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=w2aew|title=#58: How to zero-beat WWV to check or adjust a Frequency Counter's accuracy|date=2012-08-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJ4cQGOQLI|accessdate=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The broadcast time is accurate to within 100 ns of UTC and 20 ns of the national time standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/nist-radio-broadcasts-frequently-asked-questions-faq#listen|title=NIST Radio Broadcasts Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|last=Novick|first=Andrew|date=2010-02-03|work=NIST|access-date=2017-05-13|language=en|quote=The time is kept to within less than 0.0001 milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The transmitters for 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 20&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the experimental 25&amp;nbsp;MHz put out an [[effective radiated power|ERP]] of 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW, while those for the other three frequencies use 10&amp;nbsp;kW of ERP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/wwv.cfm NIST Radio Station WWV] describing 25 MHz broadcast.&lt;/ref&gt; Each transmitter is connected to a dedicated [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], which has a height corresponding to approximately one-half of its signal's [[wavelength]], and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are omnidirectional.  The top half of each antenna tower contains a quarter-wavelength radiating element, and the bottom half uses nine [[Guy-wire|guy wires]], connected to the midpoint of the tower and sloped at one-to-one from the groundâwith a length of {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|4}} times the wavelengthâas additional radiating elements.&lt;ref name="NIST25067"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Glenn|author2=Michael Lombardi |author3=Dean Okayama |title=NIST Special Publication 250-67: NIST Time and Frequency Stations: WWV, WWVH and WWVB|publisher=NIST|year=2005|url=https://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1969.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The once-per-second "ticks" and minute and hour tones are modulated onto the carrier signal at 100 percent, or 0 [[dBc]].  The time code and audio tones are modulated at 50 percent, or approximately â3 dBc, and the maximum modulation level for the voice recordings is 75 percent, or approximately â1.25 dBc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/stations/wwv.html|title=NIST Radio Station WWV|publisher=NIST|accessdate=2009-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022035310/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/stations/wwv.html|archive-date=2009-10-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone service===
WWV's time signal can also be accessed by telephone by calling +1 (303) 499-7111 (Boulder, Colorado). An equivalent time service operated by the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]] can be accessed by calling +1 (202) 762-1401 (Washington, D.C.). Telephone calls are limited to 2 minutes and 35 seconds, and the signal is delayed by an average of 30 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/ttds.cfm|title=NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service|author=NIST|accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast format==
{{For|differences in format used by station WWVH|WWVH#Broadcast format}}
On top of the standard carrier frequencies, WWV carries additional information using standard double-sideband [[amplitude modulation]].
WWV's transmissions follow a regular pattern repeating each minute.  They are coordinated with its sister station WWVH to limit interference between them.  Because they are so similar, both are described here.

===Date and time===
WWV transmits the date and exact time as follows:
# English-language voice announcements of time.
# [[Binary-coded decimal]] time code of date and time, transmitted as varying length pulses of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, one bit per second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.nist.gov/stations/wwvtimecode.htm] NIST's graphic describing the date and time code broadcast by WWV and WWVH&lt;/ref&gt;

In both cases the transmitted time is given in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] ([[UTC]]).

===Per-second ticks and minute markers===
[[File:WWVNBSRadioStation 015.jpg|thumb|WWV seconds pulse generator, 1943]]
WWV transmits audio "ticks" once per second, to allow for accurate manual clock synchronization. These ticks are always transmitted, even during voice announcements and silent periods. Each tick begins on the second, lasts 5&amp;nbsp;ms and consists of 5 cycles of a [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/1000Hz.ogg 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz] sine wave.  To make the tick stand out more, all other signals are suppressed for 40&amp;nbsp;ms, from 10&amp;nbsp;ms before the second until 30&amp;nbsp;ms after (25&amp;nbsp;ms after the tick).  As an exception, no tick (and no silent interval) is transmitted at 29 or 59 seconds past the minute.  In the event of a leap second, no tick is transmitted during second 60 of the minute, either.&lt;ref name=audio&gt;[http://www.febo.com/pages/leapsecond_2005/ Leap Second 2005] Audio recordings of WWV during a leap second.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the minute, the tick is extended to a 0.8 second long beep, followed by 0.2&amp;nbsp;s of silence.  On the hour, this minute pulse is transmitted at [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/1500Hz.ogg 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz] rather than 1000.  The beginning of the tone corresponds to the start of the minute.&lt;ref name="WWVInfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/stations/iform.html |title=Information Transmitted by WWV and WWVH |publisher=NIST |accessdate=2009-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121185529/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/stations/iform.html |archive-date=2009-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between seconds one and sixteen inclusive past the minute, the current difference between UTC and [[Universal Time|UT1]] is transmitted by doubling some of the once-per-second ticks, transmitting a second tick 100&amp;nbsp;ms after the first.  (The second tick preempts other transmissions, but does not get a silent zone.&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;)  The absolute value of this difference, in tenths of a second, is determined by the number of doubled ticks.  The sign is determined by the position: If the doubled ticks begin at second one, UT1 is ahead of UTC; if they begin at second nine, UT1 is behind UTC.&lt;ref name=WWVInfo/&gt;

WWVH transmits similar 5&amp;nbsp;ms ticks, but they are sent as 6 cycles of [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/1200Hz.ogg 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz].  The minute beep is also 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, except on the hour when it is 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The ticks and minute tones are transmitted at 100% modulation (0 [[dBFS]]).

===Voice time announcements===
Voice announcements of time of day are made at the end of every minute, giving the time of the following minute beep.  The format for the voice announcement is, ''"At the tone, X hour(s), Y minute(s), Coordinated Universal Time."'' 
The announcement is in a male voice and begins 7.5 seconds before the minute tone.

WWVH makes an identical time announcement, starting 15 seconds before the minute tone, in a female voice.

When voice announcements were first instituted, they were phrased as follows: ''"National Bureau of Standards, WWV; when the tone returns, Eastern Standard Time is [time in 12-hour format]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1643.pdf |title=NBS Letter Circular 1023: 1956 Guide to NBS Time and Frequency Services |publisher=NIST |accessdate=2009-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720035312/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1643.pdf |archive-date=2008-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1967 switch to GMT, the announcement changed to ''"National Bureau of Standards, WWV, Fort Collins, Colorado; next tone begins at X hours, Y minute(s), Greenwich Mean Time."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1754.pdf
|title=NBS Special Publication 236: 1968 Guide to NBS Time and Frequency Services
|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
|accessdate=2009-10-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this format would be short-lived. The announcement was changed again to the current format in 1971. ''"At the tone, X hour(s), Y minute(s), Greenwich Mean Time."'' The name "Greenwich Mean Time" was changed to "Coordinated Universal Time" in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1771.pdf |title=NBS Special Publication 236: 1971 Guide to NBS Time and Frequency Services |last=Viezbicke |first=P |date=July 1971 |publisher=US Government Printing Office |accessdate=2009-11-07 |location=Washington, D.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808133232/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1771.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voice time announcements are sent at 75% modulation, i.e. the carrier varies between 25% and 175% of nominal power.

===Other voice announcements===
WWV transmits the following 44-second voice announcements (in lieu of the standard frequency tones) on an hourly schedule:&lt;ref name=WWVInfo/&gt;
* A station identification  at :00 and :30 past each hour;
* marine storm warnings, provided by the [[National Weather Service]], for the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at :08 and :09 minutes past, and for the [[Pacific Ocean]] at :10 past;
* at :14 and :15 past, GPS [[Notice Advisory to NAVSTAR Users|satellite health reports]] from the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Navigation Center;
* at :18 past, a special "geophysical alert" report from [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] is transmitted, containing information on solar activity and shortwave radio propagation conditions. These particular alerts were to be discontinued on September 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Weather Prediction Center to Discontinue Broadcasts on WWV and WWVH|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/view/space-weather-prediction-center-to-discontinue-broadcasts-on-wwv-and-wwvh|publisher=American Radio Relay League|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as of June 17, 2011, WWV is announcing at :18 past that the decision has been retracted and that the geophysical alert reports "will continue for the foreseeable future". Here is an example of this announcement from the 24th of May, 2018 at 0905 UTC: "Solar-terrestrial indices for 23 May follow. Solar flux 73 and estimated planetary A-index 9. The estimated planetary K-index at 0900 UTC on 24 May was 1. No space weather storms were observed for the past 24 hours. No space weather storms are predicted for the next 24 hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/geophysical-alert-wwv-text|title=Geophysical Alert - WWV text {{!}} NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center|website=www.swpc.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional time slots are normally transmitted as a standard frequency tone, but can be preempted by voice messages if necessary:
* At :04 and :16 past the hour, NIST broadcasts any announcements regarding a manual change in the operation of WWV and WWVH, such as leap second announcements.  These minutes are marked in the [http://tf.nist.gov/stations/wwv-wheel.htm broadcast schedule] as "NIST Reserved".  When not used, a 500&amp;nbsp;Hz tone is broadcast. Prior to the shutdown of the [[Omega (navigation system)|OMEGA]] navigation system in 1997, an [[Omega (navigation system)|OMEGA]] status report was broadcast at :16 past the hour.   
* Minute 11 is used for additional storm warnings if necessary.  If not, a 600&amp;nbsp;Hz tone is transmitted.

WWVH transmits the same information on a different schedule. WWV and WWVH's voice announcements are timed to avoid crosstalk; WWV airs [[dead air]] when WWVH airs voice announcements, and vice versa.  WWVH's storm warnings cover the area around the Hawaiian islands and the [[Far East]] rather than North America.

====Half-hourly station identification announcement====
[[File:QSL card sent to listener confirming reception of WWV from Maryland - 194007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A 1940 [[QSL card]] for WWV]]
WWV identifies itself twice each hour, at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour. The text of the identification is as follows:
{{cquote|National Institute of Standards and Technology time: this is Radio Station WWV, Fort Collins Colorado, broadcasting on internationally allocated standard carrier frequencies of two-point-five, five, ten, fifteen, and twenty megahertz, providing time of day, standard time interval, and other related information. Inquiries regarding these transmissions may be directed to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Radio Station WWV, 2000 East County Road 58, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80524.}}
WWV accepts reception reports sent to the address mentioned in the station ID, and responds with [[QSL cards]].

===Standard audio tone frequencies===
WWV and WWVH transmit 44 seconds of audio tone in most minutes. It begins after the 1-second minute mark and continues until the beginning of the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute.

Even-numbered minutes (except for minute 2) transmit [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/500Hz.ogg 500&amp;nbsp;Hz], while [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/600Hz.ogg 600&amp;nbsp;Hz] is heard during odd-numbered minutes.  The tone is interrupted for 40&amp;nbsp;ms each second by the second ticks.  WWVH is similar, but exchanges the two tones.

WWV also transmits a [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Tone_440Hz.ogg 440 Hz] tone, a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] commonly used in music ([[A440 (Concert A)|A440]], the [[note (music)|note]] A above [[middle C]]) during minute 2 of each hour, except for the first hour of the UTC day. Since the 440&amp;nbsp;Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour, many [[chart recorder]]s may use this tone to mark off each hour of the day, and likewise, the omission of the 440&amp;nbsp;Hz tone once per day can be used to mark off each twenty-four-hour period.  WWVH transmits the same tone during minute 1 of each hour.

No tone is transmitted during voice announcements from either WWV or WWVH; the latter causes WWV to transmit no tone during minutes 43 through 51 (inclusive) and minutes 29 and 59 of each hour.&lt;ref name=WWVInfo/&gt;  Likewise, WWVH transmits no tone during minutes 0, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 30.

Audio tones and other voice announcements are sent at 50% modulation.

===Digital time code===

Time of day is also continuously transmitted using a digital [[time code]], interpretable by [[radio clock|radio-controlled clocks]]. The time code uses a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz [[subcarrier]] of the main signal.  That is, it is an additional low-level 100&amp;nbsp;Hz tone added to the other AM audio signals.

This code is similar to, and has the same framework as, the [[IRIG timecode|IRIG H time code]] and the time code that [[WWVB]] transmits, except the individual fields of the code are rearranged and are transmitted with the least significant bit sent first. 
Like the IRIG timecode, the time transmitted is the time of the start of the minute. 
Also like the IRIG timecode, numeric data (minute, hour, day of year, and last two digits of year) are sent in [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) format rather than as simple binary integers: 
Each decimal digit is sent as two, three, or four bits (depending on its possible range of values).

=====Bit encoding=====
[[Image:WWV-WWVH time code format.svg|750px|center]]

The 100&amp;nbsp;Hz subcarrier is transmitted at â15&amp;nbsp;dBFS (18% modulation) beginning at 30 ms from the start of the second (the first 30 ms are reserved for the seconds tick), and then reduced by 15&amp;nbsp;dB (to â30&amp;nbsp;dBFS, 3% modulation) at one of three times within the second.
The duration of the high amplitude 100&amp;nbsp;Hz subcarrier encodes a data bit of 0, a data bit of 1, or a "marker", as follows:

* If the subcarrier is reduced 800&amp;nbsp;ms past the second, this indicates a "marker."
* If the subcarrier is reduced 500&amp;nbsp;ms past the second, this indicates a data bit with value one.
* If the subcarrier is reduced 200&amp;nbsp;ms past the second, this indicates a data bit with value zero.

A single [[bit]] or marker is sent in this way in every second of each minute except the first (second :00). The first second of each minute is reserved for the minute marker, previously described.

In the diagram above, the red and yellow bars indicate the presence of the 100&amp;nbsp;Hz subcarrier,
with yellow representing the higher strength subcarrier (â15&amp;nbsp;dB referenced to 100% modulation)
and red the lower strength subcarrier (â30&amp;nbsp;dB referenced to 100% modulation).
The widest yellow bars represent the markers,
the narrowest represent data bits with value 0,
and those of intermediate width represent data bits with value&amp;nbsp;1.

=====Interpretation=====

It takes one minute to transmit a complete time code.  
Most of the bits encode UTC time, day of year, year of century, and UT1 correction up to Â±0.7&amp;nbsp;s.

Like the WWVB time code, only the [[Time formatting and storage bugs#Two-digit year representations|tens and units digits of the year]] are transmitted; 
unlike the WWVB time code, there is no direct indication for leap year.  
Thus, receivers assuming that year 00 is a leap year (correct for year 2000) will be incorrect in the year 2100.
On the other hand, receivers that assume year 00 is not a leap year will be correct for 2001 through 2399.

The table below shows the interpretation of each bit, with the "Ex" column being the values from the example above.

The example shown encodes day 86 (March 27) of 2009, at 21:30:00 UTC. DUT1 is +0.3, so UT1 is 21:30:00.3. 
Daylight Saving Time was not in effect at the previous 00:00 UTC (DST1=0), and will not be in effect at the next 00:00 UTC (DST2=0). 
There is no leap second scheduled (LSW=0).
The day of year normally runs from 1 (January 1) through 365 (December 31), 
but in leap years, December 31 would be day 366, and day 86 would be March 26 instead of March 27.

====Daylight saving time and leap seconds====

The time code contains three bits announcing [[daylight saving time]] (DST) changes and imminent [[leap second]]s.

* Bit :03 is set near the beginning of the month which is scheduled to end in a leap second.  It is cleared when the leap second occurs.
* Bit :55 (DST2) is set at UTC midnight just before DST comes into effect.  It is cleared at UTC midnight just before standard time resumes.
* Bit :02 (DST1) is set at UTC midnight just after DST comes into effect, and cleared at UTC midnight just after standard time resumes.

If the DST1 and DST2 bits differ, DST is changing during the current UTC day, at the next 02:00 local time. Before the next 02:00 local time after that, the bits will be the same. Each change in the DST bits happens at 00:00 UTC and so will first be received in the mainland United States between 16:00 (PST) and 20:00 (EDT), depending on local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end. A receiver in the Eastern time zone (UTCâ5) must therefore correctly receive the "DST is changing" indication within the seven hours before DST begins, and six hours before DST ends, if it is to change the local time display at the correct time. Receivers in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones have one, two, and three more hours of advance notice, respectively.&lt;!-- no, this is not OR. It's just arithmetic. --&gt;

During a leap second, a binary zero is transmitted in the time code;&lt;ref name=sp432&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1383.pdf |title=NIST Time and Frequency Services (NIST Special Publication 432) |last=Lombardi |first=Michael |year=2002 |publisher=NIST |page=80 |accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Confirmed by listening to WWV recording during 2005 leap second.--&gt; in this case, the minute will not be preceded by a marker.

==History==

===Establishment===
[[File:Portaphone radio receiver (1920).jpg|thumb|right|Alongside weekly broadcasts over WWV, in May 1920 the Bureau of Standards presented the "portaphone", with which one could "receive wireless impulses in the form of signals, music or speech, reproducing the same through a loud-speaking telephone and horn".&lt;ref name="portaphone"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015024546403;view=1up;seq=625 "The PortaphoneâA Wireless Set for Dance Music or the Day's News"] by Herbert T. Wade, ''Scientific American'', May 22, 1920, page 571.&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

The earliest formal record of WWV's existence is in the October 1919 issue of the Department of Commerce's ''Radio Service Bulletin'', where it is listed as a new "experimental station"&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066705641;view=1up;seq=106 "New Stations: Government Stations"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', October 1, 1919, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; assigned to the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C, with the randomly issued call letters of WWV.&lt;ref&gt;WWV received its call letters from a block of call signs that the Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, had issued to government stationsâtwo months previously it assigned WWG, WWO, WWU, WWQ and WWX to five Post Office Department stations ([https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066705641;view=1up;seq=90 "New Stations: Government Stations"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', August 1, 1919, page 4). WWV is one of a small number of radio stations west of the Mississippi River with a call sign beginning with W instead of K, as the original call was kept when the station moved to Colorado. As a government station, WWV, does not fall within the FCC's jurisdiction with respect to call signs, and an FCC regulation reserves the call signs WWV, WWVB through WWVI, WWVL and WWVS for "standard frequency" stations ([https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title47-vol1/xml/CFR-2009-title47-vol1-part2-subpartD.xml "Title 47:Subpart D:Â§ 2.302: Call Signs"], ''Code of Federal Regulations'', Government Printing Office).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were also earlier reports of radio demonstrations by the Bureau, starting the previous February.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1919-02-26/ed-1/seq-3/ "Awed Visitors Listen to 'Pretty Baby' Played by Wireless Phonograph"], ''Washington Times'', February 26, 1919, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1919-07-31/ed-1/seq-15/ "Music By Radio Now Fact"] by J. Maell, ''Washington Times'', July 31, 1919, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2559864;view=1up;seq=472 An Almost Unlimited Field For Radio Telephony"], ''Radio News'', February 1920, page 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 1920 the Bureau's Radio Laboratory was reported to be conducting weekly Friday evening concerts from 8:30 to 11:00, transmitting on 600&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000057517858;view=1up;seq=564 "13&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Transmission of Music by Radio"] by S. W. Stratton, ''Technical News Bulletin no. 38'', Bureau of Standards, June 4, 1920, pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the Bureau demonstrated a portable radio receiver, called the "portaphone", which was said to be capable of receiving broadcast programs for up to {{convert|15|mi|km|sp=us}} away.&lt;ref name="portaphone"/&gt; A newspaper article the following August reported that the weekly concerts could be heard up to {{convert|100|mi|km|sp=us}} from Washington. However, it also noted that "The bureau has been experimenting with the wireless music for several months, and has reached such an advanced stage of development that further investigation to them is useless, and they are going to discontinue the concerts."&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1920-08-08/ed-1/seq-26/ "'Picking' Tunes From Air Nightly Pastime With Wireless Amateurs"], ''Washington Times'', August 8, 1920, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 1920, WWV began broadcasting 500-word "Daily Radio Marketgrams", prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Markets, in Morse code on 750&amp;nbsp;kHz, which reportedly could be heard up to {{convert|200|mi|km|sp=us}} from Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015050612004;view=1up;seq=260 "Daily Radio Marketgrams"], ''The Wireless Age'', April 1921, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 15, 1921 responsibility for the reports was transferred to four stations operated by the Post Office Department, including its WWX in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510008571509;view=1up;seq=700 "Radio Market News Service"], ''QST'', July 1921, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Standard frequency transmissions===
At the end of 1922, WWV's purpose shifted to broadcasting standard frequency signals. These were an important aid to broadcasting and amateur stations, because their equipment limitations at the time meant they had difficulty staying on their assigned frequencies. Testing began on January 29, 1923.&lt;ref name=QST&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beers|first=Yardley|title=WWV Moves to Colorado: In Two Parts - Part II|journal=QST|publisher=American Radio Relay League|issue=February 1967|pages=30â36|oclc=1623841|url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/271.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231173753/http://tf.nist.gov:80/timefreq/general/pdf/271.pdf|archive-date=12 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regularly scheduled operations began on March 6, 1923, initially consisting of seven transmitting frequencies ranging from 550 to 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz (wavelengths of 545 to 200 meters).&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112008072776;view=1up;seq=649 "Bureau of Standards to Test Seven Standard Wavelengths"] by Carl H. Butman, ''Radio World'', February 24, 1923, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The frequencies were accurate to "better than three-tenths of one percent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221817;view=1up;seq=128 "Radio Signals of Standard Frequency"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', June 1, 1923, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next, using a wavemeter. The first [[Crystal oscillator|quartz resonators]] (that stabilized the frequency generating oscillators) were invented in the mid-1920s, and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV's frequency broadcasts.&lt;ref name=NIST25067 /&gt; 
[[Image:WWVBeltsville.png|thumb|right|One of the [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]] transmitter buildings (1943-1966)&lt;!--https://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1969.pdf Page 13, no specific year for the photo--&gt;]]
In 1926, WWV was nearly shut down. Its signal could only cover the eastern half of the United States, and other stations located in [[Minneapolis]] and at [[Stanford University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to [[College Park, Maryland]]. Broadcasts began on 5&amp;nbsp;MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in [[Beltsville, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=NIST25067 /&gt; Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an [[A440 (Concert A)|A440]] tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.&lt;ref name=NIST25067 /&gt;

WWV was nearly destroyed by a fire on November 6, 1940. The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered, and the station was back on the air (with reduced power) on November 11. Congress funded a new station in July 1941, and it was built {{convert|5|km|mi}} south of the former location, still referred to as Beltsville (although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to [[Greenbelt, Maryland]]).&lt;ref name=NIST25067 /&gt; WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2.5, 5, 10, and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz on August 1, 1943.&lt;ref name=QST /&gt;

===Time signal transmissions===

WWV had been broadcasting second pulses since 1937, but these pulses were not tied to actual time. In June 1944, the [[United States Naval Observatory]] allowed WWV to use the USNO's clock as a source for its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast [[Morse code]] time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Frequencies of 600&amp;nbsp;Hz and 440&amp;nbsp;Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 30 and 35&amp;nbsp;MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.&lt;ref name=NIST25067/&gt;

A [[binary-coded decimal]] time code began testing in 1960, and became permanent in 1961. This "NASA time code" was modulated onto a 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz audio tone at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated "baaga-bong".&lt;ref name=NIST25067/&gt;&lt;!--The technical information was in the source, but I didn't see any details about the "baaga-bong" sound (including the onomatopoeia), or the "buzz-saw" reference in the next sentence. -- PCjabber 08 Nov 2014 --&gt; The code was also described as sounding like a "buzz-saw". On July 1, 1971, the time code's broadcast was changed to the present 100&amp;nbsp;Hz [[subcarrier]], which is inaudible when using a normal radio (but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a [[chart recorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fey|first=Lowell|title=New Signals from an Old Timer...WWV|journal=Broadcast Engineering|issue=July 1971|pages=44â46|issn=0007-1994|url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/479.pdf|access-date=2009-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720035446/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/479.pdf|archive-date=2008-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWV moved to its present location near Fort Collins on December 1, 1966,&lt;ref name=Reloc1966&gt;{{Citation |url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1730.pdf |title=WWV to be Relocated |journal=NBS Technical News Bulletin |date=December 1965 |pages=215â216 |accessdate=2011-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320232637/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1730.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}.  Also contains details about the construction of the WWV transmitters.&lt;/ref&gt;  enabling better reception of its signal throughout the continental United States. [[WWVB]] signed on in that location three years earlier. In April 1967, WWV stopped using the local time of the transmitter site ([[Eastern Time]] until 1966, and [[Mountain Time]] afterwards) and switched to broadcasting [[Greenwich Mean Time]] or GMT. The station switched again, to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), in 1974.&lt;ref name=NIST25067/&gt;

The 20 and 25&amp;nbsp;MHz broadcasts were discontinued in 1977, but the 20&amp;nbsp;MHz broadcast was reinstated the next year.&lt;ref name=NIST25067/&gt; Starting on April 4, 2014, the 25&amp;nbsp;MHz signal was back on the air in an 'experimental' mode but has since been dropped again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/wwv-s-25-mhz-signal-back-on-the-air "WWV's 25 MHz Signal Back on the Air"], April 7, 2014 (ARRL.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

The voice used on WWV was that of [[Don Elliott Heald]] until August 13, 1991, when equipment changes required rerecording the announcer's voice. The one used at that time was that of [[John Doyle (announcer)|John Doyle]], but was soon switched to the voice of [[KSFO]] morning host Lee Rodgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/dxld5016.txt DX Listening Digest 5-016] "For a short time, a broadcaster from Atlanta named John Doyle's voice was used on the broadcast; the voice announcement was then re-recorded by a radio personality in the San Francisco area named Lee Rodgers." âGlenn Nelson, NIST&lt;/ref&gt;

===WWV and Sputnik===
WWV's 20&amp;nbsp;MHz signal was used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the disintegration of [[USSR|Russian]] [[satellite]] [[Sputnik I]] after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. [[John D. Kraus]], a professor at [[Ohio State University]], knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake a small amount of ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as [[meteor scatter]]. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/01/19/archives/science-notes-death-of-a-sputnik-traced-by-new-radio-system.html|title=Science Notes: Death of a Sputnik Traced by New Radio System|date=January 19, 1958|work=The New York Times|pages=E11|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864206,00.html|title=Science: Slow Death|date=January 27, 1958|work=Time|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]] and [[military planning]], a '''war effort''' refers to a coordinated [[mobilization]] of [[Society|society's]] resources&amp;mdash;both [[Industry|industrial]] and [[Human resources|human]]&amp;mdash;towards the support of a [[military]] force. Depending on the [[militarism|militarization]] of the culture, the relative size of the [[armed forces]] and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.

Although many societies were retroactively perceived to be engaged in a war effort, the concept was not generally used until the last decade of the 18th century, when the leaders of the [[French Revolution]] called for the ''[[levÃ©e en masse]]'' and a general mobilization of society to prevent [[monarchist]] forces from reclaiming control of the French government.

The concept was subsequently adapted and used by [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], especially during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The term ''war effort'' was coined in conjunction with these efforts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Economy ==
Although certain societies, especially [[nomad]]ic [[Raid (military)|raid]]ers and mobile cavalry societies such as the [[Mongols]], specialized in providing war-effort-like support for their armies, the idea of a specialized ''war effort'' that diverted supplies, means of production, and people to military support came into general use only with the increased specialization of the [[industrial revolution]]. Previously, most military supplies were either common elements of the economy (food, clothing, horses) or specialized instruments produced only for war purposes by industries dedicated to the task (mainly [[weapon]]s and [[military vehicle]]s). 

Moreover, in [[feudal]] societies, [[peasant]]sâwho were the great majority of the populationâoften perceived war as the business of the aristocrats, and did not feel especially obliged to make an extra effort to help their country's [[aristocracy]] win a war with that of another country. The modern concept of a state belonging to its "people" carried the concomitant assumption that war was everybody's business and everyone, combatant or not, was expected to contribute actively to winning it.

Crossover use of peacetime elements of society and economy for wartime uses became important due to scarcity of manpower (due to the large size of armies) and specialized materials used for war production ([[rubber]], [[aluminum]], [[steel]], etc.). The complex decisions involved in conversion to wartime use also necessitated organization and a bureaucracy; the term ''war effort'' was coined to describe these collective tasks. 

Implicit in the concept of ''war effort'' was that the entire society was expected to contribute in some way; this served the double purpose of improving [[morale]] as well as resource conservation. {{Further|War economy}} 

A war effort was also used to help companies grow. An example of this was when the military would contract companies such as [[Boeing]] to produce war resources for them. This would eventually give room for innovation and technological advances for these comapanies &lt;ref&gt;https://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2005/march/i_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related is the concept of the [[Home Front]]âi.e., that civilians engaged in wartime pursuits (particularly, industrial production) are in effect also fighting the enemy on a "front" of their own, and that the result of their "fighting"âi.e., higher productivity, refraining from labor disputes, [[strike action|strike]]s, etc.âmight determine the difference between victory and defeat.

== Early life ==
Yoshiki was born on November 20, 1965 in [[Tateyama, Chiba|Tateyama]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], Japan, as the elder of two brothers in a musically oriented family. His father was a tap dancer and jazz pianist, his mother played the [[shamisen]], while his aunt played the [[Koto (instrument)|koto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyojournal.com/sections/features-reviews/item/332-yoshiki.html|title=Japan's Rock Legend Yoshiki Rocks Classical Charts Worldwide|date=December 9, 2013|publisher=Tokyo Journal|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began taking piano lessons and music theory at age four.&lt;ref name="Keyboard Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal| date=January 2003| title=è¡¨ç´ï¼å·»é ­ã¤ã³ã¿ãã¥ã¼ YOSHIKI ãã¢ããã¯ã©ã·ãã¯é³æ¥½ãããããã®æ´»åã«ã¤ãã¦å¤§ãã«èªãï¼| journal=Keyboard Magazine Japan| volume=1| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became interested in classical works by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]].&lt;ref name="Keyboard Magazine"/&gt; In [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary school]], he played the [[trumpet]] in the brass band, and around age ten started composing songs for piano.&lt;ref name="Keyboard Magazine"/&gt; This period was a decisive point in his life.

Dynamite changed its name to Noise a year later.

=== 1982â1997: X Japan ===
{{Main|X Japan}}

When Noise disbanded in 1982, Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, which they named X while they tried to think of another name, but the name stuck. In 1986, Yoshiki founded his own [[independent record label]], [[Extasy Records]], in order to distribute the band's music.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;Seida, Linda.[{{Allmusic| id=p320432| pure_url=yes}} "X-Japan &gt; Biography"]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved January 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]] held by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|CBS/Sony]] which led to a recording contract in August of the following year. The band's breakthrough came in 1989 with the release of their second, and major debut, album ''[[Blue Blood (X Japan album)|Blue Blood]]'', which reached number six on the [[Oricon]] chart and charted for more than 100 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/search/result.php?kbn=ja&amp;types=rnk&amp;year=1989&amp;month=5&amp;week=1&amp;submit5.x=20&amp;submit5.y=7| title = Oricon Weekly Album Chart for the first week of May 1989| work = oricon.co.jp| publisher = [[Oricon]]| accessdate = January 9, 2012| language = Japanese| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130218160521/http://www.oricon.co.jp/search/result.php?kbn=ja&amp;types=rnk&amp;year=1989&amp;month=5&amp;week=1&amp;submit5.x=20&amp;submit5.y=7| archivedate = February 18, 2013| deadurl = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/42172/| title = Xãåæã®ãªãã¹ã¿ã¼åçºåå2ä½ãå¥½èª¿ï¼| date = February 14, 2007 | work = oricon.co.jp| publisher = [[Oricon]] | accessdate = July 23, 2009| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, the band received the "Grand Prix New Artist of the Year" award at the 4th [[Japan Gold Disc Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.golddisc.jp/award/04/index.html| title=The Japan Gold Disc Award 1990| work=golddisc.jp| accessdate=January 8, 2012| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 they released their hit million-selling album ''[[Jealousy (X Japan album)|Jealousy]]'', and were the first Japanese metal band to perform in Japan's largest indoor concert venue, the [[Tokyo Dome]]. The following year they announced the renaming of the band to X Japan in order to launch an international career with an American album release, however, this ultimately did not happen.

He renamed it One on One South,&lt;ref name="Billboard November 27, 1999, p. 52"/&gt; before using it as the headquarters of Extasy Records International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mQ4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=%27%27Billboard%27%27+April+18,+1998#v=onepage&amp;q=''Billboard''%20April%2018%2C%201998&amp;f=false|title=Newsline...|journal=Billboard|year=1998|issue=16|volume=110|issn=0006-2510|pages=33|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoshiki said he considers himself a [[Groove (music)|groove]] drummer.&lt;ref name="drum mag"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.drummagazine.com/features/post/yoshiki-japans-revered-drumming-x-port/ |title=Yoshiki: The Japanese Bono's Bonzai Beat |date=January 2011 |last=Lentz |first=Andrew |journal=[[Drum!]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131013193437/http://www.drummagazine.com/features/post/yoshiki-japans-revered-drumming-x-port/|archivedate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He normally wears a neck brace when playing the drums; as a result of his years of "[[headbanging]]" while drumming, he injured his neck and had to undergo surgery.&lt;ref name="drum mag"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/interview-x-japan-bandleader-yoshiki-hayashi-talks-next-album-neck-braces-and-more.html|title=Interview: X Japan Bandleader Yoshiki Hayashi Talks Next Album, Neck Braces, And More|date=May 11, 2013|accessdate=April 4, 2017|publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Yoshiki stated he is more of a songwriter than a drummer.&lt;ref name="drums"/&gt;
[[File:Yoshiki playing drums.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yoshiki's drum kit up close]]
[[Tama Drums]] created a custom-made [[Poly (methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] drum set for Yoshiki to use on stage, the ArtStar series. Yoshiki admitted that the clear acrylic shells are great for appearances, allowing the stage lights to color his drums with varying hues, but are not ideal sound-wise. He has explained that the clear drums are difficult to play because they do not have the usual responsive of wooden shells and are not very durable; as they require much more physical pounding to deliver a good sound and that causes the heads to be essentially ruined after only a single concert.&lt;ref name="drums"/&gt; Yoshiki's live kit uses two {{convert|24|in|adj=on}} [[Bass drum|kick drums]], and centers the 14" [[snare drum]] directly in front of him. He usually works with five [[tom drum]]s: three rack toms with diameters of {{convert|10|in}}, 12" and 13", and two floor toms with diameters of 16" and 18".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/artist/roster_j10.php?artist_id=369 |title=Yoshiki: Tama Drums |publisher=[[Tama Drums]] |accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the studio he uses a custom made [[titanium]] kit with Evans coated heads.&lt;ref name="drums"/&gt;

Yoshiki usually performs on a [[Kawai]] Crystal II Grand Piano CR-40A. Kawai also makes a Yoshiki-model grand piano of traditional wooden design. He has a constant numbness of two fingers on his left hand that he says makes it difficult to play piano.&lt;ref name="drum mag"/&gt; He also suffers from chronic [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]] on his right hand, which may cause him to be unable to play musical instruments in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.barks.jp/news/?id=1000005270|title=YOSHIKI of X JAPAN speaks out, "My right hand will not recover"|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=April 5, 2017|publisher=Barks}}&lt;/ref&gt;
