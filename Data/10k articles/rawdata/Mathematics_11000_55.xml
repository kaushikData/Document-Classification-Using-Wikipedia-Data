'''152''' ('''one hundred [and] fifty-two''') is the [[natural number]] following [[151 (number)|151]] and preceding [[153 (number)|153]].

==In mathematics==
152 is the sum of four consecutive primes (31 + 37 + 41 + 43). It is a [[nontotient]] since there is no integer with 152 [[coprime]]s below it.

152 is a [[refactorable number]] since it is divisible by the total number of divisors it has, and in base 10 it is divisible by the sum of its digits, making it a [[Harshad number]].

Recently, the smallest [[repunit]] [[probable prime]] in base 152 was found, it has 589570 digits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=%28152%5En-1%29%2F%28152-1%29&amp;action=Search PRP records]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[architecture]] an '''architectural plan''' is a [[design]] and planning for a [[building]], and can contain [[architectural drawing]]s, specifications of the design, calculations, time planning of the building process, and other documentation. 

== The term "Architectural plan" ==
The term "Architectural plan" can have multiple related meanings:
* [[Plan]] for an [[architectural]] project
* [[Documentation]] of written and graphic descriptions of the architectural elements of a building project including sketches, drawings and details. This effort could also include both the design of new buildings and other structures, as well as the planning for reconstruction of early historic structures.
* architectural [[design]]
* [[Floor plan]]
* [[Scale drawing]] of a structure, for example "the architectural plans for City Hall were on file"
This article will focus on the general meaning of architectural plan as a plan and documentation for a building project.

== Architectural plan aspects ==
=== Buildings ===
{{main|building}}
A [[building]] is a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place. Buildings come in a variety of shapes, sizes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures. The gallery below gives an overview of different types of building.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project.

=== Design process ===
A design process may include a series of steps followed by designers. Depending on the product or service, some of these stages may be irrelevant, ignored in real-world situations in order to save time, reduce cost, or because they may be redundant in the situation. Typical stages of the design process include:
*Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] - a statement of design goals
** [[wiktionary:Analysis|Analysis]] - analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]] - investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]] - specifying requirements of a design solution 
** [[Problem solving]] - [[concept]]ualizing and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]] - presenting design solutions
*Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]] - continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** [[Test (assessment)|Test]]ing - [[in-situ]] testing a designed solution
*Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]  - introducing the designed solution into the environment
** [[Evaluation]] and [[Result|conclusion]] - summary of process and results, including [[constructive criticism]] and suggestions for future improvements
*Redesign - any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.

=== Architectural drawing ===
{{main|Architectural drawing}}
Architectural drawings are used by [[architect]]s and others for a number of purposes: to develop a design idea into a coherent proposal, to communicate ideas and concepts, to convince clients of the merits of a design, to enable a [[building contractor]] to construct it, as a record of the completed work, and to make a record of a building that already exists.

Architectural drawings are made according to a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], which include particular views (floor plan, section etc.), sheet sizes, units of measurement and scales, annotation and cross referencing. Conventionally, drawings were made in ink on paper or a similar material, and any copies required had to be laboriously made by hand. The twentieth century saw a shift to drawing on tracing paper, so that mechanical copies could be run off efficiently.

=== Architectural design values ===
{{Main|Architectural design values}}
Architectural design values make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174839/http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Floor plan ===
{{Main|Floor plan}}
[[File:Sample Floorplan.jpg|thumb|[[Floor plan]] for a single-family home]]
One of the major tools in architectural design is the [[floor plan]]. This diagram shows the relationships between rooms, spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure. Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans will also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans will include notes to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.

Similar to a [[map]] in a floor plan  the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional [[map]], a plan is understood to be drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 4 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. [[Plan view]] or "[[planform]]" is defined as a vertical [[orthographic projection]] of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.

=== Planning ===
A [[plan]] is typically any procedure used to achieve an [[Objective (goal)|objective]]. It is a set of intended actions, through which one expects to achieve a [[goal]]. Plans can be formal or informal:
* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in [[project]]s, [[diplomacy]], [[career]]s, [[economic development]], [[military]] campaigns, [[combat]], or in the conduct of other [[business]].
* Informal or [[Ad hoc|ad-hoc]] plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.

A lack of planning in any discipline may lead to a misallocation of resources, misunderstandings, or irrelevant sections added to Wikipedia articles such as this one.

=== Building construction ===
{{Main|Construction}}
Building construction is the process of preparing for and forming [[building]]s&lt;ref name="Sturgis" &gt;Sturgis, Russell. "Construction def. B. and "Building" def. A. ''Sturgis' illustrated dictionary of architecture and building: an unabridged reprint of the 1901-2 edition''. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and building systems.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. "Construction" def. 1-5. ''Dictionary of architecture and building construction''. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural Press, 2008. 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction starts with planning, design, and financing and continues until the structure is ready for occupancy. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of [[human multitasking]]. Normally, the job is managed by a [[project manager]], and supervised by a [[construction manager]], [[design engineer]], [[construction engineer]] or [[project architect]]. For the successful [[Project management|execution]] of a [[project]], effective [[planning]] is essential.

== Related types of design ==
=== Garden design ===
{{Main|Garden design}}
Garden design is the art and process of designing and creating plans for layout and planting of [[garden]]s and [[landscape]]s. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise.  Most professional garden designers are trained in principles of design and in [[horticulture]], and have an expert knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also [[landscape architect]]s, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license.  Many amateur gardeners also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study or [[Master Gardener Programs]] offered by the [[American Horticultural Society]].

=== Landscape design ===
{{Main|Landscape planning}}
Landscape planning is a branch of [[landscape architecture]]. Urban [[park system]]s and [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]]s of the type planned by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are key examples of urban landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners can look beyond the  'closely drawn technical limits' and 'narrowly drawn territorial boundaries' which constrain design projects.

Landscape planners tend to work on projects which:
* are of broad geographical scope
* concern many land uses or many clients
* are implemented over a long period of time
In rural areas, the damage caused by unplanned mineral extraction was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.

=== Site planning ===
[[File:Scottish Parliament site plan.svg|thumb|180px|Example of a site plan]]
A [[site plan]] is an architectural plan, and a detailed [[engineering drawing]] of proposed improvements to a given [[Lot (real estate)|lot]]. A site plan usually shows a building footprint, travelways, parking, drainage facilities, sanitary sewer lines, water lines, trails, lighting, and landscaping.

Such a plan of a site is a graphic [[Depiction|representation]] of the arrangement of buildings, parking, drives, landscaping and any other structure that is part of a [[Real estate development|development]] [[project]].

A site plan is a set of [[construction drawing]]s that a builder or contractor uses to make improvements to a property. Counties can use the site plan to verify that development codes are being met and as a historical resource. Site plans are often prepared by a design consultant who must be either a licensed engineer, architect, landscape architect or land survey. The architect Map is part of a plan in Chandler, AZ.

=== Transportation planning ===
[[Transportation planning]] is the field involved with the siting of [[transport]]ation facilities (generally [[street]]s, [[highway]]s, sidewalks, bike lanes and [[public transport]] lines).

Transportation planning historically has followed the [[rational planning model]] of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing the plan.  Other models for planning include [[rational actor]], satisficing, [[incremental planning]], organizational process, and political bargaining.  However, planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of [[environmentalism]].  For example, the use of [[behaviorism|behavioral psychology]] to persuade drivers to abandon their [[automobile]]s and use [[public transport]] instead.  The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting [[sustainability]] through integrated transport [[policy|policies]].&lt;ref name="f1"&gt;Southern, A. (2006), Modern-day transport planners need to be both technically proficient and politically astute, ''Local Transport Today'', no. 448, 27 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urban planning|Urban, city, and town planning]] is the integration of the disciplines of [[land use planning]] and [[transport planning]], to explore a very wide range of aspects of the built and social environments of urbanized municipalities and communities. [[Regional planning]] deals with a still larger environment, at a less detailed level.

Another key role of urban planning is [[urban renewal]], and re-generation of [[inner city|inner cities]] by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from long-term infrastructural decay. The picture below is an architecture map of a part of south Chandler, AZ.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan, Paul, Proscio, Tony, ''Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival'', 2000. {{ISBN|0-8133-3952-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3page K5.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A three-page book embedding of the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Because it is not a [[planar graph]], it is not possible to embed this graph without crossings on fewer pages, so its book thickness is three.]]
In [[graph theory]], a '''book embedding''' is a generalization of [[planar graph|planar embedding]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] to embeddings into a ''book'', a collection of [[half-plane]]s all having the same [[Line (geometry)|line]] as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the ''spine'', and the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The '''book thickness''' of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called '''pagenumber''', '''stacknumber''' or '''fixed outerthickness'''. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other [[graph invariant]]s including the pagewidth and book crossing number.

Every graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices has book thickness at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil n/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;, and this formula gives the exact book thickness for [[complete graph]]s. The graphs with book thickness one are the [[outerplanar graph]]s. The graphs with book thickness at most two are the [[subhamiltonian graph]]s, which are always [[planar graph|planar]]; more generally, every planar graph has book thickness at most four. All [[Robertson–Seymour theorem|minor-closed graph families]], and in particular the graphs with bounded [[treewidth]] or bounded [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]], also have bounded book thickness. It is [[NP-hard]] to determine the exact book thickness of a given graph, with or without knowing a fixed vertex ordering along the spine of the book.

One of the original motivations for studying book embeddings involved applications in [[VLSI]] design, in which the vertices of a book embedding represent components of a circuit and the wires represent connections between them.
Book embedding also has applications in [[graph drawing]], where two of the standard visualization styles for graphs, [[arc diagram]]s and [[circular layout]]s, can be constructed using book embeddings.

In [[transportation planning]], the different sources and destinations of foot and vehicle traffic that meet and interact at a [[traffic light]] can be modeled mathematically as the vertices of a graph, with edges connecting different source-destination pairs. A book embedding of this graph can be used to design a schedule that lets all the traffic move across the intersection with as few signal phases as possible.
In [[bioinformatics]] problems involving the folding structure of [[RNA]], single-page book embeddings represent classical forms of [[nucleic acid secondary structure]], and two-page book embeddings represent [[pseudoknot]]s.
Other applications of book embeddings include  [[abstract algebra]] and [[knot theory]].

There are several [[open problem]]s concerning book thickness. It is unknown whether the book thickness of an arbitrary graph can be bounded by a function of the book thickness of its [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivisions]].
Testing the existence of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along the spine of the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every planar graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a planar graph whose book thickness is exactly four.

==History==
The notion of a book, as a topological space, was defined by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="persinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a68"&gt;{{citation

The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs into any other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, edges are represented by curves, and the only way that two edges can intersect is for them to meet at a common endpoint.

In the early 1970s,  [[Paul Chester Kainen|Paul C. Kainen]] and L. Taylor Ollmann developed a more restricted type of embedding that came to be used in most subsequent research. In their formulation, the graph's vertices must be placed along the spine of the book, and each edge must lie in a single page.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For the "back" and "leaves" terminology, see {{harvtxt|Persinger|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; each having the spine as its boundary. Books with a [[finite set|finite number]] of pages can be [[Embedding|embedded]] into three-dimensional space, for instance by choosing {{mvar|ℓ}} to be the {{mvar|z}}-axis of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] and choosing the pages to be the {{mvar|k}} half-planes whose [[dihedral angle]] with respect to the {{mvar|xz}}-plane is an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}/''k''}}.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt;

A '''book drawing''' of a finite graph {{mvar|G}} onto a book {{mvar|B}} is a [[graph drawing|drawing]] of {{mvar|G}} on {{mvar|B}} such that every vertex of {{mvar|G}} is drawn as a point on the spine of {{mvar|B}}, and every edge of {{mvar|G}} is drawn as a [[curve]] that lies within a single page of {{mvar|B}}. The {{mvar|k}}-page '''book crossing number''' of {{mvar|G}} is the minimum [[crossing number (graph theory)|number of crossings]] in a {{mvar|k}}-page book drawing.&lt;ref name="sssv"&gt;{{citation

A '''book embedding''' of {{mvar|G}} onto {{mvar|B}} is a book drawing that forms a [[graph embedding]] of {{mvar|G}} into {{mvar|B}}. That is, it is a book drawing of {{mvar|G}} on {{mvar|B}} that does not have any edge crossings.
Every finite graph has a book embedding onto a book with a large enough number of pages. For instance, it is always possible to embed each edge of the graph on its own separate page.
The '''book thickness''', '''pagenumber''', or '''stack number''' of {{mvar|G}} is the minimum number of pages required for a book embedding of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|G}}.
Another parameter that measures the quality of a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its '''pagewidth'''. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a [[ray (geometry)|ray]] perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.&lt;ref name="h87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

It is crucial for these definitions that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across the spine of the book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book.&lt;ref name="em99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bo99"/&gt; For such a three-page '''topological book embedding''' in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge,&lt;ref name="em99"&gt;{{citation

==Specific graphs==
As shown in the first figure, the book thickness of the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} is three: as a non-planar graph its book thickness is greater than two, but a book embedding with three pages exists. More generally, the book thickness of every complete graph with {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} vertices is exactly &lt;math&gt;\lceil n/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;. This result also gives an [[upper bound]] on the maximum possible book thickness of any {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt;

The two-page crossing number of the complete graph {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} \biggl\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\biggr\rfloor\biggl\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\biggr\rfloor\biggl\lfloor\frac{n-2}{2}\biggr\rfloor\biggl\lfloor\frac{n-3}{2}\biggr\rfloor,&lt;/math&gt;
matching a still-unproven conjecture of [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]] on what the unrestricted crossing number of this graph should be. That is, if Hill's conjecture is correct, then the drawing of this graph that minimizes the number of crossings is a two-page drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The book thickness of the [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''a'',''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is at most {{math|min(''a'',''b'')}}. To construct a drawing with this book thickness, for each vertex on the smaller side of the bipartition, one can place the edges incident with that vertex on their own page. This bound is not always tight; for instance, {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt;}} has book thickness three, not four. However, when the two sides of the graph are very unbalanced, with {{math|''b'' &gt; ''a''(''a'' &amp;minus; 1)}}, the book thickness of {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''a'',''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is exactly {{mvar|a}}.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For additional results on the book thickness of complete bipartite graphs, see {{citation

==Properties==

===Planarity and outerplanarity===
[[File:Goldner-Harary graph.svg|thumb|The [[Goldner–Harary graph]], a planar graph with book thickness three]]
The book thickness of a given graph {{mvar|G}} is at most one if and only if {{mvar|G}} is an [[outerplanar graph]]. An outerplanar graph is a graph that has a planar embedding in which all vertices belong to the outer face of the embedding. For such a graph, placing the vertices in the same order along the spine as they appear in the outer face provides a one-page book embedding of the given graph. (An [[articulation point]] of the graph will necessarily appear more than once in the cyclic ordering of vertices around the outer face, but only one of those copies should be included in the book embedding.) Conversely, a one-page book embedding is automatically an outerplanar embedding. For, if a graph is embedded on a single page, and another half-plane is attached to the spine to extend its page to a complete plane, then the outer face of the embedding includes the entire added half-plane, and all vertices lie on this outer face.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h87"/&gt;

Every two-page book embedding is a special case of a planar embedding, because the union of two pages of a book is a space topologically equivalent to the whole plane. Therefore, every graph with book thickness two is automatically a [[planar graph]]. More precisely, the book thickness of a graph {{mvar|G}} is at most two if and only if {{mvar|G}} is a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of a planar graph that has a [[Hamiltonian cycle]].&lt;ref name="bk"&gt;{{citation

The [[Goldner–Harary graph]] provides an example of a planar graph that does not have book thickness two: it is a [[maximal planar graph]], so it is not possible to add any edges to it while preserving planarity, and it does not have a Hamiltonian cycle.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt; Because of this characterization by Hamiltonian cycles, graphs that have two-page book embeddings are also known as [[subhamiltonian graph]]s.&lt;ref name="h87"&gt;{{citation

{{unsolved|mathematics|Can the book thickness of a graph be upper bounded by a function of the book thickness of its subdivision?}}
[[File:Diamond graph.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|The book thickness of the diamond graph increases after edge subdivision]]
[[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|Subdividing]] every edge of a graph into two-edge paths, by adding new vertices within each edge, may sometimes increase its book thickness. For instance, the [[diamond graph]] has book thickness one (it is outerplanar) but its subdivision has book thickness two (it is planar and subhamiltonian but not outerplanar). However, this subdivision process can also sometimes significantly reduce the book thickness of the subdivided graph. For instance, the book thickness of the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is proportional to its number of vertices, but subdividing each of its edges into a two-edge path produces a subdivision whose book thickness is much smaller, only &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="e01"&gt;{{citation|title=Separating geometric thickness from book thickness|first=David|last=Eppstein|authorlink=David Eppstein|arxiv=math.CO/0109195|year=2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the existence of examples such as this one, {{harvtxt|Blankenship|Oporowski|1999}} [[conjecture]]d that a subdivision's book thickness cannot be too much smaller than that of the original graph. Specifically, they conjectured that there exists a function {{mvar|f}} such that, for every graph {{mvar|G}} and for the graph {{mvar|H}} formed by replacing every edge in {{mvar|G}} by a two-edge path, if the book thickness of {{mvar|H}} is {{mvar|t}} then the book thickness of {{mvar|G}} is at most {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.&lt;ref name="bo99"&gt;{{citation|first1=Robin|last1=Blankenship|first2=Bogdan|last2=Oporowski|title=Drawing Subdivisions Of Complete And Complete Bipartite Graphs On Books|series=Technical Report 1999-4|publisher=Department of Mathematics, Louisiana State University|year=1999|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.36.4358}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2013, the '''Blankenship–Oporowski conjecture''' remains unproven.&lt;ref name="opg-bts"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/book_thickness_of_subdivisions|work=Open Problem Garden|title=Book Thickness of Subdivisions|accessdate=2013-02-05|date=January 19, 2009|first=David|last=Wood}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to other graph invariants===
Book thickness is related to [[thickness (graph theory)|thickness]], the number of planar graphs needed to cover the edges of the given graph. A graph {{mvar|G}} has thickness {{mvar|&amp;theta;}} if it can be drawn in the plane, and its edges [[edge coloring|colored]] with {{mvar|&amp;theta;}} colors, in such a way that edges of the same color as each other do not cross. Analogously, a graph {{mvar|G}} has book thickness {{mvar|&amp;theta;}} if it can be drawn in a [[half plane]], with its vertices on the boundary of the half plane, with its edges colored with {{mvar|&amp;theta;}} colors with no crossing between two edges of the same color. In this formulation of book thickness, the colors of the edges correspond to the pages of the book embedding. However, thickness and book thickness can be very different from each other: there exist graphs ([[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivisions]] of [[complete graph]]s) that have unbounded book thickness,&lt;ref name="e01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="em99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bo99"/&gt; despite having thickness two.&lt;ref name="e01"/&gt;

Every [[shallow minor]] of a graph of bounded book thickness is a [[sparse graph]], whose ratio of edges to vertices is bounded by a constant that depends only on the depth of the minor and on the book thickness. That is, in the terminology of {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, the graphs of bounded book thickness have [[bounded expansion]].&lt;ref name="nodm"/&gt; However, even the graphs of bounded [[degree (graph theory)|degree]], a much stronger requirement than having bounded expansion, can have unbounded book thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Because graphs of book thickness two are planar graphs, they obey the [[planar separator theorem]]: they have separators, subsets of vertices whose removal splits the graph into pieces with at most {{math|2''n''/3}} vertices each, with only &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt n)&lt;/math&gt; vertices in the separator.

The edges within a single page of a book embedding behave in some ways like a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack data structure]]. This can be formalized by considering an arbitrary sequence of push and pop operations on a stack, and forming a graph in which the stack operations correspond to the vertices of the graph, placed in sequence order along the spine of a book embedding. Then, if one draws an edge from each pop operation that pops an object {{mvar|x}} from the stack, to the previous push operation that pushed {{mvar|x}}, the resulting graph will automatically have a one-page embedding. For this reason, the page number of a graph has also been called its '''stack number'''. In the same way, one may consider an arbitrary sequence of enqueue and dequeue operations of a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue data structure]], and form a graph that has these operations as its vertices, placed in order on the spine of a single page, with an edge between each enqueue operation and the corresponding dequeue. Then, in this graph, each two edges will either cross or cover disjoint intervals on the spine. By analogy, researchers have defined a queue embedding of a graph to be an embedding in a topological book such that each vertex lies on the spine, each edge lies in a single page, and each two edges in the same page either cross or cover disjoint intervals on the spine. The minimum number of pages needed for a queue embedding of a graph is called its [[queue number]].&lt;ref name="nodm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Computational complexity===
[[File:Circle graph and circle model.svg|thumb|A [[circle graph]], the [[intersection graph]] of chords of a circle. For book embeddings with a fixed vertex order, finding the book thickness is equivalent to coloring a derived circle graph.]]
Finding the book thickness of a graph is [[NP-hard]].
This follows from the fact that finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal planar graphs is [[NP-complete]]. In a maximal planar graph, the book thickness is two if and only if a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal planar graph is two.&lt;ref name="clr"/&gt;

If an ordering of the vertices of a graph along the spine of an embedding is fixed, then a two-page embedding (if it exists) can be found in [[linear time]], as an instance of [[planarity testing]] for a graph formed by augmenting the given graph with a cycle connecting the vertices in their spine ordering.&lt;ref name="hs99"/&gt; {{harvtxt|Unger|1992}} claimed that finding three-page embeddings with a fixed spine ordering can also be performed in [[polynomial time]] although his writeup of this result omits many details.&lt;ref name="u-stacs-92"&gt;{{citation

Given a graph {{mvar|G}} with a fixed spine ordering for its vertices, drawing these vertices in the same order around a circle and drawing the edges of {{mvar|G}} as line segments produces a collection of chords representing {{mvar|G}}. One can then form a circle graph that has the chords of this diagram as vertices and crossing pairs of chords as edges. A coloring of the circle graph represents a partition of the edges of {{mvar|G}} into subsets that can be drawn without crossing on a single page. Therefore, an optimal coloring is equivalent to an optimal book embedding. Since circle graph coloring with four or more colors is NP-hard, and since any circle graph can be formed in this way from some book embedding problem, it follows that optimal book embedding is also NP-hard.&lt;ref name="u88"&gt;{{citation

However, it is NP-complete to find a 2-page embedding when neither the spine ordering nor the edge partition is known.
Finding the book crossing number of a graph is also NP-hard, because of the NP-completeness of the special case of testing whether the 2-page crossing number is zero.

As a consequence of bounded expansion, the [[subgraph isomorphism]] problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The same is true for detecting whether the pattern graph is an [[induced subgraph]] of the larger graph, or whether it has a [[graph homomorphism]] to the larger graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Corollary 18.1, p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|Bekos|Kaufmann|Zielke|2015}} describe a system for finding optimal book embeddings by transforming the problem into an instance of the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] and applying a SAT solver to the resulting problem. They state that their system is capable of finding an optimal embedding for 400-vertex [[maximal planar graph]]s in approximately 20 minutes, and that it was successfully applied to a 600-vertex graph that Yannakakis had proposed as requiring four pages, but that turned out to require only three pages.&lt;ref name="bkz15"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Fault-tolerant multiprocessing===
One of the main motivations for studying book embedding cited by {{harvtxt|Chung|Leighton|Rosenberg|1987}} involves an application in [[VLSI]] design, to the organization of [[fault tolerance|fault-tolerant]] [[multiprocessor]]s. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the [[CPU]]s of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a logical sequence corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence may not necessarily be placed along a line in the [[physical layout]] of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into "bundles" which correspond to the pages of a book and act like [[Stack (abstract data type)|stacks]]: connecting one of the processors to the start of a new communications link pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle and pops all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle can handle a set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding.  By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network.  The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.&lt;ref name="clr"&gt;{{citation

===Stack sorting===
Another application cited by {{harvtxt|Chung|Leighton|Rosenberg|1987}} concerns sorting [[permutation]]s using [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]]s.
An influential result of {{harvs|first=Donald|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|year=1968|txt}} showed that a system that processes a [[data stream]] by pushing incoming elements onto a 
stack and then, at appropriately chosen times, popping them from the stack onto an output stream can [[sorting algorithm|sort]] the data if and only if its initial order is described by a [[permutation]] that avoids the [[permutation pattern]] 231.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

In the system considered by {{harvtxt|Chung|Leighton|Rosenberg|1987}}, each element from an input data stream must be pushed onto one of several stacks. Then, once all of the data has been pushed in this way, the items are popped from these stacks (in an appropriate order) onto an output stream. As Chung et al. observe, a given permutation can be sorted by this system if and only if a certain graph, derived from the permutation, has a book embedding with the vertices in a certain fixed order along the spine and with a number of pages that is at most equal to the number of stacks.&lt;ref name="clr"/&gt;

===Traffic control===
[[File:Street Intersection diagram.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|A traffic intersection. The four incoming and four outgoing pairs of through lanes, two turn pockets, and four crosswalk corners can be represented as a set of 14 vertices on the spine of a book embedding, with edges representing connections between these points.]]
As {{harvtxt|Kainen|1990}} described, a book embedding may be used to describe the phases of a [[traffic signal]] at a controlled intersection.
At an intersection, the incoming and outgoing lanes of traffic (including the ends of pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both belong to the same segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.&lt;ref name="kainen"&gt;{{citation

===Graph drawing===
[[File:Goldner-Harary-linear.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|An [[arc diagram]] of the [[Goldner–Harary graph]]. In order to create a planar diagram, two triangles of the graph have been subdivided into four by the dashed red line, causing one of the graph edges to extend both above and below the line.]]
Book embedding has also been frequently applied in the visualization of network data. Two of the standard layouts in [[graph drawing]], arc diagrams&lt;ref name="w02"/&gt; and circular layouts,&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt; can be viewed as book embeddings, and book embedding has also been applied in the construction of clustered layouts,&lt;ref name="hn09"/&gt; simultaneous embeddings,&lt;ref name="adfpr"/&gt; and three-dimensional graph drawings.&lt;ref name="wood02"/&gt;

This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing numbers]] of graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For one-page drawings of either style, it is important to keep the number of crossings small as a way of reducing the visual clutter of the drawing.

Two-page book embeddings with a fixed partition of the edges into pages can be interpreted as a form of [[clustered planarity]], in which the given graph must be drawn in such a way that parts of the graph (the two subsets of edges) are placed in the drawing in a way that reflects their clustering.&lt;ref name="hn09"/&gt; Two-page book embedding has also been used to find [[simultaneous embedding]]s of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.&lt;ref name="adfpr"&gt;{{citation

Book embeddings with more than two pages have also been used to construct three-dimensional drawings of graphs.

===RNA folding===
[[File:Pseudoknot.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|A fragment of human [[telomerase]] showing a [[pseudoknot]]. If the fragment is stretched straight along the spine of a book embedding, the blue base pairs can be drawn in two non-crossing subsets above and below the spine, showing that this pseudoknot forms a bi-secondary structure.]]
In the study of how [[RNA]] molecules fold to form their structure, the standard form of [[nucleic acid secondary structure]] can be described diagrammatically as a chain of bases (the RNA sequence itself), drawn along a line, together with a collection of arcs above the line describing the [[basepair]]s of the structure. That is, although these structures actually have a complicated three-dimensional shape, their connectivity (when a secondary structure exists) can be described by a more abstract structure, a one-page book embedding. However, not all RNA folds behave in this simple way. {{harvtxt|Haslinger|Stadler|1999}} have proposed a so-called "bi-secondary structure" for certain RNA [[pseudoknot]]s that takes the form of a two-page book embedding: the RNA sequence is again drawn along a line, but the basepairs are drawn as arcs both above and below this line. In order to form a bi-secondary structure, a graph must have maximum degree at most three: each base can only participate in one arc of the diagram, in addition to the two links to its neighbors in the base sequence. Advantages of this formulation include the facts that it excludes structures that are actually knotted in space, and that it matches most known RNA pseudoknots.&lt;ref name="hs99"&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 61
 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the spine ordering is known in advance for this application, testing for the existence of a bi-secondary structure for a given basepairing is straightforward. The problem of assigning edges to the two pages in a compatible way can be formulated as either an instance of [[2-satisfiability]], or as a problem of testing the [[bipartite graph|bipartiteness]] of the [[circle graph]] whose vertices are the basepairs and whose edges describe crossings between basepairs.&lt;ref name="hs99"/&gt; Alternatively and more efficiently, as  {{harvtxt|Haslinger|Stadler|1999}} show, a bi-secondary structure exists if and only if the ''diagram graph'' of the input (a graph formed by connecting the bases into a cycle in their sequence order and adding the given basepairs as edges) is a [[planar graph]].&lt;ref name="hs99"/&gt; This characterization allows bi-secondary structures to be recognized in [[linear time]] as an instance of [[planarity testing]].

{{harvtxt|Blin|Fertin|Rusu|Sinoquet|2007}} used the connection between secondary structures and book embeddings as part of a proof of the [[NP-hard]]ness of certain problems in RNA secondary structure comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

And if an RNA structure is tertiary rather than bi-secondary (that is, if it requires more than two pages in its diagram), then determining the page number is again NP-hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Computational complexity theory===
{{harvtxt|Pavan|Tewari|Vinodchandran|2012}} used book embedding to study the [[computational complexity theory]] of the [[reachability]] problem in [[directed graph]]s. As they have observed, reachability for two-page directed graphs may be solved in unambiguous logarithmic space (the analogue, for [[L (complexity)|logarithmic space complexity]], of the class [[UP (complexity)|UP]] of unambiguous polynomial-time problems). However, reachability for three-page directed graphs requires the full power of [[NL (complexity)|nondeterministic logarithmic space]]. Thus, book embeddings seem intimately connected with the distinction between these two complexity classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8066">In a field of [[mathematics]] known as [[differential geometry]], the '''Courant bracket''' is a generalization of the [[Lie derivative|Lie bracket]] from an operation on the [[tangent bundle]] to an operation on the [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]] of the tangent bundle and the [[vector bundle]] of [[differential form|''p''-forms]].

The case ''p'' = 1 was introduced by [[Theodore James Courant]] in his 1990 doctoral dissertation as a structure that bridges [[Poisson manifold|Poisson geometry]] and pre[[symplectic geometry]], based on work with his advisor [[Alan Weinstein]].  The twisted version of the Courant bracket was introduced in 2001 by [[Pavol Severa]], and studied in collaboration with Weinstein.

Today a [[complex number|complex]] version of the ''p''=1 Courant bracket plays a central role in the field of [[generalized complex geometry]], introduced by [[Nigel Hitchin]] in 2002.  Closure under the Courant bracket is the [[integrability condition]] of a [[Almost complex manifold#Generalized almost complex structure|generalized almost complex structure]].

==Definition==
Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[vector field]]s on an N-dimensional real [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] ''M'' and let ''ξ'' and ''η'' be ''p''-forms.  Then ''X+ξ'' and ''Y+η'' are [[fiber bundle#Sections|sections]] of the direct sum of the tangent bundle and the bundle of ''p''-forms.  The Courant bracket of ''X+ξ'' and ''Y+η'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;[X+\xi,Y+\eta]=[X,Y]
+\mathcal{L}_X\eta-\mathcal{L}_Y\xi
-\frac{1}{2}d(i(X)\eta-i(Y)\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] along the vector field ''X'', ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]] and ''i'' is the [[Exterior algebra#The interior product or insertion operator|interior product]].

==Properties==

The Courant bracket is [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] but it does not satisfy the [[Jacobi identity]] for ''p'' greater than zero.

===The Jacobi identity===

However, at least in the case ''p=1'', the [[Jacobiator]], which measures a bracket's failure to satisfy the Jacobi identity, is an [[exact form]].  It is the exterior derivative of a form which plays the role of the [[Nijenhuis tensor]] in generalized complex geometry.

The Courant bracket is the antisymmetrization of the [[Courant bracket#Dorfman bracket|Dorfman bracket]], which does satisfy a kind of Jacobi identity.

===Symmetries===

Like the Lie bracket, the Courant bracket is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the manifold ''M''.  It also enjoys an additional symmetry under the vector bundle [[automorphism]]

:::&lt;math&gt;X+\xi\mapsto X+\xi+i(X)\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is a closed ''p+1''-form.  In the ''p=1'' case, which is the relevant case for the geometry of [[Compactification (physics)#Flux compactification|flux compactification]]s in [[string theory]], this transformation is known in the physics literature as a shift in the [[Kalb-Ramond field|B field]].

==Dirac and generalized complex structures==

The [[cotangent bundle]], &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}^*&lt;/math&gt; of M is the bundle of differential one-forms.  In the case ''p''=1 the Courant bracket maps two sections of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the direct sum of the tangent and cotangent bundles, to another section of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt;.  The fibers of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt; admit [[inner product]]s with [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] (N,N) given by
:::&lt;math&gt;\langle X+\xi,Y+\eta\rangle=\frac{1}{2}(\xi(Y)+\eta(X)).&lt;/math&gt;

A [[linear subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt; in which all pairs of vectors have zero inner product is said to be an [[isotropic subspace]]. The fibers of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt; are ''2N''-dimensional and the maximal dimension of an isotropic subspace is ''N''.  An ''N''-dimensional isotropic subspace is called a maximal isotropic subspace.

A [[Dirac structure]] is a maximally isotropic subbundle of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt; whose sections are closed under the Courant bracket.  Dirac structures include as special cases [[symplectic geometry|symplectic structures]], [[Poisson manifold|Poisson structures]] and [[foliation|foliated geometries]].

A [[generalized complex structure]] is defined identically, but one [[tensor product|tensors]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}\oplus{\mathbf{T}}^*&lt;/math&gt; by the complex numbers and uses the [[complex dimension]] in the above definitions and one imposes that the direct sum of the subbundle and its [[complex conjugate]] be the entire original bundle ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;
'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''. Special cases of generalized complex structures include [[Complex manifold|complex structure]] and a version of [[Kähler manifold|Kähler structure]] which includes the B-field.

==Dorfman bracket==

In 1987 [[Irene Dorfman]] introduced the Dorfman bracket [,]&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, which like the Courant bracket provides an integrability condition for Dirac structures.  It is defined by

::&lt;math&gt;[A,B]_D=[A,B]+d\langle A,B\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The Dorfman bracket is not antisymmetric, but it is often easier to calculate with than the Courant bracket because it satisfies a [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]] which resembles the Jacobi identity

::&lt;math&gt;[A,[B,C]_D]_D=[[A,B]_D,C]_D+[B,[A,C]_D]_D.&lt;/math&gt;

==Courant algebroid==

The Courant bracket does not satisfy the [[Jacobi identity]] and so it does not define a [[Lie algebroid]], in addition it fails to satisfy the Lie algebroid condition on the [[anchor map]].  Instead it defines a more general structure introduced by [[Zhang-Ju Liu]], [[Alan Weinstein]] and [[Ping Xu]] known as a [[Courant algebroid]].

==Twisted Courant bracket==

===Definition and properties===
The Courant bracket may be twisted by a ''(p+2)''-form ''H'', by adding the interior product of the vector fields ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''H''.  It remains antisymmetric and invariant under the addition of the interior product with a ''(p+1)''-form ''B''.  When ''B'' is not closed then this invariance is still preserved if one adds ''dB'' to the final ''H''.

If ''H'' is closed then the Jacobiator is exact and so the twisted Courant bracket still defines a Courant algebroid.  In [[string theory]], ''H'' is interpreted as the [[Kalb-Ramond field|Neveu-Schwarz 3-form]].

===''p=0'': Circle-invariant vector fields===

When ''p''=0 the Courant bracket reduces to the Lie bracket on a [[principal bundle|principal]] [[circle bundle]] over ''M'' with [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature]] given by the 2-form twist ''H''.  The bundle of 0-forms is the trivial bundle, and a section of the direct sum of the tangent bundle and the trivial bundle defines a circle [[invariant vector field]] on this circle bundle.

Concretely, a section of the sum of the tangent and trivial bundles is given by a vector field ''X'' and a function ''f'' and the Courant bracket is
::&lt;math&gt;[X+f,Y+g]=[X,Y]+Xg-Yf&lt;/math&gt;
which is just the Lie bracket of the vector fields
:::&lt;math&gt;[X+f,Y+g]=[X+f\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta},Y+g\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}]_{Lie}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ'' is a coordinate on the circle fiber.  Note in particular that the Courant bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity in the case ''p=0''.

===Integral twists and gerbes===

The curvature of a circle bundle always represents an integral [[cohomology]] class, the [[Chern class]] of the circle bundle.  Thus the above geometric interpretation of the twisted ''p=0'' Courant bracket only exists when ''H'' represents an integral class.   Similarly at higher values of ''p'' the twisted Courant brackets can be geometrically realized as untwisted Courant brackets twisted by [[gerbe]]s when ''H'' is an integral cohomology class.

In [[probability theory|probability]] and [[statistics]], '''decoupling''' is a reduction of a [[sample statistic]] to an average of the statistic evaluated on several [[statistical independence|independent]] sequences of the [[random variable]]. This sum, [[conditional probability|conditioned]] on all but one of the independent sequences becomes a sum of independent random variables. Decoupling is used in the study of [[U statistic]]s, where decoupling should not be confused with Hoeffding's decomposition, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor H. de la Peña and Evariste Giné|title=Decoupling: From Dependence to Independence|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1999|isbn=978-0-387-98616-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such "decoupling" is unrelated to the use of "[[Coupling (probability)|coupling]]s" in the study of [[stochastic processes]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64537">[[Image:Desargues graph 3color edge.svg|thumb|A 3-edge-coloring of the [[Desargues graph]].]]

In [[graph theory]], an '''edge coloring''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is an assignment of "colors" to the edges of the graph so that no two incident edges have the same color.  For example, the figure to the right shows an edge coloring of a graph by the colors red, blue, and green. Edge colorings are one of several different types of [[graph coloring]]. The '''edge-coloring problem''' asks whether it is possible to color the edges of a given graph using at most {{mvar|k}} different colors, for a given value of {{mvar|k}}, or with the fewest possible colors.  The minimum required number of colors for the edges of a given graph is called the '''chromatic index''' of the graph.  For example, the edges of the graph in the illustration can be colored by three colors but cannot be colored by two colors, so the graph shown has chromatic index three.

By [[Vizing's theorem]], the number of colors needed to edge color a simple graph is either its maximum [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|&amp;Delta;}} or {{math|&amp;Delta;+1}}. For some graphs, such as [[bipartite graph]]s and high-degree [[planar graph]]s, the number of colors is always {{math|&amp;Delta;}}, and for [[multigraph]]s, the number of colors may be as large as {{math|3&amp;Delta;/2}}. There are polynomial time algorithms that construct optimal colorings of bipartite graphs, and colorings of non-bipartite simple graphs that use at most {{math|&amp;Delta;+1}} colors; however, the general problem of finding an optimal edge coloring is [[NP-hard]] and the fastest known algorithms for it take exponential time. Many variations of the edge coloring problem, in which an assignments of colors to edges must satisfy other conditions than non-adjacency, have been studied. Edge colorings have applications in scheduling problems and in frequency assignment for [[fiber optic]] networks.

==Examples==
A [[cycle graph]] may have its edges colored with two colors if the length of the cycle is even: simply alternate the two colors around the cycle. However, if the length is odd, three colors are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, problem 16.4, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Complete-edge-coloring.svg|thumb|Geometric construction of a 7-edge-coloring of the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Each of the seven color classes has one edge from the center to a polygon vertex, and three edges perpendicular to it.]]
A [[complete graph]] {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{mvar|n}} vertices is edge-colorable with {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} colors when {{mvar|n}} is an even number; this is a special case of [[Baranyai's theorem]]. {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}} provides the following geometric construction of a coloring in this case: place {{mvar|n}} points at the vertices and center of a regular {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-sided polygon. For each color class, include one edge from the center to one of the polygon vertices, and all of the perpendicular edges connecting pairs of polygon vertices. However, when {{mvar|n}} is odd, {{mvar|n}} colors are needed: each color can only be used for {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}} edges, a {{math|1/''n''}} fraction of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, problem 16.5, p. 133. The fact that either {{mvar|n}} or {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}} colors are needed is an instance of [[Vizing's theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have studied edge colorings of the [[odd graph]]s, {{mvar|n}}-regular graphs in which the vertices represent teams of {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} players selected from a pool of {{mvar|2''n'' − 1}} players, and in which the edges represent possible pairings of these teams (with one player left as "odd man out" to referee the game). The case that {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} gives the well-known [[Petersen graph]]. As {{harvtxt|Biggs|1972}} explains the problem (for {{math|1=''n'' = 6}}), the players wish to find a schedule for these pairings such that each team plays each of its six games on different days of the week, with Sundays off for all teams; that is, formalizing the problem mathematically, they wish to find a 6-edge-coloring of the 6-regular odd graph {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}. When {{mvar|n}} is 3, 4, or 8, an edge coloring of {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} requires {{math|''n'' + 1}} colors, but when it is 5, 6, or 7, only {{mvar|n}} colors are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Biggs|1972}}; {{harvtxt| Meredith|Lloyd|1973}}; {{harvtxt|Biggs|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
As with its [[Graph coloring|vertex counterpart]], an '''edge coloring''' of a graph, when mentioned without any qualification, is always assumed to be a proper coloring of the edges, meaning no two adjacent edges are assigned the same color.  Here, two distinct edges are considered to be adjacent when they share a common vertex. An edge coloring of a graph {{mvar|G}} may also be thought of as equivalent to a vertex coloring of the [[line graph]] {{math|''L''(''G'')}}, the graph that has a vertex for every edge of {{mvar|G}} and an edge for every pair of adjacent edges in {{mvar|G}}.

A proper edge coloring with {{mvar|k}} different colors is called a (proper) {{mvar|k}}-edge-coloring.  A graph that can be assigned a (proper) {{mvar|k}}-edge-coloring is said to be {{mvar|k}}-edge-colorable. The smallest number of colors needed in a (proper) edge coloring of a graph {{mvar|G}} is the '''chromatic index''', or edge chromatic number, {{math|χ&amp;prime;(''G'')}}. The chromatic index is also sometimes written using the notation {{math|χ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'')}}; in this notation, the subscript one indicates that edges are one-dimensional objects.  A graph is {{mvar|k}}-edge-chromatic if its chromatic index is exactly {{mvar|k}}. The chromatic index should not be confused with the [[graph coloring|chromatic number]] {{math|χ(''G'')}} or {{math|χ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'')}}, the minimum number of colors needed in a proper vertex coloring of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|G}}.

Unless stated otherwise all graphs are assumed to be simple, in contrast to [[multigraph]]s in which two or more edges may connecting the same pair of endpoints and in which there may be self-loops. For many problems in edge coloring, simple graphs behave differently from multigraphs, and additional care is needed to extend theorems about edge colorings of simple graphs to the multigraph case.

==Relation to matching==
[[File:Class-2-planar-3-regular.svg|thumb|This 3-regular [[planar graph]] has 16 vertices and 24 edges, but only 7 edges in any maximum matching. Therefore, it requires four colors in any edge coloring.]]
A [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]] in a graph {{mvar|G}} is a set of edges, no two of which are adjacent; a [[perfect matching]] is a matching that includes edges touching all of the vertices of the graph, and a [[maximum matching]] is a matching that includes as many edges as possible. In an edge coloring, the set of edges with any one color must all be non-adjacent to each other, so they form a matching. That is, a proper edge coloring is the same thing as a partition of the graph into disjoint matchings.

If the size of a maximum matching in a given graph is small, then many matchings will be needed in order to cover all of the edges of the graph. Expressed more formally, this reasoning implies that if a graph has {{mvar|m}} edges in total, and if at most {{math|&amp;beta;}} edges may belong to a maximum matching, then every edge coloring of the graph must use at least {{math|''m''/&amp;beta;}} different colors.&lt;ref name="s134"&gt;{{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the 16-vertex planar graph shown in the illustration has {{math|1=''m'' = 24}} edges. In this graph, there can be no perfect matching; for, if the center vertex is matched, the remaining unmatched vertices may be grouped into three different connected components with four, five, and five vertices, and the components with an odd number of vertices cannot be perfectly matched. However, the graph has maximum matchings with seven edges, so {{math|1=&amp;beta; = 7}}. Therefore, the number of colors needed to edge-color the graph is at least 24/7, and since the number of colors must be an integer it is at least four.

For a [[regular graph]] of degree {{mvar|k}} that does not have a perfect matching, this lower bound can be used to show that at least {{math|''k'' + 1}} colors are needed.&lt;ref name="s134"/&gt; In particular, this is true for a regular graph with an odd number of vertices (such as the odd complete graphs); for such graphs, by the [[handshaking lemma]], {{mvar|k}} must itself be even. However, the inequality {{math|χ&amp;prime; ≥ ''m''/&amp;beta;}} does not fully explain the chromatic index of every regular graph, because there are regular graphs that do have perfect matchings but that are not ''k''-edge-colorable. For instance, the [[Petersen graph]] is regular, with {{math|1=''m'' = 15}} and with {{math|1=&amp;beta; = 5}} edges in its perfect matchings, but it does not have a 3-edge-coloring.

==Relation to degree==

===Vizing's theorem===
{{Main|Vizing's theorem}}
The edge chromatic number of a graph {{mvar|G}} is very closely related to the [[Degree (graph theory)|maximum degree]] {{math|Δ(''G'')}}, the largest number of edges incident to any single vertex of {{mvar|G}}. Clearly, {{math|χ&amp;prime;(''G'') ≥ Δ(''G'')}}, for if {{math|Δ}} different edges all meet at the same vertex {{mvar|v}}, then all of these edges need to be assigned different colors from each other, and that can only be possible if there are at least {{math|Δ}} colors available to be assigned. [[Vizing's theorem]] (named for [[Vadim G. Vizing]] who published it in 1964) states that this bound is almost tight: for any graph, the edge chromatic number is either {{math|Δ(''G'')}} or {{math|Δ(''G'') + 1}}.
When {{math|1=χ&amp;prime;(''G'') = Δ(''G'')}}, ''G'' is said to be of class 1; otherwise, it is said to be of class 2.

Every bipartite graph is of class 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kőnig|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[almost all]] [[random graph]]s are of class 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|Wilson|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is [[NP-complete]] to determine whether an arbitrary graph is of class 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Holyer|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} proved that [[planar graph]]s of maximum degree at least eight are of class one and conjectured that the same is true for planar graphs of maximum degree seven or six. On the other hand, there exist planar graphs of maximum degree ranging from two through five that are of class two. The conjecture has since been proven for graphs of maximum degree seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bridge (graph theory)|Bridgeless]] planar [[cubic graph]]s are all of class 1; this is an equivalent form of the [[four color theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tait|1880}}; {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular graphs===
A [[1-factorization]] of a ''k''-[[regular graph]], a partition of the edges of the graph into [[perfect matching]]s, is the same thing as a ''k''-edge-coloring of the graph. That is, a regular graph has a 1-factorization if and only if it is of class 1.  As a special case of this, a 3-edge-coloring of a [[cubic graph|cubic]] (3-regular) graph is sometimes called a '''Tait coloring'''.

Not every regular graph has a 1-factorization; for instance, the [[Petersen graph]] does not. More generally the [[Snark (graph theory)|snark]]s are defined as the graphs that, like the Petersen graph, are bridgeless, 3-regular, and of class 2.

According to the theorem of {{harvtxt|Kőnig|1916}}, every bipartite regular graph has a 1-factorization. The theorem was stated earlier in terms of [[projective configuration]]s and was proven by [[Ernst Steinitz]].

===Multigraphs===
[[File:Multigraph-edge-coloring.svg|thumb|A [[Shannon multigraph]] with degree six and edge multiplicity three, requiring nine colors in any edge coloring]]
For [[multigraph]]s, in which multiple parallel edges may connect the same two vertices, results that are similar to but weaker than Vizing's theorem are known relating the edge chromatic number  {{math|1=χ&amp;prime;(''G'')}}, the maximum degree {{math|Δ(''G'')}}, and the multiplicity {{math|μ(''G'')}}, the maximum number of edges in any bundle of parallel edges. As a simple example showing that Vizing's theorem does not generalize to multigraphs, consider a [[Shannon multigraph]], a multigraph with three vertices and three bundles of {{math|μ(''G'')}} parallel edges connecting each of the three pairs of vertices. In this example, {{math|1=Δ(''G'') = 2μ(''G'')}} (each vertex is incident to only two out of the three bundles of {{math|μ(''G'')}} parallel edges) but the edge chromatic number is {{math|3μ(''G'')}} (there are {{math|3μ(''G'')}} edges in total, and every two edges are adjacent, so all edges must be assigned different colors to each other). In a result that inspired Vizing,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showed that this is the worst case: {{math|χ&amp;prime;(''G'') ≤ (3/2)Δ(''G'')}} for any multigraph {{mvar|G}}. Additionally, for any multigraph {{mvar|G}}, {{math|χ&amp;prime;(''G'') ≤ Δ(''G'') + μ(''G'')}}, an inequality that reduces to Vizing's theorem in the case of simple graphs (for which {{math|1=μ(''G'') = 1}}).

==Algorithms==
Because the problem of testing whether a graph is class 1 is [[NP-complete]], there is no known polynomial time algorithm for edge-coloring every graph with an optimal number of colors. Nevertheless, a number of algorithms have been developed that relax one or more of these criteria: they only work on a subset of graphs, or they do not always use an optimal number of colors, or they do not always run in polynomial time.

===Optimally coloring special classes of graphs===
In the case of [[bipartite graph]]s or multigraphs with maximum degree {{math|Δ}}, the optimal number of colors is exactly {{math|Δ}}. {{harvtxt|Cole|Ost|Schirra|2001}} showed that an optimal edge coloring of these graphs can be found in the near-linear time bound {{math|O(''m'' log Δ)}}, where {{mvar|m}} is the number of edges in the graph; simpler, but somewhat slower, algorithms are described by {{harvtxt|Cole|Hopcroft|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Alon|2003}}. The algorithm of {{harvtxt|Alon|2003}} begins by making the input graph regular, without increasing its degree or significantly increasing its size, by merging pairs of vertices that belong to the same side of the bipartition and then adding a small number of additional vertices and edges. Then, if the degree is odd, Alon finds a single perfect matching in near-linear time, assigns it a color, and removes it from the graph, causing the degree to become even. Finally, Alon applies an observation of {{harvtxt|Gabow|1976}}, that selecting alternating subsets of edges in an [[Euler tour]] of the graph partitions it into two regular subgraphs, to split the edge coloring problem into two smaller subproblems, and his algorithm solves the two subproblems [[recursion|recursively]]. The total time for his algorithm is {{math|O(''m'' log ''m'')}}.

For [[planar graph]]s with maximum degree {{math|Δ ≥ 7}}, the optimal number of colors is again exactly {{math|Δ}}. With the stronger assumption that {{math|Δ ≥ 9}}, it is possible to find an optimal edge coloring in linear time {{harv|Cole|Kowalik|2008}}.

For d-regular graphs which are pseudo-random in the sense that their adjacency matrix has second largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) at most {{math|d&lt;sup&gt;1-ε&lt;/sup&gt;}}, d is the optimal number of colors {{harv|Ferber|Jain|2018}}.

===Algorithms that use more than the optimal number of colors===
{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} and {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} describe polynomial time algorithms for coloring any graph with {{math|Δ + 1}} colors, meeting the bound given by Vizing's theorem; see [[Misra &amp; Gries edge coloring algorithm]].

For multigraphs, {{harvtxt|Karloff|Shmoys|1987}} present the following algorithm, which they attribute to [[Eli Upfal]]. Make the input multigraph {{mvar|G}} [[Euler tour|Eulerian]] by adding a new vertex connected by an edge to every odd-degree vertex, find an Euler tour, and choose an orientation for the tour. Form a bipartite graph {{mvar|H}} in which there are two copies of each vertex of {{mvar|G}}, one on each side of the bipartition, with an edge from a vertex {{mvar|u}} on the left side of the bipartition to a vertex {{mvar|v}} on the right side of the bipartition whenever the oriented tour has an edge from {{mvar|u}} to {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|G}}. Apply a bipartite graph edge coloring algorithm to {{mvar|H}}. Each color class in {{mvar|H}} corresponds to a set of edges in {{mvar|G}} that form a subgraph with maximum degree two; that is, a disjoint union of paths and cycles, so for each color class in {{mvar|H}} it is possible to form three color classes in {{mvar|G}}. The time for the algorithm is bounded by the time to edge color a bipartite graph, {{math|O(''m'' log Δ)}} using the algorithm of {{harvtxt|Cole|Ost|Schirra|2001}}. The number of colors this algorithm uses is at most &lt;math&gt;3 \left\lceil\frac\Delta2\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;, close to but not quite the same as Shannon's bound of &lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\frac{3\Delta}2\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;. It may also be made into a [[parallel algorithm]] in a straightforward way. In the same paper, Karloff and Shmoys also present a linear time algorithm for coloring multigraphs of maximum degree three with four colors (matching both Shannon's and Vizing's bounds) that operates on similar principles: their algorithm adds a new vertex to make the graph Eulerian, finds an Euler tour, and then chooses alternating sets of edges on the tour to split the graph into two subgraphs of maximum degree two. The paths and even cycles of each subgraph may be colored with two colors per subgraph. After this step, each remaining odd cycle contains at least one edge that may be colored with one of the two colors belonging to the opposite subgraph. Removing this edge from the odd cycle leaves a path, which may be colored using the two colors for its subgraph.

A [[greedy coloring]] algorithm that considers the edges of a graph or multigraph one by one, assigning each edge the [[Mex (mathematics)|first available]] color, may sometimes use as many as {{math|2Δ &amp;minus; 1}} colors, which may be nearly twice as many number of colors as is necessary. However, it has the advantage that it may be used in the [[online algorithm]] setting in which the input graph is not known in advance; in this setting, its [[competitive ratio]] is two, and this is optimal: no other online algorithm can achieve a better performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bar-Noy|Motwani|Naor|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if edges arrive in a random order, and the input graph has a degree that is at least logarithmic, then smaller competitive ratios can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bahmani|Mehta|Motwani|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have made conjectures that imply that the [[Fractional coloring|fractional chromatic index]] of any multigraph (a number that can be computed in polynomial time using [[linear programming]]) is within one of the chromatic index.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Goldberg|1973}}; {{harvtxt|Andersen|1977}}; {{harvtxt|Seymour|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If these conjectures are true, it would be possible to compute a number that is never more than one off from the chromatic index in the multigraph case, matching what is known via Vizing's theorem for simple graphs. Although unproven in general, these conjectures are known to hold when the chromatic index is at least &lt;math&gt;\Delta+\sqrt{\Delta/2}&lt;/math&gt;, as can happen for multigraphs with sufficiently large multiplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chen|Yu|Zang|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exact algorithms===
It is straightforward to test whether a graph may be edge colored with one or two colors, so the first nontrivial case of edge coloring is testing whether a graph has a 3-edge-coloring.
As {{harvtxt|Kowalik|2009}} showed, it is possible to test whether a graph has a 3-edge-coloring in time {{math|O(1.344&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, while using only polynomial space. Although this time bound is exponential, it is significantly faster than a brute force search over all possible assignments of colors to edges. Every [[biconnected graph|biconnected]] 3-regular graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices has {{math|O(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} 3-edge-colorings; all of which can be listed in time {{math|O(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} (somewhat slower than the time to find a single coloring); as [[Greg Kuperberg]] observed, the graph of a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] over an {{math|''n''/2}}-sided polygon has {{math|Ω(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} colorings (lower instead of upper bound), showing that this bound is tight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By applying exact algorithms for vertex coloring to the [[line graph]] of the input graph, it is possible to optimally edge-color any graph with {{mvar|m}} edges, regardless of the number of colors needed, in time {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''m''&lt;sup&gt;O(1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and exponential space, or in time {{math|O(2.2461&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and only polynomial space {{harv|Björklund|Husfeldt|Koivisto|2009}}.

Because edge coloring is NP-complete even for three colors, it is unlikely to be [[Parameterized complexity|fixed parameter tractable]] when parametrized by the number of colors. However, it is tractable for other parameters. In particular, {{harvtxt|Zhou|Nakano|Nishizeki|1996}} showed that for graphs of [[treewidth]] {{mvar|w}}, an optimal edge coloring can be computed in time {{math|O(''nw''(6''w'')&lt;sup&gt;''w''(''w'' + 1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, a bound that depends superexponentially on {{mvar|w}} but only linearly on the number {{mvar|n}} of vertices in the graph.

{{harvtxt|Nemhauser|Park|1991}} formulate the edge coloring problem as an [[integer program]] and describe their experience using an integer programming solver to edge color graphs. However, they did not perform any complexity analysis of their algorithm.

==Additional properties==
[[File:Generalized Petersen 9 2 Hamiltonicity.svg|thumb|The uniquely 3-colorable [[generalized Petersen graph]] {{math|''G''(9,2)}}. One of its three color classes is shown by the light edges and the other two can be found either by rotating the light edges by 40° in each direction or by partitioning the dark Hamiltonian cycle into alternating edges.]]
A graph is [[Uniquely colorable graph|uniquely]] {{mvar|k}}-edge-colorable if there is only one way of partitioning the edges into {{mvar|k}} color classes, ignoring the {{math|''k''!}} possible permutations of the colors. For {{math|''k'' ≠ 3}}, the only uniquely {{mvar|k}}-edge-colorable graphs are paths, cycles, and [[star (graph theory)|star]]s, but for {{math|1=''k'' = 3}} other graphs may also be uniquely {{mvar|k}}-edge-colorable. Every uniquely 3-edge-colorable graph has exactly three [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s (formed by deleting one of the three color classes) but there exist 3-regular graphs that have three Hamiltonian cycles and are not uniquely 3-colorable, such as the [[generalized Petersen graph]]s {{math|''G''(6''n'' + 3, 2)}} for {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}. The only known nonplanar uniquely 3-colorable graph is the generalized Petersen graph {{math|''G''(9,2)}}, and it has been conjectured that no others exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schwenk|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Folkman|Fulkerson|1969}} investigated the non-increasing sequences of numbers {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} with the property that there exists a proper edge coloring of a given graph {{mvar|G}} with {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} edges of the first color, {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} edges of the second color, etc. They observed that, if a sequence {{mvar|P}} is feasible in this sense, and is greater in [[lexicographic order]] than a sequence {{mvar|Q}} with the same sum, then {{mvar|Q}} is also feasible. For, if {{math|''P'' &gt; ''Q''}} in lexicographic order, then {{mvar|P}} can be transformed into {{mvar|Q}} by a sequence of steps, each of which reduces one of the numbers {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} by one unit and increases another later number 
{{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with {{math|''i'' &lt; ''j''}} by one unit. In terms of edge colorings, starting from a coloring that realizes {{mvar|P}}, each of these same steps may be performed by swapping colors {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} on a [[Kempe chain]], a maximal path of edges that alternate between the two colors. In particular, any graph has an [[equitable coloring|equitable]] edge coloring, an edge coloring with an optimal number of colors in which every two color classes differ in size by at most one unit.

The [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (graph theory)|De Bruijn–Erdős theorem]] may be used to transfer many edge coloring properties of finite graphs to [[infinite graph]]s. For instance, Shannon's and Vizing's theorems relating the degree of a graph to its chromatic index both generalize straightforwardly to infinite graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bosák|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Richter|2011}} considers the problem of finding a [[graph drawing]] of a given [[cubic graph]] with the properties that all of the edges in the drawing have one of three different slopes and that no two edges lie on the same line as each other. If such a drawing exists, then clearly the slopes of the edges may be used as colors in a 3-edge-coloring of the graph. For instance, the drawing of the [[utility graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;}} as the edges and long diagonals of a [[regular hexagon]] represents a 3-edge-coloring of the graph in this way. As Richter shows, a 3-regular simple bipartite graph, with a given Tait coloring, has a drawing of this type that represents the given coloring if and only if the graph is [[k-edge-connected graph|3-edge-connected]]. For a non-bipartite graph, the condition is a little more complicated: a given coloring can be represented by a drawing if the [[bipartite double cover]] of the graph is 3-edge-connected, and if deleting any monochromatic pair of edges leads to a subgraph that is still non-bipartite. These conditions may all be tested easily in polynomial time; however, the problem of testing whether a 4-edge-colored 4-regular graph has a drawing with edges of four slopes, representing the colors by slopes, is complete for the [[existential theory of the reals]], a complexity class at least as difficult as being NP-complete.

As well as being related to the maximum degree and maximum matching number of a graph, the chromatic index is closely related to the [[linear arboricity]] {{math|la(''G'')}} of a graph {{mvar|G}}, the minimum number of linear forests (disjoint unions of paths) into which the graph's edges may be partitioned. A matching is a special kind of linear forest, and in the other direction, any linear forest can be 2-edge-colored, so for every {{mvar|G}} it follows that {{math|la(''G'') ≤ χ&amp;prime;(''G'') ≤ 2 la(''G'')}}. [[Akiyama's conjecture]] (named for [[Jin Akiyama]]) states that &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{la}}(G) \leq \left\lceil\frac{\Delta+1}{2}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;, from which it would follow more strongly that {{math|2 la(''G'') &amp;minus; 2 ≤ χ&amp;prime;(''G'') ≤ 2 la(''G'')}}. For graphs of maximum degree three, {{math|la(''G'')}} is always exactly two, so in this case the bound {{math|χ&amp;prime;(''G'') ≤ 2 la(''G'')}} matches the bound given by Vizing's theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Akiyama|Exoo|Harary|1980}}; {{harvtxt|Habib|Péroche|1982}}; {{harvtxt|Horák|Niepel|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of edge coloring==
[[Image:K44 arboricity.svg|thumb|A partition of the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt; into three forests, showing that it has arboricity three.]]
The [[Thue number]] of a graph is the number of colors required in an edge coloring meeting the stronger requirement that, in every even-length path, the first and second halves of the path form different sequences of colors.

The [[arboricity]] of a graph is the minimum number of colors required so that the edges of each color have no cycles (rather than, in the standard edge coloring problem, having no adjacent pairs of edges). That is, it is the minimum number of [[forest (graph theory)|forests]] into which the edges of the graph may be partitioned into.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the chromatic index, the arboricity of a graph may be computed in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gabow|Westermann|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List edge-coloring]] is a problem in which one is given a graph in which each edge is associated with a list of colors, and must find a proper edge coloring in which the color of each edge is drawn from that edge's list. The list chromatic index of a graph {{mvar|G}} is the smallest number {{mvar|k}} with the property that, no matter how one chooses lists of colors for the edges, as long as each edge has at least {{mvar|k}} colors in its list, then a coloring is guaranteed to be possible. Thus, the list chromatic index is always at least as large as the chromatic index. The [[Dinitz conjecture]] on the completion of partial [[Latin square]]s may be rephrased as the statement that the list edge chromatic number of the [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;n,n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} equals its edge chromatic number,&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|n}}. {{harvtxt|Galvin|1995}} resolved the conjecture by proving, more generally, that in every bipartite graph the chromatic index and list chromatic index are equal. The equality between the chromatic index and the list chromatic index has been conjectured to hold, even more generally, for arbitrary multigraphs with no self-loops; this conjecture remains open.

Many other commonly studied variations of vertex coloring have also been extended to edge colorings. For instance, complete edge coloring is the edge-coloring variant of [[complete coloring]], a proper edge coloring in which each pair of colors must be represented by at least one pair of adjacent edges and in which the goal is to maximize the total number of colors.{{sfnp|Bosák|Nešetřil|1976}} Strong edge coloring is the edge-coloring variant of [[strong coloring]], an edge coloring in which every two edges with adjacent endpoints must have different colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fouquet|Jolivet|1983}}; {{harvtxt|Mahdian|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Frieze|Krivelevich|Sudakov|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Cranston|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Strong edge coloring has applications in [[channel allocation schemes]] for [[wireless networks]].{{sfnp|Barrett|Istrate|Kumar|Marathe|2006}}

Acyclic edge coloring is the edge-coloring variant of [[acyclic coloring]], an edge coloring for which every two color classes form an acyclic subgraph (that is, a forest).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alon|Sudakov|Zaks|2001}}; {{harvtxt|Muthu|Narayanan|Subramanian|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The acyclic chromatic index of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;a'(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the smallest number of colors needed to have a proper acyclic edge coloring of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. It has been conjectured that &lt;math&gt;a'(G) \le \Delta + 2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum degree of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fiamčik|1978}}; {{harvtxt|Alon|Sudakov|Zaks|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the best known bound is &lt;math&gt;a'(G) \le \lceil 3.74 (\Delta -1) \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfnp|Giotis|Kirousis|Psaromiligkos|Thilikos|2015}} The problem becomes easier when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has large [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]]. More specifically, there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that if the girth of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is at least &lt;math&gt; c \Delta \log \Delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a'(G) \le \Delta + 2&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfnp|Alon|Sudakov|Zaks|2001}} A similar result is that for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists an &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has girth at least &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a'(G) \le (1+\epsilon) \Delta&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfnp|Cai|Perarnau|Reed|Watts|2014}}

{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2013}} studied 3-edge-colorings of cubic graphs with the additional property that no two bichromatic cycles share more than a single edge with each other. He showed that the existence of such a coloring is equivalent to the existence of a [[graph drawing|drawing of the graph]] on a three-dimensional integer grid, with edges parallel to the coordinate axes and each axis-parallel line containing at most two vertices. However, like the standard 3-edge-coloring problem, finding a coloring of this type is NP-complete.

[[Total coloring]] is a form of coloring that combines vertex and edge coloring, by requiring both the vertices and edges to be colored. Any incident pair of a vertex and an edge, or an edge and an edge, must have distinct colors, as must any two adjacent vertices. It has been conjectured (combining Vizing's theorem and [[Brooks' theorem]]) that any graph has a total coloring in which the number of colors is at most the maximum degree plus two, but this remains unproven.

If a 3-regular graph on a surface is 3-edge-colored, its [[dual graph]] forms a [[Triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of the surface which is also edge colored (although not, in general, properly edge colored) in such a way that every triangle has one edge of each color. Other colorings and orientations of triangulations, with other local constraints on how the colors are arranged at the vertices or faces of the triangulation, may be used to encode several types of geometric object. For instance, rectangular subdivisions (partitions of a rectangular subdivision into smaller rectangles, with three rectangles meeting at every vertex) may be described combinatorially by a "regular labeling", a two-coloring of the edges of a triangulation dual to the subdivision, with the constraint that the edges incident to each vertex form four contiguous subsequences, within each of which the colors are the same. This labeling is dual to a coloring of the rectangular subdivision itself in which the vertical edges have one color and the horizontal edges have the other color. Similar local constraints on the order in which colored edges may appear around a vertex may also be used to encode straight-line grid embeddings of planar graphs and three-dimensional polyhedra with axis-parallel sides. For each of these three types of regular labelings, the set of regular labelings of a fixed graph forms a [[distributive lattice]] that may be used to quickly list all geometric structures based on the same graph (such as all axis-parallel polyhedra having the same skeleton) or to find structures satisfying additional constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deterministic finite automaton]] may be interpreted as a [[directed graph]] in which each vertex has the same out-degree {{mvar|d}}, and in which the edges are {{mvar|d}}-colored in such a way that every two edges with the same source vertex have distinct colors. The [[road coloring problem]] is the problem of edge-coloring a directed graph with uniform out-degrees, in such a way that the resulting automaton has a [[synchronizing word]]. {{harvtxt|Trahtman|2009}} solved the road coloring problem by proving that such a coloring can be found whenever the given graph is [[strongly connected graph|strongly connected]] and [[aperiodic graph|aperiodic]].

[[Ramsey's theorem]] concerns the problem of {{mvar|k}}-coloring the edges of a large [[complete graph]] {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in order to avoid creating monochromatic complete subgraphs {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of some given size&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|s}}. According to the theorem, there exists a number {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'')}} such that, whenever {{math|''n'' ≥ ''R''(''s'')}}, such a coloring is not possible. For instance, {{math|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) = 6}}, that is, if the edges of the graph {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} are 2-colored, there will always be a monochromatic triangle.

A path in an edge-colored graph is said to be a [[Rainbow coloring|rainbow]] path if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be rainbow colored if there is a rainbow path between any two pairs of vertices.
An edge-colouring of a graph G with colours 1. . . t is an [[Interval edge coloring|interval t coloring]] if all colours are used, and the colours of edges incident to each vertex of G are distinct and form an interval of integers.

==Applications==
Edge colorings of complete graphs may be used to schedule a [[round-robin tournament]] into as few rounds as possible so that each pair of competitors plays each other in one of the rounds; in this application, the vertices of the graph correspond to the competitors in the tournament, the edges correspond to games, and the edge colors correspond to the rounds in which the games are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Burke|De Werra|Kingston|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar coloring techniques may also be used to schedule other sports pairings that are not all-play-all; for instance, in the [[National Football League]], the pairs of teams that will play each other in a given year are determined, based on the teams' records from the previous year, and then an edge coloring algorithm is applied to the graph formed by the set of pairings in order to assign games to the weekends on which they are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Skiena|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For this application, Vizing's theorem implies that no matter what set of pairings is chosen (as long as no teams play each other twice in the same season), it is always possible to find a schedule that uses at most one more weekend than there are games per team.

[[Open shop scheduling]] is a problem of [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling production processes]], in which there are a set of objects to be manufactured, each object has a set of tasks to be performed on it (in any order), and each task must be performed on a specific machine, preventing any other task that requires the same machine from being performed at the same time. If all tasks have the same length, then this problem may be formalized as one of edge coloring a bipartite multigraph, in which the vertices on one side of the bipartition represent the objects to be manufactured, the vertices on the other side of the bipartition represent the manufacturing machines, the edges represent tasks that must be performed, and the colors represent time steps in which each task may be performed. Since bipartite edge coloring may be performed in polynomial time, the same is true for this restricted case of open shop scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williamson|Hall|Hoogeveen|Hurkens|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Gandham|Dawande|Prakash|2005}} study the problem of link scheduling for [[time division multiple access]] network communications protocols on [[sensor network]]s as a variant of edge coloring. In this problem, one must choose time slots for the edges of a wireless communications network so that each node of the network can communicate with each neighboring node without interference. Using a strong edge coloring (and using two time slots for each edge color, one for each direction) would solve the problem but might use more time slots than necessary. Instead, they seek a coloring of the directed graph formed by doubling each undirected edge of the network, with the property that each directed edge {{mvar|uv}} has a different color from the edges that go out from {{mvar|v}} and from the neighbors of {{mvar|v}}. They propose a heuristic for this problem based on a distributed algorithm for {{math|(&amp;Delta; + 1)}}-edge-coloring together with a postprocessing phase that reschedules edges that might interfere with each other.

In [[fiber-optic communication]], the [[path coloring]] problem is the problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a [[star network]], with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Erlebach|Jansen|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open problems==
{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}} list 23 open problems concerning edge coloring. They include:
*The conjecture of {{harvtxt|Goldberg|1973}} that the chromatic index and fractional index are within one of each other, which would allow the chromatic index to be approximated within one color in polynomial time.
*Several conjectures of Jakobsen and others on the structure of [[critical graph]]s for edge coloring, graphs of class 2 such that any subgraph either has smaller maximum degree or is of class 1. Jakobsen originally conjectured that all critical graphs have an odd number of vertices, but this was eventually disproved. Several other conjectures weakening this one, or bounding the numbers of vertices of critical graphs and critical multigraphs, remain open.
*Vizing's problem of classifying the maximum degrees that are possible for class 2 planar graphs.
*The [[Overfull graph|overfull subgraph conjecture]] of A. J. W. Hilton, stating that graphs with degree at least {{math|''n''/3}} are either of class 1 or contain a subgraph with the same degree {{math|&amp;Delta;}} as the original graph, and with an odd number {{mvar|k}} of vertices, such that the number of edges in the subgraph is greater than {{math|&amp;Delta;(''k'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}}, and a similar conjecture by [[Herbert Grötzsch]] and [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]] concerning planar graphs in place of high-degree graphs.
*A conjecture of Chetwynd and Hilton (possibly going back earlier to the work of [[Gabriel Andrew Dirac]]) that regular graphs with an even number {{mvar|n}} of vertices and with degree at least {{math|''n''/2}} are of class 1.
*A conjecture of [[Claude Berge]] and [[D. R. Fulkerson]] that the 6-regular multigraphs formed by doubling every edge of a bridgeless 3-regular simple graph may be edge-colored with six colors.
*A conjecture of Fiorini and Wilson that every [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] planar graph, other than the [[Star (graph theory)|claw]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;, is not [[Uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 3-edge-colorable]].
* A 2012 conjecture that if {{math|''G''}} is a {{math|''d''}}-regular planar multigraph, then {{math|''G''}} is {{math|''d''}}-edge-colorable if and only if {{math|''G''}} is oddly {{math|''d''}}-edge-connected. This conjecture is a generalization of the [[four color theorem]], which arises at {{math|''d''}}=3. [[Maria Chudnovsky]], Katherine Edwards, and [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]] proved that an 8-regular planar multigraph has an edge chromatic number of 8.{{sfnp|Chudnovsky|Edwards|Seymour|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="624">In [[mathematical logic]], an '''elementary theory''' is one that involves axioms using only [[finitary]] [[first-order logic]], without reference to [[set theory]] or using any axioms which have [[consistency strength]] equal to set theory.

Saying that a theory is elementary is a weaker condition than saying it is [[algebraic theory|algebraic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5155">In [[structural biology]], the three-dimensional '''Fourier shell correlation (FSC)''' measures the normalised [[cross-correlation]] coefficient between two 3-dimensional volumes over corresponding shells in [[Fourier Transform|Fourier]] space (i.e., as a function of spatial frequency&lt;ref name=Harauz1986&gt;Harauz &amp; van Heel, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;). The FSC is the three-dimensional extension of the two-dimensional Fourier ring correlation (FRC);&lt;ref name=vanHeel1982&gt;van Heel, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; also known as: spatial frequency correlation function.&lt;ref name=Saxton1982&gt;Saxton &amp; Baumeister, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==
:&lt;math&gt;
FSC(r) = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in r}{ F_1(r_i) \cdot F_2(r_i)^{\ast} }}
{\displaystyle\sqrt[2]{\sum_{r_i \in r}{ \left|F_1(r_i)\right|^2} \cdot \sum_{r_i \in r}{\left|F_2(r_i)\right|^2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for volume 1, &lt;math&gt;F_2^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of the structure Factor for volume 2, and &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the individual voxel element at radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Image Science's FSC: Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) of two 3D volumes | url=http://www.imagescience.de/fsc/ | work=fsc | publisher=Image Science | accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RF 3 - Phase Residual &amp; Fourier shell correlation | url=http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/man/rf3.html | work=SPIDER | publisher=Wadsworth Center | accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005&gt;van Heel &amp; Schatz, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, the FSC takes two three-dimensional data sets and converts them into a one-dimensional array.

The FSC originated in [[cryo-electron microscopy]] and gradually proliferated to other fields. To measure the FSC, two independently determined 3D volumes are required. In [[cryo-electron microscopy]], the two volumes are the result of two three-dimensional reconstructions, each based on half of the available data set. Typically, the even particle images form one half and the odd particles the other half of the data set. Most publications quote the FSC 0.5 resolution cutoff, which ''ad hoc'' criterion refers to when the correlation coefficient of the Fourier shells is equal to 0.5.&lt;ref name=Bottcher1997&gt;Böttcher et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frank2006&gt;Frank, 2006, p250-251&lt;/ref&gt; However, determining the resolution threshold remains a controversial issue: fixed-value thresholds were argued to be based on incorrect statistical assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005/&gt; Many other criteria using the FSC curve exist, including 3-σ criterion, 5-σ criterion, and the 0.143 cutoff. The half-bit criterion indicates at which resolution we have collected enough information to reliably interpret the 3-dimensional volume, and the (modified) 3-[[sigma]] criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise.&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">In [[mathematics]], a '''homology manifold''' (or '''generalized manifold''')
is a [[locally compact topological space]] ''X'' that looks locally like a [[topological manifold]] from the point of view of [[homology theory]].

==Definition==
A '''homology ''G''-manifold'''  (without boundary) of dimension ''n'' over an abelian  group ''G'' of coefficients is a locally compact topological space X with finite ''G''-[[cohomological dimension]] such that for any ''x''&amp;isin;''X'', the  [[Homology (mathematics)#Construction of homology groups|homology groups]]
:&lt;math&gt; H_p(X,X-x, G)&lt;/math&gt;
are trivial unless ''p''=''n'', in which case they are isomorphic to ''G''. Here ''H'' is some homology theory, usually singular homology. Homology manifolds are the same as homology '''Z'''-manifolds.

More generally, one can define homology manifolds with boundary, by allowing the local homology groups to vanish
at some points, which are of course called the boundary of the homology manifold. The boundary of an ''n''-dimensional [[first-countable]] homology manifold is an ''n''&amp;minus;1 dimensional homology manifold (without boundary).

==Examples==
*Any topological manifold is a homology manifold. 
*An example of a homology manifold that is not a manifold is the suspension of a [[homology sphere]] that is not a sphere.

==Properties==
*If ''X''&amp;times;''Y'' is a  topological manifold, then ''X'' and ''Y'' are homology manifolds.

'''IEEE 754-2008''' (previously known as ''IEEE 754r'') was published in August 2008 and is a significant revision to, and replaces, the [[IEEE 754-1985]] [[floating point]] [[standardization|standard]].  The revision extended the previous standard where it was necessary, added decimal arithmetic and formats, tightened up certain areas of the original standard which were left undefined, and merged in [[IEEE 854]] (the radix-independent floating-point standard).

In a few cases, where stricter definitions of binary floating-point arithmetic might be performance-incompatible with some existing implementation, they were made optional.

== Revision process ==
The standard had been under revision since 2000, with a target completion date of December 2006.  The revision of an IEEE standard broadly follows three phases:
#Working group &amp;ndash; a committee that creates a draft standard
#Ballot &amp;ndash; interested parties subscribe to the ''balloting group'' and vote on the draft (75% of the group must participate, and 75% must approve for the draft to go forward); comments from the votes are resolved by a ''Ballot Resolution Committee'' (BRC) and changes made have to be recirculated with a new ballot if they are substantive
#When all comments are resolved and there are no further changes, the draft is submitted to the IEEE for review, approval, and publication (this can also result in changes and ballots, although this is rare).

On 11 June 2008, it was approved unanimously by the IEEE Revision Committee (RevCom), and it was formally approved by the IEEE-SA Standards Board on 12 June 2008.  It was published on 29 August 2008.

=== 754r Working Group phase ===
Participation in drafting the standard was open to people with a solid knowledge of floating-point arithmetic.  More than 90 people attended at least one of the monthly meetings, which were held in [[Silicon Valley]], and many more participated through the mailing list.

Progress at times was slow, leading the chairman to declare at the [http://nonabelian.com/754/minutes/754/050915 September 15, 2005 meeting]{{Dead link|date=October 2018}} that "no progress is being made, I am suspending these meetings until further notice on those grounds". 
In December 2005, the committee reorganized under new rules with a target completion date of December 2006.

New policies and procedures were adopted in February 2006.  In September 2006 a working draft was approved to be sent to the parent sponsoring committee (the IEEE Microprocessor Standards Committee, or MSC) for editing and to be sent to sponsor ballot.

=== 754r Ballot phase ===
The last version of the draft, version 1.2.5, submitted to the MSC was from October 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DRAFT Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic P754, version 1.2.5 |url=http://754r.ucbtest.org/web-2008/drafts/archive/2006-10-04.pdf |website=Revising ANSI/IEEE Std 754-1985 |accessdate=13 October 2018 |date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MSC accepted the draft on 9 October 2006.  Note that the draft has been changed significantly in detail during the balloting process.

The first sponsor ballot took place from 2006-11-29 through 2006-12-28.  Of the 84 members of the voting body, 85.7% responded—78.6% voted approval.  There were negative votes (and over 400 comments) so there was a recirculation ballot in March 2007; this received an 84% approval.  There were sufficient comments (over 130) from that ballot that a third draft was prepared for second, 15-day, recirculation ballot which started in mid-April 2007.  For a technical reason, the ballot process was restarted with the 4th ballot in October 2007; there were also substantial changes in the draft resulting from 650 voters' comments and from requests from the sponsor (the IEEE MSC); this ballot just failed to reach the required 75% approval.  The 5th ballot had a 98.0% response rate with 91.0% approval, with comments leading to relatively small changes.  The 6th, 7th, and 8th ballots sustained approval ratings of over 90% with progressively fewer comments on each draft; the 8th (which had no in-scope comments: 9 were repeats of previous comments and one referred to material not in the draft) was submitted to the IEEE Standards Revision Committee ('RevCom') for approval as an IEEE standard.

=== 754r Review and Approval phase ===
The IEEE Standards Revision Committee (RevCom) considered and unanimously approved the IEEE 754r draft at its June 2008 meeting, and it was approved by the IEEE-SA Standards Board on 12 June 2008.  Final editing is complete and the document has now been forwarded to the IEEE Standards Publications Department for publication.

=== IEEE Std 754-2008 publication ===
The new IEEE 754 (formally IEEE Std 754-2008, the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic) was published by the IEEE Computer Society on 29 August 2008, and is available from the [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4610935 IEEE Xplore website].

This standard replaces [[IEEE 754-1985]].  IEEE 854, the Radix-Independent floating-point standard was withdrawn in December 2008.

== Summary of the revisions ==
The most obvious enhancements to the standard are the addition of a 16-bit and a 128-bit binary type and three decimal types, some new operations, and many recommended functions.  However, there have been significant clarifications in terminology throughout.  This summary highlights the main differences in each major clause of the standard.

=== Clause 1: Overview ===

The scope (determined by the sponsor of the standard) has been widened to include decimal formats and arithmetic, and adds extendable formats.

=== Clause 2: Definitions ===

Many of the definitions have been rewritten for clarification and consistency.  A few terms have been renamed for clarity (for example, ''[[denormal number|denormalized]]'' has been renamed to ''subnormal'').

=== Clause 3: Formats ===

The description of formats has been made more regular, with a distinction between ''arithmetic formats'' (in which arithmetic may be carried out) and ''interchange formats'' (which have a standard encoding).  Conformance to the standard is now defined in these terms.

The specification levels of a floating-point format have been enumerated, to clarify the distinction between:
#the theoretical real numbers (an extended number line)
#the entities which can be represented in the format (a finite set of numbers, together with [[−0 (number)|−0]], [[infinity|infinities]], and [[NaN]])
#the particular representations of the entities: sign-exponent-significand, ''etc.''
#the bit-pattern (encoding) used.

The sets of representable entities are then explained in detail, showing that they can be treated with the significand being considered either as a fraction or an integer.  The particular sets known as ''basic formats'' are defined, and the encodings used for interchange of binary and decimal formats are explained.

The binary interchange formats have the "[[half precision]]" (16-bit storage format) and "[[quad precision]]" (128-bit format) added, together with generalized formulae for some wider formats; the basic formats have 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit encodings.

Three new decimal formats are described, matching the lengths of the 32–128-bit binary formats.  These give decimal interchange formats with 7, 16, and 34-digit significands, which may be normalized or unnormalized.  For maximum range and precision, the formats merge part of the exponent and significand into a ''combination field'', and compress the remainder of the significand using either a decimal integer encoding (which uses ''[[Densely Packed Decimal]]'', or DPD, a compressed form of [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]]) encoding or conventional [[binary numeral system|binary]] integer encoding.  The basic formats are the two larger sizes, which have 64-bit and 128-bit encodings.  Generalized formulae for some other interchange formats are also specified.

Extended and extendable formats allow for arithmetic at other precisions and ranges.

=== Clause 4: Attributes and rounding ===

This clause has been changed to encourage the use of static attributes for controlling floating-point operations, and (in addition to required rounding attributes) allow for alternate exception handling, widening of intermediate results, value-changing optimizations, and reproducibility.

The ''round-to-nearest, ties away from zero'' rounding attribute has been added (required for decimal operations only).

=== Clause 5: Operations ===

This section has numerous clarifications (notably in the area of comparisons), and several previously recommended operations (such as copy, negate, abs, and class) are now required.

New operations include [[fused multiply–add]] (FMA), explicit conversions, classification predicates (isNan(''x''), ''etc.''), various min and max functions, a total ordering predicate, and two decimal-specific operations (samequantum and quantize).

==== min and max ====
The [[minimum|min]] and [[maximum|max]] operations are defined but leave some leeway for the case where the inputs are equal in value but differ in representation. In particular:
* &lt;code&gt;min(+0,−0)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;min(−0,+0)&lt;/code&gt; must produce something with a value of zero but may always return the first argument.

In order to support operations such as windowing in which a NaN input should be quietly replaced with one of the end points, min and max are defined to select a number, x, in preference to a quiet NaN:
* &lt;code&gt;min(x,NaN) = min(NaN,x) = x&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;max(x,NaN) = max(NaN,x) = x&lt;/code&gt;

In the current draft, these functions are called ''minNum'' and ''maxNum'' to indicate their preference for a number over a quiet NaN.

==== decimal arithmetic ====
Decimal arithmetic, compatible with that used in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[PL/I]], [[COBOL]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[REXX]], ''etc.'', is also defined in this section.  In general, decimal arithmetic follows the same rules as binary arithmetic (results are correctly rounded, and so on), with additional rules that define the exponent of a result (more than one is possible in many cases).

==== correctly rounded base conversion ====
Unlike in 854, 754r requires correctly rounded [[base conversion]] between decimal and binary floating point within a range which depends on the format.

=== Clause 6: Infinity, NaNs, and sign bit ===

This clause has been revised and clarified, but with no major additions.

=== Clause 7: Default exception handling ===

This clause has been revised and considerably clarified, but with no major additions.

=== Clause 8: Alternate exception handling ===

This clause has been extended from the previous Clause 8 ('Traps') to allow optional exception handling in various forms, including traps and other models such as try/catch.  Traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.

=== Clause 9: Recommended operations ===

This clause is new; it recommends fifty operations, including log, power, and trigonometric functions, that language standards should define.  These are all optional (none are required in order to conform to the standard).  The operations include some on dynamic modes for attributes, and also a set of reduction operations (sum, scaled product, ''etc.'').

=== Clause 10: Expression evaluation ===

This clause is new; it recommends how language standards should specify the semantics of sequences of operations, and points out the subtleties of literal meanings and optimizations that change the value of a result.

=== Clause 11: Reproducibility ===

This clause is new; it recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (''i.e.'', programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language), and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.

=== Annex A: Bibliography ===

This annex is new; it lists some useful references.

=== Annex B: Program debugging support ===

This annex is new; it provides guidance to [[debugger]] developers for features that are desired for supporting the debugging of floating point code.

=== Index of operations ===

This is a new index, which lists all the operations described in the standard (required or optional).

== Discussed but not included ==
Due to changes in CPU design and development, the 2008 IEEE floating point standard could be viewed as historical or outdated as the 1985 standard it replaced. There were many outside discussions and items not covered in the standardization process, the items below are the ones that became public knowledge
* Annex "L" recommended to language developers how to bind items in the standard to features in a language.
* Annex "U" provided guidance on the choice of numeric underflow definitions.

:In 754 the definition of underflow was that the result is tiny and encounters a loss of accuracy.

:Two definitions were allowed for the determination of the 'tiny' condition: before or after rounding the infinitely precise result to working precision, with unbounded exponent.

:Two definitions of loss of accuracy were permitted: inexact result or loss due only to denormalization.  No known hardware systems implemented the latter and it has been removed from the revised standard as an option.

:Annex U of 754r recommended that only tininess after rounding and inexact as loss of accuracy be a cause for underflow signal.

* Annex "Z" introduced optional data types for supporting other fixed width floating point formats, as well as arbitrary precision formats (''i.e.'', where the precision of representation and rounding is determined at execution time) – some of this material was moved into the body of the draft by generalizing section 5. Arbitrary precision was dropped.
* Inheritance and propagation of modes (exception handling, presubstitution, rounding) and flags (inexact, underflow, overflow, divide by zero, invalid).  The desire is to have mode changes be able to be inherited by a callee, but not affect the caller. And have the flags propagate out to a caller.
* Interval and other arithmetics were discussed but not included as being outside scope (and a large piece of work in their own right).  Work is starting in 2008 on a proposed IEEE standard for interval arithmetic.

In [[mathematics]], the '''inverse trigonometric functions''' (occasionally also called '''arcus functions''',&lt;ref name="Taczanowski_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebner_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mejlbro_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duran_2012"/&gt; '''antitrigonometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; or '''cyclometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Klein_1924"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dörrie_1965"/&gt;) are the [[inverse function]]s of the [[trigonometric functions]] (with suitably restricted [[Domain of a function|domain]]s). Specifically, they are the inverses of the [[sine]], [[cosine]], [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangent]], [[cotangent]], [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]], and [[cosecant]] functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in [[engineering]], [[navigation]], [[physics]], and [[geometry]].

==Notation==
There are several notations used for the inverse trigonometric functions.

The most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix, e.g., {{math|arcsin(''x'')}}, {{math|arccos(''x'')}}, {{math|arctan(''x'')}}, etc.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; This convention is used throughout the article.
When measuring in radians, an angle of θ radians will correspond to an arc whose length is rθ, where r is the radius of the circle. Thus, in the [[unit circle]], "the arc whose cosine is x" is the same as "the angle whose cosine is x", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians.&lt;ref name="Americana_1912"/&gt; Similarly, in computer programming languages the inverse trigonometric functions are usually called asin, acos, atan.

The notations {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc., as introduced by [[John Herschel]] in 1813,&lt;ref name="Cajori"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herschel_1813"/&gt; are often used as well in British&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; sources, and this convention complies with the notation of an [[inverse function]]. This might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions like {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between [[multiplicative inverse]] and [[Inverse function|compositional inverse]]. The confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name—for example, {{math|(cos(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{math|sec(''x'')}}. Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt; Another convention used by a few authors&lt;ref name="Bhatti_1999"/&gt; is to use a [[majuscule]] (capital/upper-case) first letter along with a &amp;minus;1 superscript, e.g., {{math|Sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|Cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|Tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc., which avoids confusing them with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc. Since 2009, the [[ISO_80000-2#Function_symbols_and_definitions|ISO 80000-2]] standard has removed the ambiguity by specifying solely the "arc" prefix for the inverse functions.

==Basic properties==

===Principal values===
Since none of the six trigonometric functions are [[One-to-one function|one-to-one]], they are restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore the [[Range (mathematics)|range]]s of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the domains of the original functions.

For example, using ''function'' in the sense of [[multivalued function]]s, just as the [[square root]] function {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} could be defined from {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''x''}}, the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} arcsin(''x'')}} is defined so that sin(''y'') = ''x''. For a given real number ''x'', with −1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1, there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers ''y'' such that {{math|sin(''y'') {{=}} ''x''}}; for example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin(&amp;pi;) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2&amp;pi;) {{=}} 0}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]]. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.

The principal inverses are listed in the following table.

(Note: Some authors define the range of arcsecant to be ( 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{pi}} ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}} ), because the tangent function is nonnegative on this domain. This makes some computations more consistent. For example using this range, {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}, whereas with the range ( 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{pi}} ), we would have to write {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} ±{{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}, since tangent is nonnegative on 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} but nonpositive on {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{pi}}. For a similar reason, the same authors define the range of arccosecant to be −{{pi}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ −{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or 0 &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.)

If ''x'' is allowed to be a [[complex number]], then the range of ''y'' applies only to its real part.

===Relationships between trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions===

Trigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1, and another side of length ''x'' (any real number between 0 and 1), then applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. Purely algebraic derivations are longer.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Complementary angles:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arccos(x) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(x) \\[0.5em]
\arccot(x) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(x) \\[0.5em]
\arccsc(x) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsec(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Negative arguments:

\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arccsc(x) \\[0.3em]

\arccot\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} - \arccot(x) = \arctan(x) \, , \text{ if } x &gt; 0 \\[0.3em]
\arccot\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \frac{3\pi}{2} - \arccot(x) = \pi + \arctan(x) \, , \text{ if } x &lt; 0 \\[0.3em]
\arcsec\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arccos(x) \\[0.3em]
\arccsc\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arcsin(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If you only have a fragment of a sine table:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arccos(x) &amp;= \arcsin\left(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arccos(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(2x^2-1\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arcsin(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(1-2x^2\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arcsin(x) &amp;= \arctan\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \\
\arctan(x) &amp;= \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever the square root of a complex number is used here, we choose the root with the positive real part (or positive imaginary part if the square was negative real).

From the [[tangent half-angle formula|half-angle formula]], &lt;math&gt;\tan\left(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \tfrac{\sin(\theta)}{1 + \cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \\[0.5em]
\arccos(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + x}\right) \, , \text{ if } -1 &lt; x \leq + 1 \\[0.5em]
\arctan(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x^2}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Arctangent addition formula===
:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(u) \pm \arctan(v) = \arctan\left(\frac{u \pm v}{1 \mp uv}\right) \pmod \pi \, , \quad u v \ne 1 \, .&lt;/math&gt;
This is derived from the tangent [[Angle sum and difference identities|addition formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha \pm \beta) = \frac{\tan(\alpha) \pm \tan(\beta)}{1 \mp \tan(\alpha)\tan(\beta)} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
by letting
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \arctan(u) \, , \quad \beta = \arctan(v) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

==In calculus==

==={{anchor|Derivatives}}Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions===
:{{Main|Differentiation of trigonometric functions}}

The [[derivative]]s for complex values of ''z'' are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dz} \arcsin(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} \; ;   &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccos(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} \; ;  &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arctan(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{1+z^2} \; ;          &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -i, +i\\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccot(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{1+z^2} \; ;         &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -i, +i \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arcsec(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^{2}}}} \; ;   &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, 0, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccsc(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^{2}}}} \; ;  &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, 0, +1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Only for real values of ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx} \arcsec(x) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2-1}} \; ;  &amp; |x| &gt; 1\\
\frac{d}{dx} \arccsc(x) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2-1}} \; ; &amp; |x| &gt; 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a sample derivation: if &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \arcsin(x)}{dx} = \frac{d \theta}{d \sin(\theta)} = \frac{d \theta}{\cos(\theta)d \theta} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Expression as definite integrals===
Integrating the derivative and fixing the value at one point gives an expression for the inverse trigonometric function as a definite integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(x) &amp;{}= \int_0^x \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} \, dz \; , &amp; |x| &amp;{} \leq 1\\
\arccos(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} \, dz \; , &amp; |x| &amp;{} \leq 1\\
\arctan(x) &amp;{}= \int_0^x \frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \, dz \; ,\\
\arccot(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^\infty \frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \, dz \; ,\\
\arcsec(x) &amp;{}= \int_1^x \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz = \pi + \int_x^{-1} \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz\; , &amp; x &amp;{} \geq 1\\
\arccsc(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^\infty \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz = \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz \; , &amp; x &amp;{} \geq 1\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
When ''x'' equals 1, the integrals with limited domains are [[improper integral]]s, but still well-defined.

===Infinite series===
Like the sine and cosine functions, the inverse trigonometric functions can be calculated using [[power series]], as follows. For arcsine, the series can be derived by expanding its derivative, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, as a [[binomial series]], and integrating term by term (using the integral definition as above). The series for arctangent can similarly be derived by expanding its derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt; in a [[geometric series]] and applying the integral definition above (see [[Leibniz series]]).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\arcsin(z) &amp; = z + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \frac{z^3}{3} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4} \right) \frac{z^5}{5} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6} \right) \frac{z^7}{7} + \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!} \cdot \frac{z^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\binom{2n} n z^{2n+1}}{4^n (2n+1)} \, ; \qquad |z| \le 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z)
= z - \frac{z^3}{3} +\frac{z^5}{5} - \frac{z^7}{7} + \cdots
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \, ; \qquad |z| \le 1 \qquad z \neq i,-i&lt;/math&gt;

Series for the other inverse trigonometric functions can be given in terms of these according to the relationships given above.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\arccos(x) = \pi/2 - \arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\arccsc(x) = \arcsin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.  Another series is given by:&lt;ref name="Borwein_2004"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right)^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{n^2\binom {2n} n}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Leonhard Euler]] found a series for the arctangent that converges more quickly than its [[Taylor series]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \frac z {1 + z^2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \prod_{k=1}^n \frac{2k z^2}{(2k + 1)(1 + z^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= An elementary derivation of Euler’s series for the arctangent function|journal = The Mathematical Gazette | author = Hwang Chien-Lih | doi = 10.1017/S0025557200178404 | year = 2005 | volume = 89 | issue = 516}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The term in the sum for ''n'' = 0 is the [[empty product]], so is 1.)

Alternatively, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{2n} (n!)^2}{(2n + 1)!} \; \frac{z^{2n + 1}}{(1 + z^2)^{n + 1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Continued fractions for arctangent====
Two alternatives to the power series for arctangent are these [[generalized continued fraction]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) =
\frac z {1 + \cfrac{(1z)^2}{3 - 1z^2 + \cfrac{(3z)^2}{5 - 3z^2 + \cfrac{(5z)^2}{7 - 5z^2 + \cfrac{(7z)^2}{9-7z^2 + \ddots}}}}} =
\frac{z}{1 + \cfrac{(1z)^2}{3 + \cfrac{(2z)^2}{5 + \cfrac{(3z)^2}{7 + \cfrac{(4z)^2}{9 + \ddots}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second of these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from &amp;minus;'''i''' to the point at infinity, going down the imaginary axis, and from '''i''' to the point at infinity, going up the same axis. It works best for real numbers running from −1 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (''nz'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with each perfect square appearing once. The first was developed by [[Leonhard Euler]]; the second by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] utilizing the [[Gaussian hypergeometric series]].

===Indefinite integrals of inverse trigonometric functions===

For real and complex values of ''z'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsin(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arcsin(z) + \sqrt{1 - z^2} + C\\
\int \arccos(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccos(z) - \sqrt{1 - z^2} + C\\
\int \arctan(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arctan(z) - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + z^2 \right) + C\\
\int \arccot(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccot(z) + \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + z^2 \right) + C\\
\int \arcsec(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arcsec(z) - \ln \left[ z \left( 1 + \sqrt{ \frac{z^2-1}{z^2} } \right) \right] + C\\
\int \arccsc(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccsc(z) + \ln \left[ z \left( 1 + \sqrt{ \frac{z^2-1}{z^2} } \right) \right] + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For real ''x'' ≥ 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \ln \left( x + \sqrt{x^2-1} \right) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \ln \left( x + \sqrt{x^2-1} \right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For all real ''x'' not between -1 and 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \sgn(x) \ln\left(\left| x + \sqrt{x^2-1}\right|\right) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \sgn(x) \ln\left(\left| x + \sqrt{x^2-1}\right|\right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value is necessary to compensate for both negative and positive values of the arcsecant and arccosecant functions. The signum function is also necessary due to the absolute values in the [[#Derivatives|derivative]]s of the two functions, which create two different solutions for positive and negative values of x. These can be further simplified using the logarithmic definitions of the [[Inverse hyperbolic functions#Logarithmic representation|inverse hyperbolic function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \operatorname{arcosh}(|x|) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \operatorname{arcosh}(|x|) + C\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value in the argument of the arcosh function creates a negative half of its graph, making it identical to the signum logarithmic function shown above.

All of these antiderivatives can be derived using [[integration by parts]] and the simple derivative forms shown above.

====Example====
Using &lt;math&gt;\int u \, dv = u v - \int v \, du&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. [[integration by parts]]), set

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u &amp;= \arcsin(x) &amp; dv &amp;= dx \\
du &amp;= \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} &amp; v &amp;= x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin(x) \, dx = x \arcsin(x) - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which by a simple [[Integration by substitution|substitution]] yields the final result:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin(x) \, dx = x \arcsin(x) + \sqrt{1-x^2} + C &lt;/math&gt;

== Extension to complex plane ==

[[File:Riemann surface for Arg of ArcTan of x.svg|thumb|A [[Riemann surface]] for the argument of the Tan[z]=x function in the complex plane of x. The orange sheet in the middle is the principal sheet representing ArcTan(x). The blue sheet above and green sheet below are displaced by 2 &amp;pi; and -2 &amp;pi; respectively.]]

Since the inverse trigonometric functions are [[analytic function]]s, they can be extended from the real line to the complex plane. This results in functions with multiple sheets and [[branch point]]s. One possible way of defining the extension is:
:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \int_0^z \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \quad z \neq -i, +i &lt;/math&gt;
where the part of the imaginary axis which does not lie strictly between the branch points (&amp;minus;i and +i) is the [[branch cut]] between the principal sheet and other sheets. The path of the integral must not cross a branch cut. For ''z'' not on a branch cut, a straight line path from 0 to ''z'' is such a path. For ''z'' on a branch cut, the path must approach from Re[x]&gt;0 for the upper branch cut and from Re[x]&lt;0 for the lower branch cut.

The arcsine function may then be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin(z) = \arctan\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}}\right) \quad z \neq -1, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
where (the square-root function has its cut along the negative real axis and) the part of the real axis which does not lie strictly between &amp;minus;1 and +1 is the branch cut between the principal sheet of arcsin and other sheets;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccos(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(z) \quad z \neq -1, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as arcsin;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccot(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(z) \quad z \neq -i, i &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as arctan;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsec(z) = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \quad z \neq -1, 0, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
where the part of the real axis between &amp;minus;1 and +1 inclusive is the cut between the principal sheet of arcsec and other sheets;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccsc(z) = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \quad z \neq -1, 0, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as '''arcsec'''.

===Logarithmic forms===
These functions may also be expressed using [[complex logarithm]]s. This extends in a natural fashion their [[domain of a function|domain]] to the [[complex plane]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right) &amp;{}= \arccsc\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccos(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \, + i \ln \left( iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(z) &amp;{}= \arcsec\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arctan(z) &amp;{}= \tfrac{1}{2} i \left[ \ln \left(1 - iz \right) - \ln \left( 1 + iz \right) \right] &amp;{}= \arccot\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccot(z) &amp;{}= \tfrac{1}{2} i \left[ \ln \left(1 - \frac{i}{z} \right) - \ln \left( 1 + \frac{i}{z} \right) \right] &amp;{}= \arctan\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arcsec(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( \sqrt{\frac{1}{z^2} - 1} + \frac{1}{z} \right) = i \, \ln \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^2}} + \frac{i}{z} \right) + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arccsc(z) &amp;{}= \arccos\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccsc(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^2}} + \frac{i}{z}\right) &amp;{}= \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Elementary proofs of these relations proceed via expansion to exponential forms of the trigonometric functions.

====Example proof====

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\phi) = z &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arcsin(z)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Trigonometric functions#Relationship to exponential function and complex numbers|exponential definition of sine]], one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{e^{\phi i} - e^{-\phi i}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = e^{\phi i} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2iz = {\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\xi - 2iz - \frac{1}{\xi}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^2 - 2i \xi z - 1 \, = \, 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} = e^{\phi i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi i = \ln \left( iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= -i \ln \left( iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

(the positive branch is chosen)

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= \arcsin(z) = -i \ln \left(iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===General solutions===
Each of the trigonometric functions is periodic in the real part of its argument, running through all its values twice in each interval of 2{{pi}}. Sine and cosecant begin their period at 2{{pi}}''k'' − {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} (where ''k'' is an integer), finish it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and then reverse themselves over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Cosine and secant begin their period at 2{{pi}}''k'', finish it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}}, and then reverse themselves over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + 2{{pi}}. Tangent begins its period at 2{{pi}}''k'' − {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, finishes it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and then repeats it (forward) over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Cotangent begins its period at 2{{pi}}''k'', finishes it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}}, and then repeats it (forward) over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + 2{{pi}}.

This periodicity is reflected in the general inverses where ''k'' is some integer:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arcsin(x) + 2\pi k \; \text{ or } \; y = \pi - \arcsin(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:which, written in one equation, is: &lt;math&gt;\sin(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = (-1)^k\arcsin(x) + \pi k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccos(x) + 2\pi k \; \text{ or } \; y = 2\pi - \arccos(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:which, written in one equation, is: &lt;math&gt;\cos(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \pm \arccos(x) + 2\pi k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arctan(x) + \pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cot(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccot(x) + \pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sec(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arcsec(x) + 2\pi k \text{ or } y = 2\pi - \arcsec (x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\csc(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccsc(x) + 2\pi k \text{ or } y = \pi - \arccsc(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;

====Application: finding the angle of a right triangle====
[[Image:Trigonometry triangle.svg|right|thumb|A right triangle.]]
Inverse trigonometric functions are useful when trying to determine the remaining two angles of a [[right triangle]] when the lengths of the sides of the triangle are known. Recalling the right-triangle definitions of sine and cosine, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

Often, the hypotenuse is unknown and would need to be calculated before using arcsine or arccosine using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the hypotenuse. Arctangent comes in handy in this situation, as the length of the hypotenuse is not needed.

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose a roof drops 8 feet as it runs out 20 feet. The roof makes an angle ''θ'' with the horizontal, where ''θ'' may be computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta
= \arctan \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right)
= \arctan \left( \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \right)
= \arctan \left( \frac{8}{20} \right) \approx 21.8^{\circ} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===In computer science and engineering===

====Two-argument variant of arctangent====
{{anchor|Two-argument variant of arctangent}}
{{main|atan2}}
The two-argument [[atan2]] function computes the arctangent of ''y'' / ''x'' given ''y'' and ''x'', but with a range of (−{{pi}},&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}]. In other words, atan2(''y'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis of a plane and  the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, ''y''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.
 
In terms of the standard '''arctan''' function, that is with range of (−{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}), it can be expressed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = \begin{cases}
  \arctan(\frac y x) &amp; \quad x &gt; 0 \\
  \arctan(\frac y x) + \pi &amp; \quad y \ge 0 \; , \; x &lt; 0 \\
  \arctan(\frac y x) - \pi &amp; \quad y &lt; 0 \; , \; x &lt; 0 \\
  \frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \quad y &gt; 0 \; , \; x = 0 \\
  -\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \quad y &lt; 0 \; , \; x = 0 \\
  \text{undefined} &amp; \quad y = 0 \; , \; x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It also equals the [[principal value]] of the [[arg (mathematics)|arg]]ument of the [[complex number]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''i'''''y''.

This function may also be defined using the [[tangent half-angle formula]]e as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = 2\arctan\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
provided that either ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 or ''y''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0. However this fails if given x&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 and y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 so the expression is unsuitable for computational use.

The above argument order (''y'', ''x'') seems to be the most common, and in particular is used in [[ISO standard]]s such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], but a few authors may use the opposite convention (''x'', ''y'') so some caution is warranted.  These variations are detailed at [[atan2#Realizations of the function in common programming languages|atan2]].

====Arctangent function with location parameter====
In many applications{{which|date=March 2014}} the solution &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of the equation &lt;math&gt;x=\tan(y)&lt;/math&gt; is to come as close as possible to a given value &lt;math&gt;-\infty &lt; \eta &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The adequate solution is produced by the parameter modified arctangent function 
:&lt;math&gt;
y = \arctan_\eta(x) := \arctan(x) + \pi \cdot \operatorname{rni}\left(\frac{\eta - \arctan(x)}{\pi} \right)\, .
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rni}&lt;/math&gt; rounds to the nearest integer.

====Numerical accuracy====

For angles near 0 and {{pi}}, arccosine is [[ill-conditioned]] and will thus calculate the angle with reduced accuracy in a computer implementation (due to the limited number of digits).&lt;ref name="Gade_2010"/&gt; Similarly, arcsine is inaccurate for angles near &amp;minus;{{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}/2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1358">In [[mathematics]], '''Jacobsthal sums''' are finite sums of [[Legendre symbol]]s related to [[Gauss sum]]s. They were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Jacobsthal|authorlink=Ernst Jacobsthal|year1=1907}}.

==Definition==

The Jacobsthal sum is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n(a)=\sum_{m\bmod p}\binom{m(m^n+a)}{p}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is prime and () is the [[Legendre symbol]].

'''John Robinson''' (4 May 1935 – 6 April 2007) was a British sculptor and co-founder of the Bradshaw Foundation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com|title=Bradshaw Foundation|first=Bradshaw|last=Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of his work may be seen at the Robinson estate website,&lt;ref name="johnrobinson.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JohnRobinson.com/|title=JohnRobinson.com is available at DomainMarket.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the website of the Centre for the Popularisation of Mathematics&lt;ref name="popmath.org.uk"&gt;http://www.popmath.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and the June and July 2007, issues of Hyperseeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isama.org/hyperseeing|title=HYPERSEEING (from ISAMA)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other distinctions, he was the Official Sculptor for the British Olympic Committee in 1988, and a [[University of Wales]] Honorary Fellow, 1992.

== Sculpture ==

=== Figurative sculptures ===
[[File:Front of the AIS in Canberra.jpg|thumb|''The Acrobats'' in front of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] in Canberra]]

Robinson first made a name for himself with representational pieces. His figurative bronzes ranged in scope and scale from life-size commissioned sculptures of children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/figurative_sculpture.php|title=Symbolic Sculpture - Website of Sculptor John Robinson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to athletic sculptures, and included a commissioned  bust of&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/figurative/hmeizabeth2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] and another of the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]]. His representational sports figure ''Acrobats''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/figurative/acrobats2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; (1980, 5 metres) was first mounted at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Maui, Hawaii. There are another 7 examples around the world, one of which is located outside the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, Australia. 
Another of his athletic sculptures, ''Hammer Thrower'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/figurative/hammer2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen outside the Bowring Building in Tower Hill, London, at the United States Sports Academy, Daphne, Alabama, and in Melbourne, Australia. Robinson was Official Sculptor for the British Olympic Committee in 1988. His ''Gymnast''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/figurative/figurative_detail2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; is at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, donated by the Australian Olympic Committee.

=== Abstract symbolic sculptures and tapestries ===
[[File:Petrie Plaza.jpg|thumb|upright|''Eternity'' (1981) at [[Petrie Plaza]], Canberra]]

In 1975, after listening to a Mozart violin concerto, an abstract form came into his mind, which he then translated into a sculpture. This ''Adagio''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/adagio.php|title=Adagio - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of his non-figurative sculptures. Robinson then embarked on a series of abstract sculptures with the aim of symbolizing human values and our concepts of the dynamic processes which shape our lives. In this ‘Universe Series’ of symbolic sculptures and tapestries, which comprises over 100 works, he combined scientific and mathematical principles with artistic aesthetic. One example is ''Joy of Living''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/joy_of_living.php|title=Joy of Living - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1993), a curving band of stainless steel. The symbolic ''Elation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/elation.php|title=Elation - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1983) conveys the punching of the fist in triumph.

A number of Robinson's sculptures show scientific concepts, such as matter/antimatter in 
''Janus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/janus.php|title=Janus - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolution in ''Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/evolution.php&lt;/ref&gt; the explosions of stars in ''StarBurst''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/star_burst.php|title=Star Burst - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced sculptures related to [[fiber bundles]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpmath/pagesm/fibundle.html&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Borromean rings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpmath/pagesm/borings.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025213451/http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpmath/pagesm/borings.html |archivedate=25 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made a set of tapestries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/tapestries.php|title=Tapestries - Website of Sculptor John Robinson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; woven in [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson, France]].

One of Robinson’s best-known symbolic sculptures is ''Bonds of Friendship''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/bonds_of_friendship.php|title=Bonds of Friendship - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1979), which he dedicated as symbolizing the notion that “trust is the basis of peace”. A 1.5m x 1m edition of ''Bonds'', in polished bronze, was unveiled&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/images/bonds2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979 in Sydney Cove by the Governor General of Australia, to commemorate the landing in 1774 of the First Fleet. An analogous sculpture, but patinated to represent the Old Country, was unveiled in Portsmouth by  [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]. Robinson said that ‘Bonds’ “symbolises the friendship that exists between the two countries, as well as between my patrons and myself, which has enriched my life beyond measure and made the Symbolic Sculptures possible.”

Selections of Robinson’s work have been exhibited at the universities of Leeds, Bangor, Swansea, Liverpool, Wadham College Oxford, Churchill College Cambridge, London, Barcelona, Zaragoza, and at several sites in the U.S. His symbolic sculptures have been donated to a number of Universities, including  Bangor&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpture/sculpture.html&lt;/ref&gt; (4), Cambridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/art/sculptures.html|title=Symbolic Sculptures - Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5), Durham (3), Oxford (2), Macquarie&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artgallery.mq.edu.au/sp/lw/33.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (1). Many of his sculptures can be viewed on web sites, including the Robinson estate website.&lt;ref name="johnrobinson.com"/&gt;  A discussion of Robinson’s work within the context of mathematical principles can be seen at the website of the Centre for the Popularisation of Mathematics&lt;ref name="popmath.org.uk"/&gt; hosted by the University of Wales, Bangor.

== Biography ==

Robinson was born in London on 4 May 1935. His father was Australian and mother English. He was evacuated to Australia from 1940 to 1943, where attended [[Melbourne Grammar School]]. On returning to England, he attended [[Rugby School]], where he received prizes for geometry and sculpture. He left school at the age of 16 and joined the Merchant Navy, but left the Navy upon arrival in Australia. There he engaged in a wide range of activities that enabled him to explore that continent. His adventures ranged from [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackeroo]]ing and cattle droving to serving on a mounted patrol: he joined the last Mounted Police Patrol and trekked on horseback through 1100 kilometres of the [[King Leopold Ranges]] of the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of Western Australia. In the 1950s, he married, bought a {{convert|1600|acre|km2|adj=on}} virgin scrub block in the Ninety Mile Desert of South Australia and for ten years, he and Margie developed a sheep farm. Their three sons were born on that farm.

[[File:AIS statue 0006.JPG|thumb|left|''The Gymnast'' at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] in [[Canberra]].]]
In the late 1960s, he bought some modelling clay and started modelling friends and children, working in his shearing shed at weekends. His sculpting became so consuming that, in 1969 at the age of 35, having developed the farm totally and alone, he sold it for enough money to support himself and his family for two years to try his hand as a sculptor. Robinson returned to England with his wife and 3 sons to begin his sculpting career in earnest. Robinson first worked from a barn studio in [[Devon]] in the early 1970s, and later moved his family and studio to [[Somerset]].

In 1983-1985 Robinson opened the Freeland Gallery&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpture/images/gall.gif&lt;/ref&gt; in Albemarle Street, London, showing both figurative and representative sculptures. This led to contact with several art collectors and with the topologist [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronnie Brown]]. He and John collaborated in designing an exhibition of 13 full size sculptures at the Pop Maths Roadshow at  Leeds University in 1989. The Catalogue they prepared for this exhibition, ''Symbolic Sculptures and Tapestries'', was widely distributed and led to further exhibitions.

In 1992 John was made an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groupoids.org.uk/popmath/cpm/sculpture/pages/1immorta.html|title=John Robinson - Immortality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the value of his sculpture and his collaboration with the Department of Mathematics. In 1996 he worked with [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronnie Brown]] and Cara Quinton on a web account of his sculptures, and this convinced him of the value of the internet. In typical fashion, he developed his own ideas, skills and a team of experts. Later he worked with  Nick Mee of  Virtual Image&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualimage.co.uk/index.html|title=Maths Starters for schools, parents and home tutors|first=Virtual|last=Image|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create animations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/animations.php|title=Symbolic Sculpture - Website of Sculptor John Robinson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of some of his sculptures, and these were used in a CDRom produced by John, another developed by Ronnie Brown in  WMY2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mat.dtu.dk/people/V.L.Hansen/wmy.html|title=Vagn Lundsgaard Hansen|first=Martin Lundsgaard Hansen, thats IT (c)|last=1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under an EC grant, and in the two web sites referred to earlier.

For an indication of John's style of symbolism and craftmanship, see ''Mortality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/mortality-johnsm.jpg|title=Ronald Brown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'From nothing to nothing, cut from an egg, representing the cycle of life', and also ''Immortality'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/jr/immortality.php|title=Immortality - John Robinson Symbolic Sculptures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Passing on the torch of life''.

=== Rock Art Research and the Bradshaw Foundation ===
After a lifetime of interest in art, archaeology and anthropology, Robinson co-founded the Bradshaw Foundation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  This foundation was formed in 1992 following an expedition to the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of north-western Australia to examine a distributed set of rock art called the [[Bradshaws]]. Robinson’s travels to study rock art took him from the Sahara Desert to Easter Island. He was one of the few members of the [[Chauvet Cave]] scientific exploration team, led by Jean Clottes. In 1998, Robinson visited the Chauvet cave with Dr. Clottes, Dr. [[David Lewis-Williams]], and several other team members, to visit the images estimated to be older than 35,000 years, the oldest art yet discovered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Robinson also travelled from Petra in Jordan to the Olgas in Central Australia, visited art academies throughout China, and explored the temples of Egypt, Mexico, Malta, Samarkand and Bokara in Uzbekistan.

The Bradshaw Foundation's first publication 'Bradshaws - Rock Paintings of North-Western Australia' was edited by Robinson in 1993. He foresaw the importance of the emerging World Wide Web, and in 1997 the Bradshaw Foundation website&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; was established to highlight rock art research from around the world. In 2004 the website further expanded as Robinson introduced the genetic research of Professor Stephen Oppenheimer of Oxford University, in order to give rock art an anthropological context. This resulted in the 'Journey of Mankind - Genetic Map'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/stephenoppenheimer/|title=Bradshaw Foundation - Journey of Mankind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point the Bradshaw Foundation received a web award from ''Scientific American''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0008B108-3BE8-115C-BBE883414B7F0000&lt;/ref&gt; for work in the field of Anthropology &amp; Paleontology.

In March 2007 Robinson was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. He died on April 6 the same year at his home in Somerset, England after a short illness, fully in control, and, as he said, with no regrets. Two of his sculptures illustrate his attitude: ''Mortality'' (1982), ''From nothing to nothing, cut from an egg'', where the egg is the symbol of the cycle of life; and ''Immortality'' (1982), ''Passing on the torch of life''.

}}'''Julian Lowell Coolidge''' (September 28, 1873 – March 5, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and a [[professor]] and chairman of the [[Harvard University]] Mathematics Department.&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id= Coolidge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], he graduated from [[Harvard University]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

Between 1897 and 1899 Julian Coolidge taught at the [[Groton School]] where one of his students was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; He left the private school to accept a teaching position at Harvard and in 1902 was given an assistant professorship, but took two years off to further his education with studies in [[Turin, Italy]]&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; before receiving his [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id= 30689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Coolidge then returned to teach at Harvard where he remained for his entire academic career, interrupted only by a year at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris as an exchange professor.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22061">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Kakutani fixed-point theorem''' is a [[fixed-point theorem]] for [[set-valued function]]s. It provides [[sufficient condition]]s for a set-valued function defined on a [[convex set|convex]], [[compact set|compact]] subset of a [[Euclidean space]] to have a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], i.e. a point which is [[map (mathematics)|map]]ped to a set containing it. The Kakutani fixed point theorem is a generalization of [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]]. The Brouwer fixed point theorem is a fundamental result in [[topology]] which proves the existence of fixed points for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s defined on compact, convex subsets of Euclidean spaces.  Kakutani's theorem extends this to set-valued functions.

The theorem was developed by [[Shizuo Kakutani]] in 1941,&lt;ref name="kakutani"&gt;

: ''Let'' ''S'' ''be a [[empty set|non-empty]], [[compact set|compact]] and [[convex set|convex]] [[subset]] of some [[Euclidean space]]'' '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. ''Let'' ''φ'':&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; ''be a [[set-valued function]] on'' ''S'' ''with a closed graph and the property that'' ''φ''(''x'') ''is non-empty and convex for all'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''. ''Then'' ''φ'' ''has a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]].''

==Definitions==
;Set-valued function: A '''set-valued function''' ''φ'' from the set ''X'' to the set ''Y'' is some rule that associates one ''or more'' points in ''Y'' with each point in ''X''. Formally it can be seen just as an ordinary [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''X'' to the [[power set]] of ''Y'', written as ''φ'':&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;, such that ''φ''(''x'') is non-empty for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;.  Some prefer the term '''correspondence''', which is used to refer to a function that for each input may return many outputs. Thus, each element of the domain corresponds to a subset of one or more elements of the range.
;Closed graph: A set-valued function φ:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; is said to have a '''closed graph''' if the set {(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''φ''(''x'')} is a [[closed set|closed]] subset of ''X''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''Y'' in the [[product topology]] i.e. for all sequences &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{y_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n\to x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_{n}\to y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{n}\in \varphi(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;y\in \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
;Fixed point: Let φ:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; be a set-valued function. Then ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' is a '''fixed point''' of ''φ'' if ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''φ''(''a'').

==Example==
[[File:Kakutani.svg|thumb|150px|Fixed points for f(x)=&lt;nowiki&gt;[1−x/2,&amp;nbsp;1−x/4]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]Let ''f''(''x'') be a set-valued function defined on the closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&amp;nbsp;1] that maps a point ''x'' to the closed interval [1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''/2,&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''/4]. Then ''f''(''x'') satisfies all the assumptions of the theorem and must have fixed points.

In the diagram, any point on the 45° line (dotted line in red) which intersects the graph of the function (shaded in grey) is a fixed point, so in fact there is an infinity of fixed points in this particular case. For example, ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.72 (dashed line in blue) is a fixed point since 0.72&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.72/2,&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.72/4].

==Non-example==
[[File:Kakutani non.svg|thumb|150px|A function without fixed points]]The requirement that ''φ''(''x'') be convex for all ''x'' is essential for the theorem to hold.

Consider the following function defined on [0,1]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi(x)=
\begin{cases}
3/4           &amp; 0 \le x &lt; 0.5 \\
\{ 3/4, 1/4 \}  &amp; x = 0.5 \\
1/4           &amp; 0.5 &lt; x \le 1
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
The function has no fixed point. Though it satisfies all other requirements of Kakutani's theorem, its value fails to be convex at ''x'' = 0.5.
{{clear}}&lt;!--Stops image from floating past--&gt;

==Alternative statement==
Some sources, including Kakutani's original paper, use the concept of [[Hemicontinuity#Upper hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuity]] while stating the theorem:
:''Let'' ''S'' ''be a [[empty set|non-empty]], [[compact set|compact]] and [[convex set|convex]] [[subset]] of some [[Euclidean space]]'' '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. ''Let'' ''φ'':&amp;nbsp;''S''→2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; ''be an [[Hemicontinuity#Upper hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]] [[set-valued function]] on'' ''S'' ''with the property that'' ''φ''(''x'') ''is non-empty and convex for all'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''. ''Then'' ''φ'' ''has a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]].''

This statement of Kakutani's theorem is completely equivalent to the statement given at the beginning of this article.

We can show this by using the [[Closed graph theorem]] for set-valued functions,&lt;ref name="aliprantis"/&gt; which says that a for a compact [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] range space ''Y'', a set-valued function ''φ'':&amp;nbsp;''X''→2&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; has a closed graph if and only if it is upper hemicontinuous and ''φ''(''x'') is a closed set for all ''x''. Since all [[Euclidean space]]s are Hausdorff (being [[metric space]]s) and ''φ'' is required to be closed-valued in the alternative statement of the Kakutani theorem, the Closed Graph Theorem implies that the two statements are equivalent.

==Applications==
{{See also|Mathematical economics}}

===Game theory===
{{See also|Game theory}}
The Kakutani fixed point theorem can be used to prove the [[Minimax#Minimax theorem|minimax theorem]] in the theory of [[zero-sum game]]s. This application was specifically discussed by Kakutani's original paper.&lt;ref name="kakutani"/&gt;

Mathematician [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] used the Kakutani fixed point theorem to prove a major result in [[game theory]].&lt;ref name="nash"&gt;

Stated informally, the theorem implies the existence of a [[Nash equilibrium]] in every finite game with mixed strategies for any number of players. This work later earned him a [[Nobel Prize in Economics]].

In this case, ''S'' is the set of [[tuple]]s of [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]] chosen by each player in a game. The function φ(''x'') gives a new tuple where each player's strategy is her best response to other players' strategies in ''x''. Since there may be a number of responses which are equally good, φ is set-valued rather than single-valued. Then the [[Nash equilibrium]] of the game is defined as a fixed point of φ, i.e. a tuple of strategies where each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies of the other players. Kakutani's theorem ensures that this fixed point exists.

===General equilibrium===
{{See also|General equilibrium}}
In [[general equilibrium]] theory in economics, Kakutani's theorem has been used to prove the existence of set of prices which simultaneously equate supply with demand in all markets of an economy.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of such prices had been an open question in economics going back to at least [[Léon Walras|Walras]]. The first proof of this result was constructed by [[Lionel McKenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lionel |last=McKenzie |title=On Equilibrium in Graham's Model of World Trade and Other Competitive Systems |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |year=1954 |pages=147–161 |doi=10.2307/1907539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, ''S'' is the set of [[tuple]]s of commodity prices. φ(''x'') is chosen as a function whose result is different from its arguments as long as the price-tuple ''x'' does not equate supply and demand everywhere. The challenge here is to construct φ so that it has this property while at the same time satisfying the conditions in Kakutani's theorem. If this can be done then φ has a fixed point according to the theorem. Given the way it was constructed, this fixed point must correspond to a price-tuple which equates supply with demand everywhere.

===Fair division===
{{See also|Fair cake-cutting}}
Kakutani's fixed-point theorem is used in proving the existence of cake allocations that are both [[envy-free cake-cutting|envy-free]] and [[Pareto efficient]]. This result is known as [[Weller's theorem]].

==Proof outline==

===''S'' = &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;===
The proof of Kakutani's theorem is simplest for set-valued functions defined over [[interval (mathematics)|closed intervals]] of the real line. However, the proof of this case is instructive since its general strategy can be carried over to the higher-dimensional case as well.

Let φ: &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;→2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; be a [[set-valued function]] on the closed interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which satisfies the conditions of Kakutani's fixed-point theorem.

* '''Create a sequence of subdivisions of &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with adjacent points moving in opposite directions.'''
Let (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''i'' = 0, 1, … be a [[sequence]] with the following properties:
:{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''1.'''||width="50%"|1 ≥ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0
|'''2.'''||width="40%"|(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;−''i''&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|'''3.'''||''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ φ(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)
|'''4.'''||''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ φ(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
|'''5.'''||''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
|'''6.'''||''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Thus, the closed intervals &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; form a sequence of subintervals of &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Condition (2) tells us that these subintervals continue to become smaller while condition (3)–(6) tell us that the function φ shifts the left end of each subinterval to its right and shifts the right end of each subinterval to its left.

Such a sequence can be constructed as follows. Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be any point in φ(0) and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be any point in φ(1). Then, conditions (1)–(4) are immediately fulfilled. Moreover, since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ φ(0) ⊂ &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, it must be the case that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 and hence condition (5) is fulfilled. Similarly condition (6) is fulfilled by ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now suppose we have chosen ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying (1)–(6). Let,
:''m'' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;+''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2.
Then ''m'' ∈ &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt; because &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is [[convex set|convex]].

If there is a ''r'' ∈ φ(''m'') such that ''r'' ≥ ''m'', then we take,
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''
:''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''
:''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
Otherwise, since φ(''m'') is non-empty, there must be a ''s'' ∈ φ(''m'')  such that ''s'' ≤ ''m''. In this case let,
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''.
It can be verified that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy conditions (1)–(6).

* '''Find a limiting point of the subdivisions.'''
The [[cartesian product]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;×&lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;×&lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;×&lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a [[compact set]] by [[Tychonoff's theorem]]. Since the sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in this compact set, it must have a [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] [[subsequence]] by the [[Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem]]. Let's fix attention on such a subsequence and let its limit be (''a''*, ''p''*,''b''*,''q''*). Since the graph of φ is closed it must be the case that ''p''* ∈ φ(''a''*) and ''q''* ∈ φ(''b''*). Moreover, by condition (5), ''p''* ≥ ''a''* and by condition (6), ''q''* ≤ ''b''*.

But since (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;−''i''&lt;/sup&gt; by condition (2),
:''b''* − ''a''* = (lim ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) − (lim ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = lim (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.
So, ''b''* equals ''a''*. Let ''x'' = ''b''* = ''a''*.

Then we have the situation that

:φ(''x'') ∋ ''q''* ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''p''* ∈ φ(''x'').

* '''Show that the limiting point is a fixed point.'''
If ''p''* = ''q''* then ''p''* = ''x'' = ''q''*. Since ''p''* ∈ φ(''x''), ''x'' is a fixed point of φ.

Otherwise, we can write the following.  Recall that we can parameterize a line between two points a and b by (1-t)a + tb.  Using our finding above that q&lt;x&lt;p, we can create such a line between p and q as a function of x (notice the fractions below are on the unit interval).  By a convenient writing of x, and since φ(''x'') is [[convex set|convex]] and
:&lt;math&gt;x=\left(\frac{x-q^*}{p^*-q^*}\right)p^*+\left(1-\frac{x-q^*}{p^*-q^*}\right)q^*&lt;/math&gt;
it once again follows that ''x'' must belong to φ(''x'') since ''p''* and ''q''* do and hence ''x'' is a fixed point of φ.

===''S'' is a ''n''-simplex===
In dimensions greater one, [[simplex|''n''-simplices]] are the simplest objects on which Kakutani's theorem can be proved. Informally, a ''n''-simplex is the higher-dimensional version of a triangle. Proving Kakutani's theorem for set-valued function defined on a simplex is not essentially different from proving it for intervals. The additional complexity in the higher-dimensional case exists in the first step of chopping up the domain into finer subpieces:
* Where we split intervals into two at the middle in the one-dimensional case, [[barycentric subdivision]] is used to break up a simplex into smaller sub-simplices.
* While in the one-dimensional case we could use elementary arguments to pick one of the half-intervals in a way that its end-points were moved in opposite directions, in the case of simplices the [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] result known as [[Sperner's lemma]] is used to guarantee the existence of an appropriate subsimplex.

Once these changes have been made to the first step, the second and third steps of finding a limiting point and proving that it is a fixed point are almost unchanged from the one-dimensional case.

===Arbitrary ''S''===
Kakutani's theorem for n-simplices can be used to prove the theorem for an arbitrary compact, convex ''S''. Once again we employ the same technique of creating increasingly finer subdivisions. But instead of triangles with straight edges as in the case of n-simplices, we now use triangles with curved edges. In formal terms, we find a simplex which covers ''S'' and then move the problem from ''S'' to the simplex by using a [[deformation retract]]. Then we can apply the already established result for n-simplices.

==Infinite-dimensional generalizations==
Kakutani's fixed-point theorem was extended to infinite-dimensional [[locally convex topological vector space]]s by [[Irving Glicksberg]]&lt;ref&gt;

To state the theorem in this case, we need a few more definitions:
;Upper hemicontinuity: A set-valued function φ:&amp;nbsp;''X''→2&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; is '''[[upper hemicontinuous]]''' if for every [[open set]] ''W''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''Y'', the set {''x''|&amp;nbsp;φ(''x'')&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''W''} is open in ''X''.&lt;ref name="dugundji"&gt;

;Kakutani map: Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[topological vector space]]s and φ:&amp;nbsp;''X''→2&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; be a set-valued function. If ''Y'' is convex, then φ is termed a '''Kakutani map''' if it is upper hemicontinuous and φ(''x'') is non-empty, compact and convex for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''.&lt;ref name="dugundji"/&gt;

Then the Kakutani–Glicksberg–Fan theorem can be stated as:&lt;ref name="dugundji"/&gt;
:''Let S be a [[empty set|non-empty]], [[compact set|compact]] and [[convex set|convex]] [[subset]] of a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[locally convex topological vector space]]. Let φ:&amp;nbsp;S→2&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; be a Kakutani map. Then φ has a fixed point.''

The corresponding result for single-valued functions is the [[Tychonoff fixed-point theorem]].

There is another version that the statement of the theorem becomes the same as that in the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] case:&lt;ref name="aliprantis"&gt;

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Let S be a [[empty set|non-empty]], [[compact set|compact]] and [[convex set|convex]] [[subset]] of a  [[Locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] [[Hausdorff space]]. Let φ:&amp;nbsp;S→2&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; be a [[set-valued function]] on S which has a closed graph and the property that φ(x) is non-empty and convex for all x&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;S. Then the set of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of φ is non-empty and compact.''

==Anecdote==
In his game theory textbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binmore |first=Ken |title=Playing for Real: A Text on Game Theory |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=1st |chapter=When Do Nash Equilibria Exist? |page=256 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=NycDSDcmSM4C&amp;pg=PA256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Binmore]] recalls that Kakutani once asked him at a conference why so many economists had attended his talk. When Binmore told him that it was probably because of the Kakutani fixed point theorem, Kakutani was puzzled and replied, "What is the Kakutani fixed point theorem?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6905">In [[formal language theory]], an '''LL grammar''' is a [[formal grammar]] that can be [[parsing|parsed]] by an [[LL parser]], which parses the input from '''L'''eft to right, and constructs a [[Context-free grammar#Derivations and syntax trees|'''L'''eftmost derivation]] of the sentence (hence LL, compared with [[LR parser]] that constructs a rightmost derivation). A language that has an LL grammar is known as an '''LL language'''. These form subsets of [[deterministic context-free grammar]]s (DCFGs) and [[deterministic context-free language]]s (DCFLs), respectively. One says that a given grammar or language "is an LL grammar/language" or simply "is LL" to indicate that it is in this class.

LL parsers are table-based parsers, similar to LR parsers. LL grammars can alternatively be characterized as precisely those that can be parsed by a [[predictive parser]] – a [[recursive descent parser]] without [[backtracking]] – and these can be readily written by hand. This article is about the formal properties of LL grammars; for parsing, see [[LL parser]] or [[recursive descent parser]].

==Relation to LL parsers==
There is a separate LL(''k'') parser for each natural number ''k'' (0, 1, 2, ...). A LL parser is called a LL(''k'') parser if it uses ''k'' [[token (parser)|tokens]] of [[Parsing#Lookahead|lookahead]] when parsing a sentence. A LL(''k'') parser recognizes the languages generated by some ''ε''-free LL(''k'') grammar. As allowing more tokens of lookahead makes the parser strictly more powerful, the languages that can be recognized with a LL(''k'') parser are a strict subset of the languages that can be recognized by a LL(''k+n''), ''n &gt; 0'' parser. This creates a strictly increasing sequence of sets: LL(0) ⊊ LL(1) ⊊ LL(2) ⊊ …. Since these are all DCFLs, a corollary is that for any fixed ''k'', there are DCFLs that cannot be recognized by a LL(''k'') parser.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenkrantz|Stearns|1970|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An LL parser is called an LL(*) parser if it is not restricted to a finite ''k'' tokens of lookahead, but can make parsing decisions by recognizing whether the following tokens belong to a [[regular language]] (for example by use of a [[Deterministic Finite Automaton]]), and accordingly there are the set of LL(*) grammars and the set of LL(*) languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1993316.1993548| title = LL(*)| journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices| volume = 46| issue = 6| pages = 425| year = 2011| last1 = Parr | first1 = T. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''ε''-free LL(''k'') grammars are considered for LL(''k'') parsers, allowing ''ε''-rules increases the expressive power of the grammar: For every ''ε''-free LL(''k+1'') grammar, there exists a LL(''k'') grammar with ''ε''-rules that generates the same language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenkrantz|Stearns|1970|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other grammar classes==
Every LL(''k'') grammar is also a LR(''k'') grammar. It is also decidable if a given LR(''k'') grammar is also a LL(''m'') grammar for some ''m''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozenkratz|Stearns|1970|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''ε''-free LL(1) grammar is also a SLR(1) grammar. A LL(1) grammar with symbols that have both empty and non-empty derivations is also a LALR(1) grammar. A LL(1) grammar with symbols that have only the empty derivation may or may not be LALR(1).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beaty|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LL grammars cannot have rules containing [[left recursion]]. Removing left recursion from a context-free grammar is always possible. However, the resulting grammar may be bigger, require more lookahead tokens than preferred to be an LL grammar, or not be an LL grammar at all. LL(''k'') grammars that are ε-free can be transformed into [[Greibach normal form]] (which by definition do not have rules with left recursion) without increasing the lookahead tokens.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozenkratz|Stearns|1970|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple deterministic languages===
The class of languages having an ε-free LL(1) grammar equals the class of simple deterministic languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenkrantz|Stearns|1970|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the languages generated by ''simple'' context-free grammars,
which are the context-free grammars in [[Greibach normal form]] (i.e. for which each rule has the form &lt;math&gt;Z \rightarrow aY_1 \ldots Y_n, n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) such that different right hand sides for the same nonterminal &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; always start with different terminals &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

This language class includes the regular sets with end-markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalence is decidable for it, while inclusion is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Korenjak, A.J., Hopcroft, J.E.| chapter=Simple deterministic languages| title=IEEE Conf. Rec. 7th Ann. Symp. on Switching and Automata Theory (SWAT)| year=1966| month=| volume=16-C-40| pages=36–46| series=IEEE Pub. No. |doi=10.1109/SWAT.1966.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
LL grammars, particularly LL(1) grammars, are of great practical interest, as they are easy to parse, either by LL parsers or by recursive descent parsers, and many [[computer language]]s are designed to be LL(1) for this reason. Languages based on grammars with a high value of ''k'' have traditionally been considered {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} to be difficult to parse, although this is less true now given the availability and widespread use {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} of parser generators supporting LL(''k'') grammars for arbitrary ''k''.

'''Laurent Lafforgue''' ({{IPA-fr|lafɔʁɡ|lang}}; born 6 November 1966) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]. He has made outstanding contributions to [[Langlands' program]] in the fields of [[number theory]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;D Mackenzie (2000) ''Fermat's Last Theorem's First Cousin'', [[Science (journal)|Science]] 287(5454), 792-793.&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular proved the Langlands conjectures for the [[Automorphism#Automorphism group|automorphism group]] of a function field. The crucial contribution by Lafforgue to solve this question is the construction of compactifications of certain [[moduli stack]]s of [[shtuka]]s. The monumental [[mathematical proof|proof]] is the result of more than six years of concentrated efforts.

In 2002 at the 24th [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], he received the [[Fields Medal]] together with [[Vladimir Voevodsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedlander, Eric M.|author2=Rapoport, Michael|author3=Suslin, Andrei|year=2003|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-suslin.pdf|title=The mathematical work of the 2002 Fields medalists|journal=Notices Amer. Math. Soc.|volume=50|issue=2|pages=212–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Laurent Lafforgue has two brothers, Thomas and [[Vincent Lafforgue|Vincent]], both mathematicians. Thomas is now a teacher in a ''[[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles]]'' at Lycée Louis le Grand in [[Paris]] and [[Vincent Lafforgue|Vincent]] a [[CNRS]] directeur de recherches at the Institut Fourier in Grenoble.

He won 2 silver medals at [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] (IMO) in 1984 and 1985. He entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1986. In 1994 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] under the direction of [[Gérard Laumon]] in the [[Arithmetic]] and [[Algebraic Geometry]] team at the [[Université de Paris-Sud]]. Currently he is a research director of [[CNRS]], detached as permanent professor of [[mathematics]] at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (I.H.E.S.) in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]], France.

Laurent is a devout catholic and never married&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laurentlafforgue.org/textes/ChristVeriteEnseignementCatholique.pdf|title=The Christ is the truth|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==Career==
He received the [[Clay Research Award]] in 2000, and the {{ill|Grand Prix Jacques Herbrand|fr}} of the [[French Academy of Sciences#Medals, awards and prizes|French Academy of Sciences]] in 2001. His younger brother [[Vincent Lafforgue]] is also a notable mathematician. On 22 May 2011 Lafforgue was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Notre Dame |title=Honorary Degree |url=http://commencement.nd.edu/archives/honorary-degrees/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813213048/http://commencement.nd.edu/archives/honorary-degrees/ |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Lafforgue is a critic of what he calls the "pedagogically correct" in France's educational system. In 2005, he was forced to resign from the [[Haut conseil de l'éducation]] after he expressed these views in a private letter that he sent to [[Bruno Racine]], president of the HCE, that later was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archives.polemia.com/article.php?id=1128|title=« Démission » forcée de Laurent Lafforgue, mathématicien français, du Haut Conseil de l'Education (HCE)|work=Polémia|language=French|date=December 10, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3879">In [[algebra]], '''like terms''' are [[Term (mathematics)|term]]s that have the same [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]s and [[Exponentiation|power]]s. The [[coefficient]]s do not need to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.com/school/subject2/lessons/S2U2L4DP.html |title=Like terms in Depth |accessdate=2008-09-07 |work=Math Online |publisher=Math Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unlike terms''' are two or more [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] that are not like terms, i.e. they do not have the same variables or powers. The order of the variables does not matter unless there is a power. For example, 8''xyz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;minus;5''xyz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are like terms because they have the same variables and power while 3''abc'' and 3''ghi'' are unlike terms because they have different variables. Since the coefficient doesn't affect likeness, all [[constant term]]s are like terms.

==Generalization==
In this discussion, a "term" will refer to a string of numbers being multiplied or divided (remember that division is simply multiplication by a reciprocal) together. Terms are within the same expression and are combined by either addition or subtraction. For example, take the expression:

&lt;math&gt;ax+bx&lt;/math&gt;

There are two terms in this expression. Notice that the two terms have a common factor, that is, both terms have an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This means that we can factor out that common factor variable, resulting in

&lt;math&gt;(a+b)x&lt;/math&gt;

If the expression in parentheses may be calculated, that is, if the variables in the expression in the parentheses are known numbers, then it is simpler to write the calculation &lt;math&gt;a+b&lt;/math&gt;. and juxtapose that new number with the remaining unknown number. Terms combined in an expression with a common, unknown factor (or multiple unknown factors) are called like terms.

==Examples==

===General Example===
To provide an example for above, let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; have arbitrary values, so that their sum may be calculated. For ease of calculation, let &lt;math&gt;a=5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=3&lt;/math&gt;. The original expression becomes

&lt;math&gt;5x+3x&lt;/math&gt;

which may be factored into

&lt;math&gt;(5+3)x&lt;/math&gt;

or, equally,

&lt;math&gt;8x&lt;/math&gt;.

This demonstrates that

&lt;math&gt;5x+3x=8x&lt;/math&gt;

The known values assigned to the unlike part of two or more terms are called coefficients. As this example shows, when like terms exist in an expression, they may be combined by adding or subtracting (whatever the expression indicates) the coefficients, and maintaining the common factor of both terms. Such combination is called combining like terms, and it is an important tool used for solving equations.

===Simplifying An Expression===
Take the expression, which is to be simplified:

&lt;math&gt;3(4x^2y-6y)+7x^2y-3y^2+2(8y-4y^2-4x^2y)&lt;/math&gt;

The first step to grouping like terms in this expression is to get rid of the parentheses. Do this by distributing (multiplying) each number in front of a set of parentheses to each term in that set of parentheses:

&lt;math&gt;12x^2y-18y+7x^2y-3y^2+16y-8y^2-8x^2y&lt;/math&gt;

The like terms in this expression are the terms that can be grouped together by having exactly the same set of unknown factors. Here, the sets of unknown factors are &lt;math&gt;x^2y,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y^2,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y.&lt;/math&gt;. By the rule in the first example, all terms with the same set of unknown factors, that is, all like terms, may be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients, while maintaining the unknown factors. Thus, the expression becomes

&lt;math&gt;11x^2y-2y-11y^2&lt;/math&gt;

The expression is considered simplified when all like terms have been combined, and all terms present are unlike. In this case, all terms now have different unknown factors, and are thus unlike, and so the expression is completely simplified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3303">The low basis theorem is one of several [[Basis theorem (computability)|basis theorems]] in computability theory, each of which shows that, given an infinite subtree of the binary tree &lt;math&gt;2^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to find an infinite path through the tree with particular computability properties. The low basis theorem, in particular, shows that there must be a path which is [[low_(computability)|low]], that is, the [[Turing jump]] of the path is Turing equivalent to the [[halting problem]] &lt;math&gt;\emptyset'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Statement and proof ==

The low basis theorem states that every nonempty [[Π01_class|&lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; class]] in &lt;math&gt;2^\omega&lt;/math&gt; (see [[arithmetical hierarchy]]) contains a set of [[low (computability)|low degree]] (Soare 1987:109). This is equivalent, by definition, to the statement that each infinite computable subtree of the binary tree &lt;math&gt;2^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite path of low degree. 

The proof uses the method of forcing with &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; classes (Cooper 2004:330).   Hájek and Kučera (1989) showed that the low basis is provable in the formal system of arithmetic known as &lt;math&gt;\text{I-}\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application ==

One application of the low basis theorem is to construct completions of effective theories so that the completions have low Turing degree. For example, the low basis theorem implies the existence of [[PA degree]]s strictly below &lt;math&gt;\emptyset'&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12053">{{math|}}The '''Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)''' is an alphanumerical [[classification scheme]] collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. The MSC is used by many mathematics [[Academic journal|journals]], which ask authors of [[research papers]] and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.

== Structure ==

The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.

The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:

* '''53''' is the classification for [[differential geometry]]
* '''53A''' is the classification for classical differential geometry
* '''53A45''' is the classification for [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[tensor]] analysis

=== First level ===
At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for "[[History]] and [[Biography]]", "[[Mathematics Education]]", and for the overlap with different sciences. [[Physics]] (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:
* [[Fluid mechanics]]
* [[Quantum mechanics]]
* [[Geophysics]]
* [[Optics]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]

All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.

=== Second level ===

The second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.

For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is '''53''', and the second-level codes are:
* '''A''' for classical differential geometry
* '''B''' for local differential geometry
* '''C''' for global differential geometry
* '''D''' for symplectic geometry and contact geometry

In addition, the special second level code "-" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:

* '''53-00''' General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.)
* '''53-01''' Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.)
* '''53-02''' Research exposition (monographs, survey articles)
* '''53-03''' Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01)
* '''53-04''' Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming)
* '''53-06''' Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc.

The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use '''53-''' as a classification. Either '''53''' on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.

=== Third level ===

Third level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.

The third-level code '''99''' exists in every category and means ''none of the above, but in this section''

== Using the scheme ==

The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like

MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;

=={{anchor|MOS|AMS Classification|MSC1990|MSC2000|MSC2010}}History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
According to the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) help page about MSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html#mscp]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's ''Mathematical Offprint Service'' (MOS scheme), the ''AMS Classification'' was established for the classification of reviews in ''Mathematical Reviews'' in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, [[Zentralblatt für Mathematik]] started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as ''MSC1990'', ''MSC2000'' and ''MSC2010''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Wegner. ''Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC''. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msc2020.org Announcement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.

== Relation to other classification schemes ==

For physics papers the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the [[arXiv]].

The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for [[computer science]]. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.

The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12934">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''n''-flake}}
An '''''n''-flake''', '''polyflake''', or '''Sierpinski ''n''-gon''',&lt;ref name=DennisSchlicker&gt;{{Citation|last = Dennis|first = Kevin|last2 = Schlicker|first2 = Steven|title = Sierpinski ''n''-Gons|url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/schlicks/SNGONS4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} is a [[fractal]] constructed starting from an [[n-gon|''n''-gon]]. This ''n''-gon is replaced by a flake of smaller ''n''-gons, such that the scaled polygons are placed at the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]], and sometimes in the center. This process is repeated recursively to result in the fractal. Typically, there is also the restriction that the ''n''-gons must touch yet not overlap.

== In two dimensions ==
The most common variety of ''n''-flake is two-dimensional (in terms of its [[topological dimension]]) and is formed of polygons.  The four most common special cases are formed with triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, but it can be extended to any polygon.&lt;ref name=DennisSchlicker/&gt;{{rp|2}} Its boundary is the [[von Koch curve]] of varying types &amp;ndash; depending on the ''n''-gon &amp;ndash; and infinitely many Koch curves are contained within. The fractals occupy zero area yet have an infinite perimeter.

The formula of the [[scale factor]] ''r'' for any ''n''-flake is:&lt;ref name=ecademy&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle|first=Larry|title=Sierpinski n-gons|url=http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/pentagon/sierngon.htm|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{2\left(1 + \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/4 \rfloor} {\cos \frac{2 \pi k}{n}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
where cosine is evaluated in radians and ''n'' is the number of sides of the ''n''-gon. The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of a ''n''-flake is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{\log m}{\log r}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the number of polygons in each individual flake and ''r'' is the scale factor.

=== Sierpinski triangle ===
The [[Sierpinski triangle]] is an ''n''-flake formed by successive flakes of three triangles. Each flake is formed by placing triangles scaled by 1/2 in each corner of the triangle they replace. Its [[Hausdorff dimension]] is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(3)} {\log(2)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.585. The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(3)} {\log(2)}}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained because each iteration has 3 triangles that are scaled by&amp;nbsp;1/2.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vicsek fractal===
If a sierpinski 4-gon were constructed from the given definition, the scale factor would be 1/2 and the fractal would simply be a square. A more interesting alternative, the [[Vicsek fractal]], rarely called a quadraflake, is formed by successive flakes of five squares scaled by 1/3. Each flake is formed either by placing a scaled square in each corner and one in the center or one on each side of the square and one in the center. Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(5)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.4650. The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(5)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained because each iteration has 5 squares that are scaled by 1/3. The boundary of the Vicsek Fractal is a [[Koch_snowflake#Variants_of_the_Koch_curve|Type 1 quadratic Koch curve]].
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Pentaflake ===
[[File:ZoomingpentaKoch.gif|200px|thumb|right|Zooming into the boundary of the pentaflake]]
A pentaflake, or sierpinski pentagon, is formed by successive flakes of six regular pentagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Pentaflake|title=Pentaflake}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each flake is formed by placing a pentagon in each corner and one in the center. Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(6)} {\log(1+\varphi)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.8617, where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[golden ratio]]). The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(6)} {\log(1+\varphi)}}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained because each iteration has 6 pentagons that are scaled by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {1} {1+\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;. The boundary of a pentaflake is the Koch curve of 72 degrees.

There is also a variation of the pentaflake that has no central pentagon. Its Hausdorff dimension equals &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(5)} {\log(1+\varphi)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.6723. This variation still contains infinitely many Koch curves, but they are somewhat more visible.

=== Hexaflake ===
A [[hexaflake]], is formed by successive flakes of seven regular hexagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(7)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.7712. The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(7)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained because each iteration has 7 hexagons that are scaled by 1/3. The boundary of a hexaflake is the standard Koch curve of 60 degrees and infinitely many [[Koch snowflake]]s are contained within. Also, the projection of the [[cantor dust|cantor cube]] onto the plane [[orthogonal projection|orthogonal]] to its main diagonal is a hexaflake.

Like the pentaflake, there is also a variation of the hexaflake, called the Sierpinski hexagon, that has no central hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Polyflake ===
''n''-flakes of higher polygons also exist, though they are less common and don't usually have a central polygon. Some examples are shown below; the 7-flake through 12-flake. While it may not be obvious, these higher polyflakes still contain infinitely many Koch curves, but the angle of the Koch curves decreases as ''n'' increases. Their Hausdorff dimensions are slightly more difficult to calculate than lower ''n''-flakes because their scale factor is less obvious. However, the Hausdorff dimension is always less than two but no less than one. An interesting ''n''-flake is the ∞-flake, because as the value of ''n'' increases, an ''n''-flake's Hausdorff dimension approaches 1,&lt;ref name=DennisSchlicker/&gt;{{rp|7}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== In three dimensions ==
''n''-flakes can generalized to higher dimensions, in particular to a [[topological dimension]] of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Kunnen|first = Aimee|last2 = Schlicker|first2 = Steven|title = Regular Sierpinski Polyhedra|url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/schlicks/phdra.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of polygons, regular [[polyhedra]] are iteratively replaced. However, while there are an infinite number of regular polygons, there are only five regular, convex polyhedra. Because of this, three-dimensional n-flakes are also called '''platonic solid fractals'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paulbourke.net/fractals/platonic/|title=Platonic solid fractals and their complements|author=Paul Bourke|date=December 2005|work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three dimensions, the fractals' volume is zero.

=== Sierpinski tetrahedron ===
A [[Sierpinski triangle#Analogues in higher dimensions|Sierpinski tetrahedron]] is formed by successive flakes of four regular tetrahedrons. Each flake is formed by placing a [[tetrahedron]] scaled by 1/2 in each corner. Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(4)} {\log(2)}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is exactly equal to&amp;nbsp;2. On every face there is a Sierpinski triangle and infinitely many are contained within.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Tetraedre Sierpinski.png|The third iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Hexahedron flake ===
A hexahedron, or cube, flake defined in the same way as the Sierpinski tetrahedron is simply a cube&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Kunnen|first = Aimee|last2 = Schlicker|first2 = Steven|title = Regular Sierpinski Polyhedra|page = 3|url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/schlicks/phdra.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not interesting as a fractal. However, there are two pleasing alternatives. One is the [[Menger Sponge]], where every cube is replaced by a three dimensional ring of cubes. Its Hausdorff dimension is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(20)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 2.7268.

Another hexahedron flake can be produced in a manner similar to the [[Vicsek fractal]] extended to three dimensions. Every cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes and the center cross is retained, which is the opposite of the [[Menger sponge]] where the cross is removed. However, it is not the Menger Sponge complement. Its Hausdorff dimension is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(7)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.7712, because a cross of 7 cubes, each scaled by 1/3, replaces each cube.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Octahedron flake ===
An octahedron flake, or sierpinski octahedron, is formed by successive flakes of six regular octahedrons. Each flake is formed by placing an [[octahedron]] scaled by 1/2 in each corner. Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(6)} {\log(2)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 2.5849. On every face there is a Sierpinski triangle and infinitely many are contained within.

=== Dodecahedron flake ===
A dodecahedron flake, or sierpinski dodecahedron, is formed by successive flakes of twenty regular dodecahedrons. Each flake is formed by placing a [[dodecahedron]] scaled by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {1} {2+\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt; in each corner. Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(20)} {\log(2+\varphi)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 2.3296.

=== Icosahedron flake ===
An icosahedron flake, or sierpinski icosahedron, is formed by successive flakes of twelve regular icosahedrons. Each flake is formed by placing an [[icosahedron]] scaled by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {1} {1+\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt; in each corner. Its Hausdorff dimension is equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(12)} {\log(1+\varphi)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 2.5819.

In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Peano axioms''', also known as the '''Dedekind–Peano axioms''' or the '''Peano postulates''', are [[axiom]]s for the [[natural number]]s presented by the 19th century [[Italian people|Italian]] [[mathematician]] [[Giuseppe Peano]]. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether [[number theory]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].

The need to formalize [[arithmetic]] was not well appreciated until the work of [[Hermann Grassmann]], who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the [[successor function|successor operation]] and [[mathematical induction|induction]].{{sfn|Grassmann|1861}} In 1881, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] provided an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of natural-number arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peirce|1881}}, {{harvnb|Shields|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In&amp;nbsp;1888, [[Richard Dedekind]] proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in&amp;nbsp;1889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, [[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita|''The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method'']] ({{lang-la|Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita}}).

The Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the "underlying logic".{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=94}} The next three axioms are [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a [[second-order logic|second order]] statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called '''Peano arithmetic''' is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the [[Second-order arithmetic#Induction and comprehension schema|second-order induction]] axiom with a first-order [[axiom schema]].

== Formulation ==

When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of [[mathematical logic]] was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and [[logical implication|implication]] (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879.{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=2}} Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]].{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=83}}

The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of ''[[natural numbers]]'', usually represented as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] '''N''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt; The [[non-logical symbol]]s for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol ''S''.

The first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:
{{ordered list|start=1
| 1= 0 is a natural number.
}}
The next four axioms describe the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of "the Peano axioms" in modern treatments.{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=83}}
{{ordered list|start=2
| 2= For every natural number ''x'', {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''x''}}. That is, equality is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].
| 3= For all natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}. That is, equality is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].
| 4= For all natural numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'', if ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'', then {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''z''}}. That is, equality is [[transitive relation|transitive]].
| 5= For all ''a'' and ''b'', if ''b'' is a natural number and {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}, then ''a'' is also a natural number. That is, the natural numbers are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under equality.
}}
The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued "[[successor function|successor]]" [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''S''.
{{ordered list|start=6
| 6=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') is a natural number.
| 7=For all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''S''(''m'') = ''S''(''n'')}}. That is, ''S'' is an [[injective function|injection]].
| 8=For every natural number ''n'', {{nowrap|1=''S''(''n'') = 0}} is false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is 0.
}}
Peano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the "first" natural number.{{sfn|Peano|1889|page=1}} This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because 0 is the [[identity element|additive identity]] in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a [[unary numeral system|unary representation]] of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as ''S''(0), 2 as ''S''(''S''(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0. Put differently, they do not guarantee that every natural number other than zero must succeed some other natural number.

The intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying ''successor'' sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the ''[[axiom of induction]]''.

{{ordered list|start=9
| 9=If ''K'' is a set such that:
* 0 is in ''K'', and
* for every natural number ''n'', ''n'' being in ''K'' implies that ''S''(''n'') is in ''K'',
then ''K'' contains every natural number.
}}

The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:
{{ordered list|start=9
| 9=If ''φ'' is a unary [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] such that:
* ''φ''(0) is true, and
* for every natural number ''n'', ''φ''(''n'') being true implies that ''φ''(''S''(''n'')) is true,
then ''φ''(''n'') is true for every natural number ''n''.
}}

In Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a [[second-order logic|second-order axiom]]. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker [[first-order logic|first-order]] induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section {{section link||Models}} below.

== Arithmetic ==

The Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] and the usual [[total order|total (linear) ordering]] on [[natural numbers#Notation|'''N''']]. The respective functions and relations are constructed in [[set theory]] or [[second-order logic]], and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.

=== Addition ===

[[Addition in N|Addition]] is a function that [[map (mathematics)|maps]] two natural numbers (two elements of '''N''') to another one. It is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 0      &amp;= a ,        &amp; \textrm{(1)}\\
a + S (b)  &amp;= S (a + b). &amp; \textrm{(2)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 1 &amp;= a + S(0)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 0)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(a),        &amp; \mbox{using (1)} \\
\\
a + 2 &amp;= a + S(1)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 1)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(S(a))      &amp; \mbox{using } a + 1 = S(a) \\
\\
a + 3 &amp;= a + S(2)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 2)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(S(S(a)))    &amp; \mbox{using } a + 2 = S(S(a)) \\
\text{etc.} &amp; \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] {{nowrap|('''N''', +)}} is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] with identity element 0. {{nowrap|('''N''', +)}} is also a [[cancellation property|cancellative]] [[magma (algebra)|magma]], and thus [[embedding|embeddable]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The smallest group embedding '''N''' is the [[integer]]s.

=== Multiplication ===

Similarly, [[multiplication]] is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

a \cdot 0 &amp;= 0, \\
a \cdot S (b) &amp;= a + (a \cdot b).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It is easy to see that ''S''(0) (or "1", in the familiar language of [[decimal representation]]) is the multiplicative [[identity element|right identity]]:

: ''a'' · ''S''(0) = ''a'' + (''a'' · 0) = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''

To show that ''S''(0) is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:

* ''S''(0) is the left identity of 0: ''S''(0) · 0 = 0.
* If ''S''(0) is the left identity of ''a'' (that is ''S''(0) · ''a'' = ''a''), then ''S''(0) is also the left identity of ''S''(''a''): ''S''(0) · ''S''(''a'') = ''S''(0) + ''S''(0) · ''a'' = ''S''(0) + ''a'' = ''a'' + ''S''(0) = ''S''(''a'' + 0) = ''S''(''a'').

Therefore by the induction axiom ''S''(0) is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers.  Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication [[distributive law|distributes over]] addition:

: ''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'').

Thus, {{nowrap|('''N''', +, 0, ·, ''S''(0))}} is a commutative [[semiring]].

=== Inequalities ===

The usual [[total order]] relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:

: For all {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''N'''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if and only if there exists some {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ '''N'''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''c'' = ''b''}}.

This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for &lt;math&gt; a, b, c \in \mathbf{N} &lt;/math&gt;, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}, then:

* ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'', and
* ''a'' · ''c'' ≤ ''b'' · ''c''.

Thus, the structure {{nowrap|('''N''', +, ·, 1, 0, ≤)}} is an [[ordered ring|ordered semiring]]; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.

The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation "≤":

: For any [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''φ'', if
:* ''φ''(0) is true, and
:* for every {{nowrap|''n'', ''k'' ∈ '''N'''}}, if {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}} implies that ''φ''(''k'') is true, then ''φ''(''S''(''n'')) is true,
: then for every {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, ''φ''(''n'') is true.

This form of the induction axiom, called ''strong induction'', is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are [[well-order]]ed—every [[empty set|nonempty]] [[subset]] of '''N''' has a [[least element]]—one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ '''N'''}} be given and assume ''X'' has no least element.

* Because 0 is the least element of '''N''', it must be that {{nowrap|0 ∉ ''X''}}.
* For any {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, suppose for every {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}, {{nowrap|''k'' ∉ ''X''}}. Then {{nowrap|''S''(''n'') ∉ ''X''}}, for otherwise it would be the least element of ''X''.

Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, {{nowrap|''n'' ∉ ''X''}}. Thus, {{nowrap|1=''X'' ∩ '''N''' = ∅}}, which [[contradiction|contradicts]] ''X'' being a nonempty subset of '''N'''. Thus ''X'' has a least element.

== First-order theory of arithmetic ==

All of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in [[first-order logic]].{{sfn|Partee|Ter Meulen|Wall|2012|page=215}} The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in [[second-order logic|second-order]], since it [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifies]] over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order ''[[axiom schema]]'' of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.{{sfnp|Harsanyi|1983}}

First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the [[successor function|successor operation]], but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the [[signature (logic)|signature]] of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.

The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], is sufficient for this purpose:{{sfn|Mendelson|1997|page=155}}

* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (0 \neq  S ( x ))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (S( x ) =  S( y ) \Rightarrow x = y)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (x  + 0 = x )&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (x + S( y ) =  S( x + y ))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (x \cdot 0 = 0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (x \cdot  S ( y ) = x \cdot y + x )&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] set of [[axioms]]. For each formula {{nowrap|''φ''(''x'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in the language of Peano arithmetic, the '''first-order induction axiom''' for ''φ'' is the sentence

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \bar{y} (\varphi(0,\bar{y}) \land \forall x ( \varphi(x,\bar{y})\Rightarrow\varphi(S(x),\bar{y})) \Rightarrow \forall x \varphi(x,\bar{y}))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{y}&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula ''φ''.

=== Equivalent axiomatizations ===

There are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of [[ordered ring|ordered semirings]], including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pages=16–18}}

&lt;!-- These axioms are taken directly from Kaye 1991. Please don't "tweak" them, add additional axioms, or remove axioms without discussion on the talk page. --&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[associative property|associative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + y = y + x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[commutative property|commutative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is associative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot y = y \cdot x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is commutative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication [[distributive property|distributes]] over addition.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + 0 = x \land x \cdot 0 = 0 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., zero is an [[identity element|identity]] for addition, and an [[absorbing element]] for multiplication (actually superfluous&lt;ref group=note&gt;"&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot 0 = 0 ) &lt;/math&gt;" can be proven from the other axioms (in first-order logic) as follows. Firstly, &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0 = x \cdot (0+0) = x \cdot 0 = x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by distributivity and additive identity. Secondly, &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 = 0 \lor x \cdot 0 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; by Axiom 15. If &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0 &gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by addition of the same element and commutativity, and hence &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by substitution, contradicting irreflexivity. Therefore it must be that &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;).
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot 1 = x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., one is an [[identity element|identity]] for multiplication.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \land y &lt; z \Rightarrow x &lt; z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( \neg (x &lt; x) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \lor x = y \lor y &lt; x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the ordering satisfies [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \Rightarrow x + z &lt; y + z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ordering is preserved under addition of the same element.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( 0 &lt; z \land x &lt; y \Rightarrow x \cdot z &lt; y \cdot z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ordering is preserved under multiplication by the same positive element.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \Rightarrow \exists z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + z = y ) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given any two distinct elements, the larger is the smaller plus another element.
# &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; 1 \land \forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &gt; 0 \Rightarrow x \ge 1 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. zero and one are distinct and there is no element between them.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \ge 0 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. zero is the minimum element.

The theory defined by these axioms is known as '''PA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'''; the theory '''PA''' is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema. An important property of PA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is that any structure &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;) isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Elements in that segment are called '''standard''' elements, while other elements are called '''nonstandard''' elements.

== Models ==

A [[model theory|model]] of the Peano axioms is a triple {{nowrap|('''N''', 0, ''S'')}}, where '''N''' is a (necessarily infinite) set, {{nowrap|0 ∈ '''N'''}} and {{nowrap|''S'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} satisfies the axioms above. [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] proved in his 1888 book, ''The Nature and Meaning of Numbers'' ({{lang-de|Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?}}, i.e., “What are the numbers and what are they good for?”) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. In particular, given two models {{nowrap|('''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|('''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of the Peano axioms, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; → '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

f(0_A) &amp;= 0_B \\
f(S_A (n)) &amp;= S_B (f (n))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is a [[bijective function|bijection]]. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.

=== Set-theoretic models ===
{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}
The Peano axioms can be derived from [[set theory|set theoretic]] constructions of the [[natural number]]s and axioms of set theory such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suppes|1960}}, {{harvnb|Hatcher|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard construction of the naturals, due to [[John von Neumann]], starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator ''s'' on sets defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;s(a) = a \cup \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;

The set of natural numbers '''N''' is defined as the intersection of all sets [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under ''s'' that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

0 &amp;= \emptyset \\
1 &amp;= s(0) = s(\emptyset) = \emptyset \cup \{ \emptyset \} = \{ \emptyset \} = \{ 0 \} \\
2 &amp;= s(1) = s(\{ 0 \}) = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0 , \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0, 1 \} \\
3 &amp;= s(2) = s(\{ 0, 1 \}) = \{ 0, 1 \} \cup \{ \{ 0, 1 \} \} = \{ 0, 1, \{ 0, 1 \} \} = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on. The set '''N''' together with 0 and the [[successor function]] {{nowrap|''s'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} satisfies the Peano axioms.

Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory.{{sfn|Tarski|Givant|1987|loc=Section 7.6}} One such system is ZFC with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of [[general set theory]] ([[Axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], existence of the [[empty set]], and the [[general set theory|axiom of adjunction]]), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.

=== Interpretation in category theory ===

The Peano axioms can also be understood using [[category theory]]. Let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with [[terminal object]] 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define the category of [[pointed unary system]]s, US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') as follows:

* The objects of US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') are triples {{nowrap|(''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where ''X'' is an object of ''C'', and {{nowrap|0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} and {{nowrap|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''X''}} are ''C''-morphisms.
* A morphism ''φ'' : (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''Y'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a ''C''-morphism {{nowrap|''φ'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} with {{nowrap|1=''φ'' 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''φ'' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ''φ''}}.

Then ''C'' is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') has an initial object; this initial object is known as a [[natural number object]] in ''C''. If {{nowrap|('''N''', 0, ''S'')}} is this initial object, and {{nowrap|(''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is any other object, then the unique map {{nowrap|''u'' : ('''N''', 0, ''S'') → (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is such that

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

u 0 &amp;= 0_X, \\
u (S x) &amp;= S_X (u x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This is precisely the recursive definition of 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Nonstandard models ==

Although the usual [[natural number]]s satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called "[[non-standard model]]s"); the [[compactness theorem]] implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic.{{sfn|Hermes|1973|loc=VI.4.3|ps=, presenting a theorem of [[Thoralf Skolem]]}} The upward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism.{{sfn|Hermes|1973|loc=VI.3.1}} This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.

When interpreted as a proof within a first-order [[set theory]], such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.

It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as [[Skolem]] in 1933 provided an explicit  construction of such a nonstandard model.  On the other hand, [[Tennenbaum's theorem]], proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[computable function|computable]].{{sfn|Kaye|1991|loc=Section 11.3}} This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible [[order type]] of a countable nonstandard model. Letting ''ω'' be the order type of the natural numbers, ''ζ'' be the order type of the integers, and ''η'' be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is {{nowrap|''ω'' + ''ζ''·''η''}}, which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.

=== Overspill ===

A '''cut''' in a nonstandard model ''M'' is a nonempty subset ''I'' of ''M'' so that ''I'' is downward closed ( ''x''&lt;''y'' and ''y''&amp;isin;''I'' implies ''x''&amp;isin;''I'') and ''I'' is closed under successor. A '''proper cut''' is a cut that is a proper subset of ''M''. Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers.   However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable.  The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact. 

:'''Overspill Lemma'''{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pages=70ff.}} Let ''M'' be a nonstandard model of PA and let ''I'' be a proper cut of ''M''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\bar a&lt;/math&gt; is a tuple of elements of ''M'' and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x, \bar a)&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in the language of arithmetic so that
::&lt;math&gt;M \vDash \phi(b, \bar a)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''b''&amp;isin;''I''.
:Then there is a ''c'' in ''M'' that is greater than every element of ''I'' such that
::&lt;math&gt;M \vDash \phi(c, \bar a).&lt;/math&gt;

== Consistency ==
{{Further|Hilbert's second problem|Consistency}}

When the Peano axioms were first proposed, [[Bertrand Russell]] and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a "natural number".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fritz|1952|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Yl_XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137, p. 137]}}&lt;br&gt;An illustration of 'interpretation' is Russell's own definition of 'cardinal number'. The uninterpreted system in this case is Peano's axioms for the number system, whose three primitive ideas and five axioms, Peano believed, were sufficient to enable one to derive all the properties of the system of natural numbers. Actually, Russell maintains, Peano's axioms define any progression of the form &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of which the series of the natural numbers is one instance.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Poincaré]] was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were ''consistent''; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|2013|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=w2Tya9gOKqEC&amp;pg=PA133 p. 133]}}&lt;br&gt;So Poincaré turned to see whether logicism could generate arithmetic, more precisely, the arithmetic of ordinals. Couturat, said Poincaré, had accepted the Peano axioms as a definition of a number. But this will not do. The axioms cannot be shown to be free of contradiction by finding examples of them, and any attempt to show that they were contradiction-free by examining the totality of their implications would require the very principle of mathematical induction Couturat believed they implied. For (in a further passage dropped from S&amp;M) either one assumed the principle in order to prove it, which would only prove that if it is true it is not self-contradictory, which says nothing; or one used the principle in another form than the one stated, in which case one must show that the number of steps in one's reasoning was an integer according to the new definition, but this could not be done (1905c, 834).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed the problem of proving their consistency using only [[Finitism|finitistic]] methods as the [[Hilbert's second problem|second]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three problems]].{{sfn|Hilbert|1902}} In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved his [[second incompleteness theorem]], which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.{{sfn|Gödel|1931}}

Although it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using [[type theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using [[transfinite induction]] up to an ordinal called [[epsilon zero|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentzen explained: "The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a [[Turing machine]] describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.

The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as [[Gentzen's consistency proof|Gentzen's proof]]. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate [[ultrafinitism]], reject Peano's axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are [[self-verifying theories]] that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt; theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of "0=1").{{sfn|Willard|2001}}

'''Pickover stalks''' are certain kinds of details to be found empirically in the [[Mandelbrot set]], in the study of [[fractal geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bentley and David W. Corne (2001). ''Creative Evolutionary Systems''. Morgan Kaufmann. p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; They are so named after the researcher [[Clifford Pickover]], whose "epsilon cross" method was instrumental in their discovery. An "epsilon cross" is a cross-shaped [[orbit trap]].

According to Vepstas (1997) "Pickover hit on the novel concept of looking to see how closely the orbits of [[interior points]] come to the x and y axes. In these pictures, the closer that the point approaches, the higher up the color scale, with red denoting the closest approach. The logarithm of the distance is taken to accentuate the details".&lt;ref name= "LV97"&gt; Linas Vepstas (1997). [http://linas.org/art-gallery/mandel/mandel.html "Interior Sketchbook Diary"]. Retrieved 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Biomorphs ==
[[File:Biomorph.png|thumbnail|An example of the sort of biomorphic forms yielded by Pickover's algorithm.]]
Biomorphs are biological-looking Pickover Stalks. &lt;ref&gt;Paul Nylander. [http://nylander.wordpress.com/2005/02/ Mandelbrot Set Biomorph]. feb 2005. Retrieved 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1980s, Pickover developed biological feedback organisms similar to [[Julia set]]s and the fractal [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Rietman (1994). ''Genesis Redux: Experiments Creating Artificial Life''. Windcrest/McGraw-Hill. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pickover (1999) in summary, he "described an algorithm which could be used for the creation of diverse and complicated forms resembling invertebrate organisms. The shapes are complicated and difficult to predict before actually experimenting with the mappings. He hoped these techniques would encourage others to explore further and discover new forms, by accident, that are on the edge of science and art".&lt;ref name="CAP99"&gt; Clifford A. Pickover (1991) [http://www.ylem.org/Journal/1999NovDec-clr.pdf "Accident, Evolution, and Art"]. YLEN NEWSLETTER number. 12 volume 19 Nov/Dec. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickover developed an algorithm (which uses neither random perturbations nor natural laws) to create very complicated forms resembling invertebrate organisms. The iteration, or recursion, of mathematical transformations is used to generate biological morphologies. He called them "biomorphs." At the same time he coined "biomorph" for these patterns, the famous evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the word to refer to his own set of biological shapes that were arrived at by a very different procedure. More rigorously, Pickover's "biomorphs" encompass the class of organismic morphologies created by small changes to traditional convergence tests in the field of "[[Julia set]]" theory.&lt;ref name="CAP99"/&gt;

Pickover's biomorphs show a self-similarity at different scales, a common feature of [[dynamical systems]] with feedback. Real systems, such as shorelines and mountain ranges, also show self-similarity over some scales. A 2-dimensional parametric 0L system can “look” like Pickover's biomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Ortega, Marina de la Cruz, and Manuel Alfonseca (2002). "Parametric 2-dimensional L systems and recursive fractal images: Mandelbrot set, Julia sets and biomorphs". In: ''Computers &amp; Graphics'' Volume 26, Issue 1, February 2002, Pages 143-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
The below example, written in pseudocode, renders a [[Mandelbrot set]] colored using a Pickover Stalk with a transformation vector and a color dividend.

The transformation vector is used to offset the (x, y) position when sampling the point's distance to the horizontal and vertical axis.

The color dividend is a float used to determine how thick the stalk is when it is rendered. [[File:Pickover Stalk.png|thumb|323.993x323.993px|Pickover Stalk rendered with an implementation of the given pseudocode.]]
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
For each pixel (x, y) on the target, do:
{
	zx = scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.5, 1))
    zy = scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1, 1))
	float2 c = (zx, zy) //Offset in the Mandelbrot formulae
	
	float x = zx; //Coordinates to be iterated
	float y = zy;
	
	float trapDistance = 1000000; //Keeps track of distance, set to a high value at first.

    int iteration = 0;
	while (x*x + y*y &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; iteration &lt; maxIterations)
	{	
		float2 z = float2(x, y);

		z = cmul(z, z); // z^2, cmul is a multiplication function for complex numbers
	    z += c;					

		x = z.x;
		y = z.y;

		float distanceToX = abs(z.x + transformationVector.x); //Checks the distance to the vertical axis
		float distanceToY = abs(z.y + transformationVector.y); //Checks the distance to the horizontal axis

		smallestDistance = min(distanceToX, distanceToY); // Use only smaller axis distance
		trapDistance = min(trapDistance, smallestDistance);

		iteration++;
	}
	return trapDistance * color / dividend; 
	//Dividend is an external float, the higher it is the thicker the stalk is

{{Punctuation marks|±|variant1=∓|caption1=Minus-plus}}
The '''plus-minus sign''' (±) is a mathematical symbol with multiple meanings.
*In [[mathematics]], it generally indicates a choice of exactly two possible values, one of which is the negation of the other.
*In [[experimental science]]s, the sign commonly indicates the [[confidence interval]] or [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error]] in a measurement, often the [[standard deviation]] or [[standard error]].&lt;ref name="stderror"/&gt; The sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have.
*In [[engineering]] the sign indicates the [[Tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]], which is the range of values that are considered to be acceptable, safe, or which comply with some standard, or with a contract.&lt;ref&gt;[[Engineering tolerance]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[botany]] it is used in morphological descriptions to notate "more or less".
*In [[chemistry]] the sign is used to indicate a [[racemic mixture]].
*In [[chess]], the sign indicates a clear advantage for the white player; the complementary sign ∓ indicates the same advantage for the black player.&lt;ref name="chess"&gt;{{citation|title=Chess For Dummies|first=James|last=Eade|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=9780471774334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eZxKNQu-JoC&amp;pg=PA272|page=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The sign is normally pronounced "plus or minus" or "plus-minus".{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==History==
A version of the sign, including also the French word ''ou'' ("or") was used in its mathematical meaning by [[Albert Girard]] in 1626, and the sign in its modern form was used as early as [[William Oughtred]]'s ''Clavis Mathematicae'' (1631).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Mathematical Notations, Volumes 1-2|first=Florian|last=Cajori|authorlink=Florian Cajori|publisher=Dover|year=1928|isbn=9780486677668|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7juWmvQSTvwC&amp;pg=PA245|page=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===In mathematics===
&lt;!-- [[± shorthand]] redirects here --&gt;
In [[mathematical formula]]s, the ± symbol may be used to indicate a symbol that may be replaced by either the [[Plus and minus signs|+ or −]] symbols, allowing the formula to represent two values or two equations.

For example, given the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9, one may give the solution as ''x'' = ±3. This indicates that the equation has two solutions, each of which may be obtained by replacing this equation by one of the two equations ''x'' = +3 or ''x'' = −3. Only one of these two replaced equations is true for any valid solution. A common use of this notation is found in the [[quadratic formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;
describing the two solutions to the [[quadratic equation]] ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Similarly, the [[trigonometric identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(A \pm B) = \sin(A) \cos(B) \pm \cos(A) \sin(B).&lt;/math&gt;
can be interpreted as a shorthand for two equations: one with "+" on both sides of the equation, and one with "−" on both sides. The two copies of the ± sign in this identity must both be replaced in the same way: it is not valid to replace one of them with "+" and the other of them with "−". In contrast to the quadratic formula example, both of the equations described by this identity are simultaneously valid.

A third related usage is found in this presentation of the formula for the [[Taylor series]] of the sine function:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin\left( x \right) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \pm \frac{1}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} + \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;
Here, the plus-or-minus sign indicates that the signs of the terms alternate, where (starting the count at&amp;nbsp;0) the terms with an even index&amp;nbsp;''n'' are added while those with an odd index are subtracted.  A more rigorous presentation of the same formula would multiply each term by a factor of (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which gives +1 when ''n'' is even and −1 when ''n'' is odd.

===In statistics===
The use of {{angbr|±}} for an approximation is most commonly encountered in presenting the numerical value of a quantity together with its [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]] or its statistical [[margin of error]].&lt;ref name="stderror"&gt;{{citation|title=Standard Deviation, Standard Error: Which 'Standard' Should We Use?|first=George W.|last=Brown|journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children|year=1982|volume=136|issue=10|pages=937–941|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1982.03970460067015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, "{{val|5.7|0.2}}" may be anywhere in the range from 5.5 to 5.9 inclusive. In scientific usage it sometimes refers to a probability of being within the stated interval, usually corresponding to either 1 or 2 [[standard deviation]]s (a probability of 68.3% or 95.4% in a [[normal distribution]]).

A [[percentage]] may also be used to indicate the error margin. For example, {{Nowrap|230 ± 10% V}} refers to a voltage within 10% of either side of 230&amp;nbsp;V (from 207&amp;nbsp;V to 253&amp;nbsp;V inclusive). Separate values for the upper and lower bounds may also be used. For example, to indicate that a value is most likely 5.7 but may be as high as 5.9 or as low as 5.6, one may write {{val|5.7|+0.2|−0.1}}.

===In chess===
The symbols ± and ∓ are used in [[Punctuation (chess)#Position evaluation symbols|chess notation]] to denote an advantage for white and black respectively. However, the more common chess notation would be only + and –. &lt;ref name="chess"/&gt;  If a difference is made, the symbols + and − denote a larger advantage than ± and ∓.

==Minus-plus sign==
The '''minus-plus sign''' (∓) is generally used in conjunction with the "±" sign, in such expressions as "x ± y ∓ z", which can be interpreted as meaning "''x'' + ''y'' − ''z''" and/or "''x'' − ''y'' + ''z''", but ''not'' "''x'' + ''y'' + ''z''" or "''x'' − ''y'' − ''z''". The upper "−" in "∓" is considered to be associated to the "+" of "±" (and similarly for the two lower symbols) even though there is no visual indication of the dependency.  (However, the "±" sign is generally preferred over the "∓" sign, so if they both appear in an equation it is safe to assume that they are linked.  On the other hand, if there are two instances of the "±" sign in an expression, it is impossible to tell from notation alone whether the intended interpretation is as two or four distinct expressions.)  The original expression can be rewritten as "''x'' ± (''y'' − ''z'')" to avoid confusion, but cases such as the trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(A \pm B) = \cos(A) \cos(B) \mp \sin(A) \sin(B) &lt;/math&gt;

are most neatly written using the "∓" sign. The trigonometric equation above thus represents the two equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\cos(A + B) &amp;= \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A) \sin(B) \\
\cos(A - B) &amp;= \cos(A)\cos(B) + \sin(A) \sin(B) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
but ''not''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\cos(A + B) &amp;= \cos(A)\cos(B) + \sin(A) \sin(B) \\
\cos(A - B) &amp;= \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A) \sin(B) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

because the signs are exclusively alternating.

Another example is
:&lt;math&gt;x^3 \pm 1 = (x \pm 1)\left(x^2 \mp x + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which represents two equations.

==Encodings==
* In Unicode: {{unichar|00B1|PLUS-MINUS SIGN|html=}}
*In [[ISO 8859-1]], [[ISO 8859-7|-7]], [[ISO 8859-8|-8]], [[ISO 8859-9|-9]], [[ISO 8859-13|-13]], [[ISO 8859-15|-15]], and [[ISO 8859-16|-16]], the plus-minus symbol is given by the code 0xB1&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; Since the first 256 code points of Unicode are identical to the contents of ISO-8859-1 this symbol is also at [[Unicode]] code point U+00B1.
*The symbol also has a [[Character entity reference|HTML entity]] representation of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;plusmn;&lt;/code&gt;.
*The rarer minus-plus sign (∓) is not generally found in legacy encodings and does not have a named HTML entity but is available in Unicode with code point U+2213 and so can be used in HTML using &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2213;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8723;&lt;/code&gt;.
*In [[TeX]] 'plus-or-minus' and 'minus-or-plus' symbols are denoted &lt;code&gt;\pm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\mp&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.
*These characters may also be produced as an underlined or overlined + symbol (&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;+&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp; or {{Overline|+}}&amp;nbsp;), but beware of the formatting being stripped at a later date, changing the meaning.
===Typing===
*On [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems, it may be entered by means of [[Alt code]]s, by holding the ALT key while typing the numbers 0177 or 241 on the [[numeric keypad]].
*On Unix-like systems, it can be entered by typing the sequence [[Compose key|compose]] + -.
*On Macintosh systems, it may be entered by pressing option shift = (on the non-numeric keypad).
*On the Chromebook, it may be entered by pressing shift, ctrl and u, and then writing the unicode for plus-minus (00B1).

==Similar characters==
The plus-minus sign resembles the [[Chinese character]]s {{lang|zh|[[wikt:士|士]]}} and {{lang|zh|[[wikt:土|土]]}}, whereas the minus-plus sign resembles {{lang|zh|[[wikt:干|干]]}}.

In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[category theory]], a '''polygraph''' is a generalisation of a [[directed graph]].  It is also known as a '''computad'''.  They were introduced as "polygraphs" by [[Albert Burroni]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Burroni. ''Higher-dimensional word problems with applications to equational logic''. TCS, 115(1):43--62, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "computads" by [[Ross Street]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Street. Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors. Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, 8(2):149--181, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way that a [[Multigraph#Directed_multigraph_(edges_without_own_identity)|directed multigraph]] can [[Free object|freely]] generate a [[Category (mathematics)|category]], an ''n''-computad is the "most general" structure which can generate a free [[n-category]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=computad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the univariate function defined by a polynomial of degree four|the bivariate quartic|Quartic plane curve|equations of degree two|Quadratic equation}}

[[File:Polynomialdeg4.svg|thumb|right|233px|Graph of a polynomial of degree 4, with 3 [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] and four [[real number|real]] [[root of a polynomial|roots]] (crossings of the ''x'' axis) (and thus no [[complex number|complex]] roots). If one or the other of the local [[minimum|minima]] were above the ''x'' axis, or if the local [[maximum]] were below it, or if there were no local maximum and one minimum below the ''x'' axis, there would only be two real roots (and two complex roots). If all three local extrema were above the ''x'' axis, or if there were no local maximum and one minimum above the ''x'' axis, there would be no real root (and four complex roots).]]
In [[algebra]], a '''quartic function'''  is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is nonzero,
which is defined by a [[polynomial]] of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] four, called a '''quartic polynomial'''.

Sometimes the term '''biquadratic''' is used instead of ''quartic'', but, usually, '''biquadratic function''' refers to a [[quadratic function]] of a square (or, equivalently, to the function defined by a quartic polynomial without terms of odd degree), having the form
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^4+cx^2+e.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''quartic equation''', or equation of the fourth degree, is an equation that equates a quartic polynomial to zero, of the form
:&lt;math&gt;ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e=0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ 0}}.

The [[derivative]] of a quartic function is a [[cubic function]].

Since a quartic function is defined by a polynomial of even degree, it has the same infinite limit when the argument goes to positive or negative [[infinity]]. If ''a'' is positive, then the function increases to positive infinity at both ends; and thus the function has a [[Maxima and minima|global minimum]]. Likewise, if ''a'' is negative, it decreases to negative infinity and has a global maximum. In both cases it may or may not have another local maximum and another local minimum.

The degree four (''quartic'' case) is the highest degree such that every polynomial equation can be solved by [[Nth root|radicals]].

==History==
[[Lodovico Ferrari]] is credited with the discovery of the solution to the quartic in 1540, but since this solution, like all algebraic solutions of the quartic, requires the solution of a [[cubic equation|cubic]] to be found, it could not be published immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Ferrari|title=Lodovico Ferrari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution of the quartic was published together with that of the cubic by Ferrari's mentor [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in the book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cardano | first = Gerolamo | author-link = Gerolamo Cardano | year = 1993 | orig-year = 1545 | title = Ars magna or The Rules of Algebra | publisher = Dover | isbn = 0-486-67811-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet historian I. Y. Depman claimed that even earlier, in 1486, Spanish mathematician Valmes was [[burned at the stake]] for claiming to have solved the quartic equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Depman|title=Rasskazy o matematike|publisher=Gosdetizdat|year=1954|place=Leningrad|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inquisitor General]] [[Tomás de Torquemada]] allegedly told Valmes that it was the will of God that such a solution be inaccessible to human understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P. Beckmann |title=A history of π |publisher=Macmillan |year=1971 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TB6jzz3ZDTEC&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However [[Petr Beckmann|Beckmann]], who popularized this story of Depman in the West, said that it was unreliable and hinted that it may have been invented as Soviet antireligious propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P. Beckmann |title=A history of π |publisher=Macmillan |year=1971 |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TB6jzz3ZDTEC&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckmann's version of this story has been widely copied in several books and internet sites, usually without his reservations and sometimes with fanciful embellishments. Several attempts to find corroborating evidence for this story, or even for the existence of Valmes, have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. Zoll | title=Letter to the Editor |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=96 |issue=8 |year=1989 |pages=709–710 |jstor=2324719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof that four is the highest degree of a general polynomial for which such solutions can be found was first given in the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] in 1824, proving that all attempts at solving the higher order polynomials would be futile. The notes left by [[Évariste Galois]] prior to dying in a duel in 1832 later led to an elegant [[Galois Theory|complete theory]] of the roots of polynomials, of which this theorem was one result.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian, ''Galois Theory, Third Edition'' (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Mathematics, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Each [[coordinate]] of the intersection points of two [[conic section]]s is a solution of a quartic equation. The same is true for the intersection of a line and a [[torus]]. It follows that quartic equations often arise in [[computational geometry]] and all related fields such as [[computer graphics]], [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]] and [[optics]]. Here are examples of other geometric problems whose solution involves solving a quartic equation.

In [[computer-aided manufacturing]], the torus is a shape that is commonly associated with the [[endmill]] cutter.  To calculate its location relative to a triangulated surface, the position of a horizontal torus on the {{math|''z''}}-axis must be found where it is tangent to a fixed line, and this requires the solution of a general quartic equation to be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.math.gatech.edu/~etnyre/class/4441Fall16/ShifrinDiffGeo.pdf|title=DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY: A First Course in Curves and Surfaces, p. 36|last=|first=|date=|website=math.gatech.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quartic equation arises also in the process of solving the [[crossed ladders problem]], in which the lengths of two crossed ladders, each based against one wall and leaning against another, are given along with the height at which they cross, and the distance between the walls is to be found.

In optics, [[Alhazen's problem]] is "''Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.''" This leads to a quartic equation.&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light|first1=R.

W.|last2=Oldford|journal=Statistical Science|volume=15|issue=3|date=August 2000|pages=254–78|doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817|MR=1847825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{Citation|last = Neumann|first = Peter M.|author-link = Peter M.

Finding the [[distance of closest approach of ellipses and ellipsoids#Distance of closest approach of two ellipses|distance of closest approach of two ellipses]] involves solving a quartic equation.

The [[eigenvalue]]s of a 4×4 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] are the roots of a quartic polynomial which is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the matrix.

The characteristic equation of a fourth-order linear [[difference equation]] or [[differential equation]] is a quartic equation. An example arises in the [[Bending#Timoshenko-Rayleigh theory|Timoshenko-Rayleigh theory]] of beam bending.

[[Intersection (Euclidean geometry)|Intersections]] between spheres, cylinders, or other [[quadric]]s can be found using quartic equations.

==Inflection points and golden ratio==

Letting {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} be the distinct [[inflection point]]s of a quartic, and letting {{mvar|H}} be the intersection of the inflection [[secant line]] {{mvar|FG}} and the quartic, nearer to {{mvar|G}} than to {{mvar|F}}, then {{mvar|G}} divides {{mvar|FH}} into the [[golden section]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Aude|first = H. T. R.|journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]|year = 1949|issue = 3|volume = 56|title = Notes on Quartic Curves|jstor = 2305030|doi = 10.2307/2305030|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{FG}{GH}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}= \text{the golden ratio}.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the area of the region between the secant line and the quartic below the secant line equals the area of the region between the secant line and the quartic above the secant line. One of those regions is disjointed into sub-regions of equal area.

==Solving a quartic equation==

===Nature of the roots===
Given the general quartic equation
:&lt;math&gt;ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0&lt;/math&gt;
with real coefficients and {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} the nature of its roots is mainly determined by the sign of its [[discriminant]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\Delta\ =\ &amp;256 a^3 e^3 - 192 a^2 b d e^2 - 128 a^2 c^2 e^2 + 144 a^2 c d^2 e - 27 a^2 d^4 \\ 
&amp;+ 144 a b^2 c e^2 - 6 a b^2 d^2 e - 80 a b c^2 d e + 18 a b c d^3 + 16 a c^4 e \\
&amp;- 4 a c^3 d^2 - 27 b^4 e^2 + 18 b^3 c d e - 4 b^3 d^3 - 4 b^2 c^3 e + b^2 c^2 d^2
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt; 
This may be refined by considering the signs of four other polynomials:
:&lt;math&gt;P = 8ac - 3b^2&lt;/math&gt;
such that {{math|{{sfrac|''P''|8''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the second degree coefficient of the associated depressed quartic (see [[#Converting_to_a_depressed_quartic|below]]);
:&lt;math&gt;R= b^3+8da^2-4abc,&lt;/math&gt;
such that {{math|{{sfrac|''R''|8''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the first degree coefficient of the associated depressed quartic; 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_0 = c^2 - 3bd + 12ae,&lt;/math&gt;
which is 0 if the quartic has a triple root; and
:&lt;math&gt;D = 64 a^3 e - 16 a^2 c^2 + 16 a b^2 c - 16 a^2 bd - 3 b^4&lt;/math&gt;
which is 0 if the quartic has two double roots.

The possible cases for the nature of the roots are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= E. L.|last=Rees|title=Graphical Discussion of the Roots of a Quartic Equation|journal = The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=29|issue=2|year=1922|pages=51–55|doi=10.2307/2972804|jstor = 2972804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* If {{math|∆ &lt; 0}} then the equation has two distinct real roots and two [[complex conjugate]] non-real roots.
* If {{math|∆ &gt; 0}} then either the equation's four roots are all real or none is.
** If {{mvar|P}} &lt; 0 and {{mvar|D}} &lt; 0 then all four roots are real and distinct.
** If {{mvar|P}} &gt; 0 or {{mvar|D}} &gt; 0 then there are two pairs of non-real complex conjugate roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | doi = 10.1016/S0747-7171(88)80015-4 | title = Quantifier elimination: Optimal solution for two classical examples | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 5 | pages = 261–266 | year = 1988 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If {{math|∆ {{=}} 0}} then (and only then) the polynomial has a [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiple]] root. Here are the different cases that can occur:
** If {{mvar|P}} &lt; 0 and {{mvar|D}} &lt; 0 and {{math|∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}}, there are a real double root and two real simple roots.
** If {{mvar|D}} &gt; 0 or ({{mvar|P}} &gt; 0 and ({{mvar|D}} ≠ 0 or {{mvar|R}} ≠ 0)), there are a real double root and two complex conjugate roots.
** If {{math|∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and {{mvar|D}} ≠ 0, there are a triple root and a simple root, all real.
** If {{mvar|D}} = 0, then:
***If {{mvar|P}} &lt; 0, there are two real double roots.
***If {{mvar|P}} &gt; 0 and {{mvar|R}} = 0, there are two complex conjugate double roots.
***If {{math|∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, all four roots are equal to {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|4''a''}}}}

There are some cases that do not seem to be covered, but they cannot occur.  For example, {{math|∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}, {{mvar|P}} = 0 and {{mvar|D}} ≤ 0 is not one of the cases.  However, if {{math|∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}} and {{mvar|P}} = 0 then  {{mvar|D}} &gt; 0 so this combination is not possible.

===General formula for roots===

The four roots {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} for the general quartic equation
:&lt;math&gt;ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
with {{mvar|a}} ≠ 0 are given in the following formula, which is deduced from the one in the section on [[#Ferrari's solution|Ferrari's method]] by back changing the variables (see {{slink||Converting to a depressed quartic}}) and using the formulas for the [[Quadratic function|quadratic]] and [[Cubic function#General formula for roots|cubic equation]]s.

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_1^2-4\Delta_0^3 = - 27 \Delta\ ,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the aforementioned [[discriminant]]. For the cube root expression for ''Q'', any of the three cube roots in the complex plane can be used, although if one of them is real that is the natural and simplest one to choose.The mathematical expressions of these last four terms are very similar to those of their [[Cubic function#Algebraic solution|cubic counterparts]].

====Special cases of the formula====

*If &lt;math&gt;\Delta &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt; the value of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a non-real complex number. In this case, either all roots are non-real or they are all real. In the latter case, the value of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is also real, despite being expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;Q;&lt;/math&gt; this is [[casus irreducibilis]] of the cubic function extended to the present context of the quartic. One may prefer to express it in a purely real way, by using [[trigonometric functions]], as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{-\frac23\ p+\frac{2}{3a}\sqrt{\Delta_0}\cos\frac{\phi}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arccos\left(\frac{\Delta_1}{2\sqrt{\Delta_0^3}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

*If &lt;math&gt;\Delta \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt; the sign of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\Delta_1^2 - 4 \Delta_0^3}=\sqrt{\Delta_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;  has to be chosen to have &lt;math&gt;Q \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt; that is one should define &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\Delta_1^2}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\Delta_1,&lt;/math&gt; maintaining the sign of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_1.&lt;/math&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;S = 0,&lt;/math&gt; then one must change the choice of the cube root in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in order to have &lt;math&gt;S \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt; This is always possible except if the quartic may be factored into &lt;math&gt;\left(x+\tfrac{b}{4a}\right)^4.&lt;/math&gt; The result is then correct, but misleading because it hides the fact that no cube root is needed in this case. In fact this case may occur only if the [[numerator]] of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is zero, in which case the associated [[#Converting to a depressed quartic|depressed quartic]] is biquadratic; it may thus be solved by the method described [[#Biquadratic equations|below]].
*If &lt;math&gt;\Delta = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt; and thus also &lt;math&gt;\Delta_1 = 0,&lt;/math&gt; at least three roots are equal to each other, and the roots are [[rational function]]s of the coefficients. The triple root &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a common root of the quartic and its second derivative &lt;math&gt;2(6ax^2+3bx+c);&lt;/math&gt; it is thus also the unique root of the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of the quartic by its second derivative, which is a linear polynomial. The simple root &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; can be deduced from &lt;math&gt;x_1+3x_0=-b/a.&lt;/math&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;\Delta=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta_0 \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt; the above expression for the roots is correct but misleading, hiding the fact that the polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|reducible]] and no cube root is needed to represent the roots.

===Simpler cases===

====Reducible quartics====
Consider the general quartic
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0.&lt;/math&gt;
It is [[irreducible polynomial|reducible]] if {{math|''Q''(''x'') {{=}} ''R''(''x'')×''S''(''x'')}}, where {{math|''R''(''x'')}} and {{math|''S''(''x'')}} are non-constant polynomials with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or more generally with coefficients in the same [[field (mathematics)|field]] as the coefficients of {{math|''Q''(''x'')}}). Such a factorization will take one of two forms:

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = (x-x_1)(b_3x^3+b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = (c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0)(d_2x^2+d_1x+d_0).&lt;/math&gt;
In either case, the roots of {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} are the roots of the factors, which may be computed using the formulas for the roots of a [[quadratic function]] or [[cubic function]].

Detecting the existence of such factorizations can be done [[Resolvent cubic#Factoring quartic polynomials|using the resolvent cubic of {{math|''Q''(''x'')}}]]. It turns out that:
* if we are working over {{math|'''R'''}} (that is, if coefficients are restricted to be real numbers) (or, more generally, over some [[real closed field]]) then there is always such a factorization;
* if we are working over {{math|'''Q'''}} (that is, if coefficients are restricted to be rational numbers) then there is an algorithm to determine whether or not {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} is reducible and, if it is, how to express it as a product of polynomials of smaller degree.

In fact, several methods of solving quartic equations ([[Quartic function#Ferrari's solution|Ferrari's method]], [[Quartic function#Descartes' solution|Descartes' method]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Quartic function#Euler's solution|Euler's method]]) are based upon finding such factorizations.

====Biquadratic equation====
If {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} then the '''biquadratic function'''
&lt;!--The \,\! below is to format this as PNG instead of HTML. Please do not remove it--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
Q(x) = a_4x^4+a_2x^2+a_0\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;
defines a '''biquadratic equation''', which is easy to solve.

Let {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
Then {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} becomes a [[Quadratic function|quadratic]] {{math|''q''}} in {{math|''z''}}: {{math|''q''(''z'') {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''z'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Let {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the roots of {{math|''q''(''z'')}}. Then the roots of our quartic {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_1&amp;=+\sqrt{z_+},
\\
x_2&amp;=-\sqrt{z_+},
\\
x_3&amp;=+\sqrt{z_-},
\\
x_4&amp;=-\sqrt{z_-}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Quasi-palindromic equation ====
The polynomial
: &lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0x^4+a_1x^3+a_2x^2+a_1 m x+a_0 m^2&lt;/math&gt;
is almost [[Reciprocal polynomial#Palindromic polynomial|palindromic]], as {{math|''P''(''mx'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}''P''({{sfrac|''m''|''x''}})}} (it is palindromic if {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}). The change of variables {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''x'' + {{sfrac|''m''|''x''}}}} in {{math|{{sfrac|''P''(''x'')|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} 0}} produces the [[quadratic equation]]  {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''z'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − 2''ma''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}. Since {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''xz'' + ''m'' {{=}} 0}}, the quartic equation {{math|''P''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} may be solved by applying the [[quadratic formula]] twice.

===Solution methods===

====Converting to a depressed quartic====

For solving purposes, it is generally better to convert the quartic into a '''depressed quartic''' by the following simple change of variable. All formulas are simpler and some methods work only in this case. The roots of the original quartic are easily recovered from that of the depressed quartic by the reverse change of variable.

Let
:&lt;math&gt; a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
be the general quartic equation we want to solve.

Dividing by {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, provides the equivalent equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx'' + ''e'' {{=}} 0}}, with {{math|''b'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, {{math|''c'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, {{math|''d'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, and {{math|''e'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}.
Substituting {{math|''y'' − {{sfrac|''b''|4}}}} for {{mvar|x}} gives, after regrouping the terms, the equation {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''py''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qy'' + ''r'' {{=}} 0}},
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p&amp;=\frac{8c-3b^2}{8} =\frac{8a_2a_4-3{a_3}^2}{8{a_4}^2}\\
q&amp;=\frac{b^3-4bc+8d}{8} =\frac{{a_3}^3-4a_2a_3a_4+8a_1{a_4}^2}{8{a_4}^3}\\
r&amp;=\frac{-3b^4+256e-64bd+16b^2c}{256}=\frac{-3{a_3}^4+256a_0{a_4}^3-64a_1a_3{a_4}^2+16a_2{a_3}^2a_4}{256{a_4}^4}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a root of this depressed quartic, then {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''b''|4}}}} (that is {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|4''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}})}} is a root of the original quartic and every root of the original quartic can be obtained by this process.

====Ferrari's solution====

As explained in the preceding section, we may start with the ''depressed quartic equation''
:&lt;math&gt; y^4 + p y^2 + q y + r = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
This depressed quartic can be solved by means of a method discovered by [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. The depressed equation may be rewritten (this is easily verified by expanding the square and regrouping all terms in the left-hand side) as
:&lt;math&gt; \left(y^2 + \frac p2\right)^2 = -q y - r + \frac{p^2}4. &lt;/math&gt;
Then, we introduce a variable {{mvar|m}} into the factor on the left-hand side by adding {{math|2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''m'' + ''pm'' + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to both sides. After regrouping the coefficients of the power of {{mvar|y}} in the right-hand side, this gives the equation 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \left(y^2 + \frac p2 + m\right)^2 = 2 m y^2 - q y + m^2 + m p + \frac{p^2}4 - r, &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
which is equivalent to the original equation, whichever value is given to {{mvar|m}}.

As the value of {{mvar|m}} may be arbitrarily chosen, we will choose it in order to get a perfect square in the right-hand side. This implies that the [[discriminant]] in {{mvar|y}} of this [[quadratic equation]] is zero, that is {{mvar|m}} is a root of the equation
:&lt;math&gt; (-q)^2 - 4 (2m)\left(m^2 + p m + \frac{p^2}4 - r\right) = 0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
which may be rewritten as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;8m^3+ 8pm^2 + (2p^2 -8r)m- q^2 =0.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1a}}}}

This is the [[resolvent cubic]] of the quartic equation. The value of {{mvar|m}} may thus be obtained from [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's formula]]. When {{mvar|m}} is a root of this equation, the right-hand side of equation '''(''{{EquationNote|1}}'')''' is the square
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sqrt{2m}y-\frac q{2\sqrt{2m}}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
However, this induces a division by zero if {{math|''m'' {{=}} 0}}. This implies {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, and thus that the depressed equation is bi-quadratic, and may be solved by an easier method (see above). This was not a problem at the time of Ferrari, when one solved only explicitly given equations with numeric coefficients. For a general formula that is always true, one thus needs to choose a root of the cubic equation such that {{math|''m'' ≠ 0}}. This is always possible except for the depressed equation {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

Now, if {{mvar|m}} is a root of the cubic equation such that {{math|''m'' ≠ 0}}, equation '''(''{{EquationNote|1}}'')''' becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \left(y^2 + \frac p2 + m\right)^2 = \left(y\sqrt{2 m}-\frac{q}{2\sqrt{2 m}}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is of the form {{math|''M''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''N''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which can be rearranged as {{math|''M''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''N''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} or {{math|(''M'' + ''N'')(''M'' − ''N'') {{=}} 0}}. Therefore, equation '''(''{{EquationNote|1}}'')'''  may be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt; \left(y^2 + \frac p2 + m + \sqrt{2 m}y-\frac q{2\sqrt{2 m}}\right) \left(y^2 + \frac p2 + m - \sqrt{2 m}y+\frac q{2\sqrt{2 m}}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is easily solved by applying to each factor the [[quadratic formula]]. Solving them we may write the four roots as
:&lt;math&gt;y={\pm_1\sqrt{2 m} \pm_2 \sqrt{-\left(2p + 2m \pm_1 {\sqrt 2q \over \sqrt{m}} \right)} \over 2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|±&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|±&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote either {{math|+}} or {{math|−}}. As the two occurrences of {{math|±&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} must denote the same sign, this leaves four possibilities, one for each root.

Therefore, the solutions of the original quartic equation are
:&lt;math&gt;x=-{a_3 \over 4a_4} + {\pm_1\sqrt{2 m} \pm_2 \sqrt{-\left(2p + 2m \pm_1 {\sqrt2q \over \sqrt{m}} \right)} \over 2}.&lt;/math&gt; 
A comparison with the [[#General_formula_for_roots|general formula]] above shows that {{math|{{sqrt|2''m''}} {{=}} 2''S''}}.

====Descartes' solution====
Descartes&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Descartes|first = René|author-link = René Descartes|title = [[La Géométrie|The Geometry of Rene Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition]]|isbn = 0-486-60068-8|publisher = [[Dover Publications|Dover]]|year = 1954|jfm = 51.0020.07|chapter = Book&amp;nbsp;III: On the construction of solid and supersolid problems|origyear = 1637}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in 1637 the method of finding the roots of a quartic polynomial by factoring it into two quadratic ones. Let

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e &amp; = (x^2 + sx + t)(x^2 + ux + v) \\
   &amp; = x^4 + (s + u)x^3 + (t + v + su)x^2 + (sv + tu)x + tv
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

By equating coefficients, this results in the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
   b = s + u \\
   c = t + v + su \\
   d = sv + tu \\
   e = tv
  \end{array}\right.
 &lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified by starting again with the [[#Converting to a depressed quartic|depressed quartic]] {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''py''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qy'' + ''r''}}, which can be obtained by substituting {{math|''y'' − ''b''/4}} for {{math|''x''}}. Since the coefficient of {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}}, we get {{math|''s'' {{=}} −''u''}}, and:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
   p + u^2 = t + v \\
   q = u (t - v) \\
   r = tv
  \end{array}\right.
 &lt;/math&gt;

One can now eliminate both {{mvar|t}} and {{mvar|v}} by doing the following:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   u^2(p + u^2)^2 - q^2 &amp; = u^2(t + v)^2 - u^2(t - v)^2 \\
   &amp; = u^2 [(t + v + (t - v))(t + v - (t - v))]\\
   &amp; = u^2(2t)(2v) \\
   &amp; = 4u^2tv \\
   &amp; = 4u^2r
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we set {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then solving this equation becomes finding the roots of the [[resolvent cubic]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; U^3 + 2pU^2 + (p^2-4r)U - q^2,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

which is [[Cubic_function#General_solution_to_the_cubic_equation_with_real_coefficients|done elsewhere]]. This resolvent cubic is equivalent to the resolvent cubic given above (equation (1a)), as can be seen by substituting U = 2m.

If {{math|''u''}} is a square root of a non-zero root of this resolvent (such a non-zero root exists except for the quartic {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is trivially factored),

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  s = -u \\
 2t = p + u^2 + q/u \\
 2v = p + u^2 - q/u
  \end{array}\right.
 &lt;/math&gt;

The symmetries in this solution are as follows. There are three roots of the cubic, corresponding to the three ways that a quartic can be factored into two quadratics, and choosing positive or negative values of {{mvar|u}} for the square root of {{mvar|U}} merely exchanges the two quadratics with one another.

The above solution shows that a quartic polynomial with rational coefficients and a zero coefficient on the cubic term is factorable into quadratics with rational coefficients if and only if either the resolvent cubic '''(''{{EquationNote|2}}'')''' has a non-zero root which is the square of a rational, or {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''r''}} is the square of rational and {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}; this can readily be checked using the [[rational root test]].&lt;ref name=Brookfield&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brookfield, G. |title=Factoring quartic polynomials: A lost art |journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] |volume=80 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=67–70|url = https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Brookfield2007-103574.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Euler's solution====
A variant of the previous method is due to [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = van der Waerden|first=Bartel Leendert|authorlink = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|title = [[Moderne Algebra|Algebra]]|volume = 1|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|edition = 7th|isbn = 0-387-97424-5|year = 1991|section = The Galois theory: Equations of the second, third, and fourth degrees|zbl = 0724.12001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Euler|first = Leonhard|author-link = Leonhard Euler|title = [[Elements of Algebra]]|chapter= Of a new method of resolving equations of the fourth degree|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|origyear = 1765|year = 1984|zbl = 0557.01014|isbn = 978-1-4613-8511-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous methods, both of which use ''some'' root of the resolvent cubic, Euler's method uses all of them. Let us consider a depressed quartic {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''px''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qx'' + ''r''}}. Observe that, if
* {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''px''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qx'' + ''r'' {{=}} (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''sx'' + ''t'')(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''sx'' + ''v'')}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the roots of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''sx'' + ''t''}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the roots of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''sx'' + ''v''}},
then
* the roots of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''px''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qx'' + ''r''}} are {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''s''}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''s''}}.
Therefore, {{math|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} −''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In other words, {{math|−(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is one of the roots of the resolvent cubic '''(''{{EquationNote|2}}'')''' and this suggests that the roots of that cubic are equal to {{math|−(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|−(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|−(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. This is indeed true and it follows from [[Vieta's formulas]]. It also follows from Vieta's formulas, together with the fact that we are working with a depressed quartic, that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}. (Of course, this also follows from the fact that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''s'' + ''s''}}.) Therefore, if {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are the roots of the resolvent cubic, then the numbers {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} are such that
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{array}{l}r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4=0\\(r_1+r_2)(r_3+r_4)=-\alpha\\(r_1+r_3)(r_2+r_4)=-\beta\\(r_1+r_4)(r_2+r_3)=-\gamma\text{.}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
It is a consequence of the first two equations that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a square root of {{math|''α''}} and that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the other square root of {{math|''α''}}. For the same reason,
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a square root of {{math|''β''}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the other square root of {{math|''β''}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a square root of {{math|''γ''}},
* {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the other square root of {{math|''γ''}}.
Therefore, the numbers {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} are such that
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{array}{l}r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4=0\\r_1+r_2=\sqrt{\alpha}\\r_1+r_3=\sqrt{\beta}\\r_1+r_4=\sqrt{\gamma}\text{;}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
the sign of the square roots will be dealt with below. The only solution of this system is:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{array}{l}r_1=\frac{\sqrt{\alpha}+\sqrt{\beta}+\sqrt{\gamma}}2\\[2mm]r_2=\frac{\sqrt{\alpha}-\sqrt{\beta}-\sqrt{\gamma}}2\\[2mm]r_3=\frac{-\sqrt{\alpha}+\sqrt{\beta}-\sqrt{\gamma}}2\\[2mm]r_4=\frac{-\sqrt{\alpha}-\sqrt{\beta}+\sqrt{\gamma}}2\text{.}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
Since, in general, there are two choices for each square root, it might look as if this provides {{math|8 ({{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} choices for the set {{math|{''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}}, but, in fact, it provides no more than {{math|2}}&amp;nbsp;such choices, because the consequence of replacing one of the square roots by the symmetric one is that the set {{math|{''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}} becomes the set {{math|{−''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, −''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, −''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, −''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}}.

In order to determine the right sign of the square roots, one simply chooses some square root for each of the numbers {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} and uses them to compute the numbers {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} from the previous equalities. Then, one computes the number {{math|{{sqrt|''α''}}{{sqrt|''β''}}{{sqrt|''γ''}}}}. Note that, since {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are the roots of '''(''{{EquationNote|2}}'')''', it is a consequence of Vieta's formulas that their product is equal to {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and therefore that {{math|{{sqrt|''α''}}{{sqrt|''β''}}{{sqrt|''γ''}} {{=}} ±''q''}}. But a straightforward computation shows that
:{{math|{{sqrt|''α''}}{{sqrt|''β''}}{{sqrt|''γ''}} {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.}}
If this number is {{math|−''q''}}, then the choice of the square roots was a good one (again, by Vieta's formulas); otherwise, the roots of the polynomial will be {{math|−''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|−''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|−''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|−''r''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which are the numbers obtained if one of the square roots is replaced by the symmetric one (or, what amounts to the same thing, if each of the three square roots is replaced by the symmetric one).

This argument suggests another way of choosing the square roots:
* pick ''any'' square root {{math|{{sqrt|''α''}}}} of {{math|''α''}} and ''any'' square root {{math|{{sqrt|''β''}}}} of {{math|''β''}};
* ''define'' {{math|{{sqrt|''γ''}}}} as &lt;math&gt;-\frac q{\sqrt{\alpha}\sqrt{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Of course, this will make no sense if {{math|''α''}} or {{math|''β''}} is equal to {{math|0}}, but {{math|0}} is  a root of '''(''{{EquationNote|2}}'')''' only when {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, that is, only when we are dealing with a [[Quartic function#Biquadratic equation|biquadratic equation]], in which case there is a much simpler approach.

====Solving by Lagrange resolvent====
The [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} on four elements has the [[Klein four-group]] as a [[normal subgroup]]. This suggests using a '''{{visible anchor|resolvent cubic}}''' whose roots may be variously described as a discrete Fourier transform or a [[Hadamard matrix]] transform of the roots; see [[Lagrange resolvents]] for the general method. Denote by {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, for {{math|''i''}} from&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}} to&amp;nbsp;{{math|3}}, the four roots of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx'' + ''e''}}. If we set

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
s_0 &amp;= \tfrac12(x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3), \\[4pt]
s_1 &amp;= \tfrac12(x_0 - x_1 + x_2 - x_3), \\[4pt]
s_2 &amp;= \tfrac12(x_0 + x_1 - x_2 - x_3), \\[4pt]
s_3 &amp;= \tfrac12(x_0 - x_1 - x_2 + x_3),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

then since the transformation is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] we may express the roots in terms of the four {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in exactly the same way. Since we know the value {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −{{sfrac|''b''|2}}}}, we only need the values for {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. These are the roots of the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;(s^2 - {s_1}^2)(s^2-{s_2}^2)(s^2-{s_3}^2).&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} by their values in term of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, this polynomial may be expanded in a polynomial in {{math|''s''}} whose coefficients are [[symmetric polynomial]]s in the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. By the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]], these coefficients may be expressed as polynomials in the coefficients of the monic quartic. If, for simplification, we suppose that the quartic is depressed, that is {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}}, this results in the polynomial
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; s^6+2cs^4+(c^2-4e)s^2-d^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
This polynomial is of degree six, but only of degree three in {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and so the corresponding equation is solvable by the method described in the article about [[cubic function]]. By substituting the roots in the expression of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in terms of the {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, we obtain expression for the roots. In fact we obtain, apparently, several expressions, depending on the numbering of the roots of the cubic polynomial and of the signs given to their square roots. All these different expressions may be deduced from one of them by simply changing the numbering of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

These expressions are unnecessarily complicated, involving the [[root of unity|cubic roots of unity]], which can be avoided as follows. If {{math|''s''}} is any non-zero root of '''(''{{EquationNote|3}}'')''', and if we set

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_1(x) &amp; = x^2 + sx + \frac{c}{2} + \frac{s^2}{2} - \frac{d}{2s} \\
F_2(x) &amp; = x^2 - sx + \frac{c}{2} + \frac{s^2}{2} + \frac{d}{2s}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;F_1(x)\times F_2(x) = x^4 + cx^2 + dx + e.&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore can solve the quartic by solving for {{math|''s''}} and then solving for the roots of the two factors using the [[quadratic formula]].

Note that this gives exactly the same formula for the roots as the one provided by [[Quartic function#Descartes' solution|Descartes' method]].

====Solving with algebraic geometry====
There is an alternative solution using algebraic geometry&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Faucette|first = William M.|journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]|pages = 51–57|title = A Geometric Interpretation of the Solution of the General Quartic Polynomial|volume = 103|year = 1996|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2975214|jstor = 2975214|mr = 1369151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, one interprets the roots as the intersection of two quadratic curves, then finds the three [[degenerate conic|reducible quadratic curves]] (pairs of lines) that pass through these points (this corresponds to the resolvent cubic, the pairs of lines being the Lagrange resolvents), and then use these linear equations to solve the quadratic.

The four roots of the depressed quartic {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''px''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qx'' + ''r'' {{=}} 0}} may also be expressed as the {{mvar|x}} coordinates of the intersections of the two quadratic equations {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''py'' + ''qx'' + ''r'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} i.e., using the substitution {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} that two quadratics intersect in four points is an instance of [[Bézout's theorem]]. Explicitly, the four points are {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;#8788; (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for the four roots {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of the quartic.

These four points are not collinear because they lie on the irreducible quadratic {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and thus there is a 1-parameter family of quadratics (a [[pencil of curves]]) passing through these points. Writing the projectivization of the two quadratics as [[quadratic form]]s in three variables:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_1(X,Y,Z) &amp;:= Y^2 + pYZ + qXZ + rZ^2,\\
F_2(X,Y,Z) &amp;:= YZ - X^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
the pencil is given by the forms {{math|''λF''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''μF''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} for any point {{math|[''λ'', ''μ'']}} in the projective line — in other words, where {{math|''λ''}} and {{math|''μ''}} are not both zero, and multiplying a quadratic form by a constant does not change its quadratic curve of zeros.

This pencil contains three reducible quadratics, each corresponding to a pair of lines, each passing through two of the four points, which can be done &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\binom{4}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|6}} different ways. Denote these {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and  {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Given any two of these, their intersection has exactly the four points.

The reducible quadratics, in turn, may be determined by expressing the quadratic form {{math|''λF''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''μF''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a {{math|3×3}}&amp;nbsp;matrix: reducible quadratics correspond to this matrix being singular, which is equivalent to its determinant being zero, and the determinant is a homogeneous degree three polynomial in {{math|''λ''}} and {{math|''μ''}} and corresponds to the resolvent cubic.

A [[linear differential operator]] ''L'' is called '''quasi-exactly-solvable''' ('''QES''') if it has a [[finite-dimensional]] [[invariant subspace]] of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{V}\}_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L: \{\mathcal{V}\}_n \rightarrow \{\mathcal{V}\}_n,&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' is a [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{V}\}_n&lt;/math&gt;. There are two important cases:
# &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{V}\}_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of [[multivariate polynomial]]s of degree not higher than some [[integer]] number; and
# &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{V}\}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of a [[Hilbert space]]. Sometimes, the [[functional space]] &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{V}\}_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphism (algebra)|isomorphic]] to the finite-dimensional [[representation space]] of a [[Lie algebra]] ''g'' of [[first-order differential operator]]s. In this case, the [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] ''L'' is called a ''g''-Lie-algebraic Quasi-Exactly-Solvable operator. Usually, one can indicate basis where ''L'' has block-triangular form. If the operator ''L'' is of the [[Second-order differential equation|second order]] and has the form of the [[Schrödinger operator]], it is called a Quasi-Exactly-Solvable Schrödinger operator.

The most studied cases are [[one-dimensional]] &lt;math&gt;sl(2)&lt;/math&gt;-Lie-algebraic quasi-exactly-solvable (Schrödinger) operators. The best known example is the sextic QES anharmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian

&lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{H}\} = -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + a^2 x^6 + 2abx^4 + [b^2 - (4 n + 3 + 2p) a] x^2, \ a \geq 0\ ,\ n\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\ p=\{0,1\},&lt;/math&gt;

where (''n+1'') [[eigenstate]]s of positive (negative) parity can be found [[algebra]]ically. Their [[eigenfunction]]s are of the form

&lt;math&gt;\Psi (x)\ =\ x^p P_n(x^2) e^{-\frac{a x^4}{4} - \frac{b x^2}{2} } \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_n(x^2)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polynomial]] of degree ''n'' and (energies) [[eigenvalue]]s are roots of an [[algebraic equation]] of degree (''n+1''). In general, twelve families of one-dimensional QES problems are known, two of them characterized by elliptic potentials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4037">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[group theory]], '''residue-class-wise affine'''
[[Group (mathematics)|groups]] are certain [[permutation groups]] [[Group action|acting]] on
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[integer]]s), whose elements are [[bijection|bijective]]
residue-class-wise affine [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]s.

A mapping &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''residue-class-wise affine'''
if there is a nonzero integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that the restrictions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;
to the [[modular arithmetic#Ring of congruence classes|residue class]]es
(mod &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) are all [[affine transformation|affine]]. This means that for any
residue class &lt;math&gt;r(m) \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; there are coefficients
&lt;math&gt;a_{r(m)}, b_{r(m)}, c_{r(m)} \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of the mapping &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;
to the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;r(m) = \{r + km \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;f|_{r(m)}: r(m) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}, \ n \mapsto
\frac{a_{r(m)} \cdot n + b_{r(m)}}{c_{r(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Residue-class-wise affine groups are [[Countable set|countable]], and they are accessible
to [[Computational group theory|computational investigations]].
Many of them act [[multiply transitive]]ly on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; or on subsets thereof.

A particularly basic type of residue-class-wise affine [[permutation]]s are the
'''class transpositions''': given [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] residue classes &lt;math&gt;r_1(m_1)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;r_2(m_2)&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding '''class transposition''' is the permutation
of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which interchanges &lt;math&gt;r_1+km_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;r_2+km_2&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and which
[[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixes]] everything else. Here it is assumed that
&lt;math&gt;0 \leq r_1 &lt; m_1&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;0 \leq r_2 &lt; m_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of all class transpositions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; [[Generating set of a group|generates]]
a countable [[simple group]] which has the following properties:

It is straightforward to generalize the notion of a residue-class-wise affine group
to groups acting on suitable [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] other than &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;,
though only little work in this direction has been done so far.

See also the [[Collatz conjecture]], which is an assertion about a [[Surjective function|surjective]],
but not [[Injective function|injective]] residue-class-wise affine mapping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11318">'''Schismogenesis''' literally means "creation of division". The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words σχίσμα ''skhisma'' "cleft" (borrowed into English as [[Schism (religion)|schism]], "division into opposing factions"), and γένεσις ''genesis'' "generation, creation" (deriving in turn from ''gignesthai'' "be born or produced, creation, a coming into being").

==Concepts==
===In anthropology===
The concept of schismogenesis was developed by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Gregory Bateson]] in the 1930s, to account for certain forms of social behavior between groups among the [[Iatmul people]] of the [[Sepik River]].  Bateson first published the concept in 1935,&lt;ref name="CCS"&gt;Bateson, Gregory (1935) Culture Contact and Schismogenesis, Man, Vol. 35 (Dec) pp.178-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM"&gt;Bateson, Gregory (1972) [[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]], Chandler Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; but elaborated on schismogenesis in his classic 1936 ethnography ''Naven: A Survey of the Problems suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe drawn from Three Points of View'', reissued with a new Epilogue in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, Gregory. 1936. Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View. Cambridge; Cambridge University Press; Second Edition, with a Revised Epilogue, 1958, Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "naven" refers to an honorific ceremony among the Iatmul (still practiced) whereby certain categories of kin celebrate first-time cultural achievements.  In a schematic summary, Bateson focused on how groups of women and groups of men (especially the honorees mothers' brothers) seemingly inverted their everyday, gendered-norms for dress, behavior, and emotional expression.  For the most part, these groups of people belonged to different patrilineages who not only did not regularly renew their marriage alliances, but also interacted through the mode he called schismogenesis.  Men and women, too, interacted in this mode.  And thus the naven ritual served to correct schismogenesis, enabling the society to endure.&lt;ref&gt;See Eric Kline Silverman, 2001, Masculinity, Motherhood, and Mockery: Psychoanalyzing Culture and the Iatmul Naven Rite in New Guinea.  Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1936 book ''Naven'', Bateson defined schismogenesis as "a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals" (p. 175).  He continued:

"It is at once apparent that many systems of relationship, either between individuals or groups of individuals, contain a tendency towards progressive change. If, for example, one of the patterns of cultural behaviour, considered appropriate in individual A, is culturally labelled as an assertive pattern, while B is expected to reply to this with what is culturally regarded as submission, it is likely that this submission will encourage a further assertion, and that this assertion will demand still further submission. We have thus a potentially progressive state of affairs, and unless other factors are present to restrain the excesses of assertive and submissive behaviour, A must necessarily become more and more assertive, while B will become more and more submissive; and this progressive change will occur whether A and B are separate individuals or members of complementary groups."

"Progressive changes of this sort we may describe as complementary schismogenesis. But there is another pattern of relationships between individuals or groups of individuals which equally contains the germs of progressive change. If, for example, we find boasting as the cultural pattern of behaviour in one group, and that the other group replies to this with boasting, a competitive situation may develop in which boasting leads to more boasting, and so on. This type of progressive change we may call symmetrical schismogenesis" (pp. 176-77). 

Somewhat analogous to [[Émile Durkheim]]'s concepts of mechanical and organic solidarity (see [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]]), Bateson understood the symmetrical form of schismogenic behavior among Iatmul men to be one of a competitive relationship between categorical equals (e.g., rivalry).  Thus one man, or a group of men, boast, and another man/group must offer an equal or better boast, prompting the first group to respond accordingly, and so forth.  Complementary schismogenesis among the Iatmul was seen by Bateson between mainly men and women, or between categorical unequals (e.g., dominance and submission).  Men would act dominant, leading women to act submissive, to which men responded with more dominance, and so forth.  In both types of schismogenesis, the everyday emotional norms or [[ethos]] of Iatmul men and women prevented a halt to schismogenesis.  The crux of the matter for Bateson was that, left unchecked, either form of schismogensis would cause Iatmul society simply to break apart.  Thus some social or cultural mechanism was needed by society to maintain social integration.  That mechanism among the Iatmul was the naven rite.  Bateson's specific contribution was to suggest that certain concrete ritual behaviors either inhibited or stimulated the schismogenic relationship in its various forms.&lt;ref&gt;For a more elaborate discussion of the concept among the Iatmul, see the section "Early Work: New Guinea and Bali" in [[Gregory Bateson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In natural resource management===
Bateson's treatment of conflict escalation has been used to explain how conflicts arise over natural resources, including human-predator conflicts in Norway&lt;ref name="BROX"&gt;Brox, Ottar. (2000) "Schismogenesis in the Wilderness: The Reintroduction of Predators in Norwegian Forests." Ethnos, Vol. 65 (3) pp.387–404. doi:10.1080/00141840050198045.
&lt;/ref&gt; and also for conflicts among stakeholder groups in shared fisheries,&lt;ref name="HLHPAL"&gt;Harrison, Hannah L., and Philip A. Loring. (2014) “Larger Than Life: The Emergent Nature of Conflict in Alaska’s Upper Cook Inlet Salmon Fisheries.” SAGE Open, Vol. 4, pp.1–14. http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/4/4/2158244014555112&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, Harrison and Loring compare conflict schismogenesis to the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], arguing that it is a similar kind of escalation of behavior also caused by the failure of [[social institutions]] to ensure equity in fisheries management outcomes.

===In music===
[[Steven Feld]] (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;265-271), apparently in response to [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s ''[[schizophonia]]'' and borrowing the term from Bateson, employs ''schismogenesis'' to name the recombination and recontextualization of sounds split from their sources.

==Types==

Bateson, in ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind'' describes the two forms of schismogenesis and proposes that both forms are self-destructive to the parties involved. He goes on to suggest that researchers look into methods that one or both parties may employ to stop a schismogenesis before it reaches its destructive stage.

===Complementary schismogenesis===

The first type of schismogenesis is best characterized by a [[class struggle]], but is defined more broadly to include a range of other possible social phenomena. Given two groups of people, the interaction between them is such that a behavior ''X'' from one side elicits a behavior ''Y'' from the other side, The two behaviors complement one another, exemplified in the dominant-submissive behaviors of a class struggle. Furthermore, the behaviors may exaggerate one another, leading to a severe rift and possible conflict. Conflict can be reduced by narrowing [[information asymmetries]] between the two groups.

===Symmetrical schismogenesis===

The second type of schismogenesis is best shown by an [[arms race]]. The behaviors of the parties involved elicit similar or symmetrical behaviors from the other parties. In the case of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], each party continually sought to amass more nuclear weapons than the other party, a clearly fruitless but seemingly necessary endeavor on both sides.

A form of symmetrical schismogenesis exists in common sporting events, such as [[baseball]], where the rules are the same for both teams.

==Interpersonal communication==
In the field of [[communication]], complementary schismogenesis is a force that can take effect in a [[conversation]] where people have different conversational styles, "creating a split in a mutually aggravating way".&lt;ref name="TNWIM"&gt;Tannen, Deborah. [[That's Not What I Meant!]], Random House Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect causes two well-meaning individuals having a conversation to ramp up different styles, resulting in a disagreement that does not stem from actual difference of opinion. For example, if one person's conversational style favoured louder voices, while the other favoured softer speech, the first person might increase the loudness in their voice while the other spoke softer and softer, each trying to lead the conversation towards their style's conception of normal talking.&lt;ref name="TNWIM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FSTS"&gt;Feld, Steven (1994) "From Schizophonia to Schismogenesis..." In  Music Grooves, edited by Charles Keil and Steven Feld, 257-289. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HSSS"&gt;Tannen, Deborah (2004) “He Said, She Said; Exploring the Different Ways Men and Women Communicate” Portable Professor: Linguistics. Barnes &amp; Noble Audio Lecture Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems of holding back==
Systems of holding back are also a form of schismogenesis. They are defined as "mutually aggregating spirals which lead people to hold back contributions they could make because others hold back contributions they could make."&lt;ref name="Si1"&gt;Hämäläinen, R. P., &amp; Saarinen, E. 2007. [http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdf-files/rham07a.pdf Systems Intelligent Leadership]. In R. P. Hämäläinen &amp; E. Saarinen (Eds.), Systems Intelligence in Leadership and Everyday Life: 3-38, Espoo: Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Systems intelligence]] literature, it is held that human interaction has a tendency to fall into such systems unless conscious effort is made to counter this tendency. For example, although most managers would want to give support to their team and most team members would like to receive such support many times support does not result. This is because both parties might feel that the other party is not giving enough and thus they will themselves hold back what they in the best case could give. It has been suggested that systems of holding back are "the single most important key to life-decreasing, reciprocity-trivializing and vitality-downgrading mechanisms in human life." &lt;ref name="Si2"&gt;Saarinen, E., &amp; Hämäläinen, R. P. 2007. [http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdf-files/rham07b.pdf Systems Intelligence: Connecting Engineering Thinking with Human Sensitivity]. In R. P. Hämäläinen &amp; E. Saarinen (Eds.), Systems Intelligence in Leadership and Everyday Life: 39-50, Espoo: Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shadow price''' is commonly referred to as a monetary value assigned to currently unknowable or difficult-to-calculate costs. It is based on the [[Willingness to pay|willingness to pay principle]] - in the absence of market prices, the most accurate measure of the value of a good or service is what people are willing to give up in order to get it. Shadow pricing is often calculated on certain assumptions and premises. As a result, it is subjective and somewhat imprecise and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadowpricing.asp|title=Shadow Pricing|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-26|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of these costs is typically due to an externalization of costs or an unwillingness to recalculate a system to account for [[marginal production]]. For example, consider a firm that already has a factory full of equipment and staff. They might estimate the shadow price for a few more units of production as simply the cost of the overtime. In this manner, some goods and services have near zero shadow prices, for example [[information goods]]. Less formally, a shadow price can be thought of as the cost of decisions made at the margin without consideration for the total cost.

While shadow pricing may be imprecise and inaccurate, it is still frequently employed as a useful technique and is widely used in [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]]. For instance, before taking on a project, businesses and governments may want to weigh the costs and benefits of the project to decide whether the project is worthwhile. While tangible costs and benefits such as the cost of labor are easy to quantify, intangible costs and benefits such as the number of hours saved is much more difficult to quantify. In this case, business owners and policymakers turn to shadow pricing to determine what these intangibles are. There are usually numerous tools that help those to determine what the monetary values of these intangibles are. Some of the most common are: [[contingent valuation]], [[revealed preference]]s, and [[hedonic pricing]].

== Constrained optimisation ==
In [[constrained optimization]] in [[economics]], the '''shadow price''' is the change, per [[infinitesimal]] unit of the constraint, in the optimal value of the objective function of an [[optimization problem]] obtained by relaxing the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]. If the objective function is [[utility]], it is the [[marginal utility]] of relaxing the constraint. If the objective function is [[cost]], it is the [[marginal cost]] of strengthening the constraint. In a [[business]] application, a shadow price is the maximum price that management is willing to pay for an extra unit of a given limited resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/shadow-price Shadow Price: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a production line is already operating at its maximum 40-hour limit, the shadow price would be the maximum price the manager would be willing to pay for operating it for an additional hour, based on the benefits he would get from this change.

In advance of adequate regulation or market pricing for some commodity items conservative organizations will place on their balance sheets a value they believe to be an accurate reflection of the value of those items to their operations.  This is common for companies with a large carbon footprint or water footprint.  As an example [[Microsoft]] has placed a $27/ton price on its carbon emissions which is then billed to the P&amp;L of its individual business units and used to fund the company's renewable energy and efficiency programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://climatemoneypolicy.squarespace.com/latest/carbon-shadow-pricing "Carbon Shadow Pricing" from www.ClimateMoneyPolicy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140717224824-31648971-carbon-shadow-pricing?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_LIKE "Carbon Shadow Pricing" Via www.LinkedIn.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, the shadow price is the value of the [[Lagrange multiplier]] at the optimal solution, which means that it is the infinitesimal change in the objective function arising from an infinitesimal change in the constraint.  This follows from the fact that at the optimal solution the gradient of the objective function is a linear combination of the constraint function gradients with the weights equal to the Lagrange multipliers. Each constraint in an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem has a shadow price or [[Dual problem|dual]] variable.

== Cost-benefit analysis ==
Shadow pricing is frequently used to figure out the monetary values of intangibles and hard to quantify factors during cost-benefit analyses. In the context of [[public economics]], shadow pricing is very useful for governments and policymakers to evaluate whether a public project should be pursued. This is because [[public good]]s are very rarely exchanged in the market, making it difficult to determine its price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47869490|title=International encyclopedia of the social &amp; behavioral sciences|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Elsevier|others=Smelser, Neil J., Baltes, Paul B.|year=|isbn=0080430767|edition= 1st|location=Amsterdam|pages=13272|oclc=47869490}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help determine the monetary value of these goods, these three tools are often used. Take the example of a government determining whether it wants to undertake a freeway project that would save commuters 500,000 hours a year, save 5 lives a year,  and reduce air pollution due to decreased congestion but with a [[present value]] cost of $250 million.

=== Contingent valuation ===
[[Contingent valuation]] estimates the value a person places on a good by asking him or her directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x8955e/x8955e03.htm|title=Applications of the contingent valuation method in developing countries|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially surveys for individuals on how much they would be willing to pay for some intangible benefits or to avoid some intangible harms. Typically, these surveys contain detailed descriptions of hypothetical public goods or services, ask respondents how much they would pay for it, and collect relevant demographic data of these respondents. Some common types of these survey questions include: open-ended, referendum-type, payment-card type, and double-bounded referendum-type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/economics/morey/4545/nonmarket/cvmbasic.pdf|title=What is the contingent valuation method, CVM?|last=|first=|date=2017-10-31|website=|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of contingent valuation is that it is sometimes the only feasible method for valuing a public good. This is especially the case when there is no obvious market price that one can use to determine the value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914290290|title=Public finance and public policy|last=Jonathan,|first=Gruber,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781464143335|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=226|oclc=914290290}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, there are also many disadvantages of this method. For instance, how the survey is structured and how the questions are framed can lead to widely varying results and can induce bias into the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Peter A|last2=Hausman|first2=Jerry A|date=1994|title=Contingent Valuation: Is Some Number Better than No Number?|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jep.8.4.45|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=45–64|doi=10.1257/jep.8.4.45|issn=0895-3309|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, the respondents may simply have no idea how much they value the public good in question.

In the freeway project example, policymakers can design a survey that asks respondents on how much they would pay to save a certain period of time or to spend less time in traffic. However, it may be difficult or uncomfortable to ask respondents how much they value a life.

=== Revealed preferences ===
[[Revealed preference]]s are based on observations on real world behaviors to determine how much individuals place on non-monetary outcomes. In other words, observing individuals' purchasing behaviors is the best way to determine their preferences. It assumes that individuals have made their purchasing decisions over other alternatives - making their final purchases the preferred one. It also allows room for the preferred choice to vary depending on the prices and the budgetary constraints. As such, by varying prices and budgetary constraints, a schedule can be created of an individual's/individuals' preferred choices under certain prices and constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revealed-preference.asp|title=Revealed Preference|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-06-28|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of revealed preferences is that it reduces biases that contingent valuation may bring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As it is based on real-world behaviors, it is much harder for individuals to manipulate or guess-work their answers. On the contrary, this tool also has its limits. For example, it is difficult to control for other factors that may make one prefer a choice over another. It also fails to fully incorporate indifference between two equally preferred choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economics-the-economy.knoji.com/demerits-of-the-revealed-preference-theory/|title=Demerits of the Revealed Preference Theory|website=economics-the-economy.knoji.com|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the freeway project example, where contingent valuation may fall short in determining how much individuals value lives, revealed preferences may be better suited. For instance, policymakers can look at how much more individuals need to be paid to take on riskier jobs that increase the probability of fatality. However, the drawbacks with revealed preferences also arise - in this case, if the riskier jobs increase the probability of not only death but also injury, the higher wages may incorporate the two factors, misrepresenting the result.

=== Hedonic pricing ===
Hedonic pricing is a model that uses regression analysis to isolate the value of a specific intangible cost or benefit. It is based on the premise that that price is determined by both internal characteristics and external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedonicpricing.asp|title=Hedonic Pricing|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-20|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also assumes that individuals value the characteristics of a good rather than the good itself, which implies that price will reflect a set of internal and external characteristics. It is most often used to calculate variances in housing prices that reflect the value of local environmental factors. The model is based on widely-available and relatively accurate market data, making this method uncontroversial and inexpensive to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecosystemvaluation.org/hedonic_pricing.htm|title=Hedonic Pricing Method|website=www.ecosystemvaluation.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, one of hedonic pricing's main advantages is that it can be used to estimate values on actual choices. This method is also very versatile and can be adapted to incorporate multiple other interactions with other factors. However, one of its major downfalls is that it is rather limited - it can mostly only measure things that are related to housing prices. It also assumes that individuals have the freedom and power to select the preferred combination given their income but in actuality, this may not be the case as the market may be influenced by changes in taxes and interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bca.transportationeconomics.org/calculation-issues/valuing-benefits/hedonic-pricing|title=Hedonic Pricing - Transportation Benefit-Cost Analysis|website=bca.transportationeconomics.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the freeway project example, hedonic pricing may be useful to value the benefits of reduced air pollution. It can run a regression of home values on clean air with a variety of control variables that can include home size, age of home, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, crime statistics, school qualities, etc. Hedonic pricing may also be considered in quantifying the monetary value of time saved. It can run a regression of home values on proximity to work with a similar set of control variables.

=== Illustration #1 ===
Suppose a consumer with [[utility]] function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; faces prices &lt;math&gt;\,\! p_1,p_2&lt;/math&gt; and is endowed with income &lt;math&gt;\,\!m.&lt;/math&gt; Then the consumer's problem is:
&lt;math&gt;
\max \{\,\!u(x_1,x_2)\mbox{ } :\mbox{ } p_1x_1+p_2x_2=m\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Forming the Lagrangian auxiliary function &lt;math&gt;\,\! L(x_1,x_2,\lambda):= u(x_1,x_2)+\lambda(m-p_1x_1-p_2x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, taking first order conditions and solving for its saddle point we obtain &lt;math&gt;\,\! x^*_1\mbox{, }x^*_2\mbox{, }\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda^*=\frac{\frac{\partial u(x^*_1,x^*_2)}{\partial x_1}}{p_1}= \frac{\frac{\partial u(x^*_1,x^*_2)}{\partial x_2}}{p_2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This gives us a clear interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier in the context of consumer maximization. If the consumer is given an extra dollar (the budget constraint is relaxed) at the optimal consumption level where the marginal utility per dollar for each good is equal to &lt;math&gt;\,\! \lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; as above, then the change in maximal utility per dollar of additional income will be equal to &lt;math&gt;\,\! \lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; since at the optimum the consumer gets the same amount of marginal utility per dollar from spending his additional income on either good.

=== Illustration #2 ===
Holding prices fixed, if we define the [[indirect utility function]] as
:&lt;math&gt; U(p_1,p_2,m) = \max \{\,\!u(x_1,x_2)\mbox{ } :\mbox{ } p_1x_1+p_2x_2=m\}&lt;/math&gt;,
then we have the identity
:&lt;math&gt;\,\! U(p_1,p_2,m)=u(x_1^*(p_1,p_2,m),x_2^*(p_1,p_2,m)) &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\,\! x_1^*(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot),x_2^*(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; are the demand functions, i.e. &lt;math&gt; x_i^*(p_1,p_2,m) = \arg\max \{\,\!u(x_1,x_2)\mbox{ } :\mbox{ } p_1x_1+p_2x_2=m\} \mbox{ for } i=1,2.&lt;/math&gt;

Now define the optimal expenditure function

:&lt;math&gt;\,\! E(p_1,p_2,m) =p_1x_1^*(p_1,p_2,m)+p_2x_2^*(p_1,p_2,m). &lt;/math&gt;
Assume differentiability and that &lt;math&gt;\,\! \lambda^* &lt;/math&gt; is the solution at &lt;math&gt;\,\! p_1,p_2,m&lt;/math&gt;, then we have from the multivariate chain rule:
:&lt;math&gt;\,\! \frac{\partial U}{\partial m} =\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial x_2^*}{\partial m} =\lambda^* p_1\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} + \lambda^* p_2 \frac{\partial x_2^*}{\partial m}=\lambda^* \left(p_1\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} +  p_2 \frac{\partial x_2^*}{\partial m} \right) =\lambda^* \frac{\partial E}{\partial m}. &lt;/math&gt;
Now we may conclude that
:&lt;math&gt;\,\! \lambda^* = \frac{\partial U/\partial m}{\partial E/\partial m} \approx \frac{\Delta \mbox{Optimal Utility }}{\Delta \mbox{Optimal Expenditure}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This again gives the obvious interpretation, one extra dollar of optimal expenditure will lead to &lt;math&gt;\,\! \lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; units of optimal utility.

== Control theory ==
In [[optimal control]] theory, the concept of shadow price is reformulated as [[costate equations]], and one solves the problem by minimization of the associated [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] via [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]].

==Etymology==
The word ''stochastic'' in English was originally used as an adjective with the definition "pertaining to conjecturing", and stemming from a Greek word meaning "to aim at a mark,  guess", and the Oxford English Dictionary gives the year 1662 as its earliest occurrence.&lt;ref name="OxfordStochastic"/&gt; In his work on probability ''Ars Conjectandi'', originally published in Latin in 1713, [[Jakob Bernoulli]]  used the phrase "Ars Conjectandi sive Stochastice", which has been translated to  "the art of conjecturing or stochastics".&lt;ref name="Sheĭnin2006page5"&gt;{{cite book|author=O. B. Sheĭnin|title=Theory of probability and statistics as exemplified in short dictums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqMZAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=NG Verlag|isbn=978-3-938417-40-9|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase was used, with reference to Bernoulli, by [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz]]&lt;ref name="SheyninStrecker2011page136"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oscar Sheynin|author2=Heinrich Strecker|title=Alexandr A.

The term ''stochastic process'' first appeared in English in a 1934 paper by  [[Joseph Doob]].&lt;ref name="OxfordStochastic"/&gt; For the term and a specific mathematical definition, Doob cited another 1934 paper, where the term ''stochastischer Prozeß''  was used in German by [[Aleksandr Khinchin]],&lt;ref name="Doob1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doob|first1=Joseph|title=Stochastic Processes and Statistics|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=20|issue=6|year=1934|pages=376–379|doi=10.1073/pnas.20.6.376|pmc=1076423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khintchine1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khintchine|first1=A.|title=Korrelationstheorie der stationeren stochastischen Prozesse|journal=Mathematische Annalen|volume=109|issue=1|year=1934|pages=604–615|issn=0025-5831|doi=10.1007/BF01449156}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the German term had been used earlier in 1931 by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref name="Kolmogoroff1931page1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolmogoroff|first1=A.|title=Über die analytischen Methoden in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung|journal=Mathematische Annalen|volume=104|issue=1|year=1931|page=1|issn=0025-5831|doi=10.1007/BF01457949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
In the early 1930s, Aleksandr Khinchin gave the first mathematical definition of a stochastic process as a set of random variables indexed by the real line.&lt;ref name="Vere-Jones2006page4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vere-Jones|first1=David|title=Khinchin, Aleksandr Yakovlevich|page=4|year=2006|doi=10.1002/0471667196.ess6027.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doob1934"/&gt;{{efn|Doob, when citing Khinchin, uses the term 'chance variable', which used to be an alternative term for 'random variable'.&lt;ref name="Snell2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snell|first1=J.

The word ''stochastic'' is used to describe other terms and objects in mathematics. Examples include a [[stochastic matrix]], which describes a stochastic process known as a [[Markov process]], and stochastic calculus, which involves [[differential equation]]s and  [[integral]]s based on stochastic processes such as the [[Wiener process]], also called the Brownian motion process.

==Artificial intelligence==
In [[artificial intelligence]], stochastic programs work by using probabilistic methods to solve problems, as in [[simulated annealing]], [[stochastic neural network]]s, [[stochastic optimization]], [[genetic algorithms]], and [[genetic programming]]. A problem itself may be stochastic as well, as in planning under uncertainty.

==Natural science==
One of the simplest continuous-time stochastic processes is [[Brownian motion]]. This was first observed by botanist Robert Brown while looking through a microscope at pollen grains in water.

===Physics===
The name "Monte Carlo" for the stochastic [[Monte Carlo method]] was popularized by physics researchers [[Stanisław Ulam]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[John von Neumann]], and [[Nicholas Metropolis]], among others. The name is a reference to the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] in [[Monaco]] where Ulam's uncle would borrow money to gamble.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hubbard "How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business" p. 46, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[randomness]] and the repetitive nature of the process are analogous to the activities conducted at a casino.
Methods of simulation and statistical sampling generally did the opposite: using simulation to test a previously understood deterministic problem. Though examples of an "inverted" approach do exist historically, they were not considered a general method until the popularity of the Monte Carlo method spread.

Perhaps the most famous early use was by Enrico Fermi in 1930, when he used a random method to calculate the properties of the newly discovered [[neutron]]. Monte Carlo methods were central to the [[simulation]]s required for the [[Manhattan Project]], though were severely limited by the computational tools at the time. Therefore, it was only after electronic computers were first built (from 1945 on) that Monte Carlo methods began to be studied in depth. In the 1950s they were used at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] for early work relating to the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], and became popularized in the fields of [[physics]], [[physical chemistry]], and [[operations research]]. The [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] were two of the major organizations responsible for funding and disseminating information on Monte Carlo methods during this time, and they began to find a wide application in many different fields.

Uses of Monte Carlo methods require large amounts of random numbers, and it was their use that spurred the development of [[pseudorandom number generator]]s, which were far quicker to use than the tables of random numbers which had been previously used for statistical sampling.

===Biology===
[[Stochastic resonance]]: In biological systems, introducing stochastic "noise" has been found to help improve the signal strength of the internal feedback loops for balance and other [[vestibular system|vestibular]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1439-7641(20020315)3:3&lt;285::AID-CPHC285&gt;3.0.CO;2-A| title = Stochastic Resonance in Biology How Noise Can Enhance Detection of Weak Signals and Help Improve Biological Information Processing| journal = ChemPhysChem| volume = 3| issue = 3| pages = 285–90| year = 2002| last1 = Hänggi | first1 = P.| pmid=12503175}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to help diabetic and stroke patients with balance control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priplata | first1 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2006 | title = Noise-Enhanced Balance Control in Patients with Diabetes and Patients with Stroke | url = http://www.bu.edu/abl/files/fulltext.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ann Neurol | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 4–12 | doi = 10.1002/ana.20670 | pmid = 16287079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many biochemical events also lend themselves to stochastic analysis. [[Gene expression]], for example, has a stochastic component through the molecular collisions—as during binding and unbinding of [[RNA polymerase]] to a [[Promoter (biology)|gene promoter]]—via the solution's [[Brownian motion]].

{{See also|Stochastic theory of hematopoiesis}}
Stochastic effect, or "chance effect" is one classification of radiation effects that refers to the random, statistical nature of the damage. In contrast to the deterministic effect, severity is independent of dose. Only the ''probability'' of an effect increases with dose.

Simonton (2003, ''Psych Bulletin'') argues that creativity in science (of scientists) is a constrained stochastic behaviour such that new theories in all sciences are, at least in part, the product of a [[stochastic process]].

==Computer science==
[[Distributed ray tracing|Stochastic ray tracing]] is the application of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] to the [[computer graphics]] [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] algorithm. "[[Distributed ray tracing]] samples the [[integrand]] at many randomly chosen points and averages the results to obtain a better approximation. It is essentially an application of the [[Monte Carlo method]] to [[3D computer graphics]], and for this reason is also called ''Stochastic ray tracing''."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Music==&lt;!--[[Stochastic music]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
In [[music]], [[mathematics|mathematical]] processes based on probability can generate stochastic elements.

Stochastic processes may be used in music to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by [[Iannis Xenakis]], who coined the term ''stochastic music''. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the [[statistical mechanics]] of gases in ''[[Pithoprakta]]'', [[statistical distribution]] of points on a plane in ''[[Diamorphoses]]'', minimal [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] in ''Achorripsis'', the [[normal distribution]] in ''ST/10'' and ''Atrées'', [[Markov chain]]s in ''Analogiques'', [[game theory]] in ''Duel'' and ''Stratégie'', [[group theory]] in ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' (for [[Siegfried Palm]]), [[set theory]] in ''Herma'' and ''Eonta'',&lt;ref&gt;Ilias Chrissochoidis, Stavros Houliaras, and Christos Mitsakis, [https://www.academia.edu/249265/Set_theory_in_Xenakis_EONTA "Set theory in Xenakis' ''EONTA''"], in ''International Symposium Iannis Xenakis'', ed. Anastasia Georgaki and [[Makis Solomos]] (Athens: The National and Kapodistrian University, 2005), 241–249.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brownian motion]] in ''N'Shima''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Xenakis frequently used [[computer music|computers]] to produce his scores, such as the ''ST'' series including ''Morsima-Amorsima'' and ''Atrées'', and founded [[CEMAMu]]. Earlier, [[John Cage]] and others had composed ''[[aleatoric music|aleatoric]]'' or [[indeterminate music]], which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage's ''[[Music of Changes]]'', for example, uses a system of charts based on the ''[[I-Ching]]''). [[Lejaren Hiller]] and [[Leonard Issacson]] used [[generative grammar]]s and [[Markov chain]]s in their 1957 ''[[Illiac Suite]]''. See: [[Generative music]].

== Subtractive color reproduction ==
When color reproductions are made, the image is separated into its component colors by taking multiple photographs filtered for each color. One resultant film or plate represents each of the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black data. [[Color printing]] is a binary system, where ink is either present or not present, so all color separations to be printed must be translated into dots at some stage of the work-flow. Traditional [[line screen]]s which are [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] had problems with [[moiré]] but were used until [[stochastic screening]] became available. A stochastic (or [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]]) dot pattern creates a sharper image.

==Language and linguistics==
Non-deterministic approaches in language studies are largely inspired by the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, in [[Functional theories of grammar|functionalist linguistic theory]], which argues that [[Linguistic competence|competence]] is based on [[Linguistic performance|performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Newmeyer, Frederick. 2001. "The Prague School and North American functionalist approaches to syntax" ''Journal of Linguistics'' 37, pp. 101–126. "Since most American functionalists adhere to this trend, I will refer to it and its practitioners with the initials 'USF'. Some of the more prominent USFs are [[Joan Bybee]], [[William Croft (linguist)|William Croft]], [[Talmy Givon]], [[John Haiman]], [[Paul Hopper]], [[Marianne Mithun]] and [[Sandra Thompson (linguist)|Sandra Thompson]]. In its most extreme form (Hopper 1987, 1988), USF rejects the Saussurean dichotomies such as langue vs. parôle. For early interpretivist approaches to focus, see Chomsky (1971) and Jackendoff (1972). parole and synchrony vs. diachrony. All adherents of this tendency feel that the Chomskyan advocacy of a sharp distinction between competence and performance is at best unproductive and obscurantist; at worst theoretically unmotivated.
"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan. "Usage-based phonology." p. 213 in Darnel, Mike (ed). 1999. Functionalism and Formalism in Linguistics: General papers. John Benjamins Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction in functional theories of grammar should be carefully distinguished from the [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] distinction. To the extent that linguistic knowledge is constituted by experience with language, grammar is argued to be probabilistic and variable rather than fixed and absolute.  This conception of grammar as probabilistic and variable follows from the idea that one's competence changes in accordance with one's experience with language. Though this conception has been contested,&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1959). Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior, Language, 35: 26–58&lt;/ref&gt; it has also provided the foundation for modern statistical natural language processing&lt;ref&gt;Manning and Schütze, (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, MIT Press. Cambridge, MA&lt;/ref&gt; and for theories of language learning and change.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee (2007) Frequency of use and the organization of language. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social sciences==
Stochastic social science theory is similar to [[systems theory]] in that events are interactions of systems, although with a marked emphasis on unconscious processes.  The event creates its own conditions of possibility, rendering it unpredictable if simply for the number of variables involved.  Stochastic social science theory can be seen as an elaboration of a kind of 'third axis' in which to situate human behavior alongside the traditional 'nature vs. nurture' opposition.  See [[Julia Kristeva]] on her usage of the 'semiotic', [[Luce Irigaray]] on reverse Heideggerian epistemology, and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] on polythetic space for examples of stochastic social science theory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Business==

===Manufacturing===
Manufacturing processes are assumed to be [[stochastic processes]].  This assumption is largely valid for either continuous or batch manufacturing processes.  Testing and monitoring of the process is recorded using a [[process control]] chart which plots a given process control parameter over time.  Typically a dozen or many more parameters will be tracked simultaneously.  Statistical models are used to define limit lines which define when corrective actions must be taken to bring the process back to its intended operational window.

This same approach is used in the service industry where parameters are replaced by processes related to service level agreements.

===Finance===
The financial markets use stochastic models to represent the seemingly random behaviour of assets such as [[stocks]], [[commodities]], relative [[currency]] prices (i.e., the price of one currency compared to that of another, such as the price of US Dollar compared to that of the Euro), and [[interest rates]]. These models are then used by [[quantitative analyst]]s to value options on stock prices, bond prices, and on interest rates, see [[Markov chain|Markov models]]. Moreover, it is at the heart of the [[Insurance|insurance industry]].

===Media===
The marketing and the changing movement of audience tastes and preferences, as well as the solicitation of and the scientific appeal of certain film and television debuts (i.e., their opening weekends, word-of-mouth, top-of-mind knowledge among surveyed groups, star name recognition and other elements of social media outreach and advertising), are determined in part by stochastic modeling. A recent attempt at repeat business analysis was done by Japanese scholars{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and is part of the Cinematic Contagion Systems patented by Geneva Media Holdings, and such modeling has been used in data collection from the time of the original [[Nielsen ratings]] to modern studio and television test audiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30388">A '''system of polynomial equations''' (sometimes simply a '''polynomial system''') is a set of [[simultaneous equations]] {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} where the {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[polynomial]]s in several variables, say {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, over some [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|''k''}}. 

A ''solution'' of a polynomial system is a set of values for the {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}s which belong to some [[algebraically closed]] [[field extension]] {{math|''K''}} of {{math|''k''}}, and make all equations true. When {{math|''k''}} is the field of [[rational number]]s, {{math|''K''}} is generally assumed to be the field of [[complex number]]s, because each solution belongs to a [[field extension]] of {{math|''k''}}, which is isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers.

This article is about the methods for solving, that is, finding all solutions or describing them. As these methods are designed for being implemented in a computer, emphasis is given on fields {{math|''k''}} in which computation (including equality testing) is easy and efficient, that is the field of [[rational number]]s and [[finite field]]s.

Searching for solutions that belong to a specific set is a problem which is generally much more difficult, and is outside the scope of this article, except for the case of the solutions in a given finite field. For the case of solutions whose all components are integers or rational numbers, see [[Diophantine equation]].

==Examples and extensions==
===Trigonometric equations===
A trigonometric equation is an equation {{math|1=''g'' = 0}} where {{math|''g''}} is a [[trigonometric polynomial]]. Such an equation may be converted into a polynomial system by expanding the sines and cosines in it, replacing {{math|sin(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'')}} by two new variables {{math|''s''}} and {{math|''c''}} and adding the new equation {{math|1=''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – 1 = 0}}.

For example, the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \sin^3(x)+\cos(3x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the polynomial system

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
s^3+4c^3-3c&amp;=0\\
s^2+c^2-1&amp;=0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Solutions in a finite field ===
When solving a system over a finite field {{math|''k''}} with {{math|''q''}} elements, one is primarily interested in the solutions in {{math|''k''}}. As the elements of {{math|''k''}} are exactly the solutions of the equation {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; – ''x'' = 0}}, it suffices, for restricting the solutions to {{math|''k''}}, to add the equation {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; – ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} for each variable&amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

=== Coefficients in a number field or in a finite field with non-prime order ===

The elements of a [[number field]] are usually represented as polynomials in a generator of the field which satisfies some univariate polynomial equation. To work with a polynomial system whose coefficients belong to a number field, it suffices to consider this generator as a new variable and to add the equation of the generator to the equations of the system. Thus solving a polynomial system over a number field is reduced to solving another system over the rational numbers.

For example, if a system contains &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, a system over the rational numbers is obtained by adding the equation {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – 2 = 0}} and replacing &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; by {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the other equations.

In the case of a finite field, the same transformation allows always to suppose that the field {{math|''k''}} has a prime order.

==Basic properties and definitions==
A system is [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] if the number of equations is higher than the number of variables. A system is [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]] if it has no solutions. By [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] this means that 1 is a [[linear combination]] (with polynomials as coefficients) of the first members of the equations. Most but not all overdetermined systems, when constructed with random coefficients, are inconsistent. For example, the system &amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 =&amp;nbsp;0, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is overdetermined (having two equations but only one unknown),  but it is not inconsistent since it has the solution ''x'' =1.

A system is [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] if the number of equations is lower than the number of the variables. An underdetermined system is either inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions in an algebraically closed extension ''K'' of&amp;nbsp;''k''.

A system is [[Zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] if it has a finite number of solutions in an algebraically closed extension ''K'' of&amp;nbsp;''k''. This terminology comes from the fact that the [[algebraic variety]] of the solutions has [[Dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] zero. A system with infinitely many solutions is said to be ''positive-dimensional''.

A zero-dimensional system with as many equations as variables is said to be ''well-behaved''.&lt;ref&gt;Songxin Liang, J. Gerhard, D.J. Jeffrey, G. Moroz, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Stoutemyer/publication/235941679_Unit_normalization_of_multinomials_over_Gaussian_integers/links/02e7e532ddec858b2a000000.pdf#page=2 A Package for Solving Parametric Polynomial Systems]''. Communications in Computer Algebra (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bézout's theorem]] asserts that a well-behaved system whose equations have degrees ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has at most ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; solutions. This bound is sharp. If all the degrees are equal to ''d'', this bound becomes ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and is exponential in the number of variables.

This exponential behavior makes solving polynomial systems difficult and explains why there are few solvers that are able to automatically solve systems with Bézout's bound higher than, say, 25 (three equations of degree 3 or five equations of degree 2 are beyond this bound).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== What is solving? ==
The first thing to do in solving a polynomial system is to decide if it is inconsistent, zero-dimensional or positive dimensional. This may be done by the computation of a [[Gröbner basis]] of the left-hand sides of the equations. The system is ''inconsistent'' if this Gröbner basis is reduced to 1. The system is ''zero-dimensional'' if, for every variable there is a [[Gröbner basis|leading monomial]] of some element of the Gröbner basis which is a pure power of this variable. For this test, the best [[monomial order]] is usually the [[monomial order#Graded reverse lexicographic order|graded reverse lexicographic]] one (grevlex).

If the system is ''positive-dimensional'', it has infinitely many solutions. It is thus not possible to enumerate them. It follows that, in this case, solving may only mean "finding a description of the solutions from which the relevant properties of the solutions are easy to extract". There is no commonly accepted such description. In fact there are many different "relevant properties", which involve almost every subfield of [[algebraic geometry]].

A natural example of such a question positive-dimensional systems is the following: ''decide if a polynomial system over the [[rational number]]s has a finite number of real solutions and compute them''. A generalization of this question is ''find at least one solution in each [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] of the set of real solutions of a polynomial system''.  The classical algorithm for solving these question is [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], which has a [[double exponential function|doubly exponential]] [[computational complexity]] and therefore cannot be used in practice, except for very small examples.

For zero-dimensional systems, solving consists of computing all the solutions. There are two different ways of outputting the solutions. The most common, possible for real or complex solutions, consists of outputting numeric approximations of the solutions. Such a solution is called ''numeric''. A solution is ''certified'' if it is provided with a bound on the error of the approximations which separates the different solutions.

The other way to represent the solutions is said to be ''algebraic''. It uses the fact that, for a zero-dimensional system, the solutions belong to the [[algebraic closure]] of the field ''k'' of the coefficients of the system. There are several ways to represent the solution in an algebraic closure, which are discussed below. All of them allow one to compute a numerical approximation of the solutions by solving one or several univariate equations. For this computation, the representation involving the solving of only one univariate polynomial for each solution is preferable: computing the roots of a polynomial which has approximate coefficients is a highly unstable problem.

== Algebraic representation of the solutions==
=== Regular chains ===
{{main|Regular chain}}
The usual way of representing the solutions is through zero-dimensional regular chains. Such a chain consists of a sequence of polynomials {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, ..., {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that, for every {{math|''i''}} such that {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} only, which has a degree {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}} in {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* the coefficient of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} in {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' −1 &lt;/sub&gt;}} which does not have any common zero with {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

To such a [[regular chain]] is associated a ''triangular system of equations''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
f_1(x_1)= 0\\
f_2(x_1,x_2)=0\\
\quad\vdots\\
f_n(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)=0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions of this system are obtained by solving the first univariate equation, substituting the solutions in the other equations, then solving the second equation which is now univariate, and so on. The definition of regular chains implies that the univariate equation obtained from {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has degree {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and thus that the system has {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} solutions, provided that there is no multiple root in this resolution process ([[fundamental theorem of algebra]]).

Every zero-dimensional system of polynomial equations is equivalent (i.e. has the same solutions) to a finite number of regular chains. Several regular chains may be needed, as it is the case for the following system which has three solutions.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
x^2-1=0\\
(x-1)(y-1)=0\\
y^2-1=0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

There are several algorithms for computing a [[triangular decomposition]] of an arbitrary polynomial system (not necessarily zero-dimensional)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aubry | first1 = P. | last2 = Maza | first2 = M. Moreno | title = Triangular Sets for Solving Polynomial Systems: a Comparative Implementation of Four Methods | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717199902705 | journal = J. Symb. Comput. | volume = 28 | issue = | year = 1999 | doi=10.1006/jsco.1999.0270}}&lt;/ref&gt; into [[regular chain]]s (or [[regular semi-algebraic system]]s).

There is also an algorithm which is specific to the zero-dimensional case and is competitive, in this case, with the direct algorithms. It consists in computing first the [[Gröbner basis]] for the [[monomial order|graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex)]], then deducing the lexicographical Gröbner basis by FGLM algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faugère | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Gianni | first2 = P. | last3 = Lazard | first3 = D. | last4 = Mora | first4 = T. | title = Efficient Computation of Zero-Dimensional Gröbner Basis by Change of Ordering | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717183710515/pdf?md5=96c9dfd7de57f6d6dc799a0c4552192d&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0747717183710515-main.pdf&amp;_valck=1 | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 16 | issue = | year = 1993 | doi=10.1006/jsco.1993.1051 | pages=329–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally applying the Lextriangular algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | title = Solving zero-dimensional algebraic systems | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800867 | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 13 | issue = | year = 1992 | doi=10.1016/S0747-7171(08)80086-7 | pages=117–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This representation of the solutions are fully convenient for coefficients in a finite field. However, for rational coefficients, two aspects have to be taken care of:
* The output may involve huge integers which may make the computation and the use of the result problematic.
* To deduce the numeric values of the solutions from the output, one has to solve univariate polynomials with approximate coefficients, which is a highly unstable problem.

The first issue has been solved by Dahan and Schost:&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Dahan and Eric Schost. ''[http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~eschost/publications/DaSc.ps Sharp Estimates for Triangular Sets]''. Moreover, recent algorithms for decomposing polynomial systems into triangular decompositions produce regular chains with coefficients matching the results of Dahan and Schost.  In proc. ISSAC'04, pages 103--110, ACM Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sets of regular chains that represent a given set of solutions, there is a set for which the coefficients are explicitly bounded in terms of the size of the input system, with a nearly optimal bound. This set, called ''equiprojectable decomposition'', depends only on the choice of the coordinates. This allows the use of [[modular arithmetic|modular methods]] for computing efficiently the equiprojectable decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Changbo Chen and Marc Moreno-Maza.

The second issue is generally solved by outputting regular chains of a special form, sometimes called ''shape lemma'', for which all {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} but the first one are equal to {{math|1}}. For getting such regular chains, one may have to add a further variable, called ''separating variable'', which is given the index {{math|0}}. The ''rational univariate representation'', described below,  allows computing such a special regular chain, satisfying Dahan–Schost bound, by starting from either a regular chain or a Gröbner basis.

===Rational univariate representation===
The ''rational univariate representation'' or RUR is a representation of the solutions of a zero-dimensional polynomial system over the rational numbers which has been introduced by  F. Rouillier.&lt;ref&gt;

A RUR of a zero-dimensional system consists in a linear combination {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the variables, called ''separating variable'', and a system of equations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
h(x_0)=0\\
x_1=g_1(x_0)/g_0(x_0)\\
\quad\vdots\\
x_n=g_n(x_0)/g_0(x_0),
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''h''}} is a univariate polynomial in {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} of degree {{math|''D''}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} are univariate polynomials in {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} of degree less than {{math|''D''}}.

Given a zero-dimensional polynomial system over the rational numbers, the RUR has the following properties.

* All but a finite number linear combinations of the variables are separating variables.
* When the separating variable is chosen, the RUR exists and is unique. In particular {{math|''h''}} and the {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are defined independently of any algorithm to compute them.
* The solutions of the system are in one-to-one correspondence with the roots of {{math|''h''}} and the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of each root of {{math|''h''}} equals the multiplicity of the corresponding solution.
* The solutions of the system are obtained by substituting the roots of {{math|''h''}} in the other equations.
* If {{math|''h''}} does not have any multiple root then {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[formal derivative|derivative]] of {{math|''h''}}.

For example, for the system in the previous section, every linear combination of the variable, except the multiples of {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x'' + ''y''}}, is a separating variable. If one chooses {{math|1=''t'' = {{sfrac|''x'' – ''y''|2}}}} as a separating variable, then the RUR is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
t^3-t=0\\
x=\frac{t^2+2t-1}{3t^2-1}\\
y=\frac{t^2-2t-1}{3t^2-1}.\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The RUR is uniquely defined for a given separating variable, independently of any algorithm, and it preserves the multiplicities of the roots. This is a notable difference with triangular decompositions (even the equiprojectable decomposition), which, in general, do not preserve multiplicities. The RUR shares with equiprojectable decomposition the property of producing an output with coefficients of relatively small size.

For zero-dimensional systems, the RUR allows retrieval of the numeric values of the solutions by solving a single univariate polynomial and substituting them in rational functions. This allows production of certified approximations of the solutions to any given precision.

Moreover, the univariate polynomial {{math|''h''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of the RUR may be factorized, and this gives a RUR for every irreducible factor. This provides the ''prime decomposition'' of the given ideal (that is the [[primary decomposition]] of the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of the ideal). In practice, this provides an output with much smaller coefficients, especially in the case of systems with high multiplicities.

Contrarily to triangular decompositions and equiprojectable decompositions, the RUR is not defined in positive dimension.

==Algorithms for numerically solving==
===General solving algorithms===
The general numerical algorithms which are designed for any [[system of nonlinear equations]] work also for polynomial systems. However the specific methods will generally be preferred, as the general methods generally do not allow one to find ''all'' solutions. In particular, when a general method does not find any solution, this is usually not an indication that there is no solution.

Nevertheless, two methods deserve to be mentioned here.

*[[Newton's method]] may be used if the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. It does not allow one to find all the solutions nor to prove that there is no solution. But it is very fast when starting from a point which is close to a solution. Therefore, it is a basic tool for the homotopy continuation method described below.
*[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] is rarely used for solving polynomial systems, but it succeeded, around 1970, in showing that a system of 81 quadratic equations in 56 variables is not inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = Daniel | year = 2009| title = Thirty years of Polynomial System Solving, and now? | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108001107 | journal = J. Symb. Comput. | volume = 44 | issue = | page = 2009 | doi=10.1016/j.jsc.2008.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the other known methods this remains beyond the possibilities of modern technology. This method consists simply in minimizing the sum of the squares of the equations. If zero is found as a local minimum, then it is attained at a solution. This method works for overdetermined systems, but outputs an empty information if all local minimums which are found are positive.

=== Homotopy continuation method ===
{{main|Homotopy continuation}}
This is a semi-numeric method which supposes that the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. This method is relatively old but it has been dramatically improved in the last decades.&lt;ref name="Vers99"&gt;{{cite journal
| first=Jan | last=Verschelde
| title=Algorithm 795: PHCpack: A general-purpose solver for polynomial systems by homotopy continuation
| journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software
| volume=25
| year=1999
| url=http://eaton.math.rpi.edu/csums/papers/homotopy/verschelde.pdf
| doi=10.1145/317275.317286
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method divides into three steps. First an upper bound on the number of solutions is computed. This bound has to be as sharp as possible. Therefore, it is computed by, at least, four different methods and the best value, say &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, is kept.

In the second step, a system &lt;math&gt;g_1=0,\, \ldots,\, g_n=0&lt;/math&gt; of polynomial equations is generated which has exactly &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; solutions that are easy to compute. This new system has the same number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of variables and the same number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of equations and the same general structure as the system to solve, &lt;math&gt;f_1=0,\, \ldots,\, f_n=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Then a [[homotopy]] between the two systems is considered. It consists, for example, of the straight line between the two systems, but other paths may be considered, in particular to avoid some singularities, in the system

:&lt;math&gt;(1-t)g_1+t f_1=0,\, \ldots,\, (1-t)g_n+t f_n=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The homotopy continuation consists in deforming the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 and ''following'' the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; solutions during this deformation. This gives the desired solutions for &lt;math&gt;t = 1&lt;/math&gt;. ''Following'' means that, if &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;, the solutions for &lt;math&gt;t=t_2&lt;/math&gt; are deduced from the solutions for &lt;math&gt;t=t_1&lt;/math&gt; by Newton's method. The difficulty here is to well choose the value of &lt;math&gt;t_2-t_1:&lt;/math&gt; Too large, Newton's convergence may be slow and may even jump from a solution path to another one. Too small, and the number of steps slows down the method.

===Numerically solving from the rational univariate representation===

To deduce the numeric values of the solutions from a RUR seems easy: it suffices to compute the roots of the univariate polynomial and to substitute them in the other equations. This is not so easy because the evaluation of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial is highly unstable.

The roots of the univariate polynomial have thus to be computed at a high precision which may not be defined once for all. There are two algorithms which fulfill this requirement.

* [[Aberth method]], implemented in [[MPSolve]] computes all the complex roots to any precision.
* Uspensky's algorithm of Collins and Akritas,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Collins and Alkiviadis G. Akritas, ''[http://www.inf.uth.gr/~akritas/articles/1.pdf Polynomial Real Root Isolation Using Descarte's Rule of Signs]''. Proceedings of the 1976 ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation&lt;/ref&gt; improved by Rouillier and Zimmermann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rouillier | first1 = F. | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = P. | title = Efficient isolation of polynomial's real roots | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042703007271 | journal = Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume = 162 | issue = | year = 2004 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2003.08.015 | pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]]. This algorithms computes the real roots, isolated in intervals of arbitrary small width. It is implemented in [[Maple (software)|Maple]] (functions ''fsolve'' and ''RootFinding[Isolate]'').

==Software packages==
There are at least four software packages which can solve zero-dimensional systems automatically (by automatically, one means that no human intervention is needed between input and output, and thus that no knowledge of the method by the user is needed). There are also several other software packages which may be useful for solving zero-dimensional systems. Some of them are listed after the automatic solvers.

The [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''RootFinding[Isolate]'' takes as input any polynomial system over the rational numbers (if some coefficients are [[floating point]] numbers, they are converted to rational numbers) and outputs the real solutions represented either (optionally) as intervals of rational numbers or as floating point approximations of arbitrary precision. If the system is not zero dimensional, this is signaled as an error.

Internally, this solver, designed by F. Rouillier computes first a Gröbner basis and then a Rational Univariate Representation from which the required approximation of the solutions are deduced. It works routinely for systems having up to a few hundred complex solutions.

The rational univariate representation may be computed with [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''Groebner[RationalUnivariateRepresentation]''.

To extract all the complex solutions from a rational univariate representation, one may use [[MPSolve]], which computes the complex roots of univariate polynomials to any precision. It is recommended to run [[MPSolve]] several times, doubling the precision each time, until solutions remain stable, as the substitution of the roots in the equations of the input variables can be highly unstable.

The second solver is PHCpack,&lt;ref name="Vers99" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html Release 2.3.86 of PHCpack]&lt;/ref&gt; written under the direction of J. Verschelde. PHCpack implements the homotopy continuation method. This solver computes the isolated complex solutions of polynomial systems having as many equations as variables.

The third solver is Bertini,&lt;ref&gt;Bates, D. J., Hauenstein, J. D., Sommese, A. J., &amp; Wampler, C. W. (2013). Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini (Vol. 25). SIAM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bertini.nd.edu/ Bertini: Software for Numerical Algebraic Geometry]&lt;/ref&gt; written by D. J. Bates, J. D. Hauenstein, A. J. Sommese, and C. W. Wampler. Bertini uses numerical homotopy continuation with adaptive precision.  In addition to computing zero-dimensional solution sets, both PHCpack and Bertini are capable of working with positive dimensional solution sets.

The fourth solver is the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] command ''RegularChains[RealTriangularize]''. For any zero-dimensional input system with rational number coefficients it returns those solutions whose coordinates are real algebraic numbers. Each of these real numbers is encoded by an isolation interval and a defining polynomial.

The command ''RegularChains[RealTriangularize]''  is part of the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] library [[RegularChains]], written by Marc Moreno-Maza, his students and post-doctoral fellows (listed in chronological order of graduation) Francois Lemaire, Yuzhen Xie, Xin Li, Xiao Rong, Liyun Li, Wei Pan and Changbo Chen. Other contributors are Eric Schost, Bican Xia and Wenyuan Wu. This library provides a large set of functionalities for solving zero-dimensional and positive dimensional systems. In both cases, for input systems with rational number coefficients, routines for isolating the real solutions are available. For arbitrary input system of polynomial equations and inequations (with rational number coefficients or with coefficients in a prime field) one can use the command ''RegularChains[Triangularize]'' for computing the solutions whose coordinates are in the algebraic closure of the coefficient field.  The underlying algorithms are based on the notion of a [[regular chain]].

While the command RegularChains[RealTriangularize] is currently limited to zero-dimensional systems, a future release will be able to process any system of polynomial equations, inequations and inequalities. The corresponding new algorithm&lt;ref&gt;Changbo Chen, James H. Davenport, John P. May, Marc Moreno-Maza, Bican Xia, Rong Xiao.

Proceedings of 2010 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2010), ACM Press, pp. 187--194, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the concept of a [[regular semi-algebraic system]].

Let ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''T'''→'''C''' be a complex function ("''symbol''") on the unit circle. Consider the ''n''&amp;times;''n'' Toeplitz matrices ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;phi;''), defined by

:&lt;math&gt; T_n(\phi)_{k,l} = \widehat\phi(k-l), \quad 0 \leq k,l \leq n-1,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat\phi(k) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \phi(e^{i\theta}) e^{-ik\theta} \, d\theta  &lt;/math&gt;

are the [[Fourier coefficient]]s of ''&amp;phi;''.

==First Szegő theorem==
The first Szegő theorem&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=G.|last=Szegő|title=Ein Grenzwertsatz über die Toeplitzschen Determinanten einer reellen positiven Funktion|journal=Math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">In 1936, [[Alfred Tarski]] set out an [[axiomatization]] of the [[real number]]s and their arithmetic, consisting of only  the 8 [[axiom]]s shown below and a mere four [[primitive notion]]s:&lt;ref name=tarski&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarski|first1=Alfred|title=Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences|date=24 March 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504472-0|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of reals denoted '''R''', a [[binary relation|binary]] [[total order]] over '''R''', denoted by [[infix]] &lt;, a [[binary operation]] of addition over '''R''', denoted by infix +, and the constant 1.

The literature occasionally mentions this axiomatization but never goes into detail, notwithstanding its economy and elegant [[Metamathematics|metamathematical]] properties. This axiomatization appears little known, possibly because of its [[second-order logic|second-order]] nature. Tarski's axiomatization can be seen as a version of the more usual [[real number#Definition|definition of real numbers]] as the unique [[Dedekind-complete]] [[ordered field]]; it is however made much more concise by using unorthodox variants of standard algebraic axioms and other subtle tricks (see e.g. axioms 4 and 5, which combine together the usual four axioms of [[abelian group]]s).

The term "Tarski's axiomatization of real numbers" also refers to the theory of [[real closed field]]s, which Tarski showed completely axiomatizes the [[first-order logic|first-order]] theory of the structure 〈'''R''', +, ·, &lt;〉.

==The axioms==
''Axioms of order'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;):

;Axiom 1 :If ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then not ''y'' &lt; ''x''. That is, "&lt;" is an [[asymmetric relation]].

;Axiom 2 :If ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''. In other words, "&lt;" is [[dense order|dense]] in '''R'''.

;Axiom 3 :"&lt;" is [[Dedekind-complete]]. More formally, for all ''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''', if for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'', then there exists a ''z'' such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', if ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''y'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

To clarify the above statement somewhat, let ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose:

:''X precedes Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

:The real number ''z separates'' ''X'' and ''Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' with ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' with ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

Axiom 3 can then be stated as:

:"If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets."

''Axioms of addition'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +):

;Axiom 4 :''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''.

;Axiom 5 :For all ''x'', ''y'', there exists a ''z'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''.

;Axiom 6 :If ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' or ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''.

''Axioms for one'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +, 1):

;Axiom 7 :1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

;Axiom 8 :1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

These axioms imply that '''R''' is a [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered]] [[abelian group]] under addition with distinguished element 1. '''R''' is also [[Dedekind-complete]] and [[divisible group|divisible]].

Tarski stated, without proof, that these axioms gave a total ordering. The missing component was supplied in 2008 by Stefanie Ucsnay.&lt;ref name=total-order&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ucsnay|first1=Stefanie|title=A Note on Tarski's Note|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=Jan 2008|volume=115|issue=1|pages=66–68|jstor=27642393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This axiomatization does not give rise to a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]], because the formal statement of axiom 3 includes two [[universal quantifier]]s over all possible subsets of '''R'''. Tarski proved these 8 axioms and 4 primitive notions independent.

==How these axioms imply a field==
Tarski sketched the (nontrivial) proof of how these axioms and primitives imply the existence of a [[binary operation]] called multiplication and having the expected properties, so that '''R''' is a complete [[ordered field]] under addition and multiplication. This proof builds crucially on the integers with addition being an abelian group and has its origins in [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus']] definition of magnitude.

'''''The Value of Science''''' ({{lang-fr|La Valeur de la Science}}) is a book by the French mathematician, [[physicist]], and philosopher [[Henri Poincaré]]. It was published in 1905. The book deals with questions in the [[philosophy of science]] and adds detail to the topics addressed by Poincaré's previous book, ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' (1902).

==Intuition and logic==
The first part of the book deals exclusively with the mathematical sciences, and particularly, the relationship between [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[logic]] in mathematics. It first examines which parts of science correspond to each of these two categories of scientific thought, and outlines a few principles:
* What we define as intuition changes with the course of time ([[Ancient philosophy|Classical philosophers]] were seen as [[logician]]s in their time, but today we might think of them as using intuition) &amp;ndash; it is therefore the ideas that change, in the evolution of scientific thought;
* This evolution began with the [[arithmetization of analysis]], and ended with the revival of intuitive ideas in an axiomatic system, by the first (true) logicians.

This ''historic'' intuition is therefore mathematical intuition. For Poincaré, it is a result of the [[principle of least effort]], that is, of a link to scientific [[Convention (norm)|convention]] based on [[experimentation]]. Convention, thus given a context, permits one to consider different theories of the same problem, and subsequently make a choice based on the degree of simplicity and usefulness of explanations advanced by each of these theories (see also [[Occam's razor]]). The example chosen by Poincaré is that of [[three-dimensional space]]. He shows how the representation of this space is only one possibility, chosen for its usefulness among many models that the mind could create. His demonstration rests on the theory of ''[[The Mathematical Continuum]]'' (1893), one of Poincaré's earlier publications.

Finally, Poincaré advances the idea of a fundamental relationship between the sciences of ''[[geometry]]'' and ''[[mathematical analysis|analysis]]''. According to him, intuition has two major roles: to permit one to choose which route to follow in search of scientific truth, and to allow one to comprehend logical developments: {{cquote|Logic, which can only give certainties, is the instrument of demonstration; intuition is that of invention}} Moreover, this relation seems to him inseparable from scientific advancement, which he presents as an enlargement of the framework of science &amp;ndash; new theories incorporating previous ones, even while breaking old patterns of thought.

==Mathematical physics==
In the second part of his book, Poincaré studies the links between physics and mathematics. His approach, at once historical and technical, illustrates the preceding general ideas.

Even though he was rarely an experimenter, Poincaré recognizes and defends the importance of experimentation, which must remain a pillar of the [[scientific method]]. According to him, it is not necessary that mathematics incorporate physics into itself, but must develop as an asset unto itself. This asset would be above all a tool: in the words of Poincaré, mathematics is "the only language in which [physicists] could speak" to understand each other and to make themselves heard. This language of numbers seems elsewhere to reveal a unity hidden in the natural world, when there may well be only one part of mathematics that applies to theoretical physics. The primary objective of [[mathematical physics]] is not invention or discovery, but reformulation. It is an activity of synthesis, which permits one to assure the coherence of theories current at a given time. Poincaré recognized that it is impossible to systematize all of physics of a specific time period into one axiomatic theory. His ideas of a three dimensional space are given significance in this context.

Poincaré states that mathematics (analysis) and physics are in the same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also to take a step back to comprehend the broader world of [[nature]]. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of [[calculus|infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] within the framework of [[Newtonian mechanics]].

Mathematical physics finds its scientific origins in the study of [[celestial mechanics]]. Initially, it was a consolidation of several fields of physics that dominated the 18th century and which had allowed advancements in both the theoretical and experimental fields. However, in conjunction with the development of [[thermodynamics]] (at the time disputed), physicists began developing an energy-based physics. In both its mathematics and its fundamental ideas, this new physics seemed to contradict the [[Newtonian physics|Newtonian concept]] of particle interactions. Poincaré terms this the ''first crisis of mathematical physics''.

===Second crisis===
Throughout the 19th century, important discoveries were being made in laboratories and elsewhere. Many of these discoveries gave substance to important theories. Other discoveries could not be explained satisfactorily - either they had only been occasionally observed, or they were inconsistent with the new and emerging theories.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the unifying principles were thrown into question. Poincaré explains some of the most important principles and their difficulties:
* The principle of [[conservation of energy]] (which he called ''[[Julius Robert von Mayer|Mayer's]] principle'') - the discovery of [[radium]] and [[radioactivity]] posed the problem of the continuous (and seemingly inexhaustible) energy emission of radioactive substances.
* The principle of [[entropy]] (which he called ''[[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot's]] principle'') - [[Brownian motion]] seemed to be in opposition to the [[second law of thermodynamics]].
* [[Newton's Third Law]] (which he called ''[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] principle'') — This law seemed to conflict with the laws of [[electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] proposed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], and with the [[luminiferous ether|ether]] theory he had proposed to explain them.
* The principle of [[conservation of mass]] (which he called ''[[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] principle'') — the consideration of movements at a speed close to that of light posed a problem for this principle; this is again an electrodynamic problem : the mass of a body in such a state of motion is not constant.
* the [[principle of relativity]] .
* Finally, he added the [[principle of least action]].

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the majority of scientists spoke of Poincaré's "diagnosis" concerning the crisis of the ''physical principles''. In fact, it was difficult to do otherwise: they had discovered experimental facts which the principles could not account for, and which they evidently could not ignore. Poincaré himself remained relatively optimistic regarding the evolution of physics with respect to these severe experimental difficulties. He had little confidence in the nature of principles: they were constructed by physicists because they accommodate and take into account a large number of laws. Their objective value consists in forming a scientific convention, in other words in providing a firm foundation to the basis on which truth and falsehood (in the scientific meaning of the words) are separated.

But if these principles are conventions, they are not therefore totally dissociated from experimental fact. On the contrary, if the principles can no longer sustain laws adequately, in accordance with experimental observation, they lose their utility and are rejected, without even having been contradicted. The failure of the laws entails the failure of the principles, because they must account for the results of experiment. To abolish these principles, products of the scientific thought of several centuries, without finding a new explanation that encompasses them (in the same manner that the "Physics of principles" encompasses the "Physics of [[central force]]s"), is to claim that all of past physics has no intellectual value. Consequently, Poincaré had great confidence that the principles were salvageable. He said that it was the responsibility of mathematical physics to reconstitute those principles, or to find a replacement for them (the greater goal being to return the field to unity), given that it had played the main role in questioning them only after consolidating them to begin with. Moreover, it was the value of mathematical physics (in terms of the scientific method) which itself saw criticism, due to the implosion of certain theories. Two physics thus existed at the same time: the physics of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and Newton, and the physics of Maxwell; but neither one was able to explain all the experimental observations that technical advances had produced.

===Electrodynamics of moving bodies===
The array of problems encountered concentrated on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Poincaré swiftly proposed the idea that it is the ether modifying itself, and not the bodies acquiring mass, which came to contradict the older theories (based on a perfectly immovable ether). Overall, Poincaré shed light on the [[Zeeman effect]], caused by discontinuous emissions of electrons. The problem of discontinuous matter forced the formulation of a minimally-destabilizing model of the atom. In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] presented his [[Bohr model|atomic model]] which was based on the concept of electron orbits, and which explained [[spectroscopy]] as well as the stability of the atom. But, in 1905, the problem with all attempts to define the behavior of the microscopic world was that no one then knew if they needed to consider a similar model to the one known for the macroscopic objects (the model of classical mechanics), or if they should try to develop an entirely new model to give account of new facts. The latter idea, which was followed with the quantum theory, also implied definitively abandoning the unity already found in prior theories of mechanics.

===Future of mathematical physics===
Poincaré argued that the advancement of the physical sciences would have to consider a new kind of [[determinism]], giving a new place to chance. And in effect, the history of twentieth century physics is marked by a paradigm where [[probability]] reigns. In The Value of Science, Poincaré writes and repeats his enthusiasm for two lines of research : statistical laws (taking the place of differential laws), and relativistic mechanics (taking the place of Newtonian mechanics). Nevertheless, he did not take into account the ideas of [[Max Planck|Planck]]. This latter had in 1900 published the spectral laws governing [[blackbody radiation]], which were the foundation of [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1905, the same year as the publication of The Value of Science, [[Albert Einstein]] published a decisive article on the photoelectric effect, which he based on the work of Planck. Despite the doubts of Poincaré, which were no doubt related to his vision of physics as an approximation of reality (in contrast to the exactness of mathematics), the probabilistic rules of quantum mechanics were clearly the response to the second crisis of mathematical physics, at the end of the nineteenth century. (One can point out that in 1902, Poincaré envisaged a relativistic physics which closely matched, in its theoretical development, the one developed and propounded by Einstein several years later.)

==Objective value of science==
"What is the purpose of science?" is the question repeatedly asked in Poincaré's book. To this [[teleological]] problem, Poincaré responds by taking the opposite position from that of [[Édouard Le Roy]], philosopher and mathematician, who argued in a 1905 article (''Sur la logique de l'invention'', "On the logic of invention") that science is intrinsically anti-intellectual (in the sense of [[Henri Bergson]]) and nominalistic. In contrast to Le Roy, Poincaré follows the thought of [[Pierre Duhem]]. He explains that the notion that science is anti-intellectual is self-contradictory, and that the accusation of [[nominalism]] can be strongly criticized, because it rests on confusions of thoughts and definitions. He defends the idea of ''conventional principles'', and the idea that scientific activity is not merely a set of conventions arranged arbitrarily around the raw observations of experiment. He wishes rather to demonstrate that objectivity in science comes precisely from the fact that the scientist does no more than translate raw facts into a particular language: "''(...) tout ce que crée le savant dans un fait, c'est le langage dans lequel il l'énonce''". The only contribution of science would be the development of a more and more mathematized language, a coherent language because it offers predictions which are useful – but not certain, as they remain forever subject to comparisons with real observations, and are always fallible.

Laughlin, (2014) pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt;  is a shorthand notation for representing the [[vertex figure]] of a polyhedron or tiling as the sequence of faces around a vertex. For [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]] there is only one vertex type and therefore the vertex configuration fully defines the polyhedron. ([[Chirality (mathematics)|Chiral]] polyhedra exist in mirror-image pairs with the same vertex configuration.)

A vertex configuration is given as a sequence of numbers representing the number of sides of the faces going around the vertex. The notation "''a.b.c''" describes a vertex that has 3 faces around it, faces with ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' sides.

For example, "3.5.3.5" indicates a vertex belonging to 4 faces, alternating [[triangle]]s and [[pentagon]]s. This vertex configuration defines the [[vertex-transitive]] [[icosidodecahedron]]. The notation is cyclic and therefore is equivalent with different starting points, so 3.5.3.5 is the same as 5.3.5.3. The order is important, so 3.3.5.5 is different from 3.5.3.5. (The first has two triangles followed by two pentagons.) Repeated elements can be collected as exponents so this example is also represented as (3.5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

It has variously been called a '''vertex description''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/archpol.htm Archimedean Polyhedra] Steven Dutch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orchidpalms.com/polyhedra/uniform/uniform.html Uniform Polyhedra] Jim McNeill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.software3d.com/Uniform.php Uniform Polyhedra and their Duals] Robert Webb&lt;/ref&gt; '''vertex type''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/111177/ Symmetry-type graphs of Platonic and Archimedean solids], Jurij Kovič, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.hws.edu/mitchell/tilings/part3.html 3.

== Vertex figures ==
A ''vertex configuration'' can also be represented as a [[polygon]]al [[vertex figure]] showing the faces around the vertex. This ''vertex figure'' has a 3-dimensional structure since the faces are not in the same plane for polyhedra, but for [[uniform polyhedron|vertex-uniform polyhedra]] all the neighboring vertices are in the same plane and so this [[Orthographic projection|plane projection]] can be used to visually represent the vertex configuration.

|colspan=4|A vertex needs at least 3 faces, and an [[angle defect]].&lt;br&gt;A 0° angle defect will fill the Euclidean plane with a regular tiling.&lt;br&gt;By [[Angular defect#Descartes.27 theorem|Descartes' theorem]], the number of vertices is 720°/''defect'' (4''&amp;pi'';&amp;nbsp;radians/''defect'').
|}

Different notations are used, sometimes with a comma (,) and sometimes a period (.) separator. The period operator is useful because it looks like a product and an exponent notation can be used. For example, 3.5.3.5 is sometimes written as (3.5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The notation can also be considered an expansive form of the simple [[Schläfli symbol]] for [[platonic solid|regular polyhedra]]. The Schläfli notation {''p'',''q''} means ''q'' ''p''-gons around each vertex. So {''p'',''q''} can be written as ''p.p.p...'' (''q'' times) or ''p&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;''. For example, an icosahedron is {3,5} = 3.3.3.3.3 or 3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

This notation applies to polygonal tilings as well as polyhedra. A planar vertex configuration denotes a uniform tiling just like a nonplanar vertex configuration denotes a uniform polyhedron.

The notation is ambiguous for [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] forms. For example, the [[snub cube]] has clockwise and counterclockwise forms which are identical across mirror images. Both have a 3.3.3.3.4 vertex configuration.

== Star polygons ==
The notation also applies for nonconvex regular faces, the [[star polygon]]s. For example, a [[pentagram]] has the symbol {5/2}, meaning it has 5 sides going around the centre twice.

For example, there are 4 regular star polyhedra with regular polygon or star polygon vertex figures. The [[small stellated dodecahedron]] has the [[Schläfli symbol]] of {5/2,5} which expands to an explicit vertex configuration 5/2.5/2.5/2.5/2.5/2 or combined as (5/2)&lt;SUP&gt;5&lt;/SUP&gt;. The [[great stellated dodecahedron]], {5/2,3} has a triangular vertex figure and configuration (5/2.5/2.5/2) or (5/2)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[great dodecahedron]], {5,5/2} has a pentagrammic vertex figure, with ''vertex configuration'' is (5.5.5.5.5)/2 or (5&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)/2. A [[great icosahedron]], {3,5/2} also has a pentagrammic vertex figure, with vertex configuration (3.3.3.3.3)/2 or (3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)/2.

== Inverted polygons ==
Faces on a vertex figure are considered to progress in one direction. Some uniform polyhedra have vertex figures with inversions where the faces progress retrograde. A vertex figure represents this in the [[star polygon]] notation of sides ''p/q'' such that ''p''&amp;lt;2''q'', where ''p'' is the number of sides and ''q'' the number of turns around a circle. For example, "3/2" means a triangle that has vertices that go around twice, which is the same as backwards once. Similarly "5/3" is a backwards pentagram 5/2.

== All uniform vertex configurations of regular convex polygons ==
{{See also|Archimedean_solid#Classification|Tiling by regular polygons#Combinations of regular polygons that can meet at a vertex|Uniform tiling#Expanded lists of uniform tilings}}
[[Semiregular polyhedron|Semiregular polyhedra]] have vertex configurations with positive [[Defect (geometry)|angle defect]].

NOTE: The vertex figure can represent a regular or semiregular tiling on the plane if its defect is zero. It can represent a tiling of the hyperbolic plane if its defect is negative.

For uniform polyhedra, the angle defect can be used to compute the number of vertices. Descartes' theorem states that all the angle defects in a topological sphere must sum to 4''π''&amp;nbsp;radians or
720&amp;nbsp;degrees.

Since uniform polyhedra have all identical vertices, this relation allows us to compute the number of vertices, which is 4''&amp;pi;''/''defect'' or
720/''defect''.

Example: A [[truncated cube]] 3.8.8 has an angle defect of 30 degrees. Therefore, it has
{{math|720/30 {{=}} 24}} vertices.

In particular it follows that {''a'',''b''} has {{math| 4 / (2 - ''b''(1 - 2/''a''))}} vertices.

Every enumerated vertex configuration potentially uniquely defines a semiregular polyhedron. However, not all configurations are possible.

Topological requirements limit existence. Specifically ''p.q.r'' implies that a ''p''-gon is surrounded by alternating ''q''-gons and ''r''-gons, so either ''p'' is even or ''q'' equals ''r''. Similarly ''q'' is even or ''p'' equals ''r'', and ''r'' is even or ''p'' equals ''q''. Therefore, potentially possible triples are 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.6.6, 3.8.8, 3.10.10, 3.12.12, 4.4.''n'' (for any ''n''&gt;2), 4.6.6, 4.6.8, 4.6.10, 4.6.12, 4.8.8, 5.5.5, 5.6.6, 6.6.6.  In fact, all these configurations with three faces meeting at each vertex turn out to exist.

The number in parentheses is the number of vertices, determined by the angle defect.

== Face configuration ==
[[Image:Rhombic dodecahedron v3434.png|thumb|[[Rhombic dodecahedron]] ]]

The uniform dual or [[Catalan solid]]s, including the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedra]], are ''vertically-regular'' ([[face-transitive]]) and so they can be identified by a similar notation which is sometimes called '''face configuration'''.&lt;ref name=Steurer /&gt; Cundy and Rollett prefixed these dual symbols by a ''V''. In contrast, ''Tilings and Patterns'' uses square brackets around the symbol for isohedral tilings.

This notation represents a sequential count of the number of faces that exist at each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] around a [[face (geometry)|face]].&lt;ref&gt;Cundy and Rollett (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, V3.4.3.4 or V(3.4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; represents the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] which is face-transitive: every face is a [[rhombus]], and alternating vertices of the rhombus contain 3 or 4 faces each.

'''Wu Wenjun''' ({{zh|s=吴文俊}}; 12 May 1919 – 7 May 2017), also commonly known as '''Wu Wen-tsün''', was a Chinese [[mathematician]] and [[academician]] at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS), best known for the [[Wu's method of characteristic set]].

==Biography==
Wu's [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral hometown]] was [[Jiashan]], [[Zhejiang]]. He was born in [[Shanghai]] and graduated from [[National Chiao Tung University]] in 1940. In 1945, Wu taught several months at [[Zhijiang Campus, Zhejiang University|Hangchow University]] (later merged into [[Zhejiang University]]) in [[Hangzhou]].

In 1947, he went to [[France]] for further study at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. In 1949, he received his PhD, for his thesis ''Sur les classes caractéristiques des structures fibrées sphériques'', written under the direction of [[Charles Ehresmann]].  Afterwards, he did some work in Paris with [[René Thom]] and discovered the [[Wu class]] and [[Wu formula]] in algebraic topology.  In 1951 he was appointed to a post at [[Peking University]].  However, Wu may have been among a wave of recalls of Chinese academics working in the West following [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s ouster from the mainland in 1949, according to eyewitness testimony by [[Marcel Berger]], as he disappeared from France one day, without saying a word to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Katz | first1=Mikhail G. | title=Systolic geometry and topology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JuY5tsWAHoUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;vq=pu&amp;dq=Systolic+geometry+and+topology|page=19 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-4177-8 | year=2007 | volume=137 | postscript=.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
In 1957, he was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1986 he was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wu, Wen-tsün|chapter=Recent studies of the history of Chinese mathematics|title=''In:'' Selected Works Of Wen-Tsun Wu|pages=273–283|year=2008|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2NhDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he was elected as an academician of [[The World Academy of Sciences]] (TWAS).

Along with [[Yuan Longping]], he was awarded the [[State Preeminent Science and Technology Award]] by President [[Jiang Zemin]] in 2000, when this highest scientific and technological prize in China began to be awarded. He also received the [[TWAS Prize]] in 1990&lt;ref name="Prizes and Awards"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twas.org/opportunities/prizes-and-awards |title=Prizes and Awards |date=2016 |publisher=The World Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shaw Prize]] in 2006. He was the President of the Chinese society of mathematics. He died on May 7, 2017, 5 days before his 98th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1679596|title=首届国家最高科技奖得主、著名数学家吴文俊逝世，享年98岁|last=Zhang|first=Guo|date=2017-05-07|website=The Paper|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The research of Wu includes the following fields: [[algebraic topology]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[game theory]], [[history of mathematics]], [[automated theorem proving]].  His most important contributions are to [[algebraic topology]].  The [[Wu class]] and the [[Wu formula]] are named after him.  In the field of [[automated theorem proving]], he is known for [[Wu's method]].

He was also active in the field of the history of Chinese mathematics. He was the chief editor
of the ten-volume Grand Series of Chinese Mathematics, covering the time from antiquity to late part of the [[Qin dynasty]].

The '''Zionts–Wallenius method''' is an interactive method used to find a best solution to a [[Multiobjective optimization|multi-criteria optimization]] problem.

==Detail==
Specifically it can help a user solve a [[linear programming]] problem having more than one (linear) objective. A user is asked to respond to comparisons between feasible solutions or to choose directions of change desired in each iteration. Providing certain mathematical assumptions hold, the method finds an optimal solution.
