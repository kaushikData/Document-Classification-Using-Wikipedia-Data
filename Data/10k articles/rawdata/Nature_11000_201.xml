'''6SN7''' is a dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] with an 8-pin [[Tube socket#Octal base|octal base]]. It provided a medium gain (20). The 6SN7 is basically two '''6J5''' triodes in one envelope.

[[Image:EIA-8BD.png|thumb]]

==History==
[[File:6SN7russ.JPG|thumb|Soviet version ''6Н8С'']]
Originally released in 1939 it was officially registered in 1941 by RCA and Sylvania as the glass-cased '''6SN7GT''', originally listed on page 235 of RCA's 1940 RC-14 Receiving Tube Manual, in the Recently Added section, as: '''6SN7-GT'''. Although the 6S-series tubes are often metal-cased, there was never a ''metal-envelope'' 6SN7 (there being no pin available to connect the metal shield); there were, however, a few glass-envelope tubes with a metal band, such as the '''6SN7A''' developed during World War II - slightly improved in some respects but the metal band was prone to splitting.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Numerous variations on the '''6SN7''' type have been offered over the years, including:
* '''7N7''' (Sylvania 1940, short-lived loktal-base version),
* '''1633''' (RCA 1941, also for 26-V radios),
* '''12SX7''' (RCA 1946, intended for use in 26-volt aircraft electronics),
* '''5692''' (RCA 1948, a super-premium version - not exactly identical - with guaranteed 10,000 hour lifetime),
* ''' ''6Н8С'' ''' (Soviet version, circa 1950, in latin letters: '''6N8S''');
* '''6SN7 DDR''', '''6Н8М''', '''E1606''' (='''CV278'''), '''OSW3129''' versions with different/larger glass enevelopes;
* '''6042''' (1951, another 1633 type), and
* '''6180''' (1952)
* '''6SN7W''' (1956; a more rugged military version, glass enevelope with metal band)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6SN7W at the National Valve Museum|url=http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aad0076.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American military designator for the 6SN7GA is'''VT-231''', and the British called it '''CV1988'''. European designations include the 1942 '''ECC32''' (not an exact equivalent), '''13D2''' and '''B65'''.

The 6SN7 has a 6.3 V 600 mA heater/filament. The 12-volt 300 mA filament equivalent is the '''12SN7GT''' or '''12SN7GTA'''. The '''14N7''' is the Loktal version of the 12SN7GT. There was also a comparatively rare 8V '''8SN7''' for 450&amp;nbsp;mA series-string TV sets) and 25 Volt/0.15 Amp heater version: '''25SN7GT'''.

== Related Types ==
The 1937 '''6F8G'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6F8G|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6f8g.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also an octal-based double triode with essentially the same characteristics as the 6SN7 (or two 6J5's), but in a 'Coke Bottle' large (Outline ST-12) glass envelope with a different pin arrangement and utilising a top cap connection for the first triode's grid (making pin 1 available for a metal shield).

== 6J5 ==
The '''6J5''', first registered in June 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6J5|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6j5.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''6J5GT''' (registered April 1938; British version '''L63''') were octal single triodes with identical characteristics to one half of a 6SN7.   Other equivalents to the 6J5 include: 
* '''VT-94''', '''6C2''', '''6J5M''', '''38565J'''; 
* military versions: '''CV1933''', '''10E/11448''' and '''CV1934'''; 
* [[Loktal]] base version: '''7A4''' (military name: '''CV1770'''), and 
* 12.6 V heater version: '''12J5'''. 
They in turn were successors to the 1935 RCA '''6C5''' and 1938 '''6P5G'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6J5|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6j5.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successors to the 6SN7 ==
The 1954 '''6CG7'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6CG7|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6cg7.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''6FQ7''' are electrically equivalent to the 6SN7, with [[Tube socket#Noval base|9-pin miniature ("Noval")]] base (RCA, 1951), also made as an 8.4V 450mA series string heater type as the '''8CG7'''.

The 1948 '''ECC40''' with [[Tube socket#Rimlock base|Rimlock base]] can also considered a successor to the 6SN7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECC40|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_ecc40.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but closer in characteristics to the ECC32). The 1946 miniature [[12AU7]]/'''ECC82''', with similar, but not identical, electrical characteristics to the 6SN7 and ECC32, and a filament usable on either 6.3 or 12.6V supplies, is more widely used than the 6CG7/6FQ7.

== Usage ==
The 6SN7 was used as an audio amplifier in the 1940-1955 period, usually in the driver stages of power amps.  The designer of the famous [[Williamson amplifier]], one of the first true [[high-fidelity]] designs, suggested use of the 6SN7 (or B65) in his 1949 revision since it is similar to the original circuit's '''L63''' (=6J5) British single triodes, four of which were used in each channel of his 1947 circuit.

The 6SN7 was one of the most important components of the first programmable digital computer, the [[ENIAC]], which contained several thousand. The [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] computer systems used hundreds of 5692s as [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s.

With the advent of television the 6SN7 was well suited for use as a vertical-deflection amplifier.  As screen sizes became larger, voltage and power headroom became insufficient.  To address this, uprated versions  with higher peak voltage and power ratings were introduced. The '''GE 6SN7GTA''' (GE, 1950) had [[anode]] dissipation uprated to 5.0 watts. The 1954 GE 6SN7GTB also had  controlled heater warmup time, better for [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] heater strings.

The 6SN7 is considered to be obsolete by the 1960s, replaced by the [[12AU7]], and became almost unobtainable. With the introduction of [[semiconductor electronics]], vacuum tubes of all types ceased to be manufactured by the major producers.

A small demand for vacuum tubes in [[guitar amplifier]]s and very expensive high-fidelity equipment remained; as existing stocks ran out, factories in eastern Europe and China started to manufacture the 6SN7, and higher-gain '''6SL7'''.  {{As of|2012}}, 6SN7s were manufactured in Russia and China under the old Soviet designator '''6N8S'''.

The '''Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands''' are an [[ecoregion]] of [[South Island]], New Zealand.

==Location and description==
This ecoregion is a large area of dry grassy plains between the east coast and the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] that form the spine of South Island, in the regions of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and [[Otago]]. The area includes the [[Canterbury Plains]] along the coast, uplands such as the mountains of [[Central Otago]] and the [[Hawkdun Range]] and mountain basins such as the [[Mackenzie Basin]] and the [[Maniototo]]. The grasslands altogether form the largest flat plain of New Zealand and are largely used for grazing livestock. Less rain falls on this eastern side of the Southern Alps so the climate is dry with a warm summer and cold winter, with the highland basins being the driest of all (less than 500mm per year). The upland areas of Canterbury, such as the [[Craigieburn, New Zealand|Craigieburn]] are higher and wetter than those of [[Old Man Range]] and the other flat-topped blocks of Otago, which are colder and often covered in wet bogs. A number of rivers including the [[Rangitata River|Rangitata]], [[Rakaia River|Rakaia]], [[Ashburton River, New Zealand|Ashburton]] and [[Waimakariri River|Waimakariri]] cross the Canterbury Plains in a unique web of braids that weave in and out of each other. The rivers of Otago are deeper and include New Zealand's largest, the [[Clutha River]].

==Flora==
There are few endemic plants on these grassy plains. While there was probably once forest the plains are now special in New Zealand as a large area of pasture almost entirely covered with grasses that are resilient to drought and the constant threat of fire. The endemic [[tussock grass]]es such as slim snow tussock have now been replaced by introduced pasture grasses in many areas. Some upland areas have a cover of ''[[Chionochloa]]'' tussocks plus heath of ''[[Chionohebe]]'' and spiky ''[[Aciphylla]]'' plus some threatened plant species including the shrub ''[[Hebe cupressoides]]'', a daisy (''[[Olearia hectori]]''), and some ''[[Peraxilla]]'' [[mistletoe]]s. In some places there are patches of original or replanted [[beech]] forest. Finally plants of the Canterbury riverine areas include lichens, ''[[Raoulia]]'' daisies, [[willowherb]]s, and shrubs like ''[[Muehlenbeckia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion
|id=aa0801
|name=Cantebury-Otago tussock grasslands
|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The dry grasslands are home to a large number of insects including beetles, grasshoppers, [[cicada]]s, moths, and [[weta]] (a kind of large grasshopper). One particular insect is the ''[[Prodontria lewisi]]'' which only remains in a small area of sand dunes around [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]]. Endemic reptiles include two rare lizards, the [[Otago skink]] (''Oligosoma otagense'') and the [[grand skink]] (''Oligosoma grande'').  The Canterbury riverbeds are an important habitat for invertebrates such as [[McCann's skink]]  (''[[Oligosoma]] maccanni''), and especially birds such as the very rare [[black stilt]] (''Himantopus novazelandiae'') which remains only in wetlands of the [[Waitaki River]] system. Another endemic species of the Canterbury plains is the [[Canterbury mudfish]] (''Neochanna burrowsius'') which has adapted to burying itself in the mud of riverbeds during the dry season. Finally the [[Otago Peninsula]] is an important breeding ground for the [[New Zealand fur seal]] (''Arctocephalus forsteri'') and [[New Zealand sea lion]] (''Phocarctos hookeri'').

==Threats and preservation==
These grasslands are now mostly utilised as pasture with overgrazing, increased occurrence of fire and urban development all causing damage, while waterways  are subject to alteration. Original wildlife has also been damaged by introduced plants including [[lodgepole pine]] [[broom (shrub)|broom]] and [[Rosa rubiginosa|sweet briar]] while [[hawkweed]] and other weeds can more easily establish themselves when land is overgrazed. [[Introduced species]] of animals that cause damage including [[common brushtail possum|possums]], goats, [[red-necked wallaby]], and [[red deer]] along with predators such as cats, rats, stoats and ferrets. Protection of the tussock grassland is an ongoing concern and a project of the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] working with local communities to establish protected areas and restrict grazing. A number of areas have already been set aside and formal protection is being established in [[Rock and Pillar Range]], [[Lammermoor Range]], Old Man Range, [[Old Woman Range]], [[Pisa Range]] and [[The Remarkables]]. However these are all upland areas and the original habitats of the lowlands are in a much more precarious state having almost entirely disappeared. Separate initiatives have been set up to preserve habitats in the Canterbury lowland riverbeds and their endangered black stilt population.

[[File:GrandCayman.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Grand Cayman showing the locations of (left to right) the IBA sites of Booby Cay, Meagre Bay Pond, Pease Bay and Malportas Pond]]

The '''Central Manrove Wetland''' is a large area of [[mangrove]] dominated [[wetland]] on [[Grand Cayman]], one of the [[Cayman Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It is one of the territory’s [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs).

==Description==
The 3553&amp;nbsp;ha IBA covers about 30% of the island area. It lies to the east of North Sound and includes Meagre Bay Pond, Pease Bay Pond and the islet of Booby Cay. The vegetation consists mainly of [[Rhizophora mangle|red]], [[Laguncularia racemosa|white]] and [[Avicennia germinans|black mangrove]]s, and [[Conocarpus erectus|buttonwood]]. It varies compositionally from stands of dwarf red mangrove on the border with North Sound to a forest of black mangrove on the outer southern boundary.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

There are also areas of seasonally open water as well as scattered islets carrying native [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forest]] vegetation. The IBA includes the saline lake of [[Malportas Pond]] which is separated from the mangrove area and a major site for both resident and wintering [[waterbird]]s.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

===Birds===
The IBA was identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports populations of [[West Indian whistling duck]]s (with 1500 individuals), [[least tern]]s (with 55 breeding pairs), [[white-crowned pigeon]]s and [[Cuban amazon]]s.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Central Mangrove Wetland |accessdate=2014-03-31 |work=Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QE8rvIqH?url=http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chersky Range''' is a chain of [[mountain]]s in northeastern [[Siberia]] between the [[Yana River]] and the [[Indigirka River]]. It generally runs from northwest to southeast through the [[Sakha Republic]] and [[Magadan Oblast]]. The highest peak in the range is [[Peak Pobeda (Chersky Range)|Peak Pobeda]], which is 3,003 meters tall.  The range lies on the boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/news/2003/story11-11-03b.html News Archive - The Earth Institute at Columbia University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chersky mountains, along with the neighboring [[Verkhoyansk Range]], have a moderate effect on the climate of Siberia. The ridges obstruct west-moving air flows, decreasing the amount of snowfall in the plains to the west.

At some time between 1633 and 1642 Poznik Ivanov ascended a tributary of the lower Lena, crossed the Verkhoyansk Range to the upper Yana and then crossed the Chersky Range to the Indigirka.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick March,'Eastern Destiny:Russia in Asia and the North Pacific, 1996, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The range was sighted in 1926 by [[Sergei Obruchev]] ([[Vladimir Obruchev]]'s son) and named by the [[Russian Geographical Society]] after the Polish explorer and geographer [[Ivan Chersky]] (or Jan Czerski).&lt;!-- {{Harvnb|Obruchev|1927|p=469}} --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Tectonics==
The precise nature of the boundary between the [[North American Plate|North American]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s in the area of the Chersky Range is still not fully understood and is the subject of ongoing research.  By the 1980s, the Chersky Range was considered mostly a zone of continental [[rift]]ing where the crust was spreading apart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zQYj5Lz12MIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=Chersky+plate&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6dRfeb6FW1&amp;sig=v2hfhR6Gt5JbMHqki4_y31P4M5M&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 "Geodynamics and Late Cenozoic Evolution of the Asia/Pacific Transitional Zone", in ''Tectonics'', International Geological Congress Staff, 27th International Geological Congress, Published 1984 by VSP]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the current view is that the Chersky Range is mostly an active [[suture zone]], a continental [[convergent plate boundary]], where compression is occurring as the two plates press against each other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8CFiT3qbN5UC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Chersky+plate&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6VieWE4yqN&amp;sig=6GnNvgXoXUyE2WAoGBByAEDxKSw&amp;hl=en ''The Physical Geography of Northern Eurasia'', ed. Maria Shahgedanova, published by Oxford University Press 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is thought to be a point in the Chersky Range where the extensional forces coming from the north change to the compressional forces noted throughout most of the range.  The Chersky Range is also thought to include a geologic [[triple junction]] where the [[Ulakhan Fault]] intersects the suture zone.  Whatever the exact nature of the regional tectonics, the Chersky Range is a seismically active zone.  It connects in the north with the landward extension of the [[Laptev Sea Rift]], itself a continental extension of the Mid-Arctic [[Gakkel Ridge]].

{{nihongo|'''Clarino'''|クラリーノ|}} is a brand name for [[artificial leather]] manufactured by [[Kuraray]] Co., Ltd. of Japan. It is commonly used in gloves, footwear, handbags, and law enforcement duty gear. Versions are made that simulate [[suede]] and top-grain leather.

Being a man-made material, it is washable and retains its softness when wet, unlike natural leather.  After many decades of development, Clarino has achieved performance that exceeds that of leather in some applications, especially where the item may be exposed to water, such as riding saddles.  Top grain leather applications include "[[patent leather]]" shoes that retain high gloss without the need for polish.  During manufacturing it is microscopically perforated to give it breathability similar to that of natural leather. Clarino is based on a non-woven fabric composed of special synthetic fibers that are intertwined three-dimensionally. The material’s softness and suppleness arise from the structure of the non-woven fabric’s special fibers—a superfine fiber construction and tiny cavities.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4264">The term '''environmental credit crunch''' refers to a crisis (which may be [[economic crisis|economic]] in origin) which exposes humanity's inability to indefinitely [[resource consumption|consume]] finite [[natural resources]] in order to sustain economic activity and a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;"From Red to Green", Donovan and Hudson, Earthscan, 2011, introduction. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Green-Paul-Donovan/dp/1849714142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309699674&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often juxtaposed with the [[credit crunch|financial credit crunch]] of 2008.

== The concept of credit in an environmental sense ==

[[Credit (finance)|Credit]] allows a borrower to increase today’s standard of living at the expense of some future standard of living. Thus in financial terms, credit allows a consumer to spend a large amount of money today (raising their standard of living) while reducing their disposable income as the debt is repaid (lowering their future standard of living relative to its potential). In environmental terms, credit can be thought of as raising today’s standard of living through the consumption of finite resources (like [[oil]]). This action will lower the future standard of living, as future consumers will be denied to opportunity to consume.

A credit crunch occurs when the act of using credit is no longer possible, normally as a result of a significant exogenous shock. A [[credit crunch|financial credit crunch]] is normally the result of a sharp decline in the willingness of banks of financial markets to lend money. In environmental terms, the credit crunch comes about as finite resources are depleted significantly.

== Earth Overshoot Day ==

The concept of an environmental credit is aligned to [[Earth Overshoot Day]] (Ecological Debt Day). Earth Overshoot Day is the point in the year at which the world economy moves from generating growth with [[renewable resources]], to generating growth with non-renewable resources. After Earth Overshoot Day, humanity is dependent on environmental credit to sustain its [[standard of living]]. Currently just over a quarter of the year is spent living on environmental credit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldfootprintnetwork.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the concept ==

The use of the term “environmental credit crunch” began to emerge as academics tried to highlight the extent of the potential disruption of environmental depletion in economic terms by using language associated with the ongoing financial credit crunch. The phrase "environmental credit crunch" was used to evoke the scale of the challenge (and the need for a policy response) as early as October 2010, as the financial credit crunch was starting to take hold. The Chartered Institute of Water and Environmental Management in the UK was one of the earliest to adopt the phrase as part of their campaign for dramatic policy action.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industrydirectory.co.uk/environment/news-article.asp?ArticleID=452&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Wild Fund for Nature]] Director General James Leape also used the phrase around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wds-uk.org.uk/article.asp?contentID=&amp;newsID=10&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed examination of the environmental credit crunch and its interaction with the financial credit crunch occurs in “From Red to Green? How the financial credit crunch could bankrupt the environment” by Donovan and Hudson. This argues that the financial credit crunch will have both positive and negative consequences for the simultaneous environmental credit crunch. As a result, policy makers need to be more flexible in their responses to both credit problems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Green-Paul-Donovan/dp/1849714142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309699674&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent book that explores the topics without using the term "environmental credit crunch" specifically is, Richard Heinberg's "The End of Growth: Adapting to Our New Economic Reality". The book opens with a review of the financial crisis and the much discussed financial limits to future growth before addressing the corresponding environmental [[limits to growth]].

'''Ergatocracy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word [[wikt:ἐργάτης|ἐργάτης]], ''ergates'', "worker" and the suffix [[wikt:-cracy|-cracy]], "government") is a type of government dominated by the labour and solidarities similar to [[communist]] beliefs. It refers to a society ruled by the working class. The term was coined by [[Eden Paul|Eden]] and [[Cedar Paul]] in their book ''Creative Revolution: A Study of Communist Ergatocracy''.&lt;ref name=Paul&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Cedar|last2=Paul|first2=Eden|title=Creative revolution:|date=1920|publisher=Thomas Seltzer|location=new York|url=https://archive.org/details/creativerevoluti00paul|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://bogdanovlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/2016-08-14-biggart-bogdanov-kultintern.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8149">The '''Halibut Treaty''' was a 1923 [[Canada|Canadian]]–[[United States|American]] agreement concerning fishing rights in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The treaty established the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) as a mechanism for the joint management of the Pacific [[halibut]] (Hippoglossus stenolepis) which, at that time, was in severe decline. The commission originally had four members but now has six, which are selected from industry and related government agencies. Half the members are Canadian and half are from the United States. The treaty also had a provision for a closed season, so halibut could not be fished during the more dangerous winter months. The treaty has been revised numerous times, often based on recommendations from the IPHC and its team of scientific researchers.

==Background==
In 1907, Canada began to negotiate its own commercial treaties. Prior to that, treaties had been negotiated on behalf of the Canadian government by the British government in [[London]]. However, those treaties negotiated since 1907 had all been signed into agreement by the British ambassador to Canada.{{sfn|MacFarlane|1999|p=51}} In 1916, the [[British Columbia]] government was informed that [[halibut]] stocks were declining in the [[North Pacific Ocean]].{{sfn|Crutchfield|Zellner|2010|p=187}}{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} Large scale halibut fishing began after the opening of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to the Canadian [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Coast]] which allowed the transportation and sale of halibut in [[Eastern Canada]].{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} During [[World War I]] there was increasing cooperation between Canada and United States on trade issues. During the war, the value of halibut increased. Following the war in 1919, the United States and Canada agreed on a closed-season treaty that also included provisions for [[salmon]] fishing. The treaty failed to reach the [[United States Senate]] for approval.{{sfn|Crutchfield|Zellner|2010|p=187}}

The Canadian Prime Minister, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], held the belief that only Canada through [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] would determine its role within the [[British Empire]]. After negotiations over the [[Rush–Bagot Treaty]] failed due to British involvement, King intended to push for greater Canadian autonomy.{{sfn|Levine|2012|p=132}}{{sfn|Hillmer|Granatstein|1994|p=86}} King faced resistance to the treaty from the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Office]].{{sfn|MacFarlane|1999|p=52}} In 1921–22 some in the American halibut industry operated under a voluntary closed season.{{sfn|Crutchfield|Zellner|2010|p=187}}

==1922 proposal==
In 1922, Canada proposed a treaty that dealt only with halibut. Named, the ''Convention for the Preservation of Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean'', this treaty created the International Fisheries Commission (IFC), which was initially intended just as a study institute, not for management.{{sfn|Crutchfield|Zellner|2010|p=187}}{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} The treaty was birthed from Article VII of the previous salmon and halibut treaty.{{sfn|Stacey|1981|pages=Chapter Two}} The treaty proposed a season closed to commercial fishing from 16 November to 15 February. Those that were caught during this period faced penalties up to and including seizure.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} By the 1920s, halibut stocks were noticeably lower to all parties and in 1923, the treaty was ratified by the [[United States Congress]] in 1923. The treaty went into effect in 1927.{{sfn|Crutchfield|Zellner|2010|p=187}} 

In a break with standard empire practice at the time, in March 1923 King demanded to sign the treaty alone, without a British countersignature. The British initially refused but relented when King threatened to send an independent Canadian diplomatic representative to [[Washington, D.C.]]{{sfn|Hillmer|Granatstein|1994|p=86}}{{sfn|Levine|2012|pp=132–133}} The treaty was signed by [[Ernest Lapointe]], the Canadian [[Minister of Marine and Fisheries]] and [[Charles Evan Hughes]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] on 23 March and intended to last five years.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}}{{sfn|Hillmer|Granatstein|1994|p=86}}

== Result ==
It was the first treaty negotiated by and signed only by Canada, independent of Britain. The British had relented as King's intention to send a delegation to Washington, D.C. would have bypassed British authority.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}}  The British had argued correctly, that what Canada had done had been illegal.{{sfn|Holloway|2006|pp=125–26}} However, at the 1923 [[Imperial Conference]] the British believed the Halibut Treaty set a new precedent for the role of the British Dominions, which had emerged following a series of events, among them the [[Chanak Crisis]].{{sfn|Hillmer|Granatstein|1994|pp=87, 95}}

The ratification of the treaty paved the way for further British colony independence, including the [[Balfour Declaration 1926|Balfour Declaration]] at the Imperial Conference in 1926, which recognized that British Dominions were "autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate", and finally the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 which repealed the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act]] and removed the last vestiges of the ability of the British government to create law which applied to its former colonies.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}}{{sfn|Holloway|2006|p=126}}

The lack of regulatory powers given to the IFC led to a continued decrease in halibut stocks.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} In 1930, the commission was expanded to include regulatory powers in a second convention.{{sfn|Crutchfield|Zellner|2010|p=187}} The treaty was reviewed and amended further in 1937, 1953 with a protocol created in 1979. The IFC was renamed the International Pacific Halibut Commission and expanded to six members.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} Following the emergence of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], the Halibut Treaty was put forward as a method to be used by the [[Quebec|provincial government of Quebec]] to earn independence from Canada.{{sfn|Hillmer|Granatstein|1994|p=282}}

Examples of inclined HEO orbits include [[Molniya orbit]]s, named after the [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] Soviet communication satellites which used them, and [[tundra orbit]]s.

Such extremely elongated orbits have the advantage of long dwell times at a point in the sky during the approach to, and descent from, [[apsis|apogee]]. Bodies moving through the long apogee dwell appear to move slowly, and remain at high [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] over high-latitude ground sites for long periods of time. This makes these elliptical orbits useful for [[communications satellite]]s. [[Geostationary orbit]]s cannot serve high latitudes due to their altitude from ground sites being too low.&lt;ref name="fortescue"/&gt;

[[Sirius Satellite Radio]] used inclined HEO orbits, specifically the Tundra orbits, to keep two satellites positioned above [[North America]] while another satellite quickly sweeps through the southern part of its 24-hour orbit. The [[longitude]] above which the satellites dwell at apogee in the small loop remains relatively constant as [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]]. The three separate orbits are spaced equally around the Earth, but share a common [[ground track]].&lt;ref name="castor-tundra"/&gt;

'''Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry''' ('''IRMS''') is a specialization of [[mass spectrometry]], in which mass spectrometric methods are used to measure the relative abundance of [[isotope]]s in a given sample.&lt;ref name="pmid17705258"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paul D, Skrzypek G, Fórizs I |title=Normalization of measured stable isotopic compositions to isotope reference scales - a review |journal=Rapid Commun.

This technique has two different applications in the earth and environmental sciences. The analysis of '[[Stable isotope ratio|stable isotopes]]' is normally concerned with measuring isotopic variations arising from mass-dependent [[isotopic fractionation]] in natural systems. On the other hand, [[radiogenic]] isotope analysis&lt;ref name="Dickin, A.P. 2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dickin, A.P. | year=2005 | title=Radiogenic Isotope Geology | url=http://www.onafarawayday.com/Radiogenic/ | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves measuring the abundances of decay-products of natural radioactivity, and is used in most long-lived [[radiometric dating]] methods.

==Introduction==
The isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) allows the precise measurement of mixtures of naturally occurring isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Townsend, A. (ed)| year=1995 | title=Encyclopaedia of Analytical Science ''Encyclopaedia of Analytical Science'' | publisher=[[Academic Press Limited]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most instruments used for precise determination of isotope ratios are of the magnetic [[sector instrument|sector]] type. This type of analyzer is superior to the [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadrupole]] type in this field of research for two reasons. First, it can be set up for multiple-collector analysis, and second, it gives high-quality 'peak shapes'. Both of these considerations are important for isotope-ratio analysis at very high precision and accuracy.&lt;ref name="Dickin, A.P. 2005"/&gt;

[[Image:Mass Spectrometer Schematic.svg|right|thumb|Schematic of an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer for measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The sector-type instrument designed by [[Alfred Nier]] was such an advance in [[mass spectrometer]] design that this type of instrument is often called the 'Nier type'. In the most general terms the instrument operates by ionizing the sample of interest, accelerating it over a potential in the kilo-volt range, and separating the resulting stream of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).  Beams with lighter ions bend at a smaller radius than beams with heavier ions.  The current of each ion beam is then measured using a '[[Faraday cup]]' or multiplier detector.

Many radiogenic isotope measurements are made by ionization of a solid source, whereas stable isotope measurements of light elements (e.g. H, C, O) are usually made in an instrument with a gas source. In a "multicollector" instrument, the ion collector typically has an array of [[Faraday cup]]s, which allows the simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. B. Bouthitt |author2=K. Garnett |title= The Evolution of the Multicollector in Isotope Ratio Mass Spectromety|journal=Proceedings of the 18th AMZSMS Conference |pages=THO–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gas source mass spectrometry==
Measurement of natural variations in the abundances of stable isotopes of the same element is normally referred to as [[stable isotope]] analysis. This field is of interest because the differences in mass between different isotopes leads to [[isotope fractionation]], causing measurable effects on the isotopic composition of samples, characteristic of their biological or physical history.

As a specific example, the [[hydrogen]] isotope [[deuterium]] (heavy hydrogen) is almost double the mass of the common hydrogen isotope. Water molecules containing the common hydrogen isotope (and the common oxygen isotope, mass 16) have a mass of 18. Water incorporating a deuterium atom has a mass of 19, over 5% heavier. The energy to vaporise the heavy water molecule is higher than that to vaporize the normal water so isotope fractionation occurs during the process of evaporation. Thus a sample of sea water will exhibit a quite detectable isotopic-ratio difference when compared to Antarctic snowfall.

Samples must be introduced to the mass spectrometer as pure gases, achieved through combustion, gas chromatographic feeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Meier-Augenstein, W. | journal =J. Chromatogr. A | year = 1999 | volume = 842 | pages= 351–371 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(98)01057-7 | title =Applied gas chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry }}&lt;/ref&gt; or chemical trapping. By comparing the detected isotopic ratios to a measured [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|standard]], an accurate determination of the isotopic make up of the sample is obtained. For example, carbon isotope ratios are measured relative to the international standard for C. The C standard is produced from a fossil [[belemnite]] found in the [[Peedee Formation]], which is a limestone formed in the Cretaceous period in [[South Carolina]], U.S.A. The fossil is referred to as [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|VPDB]] (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and has &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio of 0.0112372. Oxygen isotope ratios are measured relative the [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|standard]], V-SMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water).

[[Image:Isotope ratio ms.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|Isotope-ratio mass spectrometer used to measure [[stable isotope]] ratios, with gas bench in foreground]]
It is critical that the sample be processed before entering the mass spectrometer so that only a single chemical species enters at a given time.  Generally, samples are combusted or pyrolyzed and the desired gas species (usually hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) is purified by means of traps, filters, catalysts and/or chromatography.

The two most common types of IRMS instruments are continuous flow&lt;ref name="pmid9538528"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brenna JT, Corso TN, Tobias HJ, Caimi RJ |title=High-precision continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry |journal=Mass spectrometry reviews |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=227–58 |year=1997 |pmid=9538528 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1997)16:5&lt;227::AID-MAS1&gt;3.0.CO;2-J|bibcode=1997MSRv...16..227B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dual inlet. In dual inlet IRMS, purified gas obtained from a sample is alternated rapidly with a standard gas (of known isotopic composition) by means of a system of valves, so that a number of comparison measurements are made of both gases.  In continuous flow IRMS, sample preparation occurs immediately before introduction to the IRMS, and the purified gas produced from the sample is measured just once.  The standard gas may be measured before and after the sample or after a series of sample measurements.  While continuous-flow IRMS instruments can achieve higher sample throughput and are more convenient to use than dual inlet instruments, the yielded data is of approximately 10-fold lower precision.

==Static gas mass spectrometry==
A static gas mass spectrometer is one in which a gaseous sample for analysis is fed into the source of the instrument and then left in the source without further supply or pumping throughout the analysis. This method can be used for 'stable isotope' analysis of light gases (as above), but it is particularly used in the isotopic analysis of [[noble gases]] (rare or inert gases) for [[radiometric dating]] or [[isotope geochemistry]]. Important examples are [[argon–argon dating]] and helium isotope analysis.

==Thermal ionization mass spectrometry==
Several of the isotope systems involved in [[radiometric dating]] depend on IRMS using [[thermal ionization]] of a solid sample loaded into the source of the mass spectrometer (hence [[thermal ionization mass spectrometry]], TIMS). These methods include [[rubidium–strontium dating]], [[uranium–lead dating]], [[lead–lead dating]] and [[samarium–neodymium dating]].

When these isotope ratios are measured by TIMS, mass-dependent fractionation occurs as species are emitted by the hot filament. Fractionation occurs due to the excitation of the sample and therefore must be corrected for accurate measurement of the isotope ratio.&lt;ref name=Dickin&gt;Dickin, A.P., 2005. ''Radiogenic Isotope Geology'' 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages of the TIMS method. It has a simple design, is less expensive than other mass spectrometers, and produces stable ion emissions. It requires a stable power supply, and is suitable for species with a low ionization potential, such as [[Strontium]] (Sr), and [[Lead]] (Pb).

The disadvantages of this method stem from the maximum temperature achieved in thermal ionization. The hot filament reaches a temperature of less than 2500 degrees Celsius, leading to the inability to create atomic ions of species with a high ionization potential, such as [[Osmium]] (Os), and [[Tungsten]] (Hf-W).  Although the TIMS method can create molecular ions instead in this case, species with high ionization potential can be analyzed more effectively with MC-ICP-MS.

==Secondary-ion mass spectrometry==

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

An alternative approach used to measure the relative abundance of radiogenic isotopes when working with a solid surface is [[secondary-ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS).  This type of ion-microprobe analysis normally works by focusing a primary (oxygen) ion beam on a sample in order to generate a series of secondary positive ions that can be focused and measured based on their mass/charge ratios.

SIMS is a common method used in U-Pb analysis, as the primary ion beam is used to bombard the surface of a single zircon grain in order to yield a secondary beam of Pb ions.  The Pb ions are analyzed using a double focusing mass spectrometer that comprises both an electrostatic and magnetic analyzer.  This assembly allows the secondary ions to be focused based on their kinetic energy and mass-charge ratio in order to be accurately collected using a series of Faraday cups.&lt;ref&gt;Dickin, A. P. (2005). Radiogenic Isotope Geology 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major issue that arises in SIMS analysis is the generation of isobaric interference between sputtered molecular ions and the ions of interest.  This issue occurs with U–Pb dating as Pb ions have essentially the same mass as HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, R.W. and Long, J.V.P. (1979). High resolution ion microprobe measurement of lead isotopes: variations within single zircons from Lac Seul, Northwestern Ontario. Earth Planet. Sci. lett. 45, 309-325.,&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to overcome this problem, a sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe ([[SHRIMP]]) can be used.  A SHRIMP is a double-focusing mass spectrometer that allows for a large spatial separation between different ion masses based on its relatively large size.  For U-Pb analysis, the SHRIMP allows for the separation of Pb from other interfering molecular ions, such as HfO2+.

==Multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry==
An MC-ICP-MS instrument is a multiple collector mass spectrometer with a plasma source. MC-ICP-MS was developed to improve the precision achievable by ICP-MS during isotope-ratio measurements.  Conventional [[ICP-MS]] analysis uses a quadrupole analyser, which only allows single-collector analysis. Due to the inherent instability of the plasma, this limits the precision of ICP-MS with a quadrupole analyzer to around 1%, which is insufficient for most [[radiogenic]] isotope systems.

Isotope-ratio analysis for [[radiometric dating]] has normally been determined by TIMS. However, some systems (e.g. Hf-W and Lu-Hf) are difficult or impossible to analyse by TIMS, due to the high ionization potential of the elements involved. Therefore, these methods can now be analysed using MC-ICP-MS.

The Ar-ICP produces an ion-beam with a large inherent kinetic energy distribution, which makes the design of the mass-spectrometer somewhat more complex than it is the case for conventional TIMS instruments. First, different from Quadrupole ICP-MS systems, magnetic sector instruments have to operate with a higher acceleration potential (several 1000V) in order to minimize the energy distribution of the ion beam. Modern instruments operate at 6-10kV. 
The radius of deflection of an ion within a magnetic field depends on the kinetic energy and the mass/charge ratio of the ion (strictly, the magnet is a momentum analyzer not just a mass analyzer). Because of the large energy distribution, ions with similar mass/charge ratio can have very different kinetic energies and will thus experience different deflection for the same magnetic field. In practical terms one would see that ions with the same mass/charge ratio focus at different points in space. However, in a mass-spectrometer one wants ions with the same mass/charge ratio to focus at the same point, e.g. where the detector is located. In order to overcome these limitations, commercial MC-ICP-MS are double-focusing instruments. In a double-focusing mass-spectrometer ions are focused due to kinetic energy by the ESA (electro-static-analyzer) and kinetic energy + mass/charge (momentum) in the magnetic field. Magnet and ESA are carefully chosen to match the energy focusing properties of one another and are arranged so that the direction of energy focusing is in opposite directions. To simplify, two components have an energy focus term, when arranged properly, the energy term cancels out and ions with the same mass/charge ratio focus at the same point in space. It is important to note, double-focusing does not reduce the kinetic energy distribution and different kinetic energies are not filtered or homogenized. Double-focusing works for single as well as multi-collector instruments. In single collector instruments ESA and magnet can be arranged in either forward geometry (first ESA then magnet) or reversed geometry (magnet first then ESA), as only point-to-point focusing is required. In multi-collector instruments, only forward geometry (ESA then magnet) is possible due to the array of detectors and the requirements of a focal plane rather than a focal point.

==Accelerator mass spectrometry==

For isotopes occurring at extremely low levels, [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) can be used.  For example, the decay rate of the radioisotope &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is widely used to date organic materials, but this approach is limited to relatively large samples no more than a few thousand years old.  AMS extended the range of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C dating to about 60,000 years BP, and is about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times more sensitive than conventional IRMS.

AMS works by accelerating negative ions through a large (mega-volt) potential, followed by charge exchange and acceleration back to ground. During charge exchange, interfering species can be effectively removed. In addition, the high energy of the beam allows the use of energy-loss detectors, that can distinguish between species with the same mass/charge ratio. Together, these processes allow the analysis of extreme isotope ratios above 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Moving wire IRMS==
&lt;!-- Note that some redirect pages link to this section - please do not rename it without modifying these!--&gt;
Moving wire IRMS is useful for analyzing [[Carbon-13]] ratios of compounds in a solution, such as after purification by [[liquid chromatography]].  The solution (or outflow from the chromatography) is dried onto a nickel or stainless steel wire.  After the residue is deposited on the wire, it enters a furnace where the sample is converted to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by combustion.  The gas stream finally enters a capillary, is dried, ionized, and analyzed.&lt;ref name='brenna_1996'&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. | year = 1996 |author1=Caimi, R.

'''Krishna Pushkaralu''' is a festival of [[Krishna River|River Krishna]] which normally occurs once in every 12 years and is celebrated with much glory. The [[Pushkaram]] is observed for a period  of 12 days from the time of entry of [[Jupiter]] into [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (''Kanya'' rasi). The festival is "theoretically" observed throughout the twelve months that the planet remains in that sign, but the first 12 days are considered most sacred as per the beliefs of Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.krishnapushkaram.com/ |title= All about Krishna Pushkaralu 2016 |date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pushkaram has been an age old practice in southern states Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. In 2016, the celebration started on 12 August and ended on 23 August.

'''Layered double hydroxides''' ('''LDH''') are a class of [[ionic solid]]s characterized by a layered structure with the generic layer sequence [AcB Z AcB]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where c represents layers of metal [[cations]], A and B are layers of [[hydroxide]] ({{chem|H|O|-}}) [[anions]], and Z are layers of other anions and neutral molecules (such as water).&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt;  Lateral offsets between the layers may result in longer repeating periods.

The intercalated anions (Z) are weakly bound, often [[ion exchange|exchangeable]]; their [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] properties have scientific and commercial interest.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Aamir I.; O'Hare, Dermot "Intercalation chemistry of layered double hydroxides: recent developments and applications" Journal of Materials Chemistry (2002), 12(11), 3191-3198. {{DOI| 10.1039/b204076j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDHs occur in nature as [[mineral]]s, as byproducts of metabolism of certain bacteria, and also unintentionally in man-made contexts, such as the products of [[corrosion]] of metal objects.

==Structure and formulas==

LDHs can be seen as derived from [[hydroxide]]s of [[Valence (chemistry)|divalent]] cations (d) with the [[brucite]] (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layer structure [AdB AdB]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, by cation (c) replacement (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; → Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), or by cation [[oxidation]] (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of [[green rust]], Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), in the metallic divalent (d) cation layers, so as to give them an excess positive [[electric charge]]; and intercalation of extra anion layers (Z) between the hydroxide layers (A,B) to neutralize that charge, resulting in the structure [AcB Z AcB]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. LDHs can be formed with a wide variety of anions in the intercalated layers (Z), such as Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}, CO{{su|b=3|p=2−}}, SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}} and SeO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}.

This structure is unusual in solid state chemistry, since many materials with similar structure (such as [[montmorillonite]] and other [[clay mineral]]s) have negatively charged main metal layers (c) and positive ions in the intercalated layers (Z).&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, David G.; Slade, Robert C. T. "Structural aspects of layered double hydroxides" Structure and Bonding  2006, vol. 119, 1-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most studied class of LDHs, the positive layer (c) consists of divalent and trivalent cations, and can be represented by the formula

: [{{chem|M|2+|1-x|N|3+|x}}({{chem|HO|-}})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;x+&lt;/sup&gt; [(X&lt;sup&gt;n−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x/n&lt;/sub&gt; · ''y''{{chem|H|2|O}}]&lt;sup&gt;x-&lt;/sup&gt;,

where X&lt;sup&gt;n−&lt;/sup&gt; is the intercalating anion (or anions).

Most commonly, {{chem|M|2+}} = Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and {{chem|N|3+}} is another trivalent cation, possibly of the same element as M.  Fixed-composition phases have been shown to exist over the range 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.33. However, phases with variable x hare also known, and in some cases, x &gt; 0.5.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ima-cnmnc/Mills%20et%20al%202012%20hydrotalcite%20nomenclature.pdf|title=IMA Nomenclature Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another class of LDH is known where the main metal layer (c) consists of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, with the general formula

: [{{chem|Li|+|Al|3+|2}}({{chem|HO|-}})&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [{{chem|Li|+|Al|3+|2}}(X&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt;) ∙ ''y''{{chem|H|2|O}}]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- CHECK THIS--&gt;,

where X&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; represents one or more anions with total charge −6. The value of ''y'' is usually between 0.5 and 4.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In some cases, the pH value of the solution used during the synthesis and the high drying temperature of the LDH can eliminate the presence of the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; groups in the LDH. For example, in the synthesis of the (BiO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compound, a low pH value of the aqueous solution or higher annealing temperature of solid can induce the formation of (BiO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is thermodynamically more stable than the LDH compound, by exchanging OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; groups by CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ortiz-Quiñonez |first1=J.L. |last2=Vega-Verduga |first2=C. |last3=Díaz |first3=D. |last4=Zumeta-Dubé |first4=I. |title=Transformation of Bismuth and β-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Nanoparticles into (BiO)2CO3 and (BiO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: The Role of Halloysite Nanotubes and “Sunlight” on the Crystal Shape and Size |journal=Crystal Growth and  Design |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=4334-4346 |doi=10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00177 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The anions located in the [[interlayer]] regions can be replaced easily, in general. A wide variety of anions may be incorporated, ranging from simple inorganic anions (e.g. CO{{su|b=3|p=2−}}) through organic anions (e.g. benzoate, succinate) to complex biomolecules, including DNA. This has led to an intense interest in the use of LDH [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalates]] for advanced applications. Drug molecules such as [[ibuprofen]] may be intercalated; the resulting [[nanocomposite]]s have potential for use in controlled release systems, which could reduce the frequency of doses of medication needed to treat a disorder. Further effort has been expended on the intercalation of agrochemicals, such as the chlorophenoxyacetates, and important organic [[synthon]]s, such as terephthalate and nitrophenols. Agrochemical intercalates are of interest because of the potential to use LDHs to remove agrochemicals from polluted water, reducing the likelihood of [[eutrophication]].

LDHs exhibit shape-selective intercalation properties. For instance, treating LiAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl with a 50:50 mixture of terephthalate (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and phthalate  (1,2-benzenedicarboxylate) results in intercalation of the 1,4-isomer with almost 100% preference. The selective intercalation of ions such as benzenedicarboxylates and [[nitrophenol]]s has importance because these are produced in isomeric mixtures from crude oil residues, and it is often desirable to isolate a single form, for instance in the production of polymers.

LDH-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intercalates are used in suspensions for self-cleaning of surfaces (especially for materials in cultural heritage), because of photo-catalytic properties of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and good compatibility of LDHs with inorganic materials.

==Minerals==
Naturally occurring (i.e., mineralogical) examples of LDH are classified as members of the hydrotalcite supergroup, named after the Mg-Al carbonate [[hydrotalcite]], which is the longest-known example of a natural LDH phase. More than 40 mineral species are known to fall within this supergroup.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; The dominant divalent cations, M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, that have been reported in hydrotalcite supergroup minerals are: Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn; the dominant trivalent cations, M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, are:  Al, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni. The most common intercalated anions are [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Sb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; have also been reported. Some species contain intercalated cationic or neutral complexes such as [Na(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or [MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[International Mineralogical Association]]'s 2012 report on hydrotalcite supergroup nomenclature defines eight groups within the supergroup on the basis of a combination of criteria. These groups are:
# the [[hydrotalcite]] group, with M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; = 3:1 (layer spacing ~7.8 Å);  
# the [[quintinite]] group, with M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; = 2:1 (layer spacing ~7.8 Å);  
# the [[fougèrite]] group of natural '[[green rust]]' phases, with M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; = Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; = Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in a range of ratios, and with O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; replacing OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in the brucite module to maintain charge balance (layer spacing ~7.8 Å);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Génin|first=J.-M. R.|last2=Mills|first2=S. J.|last3=Christy|first3=A. G.|last4=Guérin|first4=O.|last5=Herbillon|first5=A.

# the [[woodwardite]] group, with variable M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and interlayer [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to an expanded layer spacing of ~8.9 Å; 
# the [[cualstibite]] group, with interlayer [Sb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and a layer spacing of ~9.7 Å; 
# the [[glaucocerinite]] group, with interlayer [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; as in the woodwardite group, and with additional interlayer H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules that further expand the layer spacing to ~11 Å; 
# the [[wermlandite]] group, with a layer spacing of ~11 Å, in which cationic complexes occur with anions between the brucite-like layers; and 
# the [[hydrocalumite]] group, with M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; = Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; = Al, which contains brucite-like layers in which the Ca:Al ratio is 2:1 and the large cation, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, is coordinated to a seventh ligand of ‘interlayer’ water.

The IMA Report &lt;ref name=Report/&gt; also presents a concise systematic nomenclature for synthetic LDH phases that are not eligible for a mineral name. This uses the prefix LDH, and characterises components by the numbers of the octahedral cation species in the chemical formula, the interlayer anion, and the Ramsdell [[polytype]] symbol (number of layers in the repeat of the structure, and crystal system). For example, the 3''R'' polytype of Mg&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[hydrotalcite]] ''sensu stricto'') is described by "LDH 6Mg2Al·CO3-3''R''". This simplified nomenclature does not capture all the possible types of structural complexity in LDH materials. Elsewhere, the Report discusses examples of:
# long-range order of different cations within a brucite-like layer, which may produce sharp superstructure peaks in diffraction patterns and ''a'' and ''b'' periodicities that are multiples of the basic 3 Å repeat, or short-range order producing diffuse scattering;
# the wide variety of ''c'' periodicities that can occur due to relative displacements or rotations of the brucite-like layers, producing multiple [[polytype]]s with the same compositions, intergrowths of polytypes and variable degrees  of stacking disorder;
# different periodicities arising from order of different interlayer species, either within an interlayer or by alternation of different anion types from interlayer to interlayer.

The following sortable table comprises the '''23 [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summits]] of [[Central America]]'''.  Each of these peaks has at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;  This article defines Central America as the seven nations of [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama|Panamá]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44733">This is a '''list of herbaria''', organized first by continent where the herbarium is located, then within each continent by size of the collection. A [[herbarium]] (''plural'' "herbaria") is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens. These specimens may be whole plants or plant parts: these will usually be in a dried form, mounted on a sheet, but depending upon the material may also be kept in alcohol or other preservative. The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]] and in [[phycology]] to describe a collection of [[algae]].

To preserve their form and color, plants collected in the field are spread flat on sheets of newsprint and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper. The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labeled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned and the case disinfected.

Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets. Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. Herbaria also preserve an historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time. In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area, or may become extinct altogether. In such cases, specimens preserved in an herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution. Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

[[File:Hermes Maia Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2304.jpg|thumb|Hermes and Maia, detail from an [[Red-figure pottery|Attic red-figure]] [[amphora]] (''c.'' 500 BC)]]

'''Maia'''&lt;ref&gt;The alternate spelling ''Maja'' represents the [[wikt:intervocalic|intervocalic]] ''i'' as ''j'', pronounced similarly to an initial ''y'' in English; hence Latin ''maior'', "greater," in English became "major."&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|.|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|.|ə}}; {{lang-el|Μαῖα}}; {{lang-la|Maia}}), in [[ancient Greek religion]], is one of the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]] and the mother of [[Hermes]].

Maia is the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 938.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]] the [[Oceanid]],&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'']]  3.10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the oldest of the seven Pleiades.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheke'' 3.10.2; [[Aratus]], ''Phainomena'' 255–263. Maia is the only one of the Pleiades named by these two sources to appear also in the rather idiosyncratic list given by the [[Scholiast]] to [[Theocritus]] (13.25), who says they were the daughters of the [[Amazons]]; see the note of [[J.G. Frazer]] in his 1921 [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition and translation of what was then assumed to be the work of [[Apollodorus of Athens]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They were born on  Mount [[Mount Kyllini|Cyllene]] in [[Arcadia]],&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheke'' 3.10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and are sometimes called mountain [[nymph]]s, ''[[oread]]s''; [[Simonides of Ceos]] sang of "mountain Maia" ''(Maiados oureias)'' "of the lovely black eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], Fragment 555.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were daughters of Atlas, they were also called the Atlantides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] 3.60.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mother of Hermes==
[[File:Cup Mercury Maia CdM.jpg|thumb|Mercury and Maia&lt;ref&gt;Although the identification of Mercury is secure, based on the presence of the [[caduceus]], the one-shouldered garment called the ''[[chlamys]]'', and his winged head, the female figure has been identified variously. The cup is part of the [[Berthouville Treasure]], found within a [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]] temple precinct; see Lise Vogel, ''The Column of Antoninus Pius'', Loeb Classical Library Monograph (Harvard University Press, 1973), p. 79 f., and Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1984, 2005, p. 119 f. In [[Gaul]], Mercury's regular consort is one of the Celtic goddesses, usually [[Rosmerta]]. The [[Rosmerta#Etymology|etymology of Rosmerta's name]] as "Great Provider" suggests a theology compatible with that of Maia "the Great". The consort on the cup has also been identified as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] by M. Chabouillet, ''Catalogue général et raisonné des camées et pierres gravées de la Bibliothéque Impériale'', Paris 1858, p. 449. Maia is suggested by the concomitant discovery of a silver bust, not always considered part of the hoard proper but more securely identified as Maia and connected to Rosmerta; see E. Babelon, ''Revue archéologique'' 24 (1914), pp. 182–190, as summarized in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 19 (1915), p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; inside a silver cup dedicated by the freedman P. Aelius Eutychus (late 2nd century AD), from a [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]] religious site]]

According to the [[Homeric hymn|Homeric ''Hymn to Hermes'']], [[Zeus]] in the dead of night secretly begot [[Hermes]] upon Maia, who avoided the company of the gods, in a cave of Cyllene. After giving birth to the baby, Maia wrapped him in blankets and went to sleep.  The rapidly maturing infant Hermes crawled away to [[Thessaly]], where by nightfall of his first day he stole some of his half-brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]'s cattle and invented the [[lyre]] from a tortoise shell. Maia refused to believe Apollo when he claimed that Hermes was the thief, and Zeus then sided with Apollo. Finally, Apollo exchanged the cattle for the lyre, which became one of his identifying attributes.

==As nurturer==
Maia also raised the infant [[Arcas]], the child of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] with Zeus. Wronged by the love affair, Zeus' wife [[Hera]] in a jealous rage had transformed Callisto into a bear. Arcas is the [[eponym]] of [[Arcadia]], where Maia was born.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheke'' 3.101.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Callisto and Arcas, like that of the Pleiades, is an ''[[aition]]'' for a stellar formation, the constellations [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]], the Great and Little Bear.

Her name is related to μαῖα (''maia''), an honorific term for older women related to μήτηρ (''mētēr'') 'mother'.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} ''Maia'' also means "[[midwife]]" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian Nutton, ''Ancient Medicine'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Maia==
[[File:Bartholomäus Spranger 011.jpg|thumb|''Vulcan and Maia'' (1585) by [[Bartholomäus Spranger]]]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], Maia embodied the concept of growth,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome: Religion in Everyday Life from Archaic to Imperial Times'', Routledge, 2001, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; as her name was thought to be related to the [[comparative adjective]] ''maius, maior'' "larger, greater". Originally, she may have been a [[homonym]] independent of the Greek Maia, whose myths she absorbed through the [[Hellenization]] of [[Latin literature]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'', Blackwell, 1996, p. 270 (originally published in French in 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an archaic Roman prayer,&lt;ref&gt;Preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 13.10.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Maia appears as an attribute of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], in an [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocational]] list of male deities paired with female abstractions representing some aspect of their functionality. She was explicitly identified with Earth (''[[Terra (mythology)|Terra]]'', the [[interpretatio graeca|Roman counterpart]] of Gaia) and the Good Goddess (''[[Bona Dea]]'') in at least one tradition.&lt;ref&gt;By [[Cornelius Labeo]], as recorded by Macrobius, 1.12.20; H.H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'', Brill, 1989, pp. 232, 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Her identity became theologically intertwined also with the goddesses [[Faunus|Fauna]], [[Ops]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Cardea|Carna]], and the [[Magna Mater]] ("Great Goddess", referring to the Roman form of Cybele but also a cult title for Maia), as discussed at some length by the [[late antiquity|late]] [[antiquarian]] writer [[Macrobius]].&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.16–33.&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment was probably influenced by the 1st-century BC scholar [[Varro]], who tended to resolve a great number of goddesses into one original "Terra".&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, ''Bona Dea'', p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; The association with Juno, whose [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]] counterpart was [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], is suggested again by the inscription ''Uni Mae'' on the [[Piacenza Liver]].&lt;ref&gt;In Mario Torelli's diagram of this [[haruspice|haruspicial]] object, the names ''Uni'' and ''Mae'' appear together in a cell on the edge of the liver; see Nancy Thompson de Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'', University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006, p. 44 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAtdzbV-yIC&amp;dq=piacenza+liver+uni+etruscan&amp;q=%22uni%2Fmae%3B5%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22uni%2Fmae%3B5%22&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The month of May (Latin ''Maius'') was supposedly named for Maia, though ancient etymologists also connected it to the ''maiores'' "ancestors", again from the adjective ''maius, maior'', meaning those who are "greater" in terms of generational precedence. On the first day of May, the [[Lares|Lares Praestites]] were honored as [[tutelary deity|protectors of the city]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' v. 73; Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[flamen]] of Vulcan sacrificed a pregnant sow to Maia, a customary offering to an earth goddess&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.20; [[Juvenal]], ''Satires'' ii.86; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 68.&lt;/ref&gt; that reiterates the link between Vulcan and Maia in the archaic prayer formula. In [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (Hermes), the son of Maia, was the father of the twin Lares, a genealogy that sheds light on the collocation of ceremonies on the [[Kalends]] of May.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, the [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]], Mercury was honored as a patron of merchants and increaser of profit (through an etymological connection with ''merx, merces'', "goods, merchandise"), another possible connection with Maia his mother as a goddess who promoted growth.&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'', p. 70 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}
The '''mantle''' is a layer inside a [[planetary body]] bounded below by a [[Planetary core|core]] and above by a [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. Mantles are made of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[Volatiles|ice]]s, and are generally the largest and most massive layer of the planetary body. Mantles are characteristic of planetary bodies that have undergone [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] by [[density]].  All [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]] (including [[Earth]]), a number of [[Asteroid|asteroids]], and some planetary [[Natural satellite|moons]] have mantles.

== Earth's mantle ==
{{See also|Structure of the Earth}}[[File:Earth poster.svg|thumb|350px|The internal structure of Earth]]
The Earth's mantle is a layer of [[Silicate minerals|silicate rock]] between the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the [[outer core]]. Its mass of 4.01&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg is 67% the mass of the Earth.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65171709|title=The planetary scientist's companion|last=Katharina.|first=Lodders,|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fegley, Bruce.|isbn=1423759834|location=New York|oclc=65171709}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a thickness of {{convert|2900|km|mi}}&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; making up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is predominantly solid but in [[Geologic time scale|geological time]] it behaves as a [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[fluid]]. Partial melting of the mantle at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid-ocean ridges]] produces [[oceanic crust]], and partial melting of the mantle at [[subduction zones]] produces [[continental crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/40229/what-is-the-earths-mantle-made-of/|title=What is the Earth's Mantle Made Of? - Universe Today|date=2016-03-26|work=Universe Today|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure ===

==== Rheological structure ====
The Earth's mantle is divided into two major [[Rheology|rheological]] layers: the rigid [[lithosphere]] comprising the uppermost mantle, and the less viscous [[asthenosphere]], separated by the [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary|lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary]]. Lithosphere underlying ocean crust has a thickness of around 100 km, whereas lithosphere underlying continental crust generally has a thickness of 150-200 km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897946590|title=Earth: Portrait of a Planet|last=Stephen|first=Marshak|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2015|isbn=9780393937503|edition=5th|location=New York|pages=|oclc=897946590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lithosphere and overlying [[Crust (geology)|crust]] make up [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], which move over the asthenosphere.

==== Seismic structure ====
The Earth's mantle is divided into three major layers defined by sudden changes in [[Seismic wave|seismic velocity:]]

* the upper mantle (starting at the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho, or base of the crust]] around {{convert|7|to|35|km|abbr=on}} downward to {{convert|410|km|abbr=on}})&lt;ref&gt;The location of the base of the crust varies from approximately 10 to 70 kilometers. [[Oceanic crust]] is generally less than 10 kilometers thick. "Standard" continental crust is around 35 kilometers thick, and the large crustal root under the [[Tibetan Plateau]] is approximately 70 kilometers thick.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Mantle transition zone|transition zone]] (approximately {{convert|410|–|660|km|abbr=on|disp=or}})
* the lower mantle (approximately {{convert|660|–|2891|km|abbr=on|disp=or}})

The lower ~200 km of the lower mantle constitutes the D" (D-double-prime) layer, a region with anomalous seismic properties. This region also contains [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces|LLSVPs]] and [[Ultra low velocity zone|ULVZs]].

==== Mineralogical structure ====
The top of the mantle is defined by a sudden increase in seismic velocity, which was first noted by [[Andrija Mohorovičić]] in 1909; this boundary is now referred to as the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]] or "Moho".&lt;ref name="today's mantle2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/library/weekly/aa031598.htm|title=Today's Mantle: a guided tour|last=Alden|first=Andrew|date=2007|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moho2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istrianet.org/istria/illustri/mohorovicic/|title=Istria on the Internet – Prominent Istrians – Andrija Mohorovicic|date=2007|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper mantle is dominantly [[peridotite]], composed primarily of variable proportions of the minerals [[olivine]], [[Pyroxene|clinopyroxene]], [[orthopyroxene]], and an aluminous phase. The aluminous phase is [[plagioclase]] in the uppermost mantle, then [[spinel]], and then [[garnet]] below ~100 km. Gradually through the upper mantle, pyroxenes become less stable and transform into [[Majorite|majoritic garnet]].

At the top of the transition zone, olivine undergoes isochemical phase transitions to [[wadsleyite]] and [[ringwoodite]]. Unlike nominally anhydrous olivine, these high-pressure olivine polymorphs have a large capacity to store water in their crystal structure. This has led to the hypothesis that the transition zone may host a large quantity of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bercovici|first=David|last2=Karato|first2=Shun-ichiro|date=September 2003|title=Whole-mantle convection and the transition-zone water filter|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature01918|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=425|issue=6953|pages=39–44|doi=10.1038/nature01918|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the transition zone, ringwoodite decomposes into bridgmanite (formerly called magnesium silicate perovskite), and ferropericlase. Garnet also becomes unstable at or slightly below the base of the transition zone.

The lower mantle is composed primarily of [[bridgmanite]] and [[ferropericlase]], with minor amounts of [[silicate perovskite|calcium perovskite]], calcium-ferrite structured oxide, and [[stishovite]]. In the lowermost ~200 km of the mantle, bridgmanite isochemically transforms into [[post-perovskite]].

=== Composition ===
The chemical composition of the mantle is difficult to determine with a high degree of certainty because it is largely inaccessible. Rare exposures of mantle rocks occur in [[Ophiolite|ophiolites]], where sections of oceanic lithosphere have been [[Obduction|obducted]] onto a continent. Mantle rocks are also sampled as [[Xenolith|xenoliths]] within [[Basalt|basalts]] or [[Kimberlite|kimberlites]].

Most estimates of the mantle composition are based on rocks that sample only the uppermost mantle. There is debate as to whether the rest of the mantle, especially the lower mantle, has the same bulk composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Motohiko|last2=Ohishi|first2=Yasuo|last3=Hirao|first3=Naohisa|last4=Hirose|first4=Kei|date=May 2012|title=A perovskitic lower mantle inferred from high-pressure, high-temperature sound velocity data|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature11004|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=485|issue=7396|pages=90–94|doi=10.1038/nature11004|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mantle's composition has changed through the Earth's history due to the extraction of magma that solidified to form oceanic crust and continental crust.

=== Temperature and pressure ===
In the mantle, temperatures range from approximately {{convert|200|C|F||}} at the upper boundary with the crust to approximately {{convert|4000|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at the core-mantle boundary.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65171709|title=The planetary scientist's companion|last=Katharina.|first=Lodders,|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fegley, Bruce.|isbn=1423759834|location=New York|oclc=65171709}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[geothermal gradient]] of the mantle increases rapidly in the thermal [[boundary layers]] at the top and bottom of the mantle, and increases gradually through the interior of the mantle.&lt;ref name="turcotte2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Geodynamics|last=Turcotte|first=DL|author2=Schubert, G|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66624-4|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge, England, UK|pages=136–7|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the higher temperatures far exceed the [[Melting point|melting points]] of the mantle rocks at the surface (about 1200&amp;nbsp;°C for representative [[peridotite]]), the mantle is almost exclusively solid.&lt;ref name="louie2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crack.seismo.unr.edu/ftp/pub/louie/class/100/interior.html|title=Earth's Interior|last=Louie|first=J.|date=1996|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enormous [[lithostatic pressure]] exerted on the mantle prevents [[melting]], because the temperature at which melting begins (the [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]]) increases with pressure.

The pressure in the mantle increases from a few kbar at the Moho to 1390 kbar (139 GPa) at the core-mantle boundary&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;.

=== Movement ===
{{main|Mantle convection}}
[[File:Convection-snapshot.png|thumb|right|220px|This figure is a snapshot of one time-step in a model of mantle convection. Colors closer to red are hot areas and colors closer to blue are cold areas. In this figure, heat received at the [[core–mantle boundary]] results in thermal expansion of the material at the bottom of the model, reducing its density and causing it to send plumes of hot material upwards. Likewise, cooling of material at the surface results in its sinking.]]

Because of the temperature difference between the Earth's surface and outer core and the ability of the crystalline rocks at high pressure and temperature to undergo slow, creeping, viscous-like deformation over millions of years, there is a [[convection|convective]] material circulation in the mantle.&lt;ref name="today's mantle"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/library/weekly/aa031598.htm|title=Today's Mantle: a guided tour|last=Alden|first=Andrew|date=2007|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Hot material [[mantle plume|upwells]], while cooler (and heavier) material sinks downward. Downward motion of material occurs at [[convergent plate boundary|convergent plate boundaries]] called [[subduction zones]]. Locations on the surface that lie over plumes are predicted to have [[Dynamic topography|high elevation]] (because of the buoyancy of the hotter, less-dense plume beneath) and to exhibit [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] [[volcanism]]. The volcanism often attributed to deep mantle plumes is alternatively explained by passive extension of the crust, permitting magma to leak to the surface (the "Plate" hypothesis).&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G.R. |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[convection]] of the Earth's mantle is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] process (in the sense of fluid dynamics), which is thought to be an integral part of the motion of plates. Plate motion should not be confused with [[continental drift]] which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed continental drift is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth's mantle.

Although there is a tendency to larger viscosity at greater depth, this relation is far from linear and shows layers with dramatically decreased viscosity, in particular in the upper mantle and at the boundary with the core.&lt;ref name="jena"&gt;Walzer, Uwe; Hendel, Roland and Baumgardner, John. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070611192838/http://www.igw.uni-jena.de/geodyn/poster2.html Mantle Viscosity and the Thickness of the Convective Downwellings]. igw.uni-jena.de&lt;/ref&gt; The mantle within about {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} above the [[core–mantle boundary]] appears to have distinctly different seismic properties than the mantle at slightly shallower depths; this unusual mantle region just above the core is called '''D&amp;Prime;''' ("D double-prime"), a nomenclature introduced over 50 years ago by the geophysicist [[Keith Edward Bullen|Keith Bullen]].&lt;ref name="bullen"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; '''D&amp;Prime;''' may consist of material from subducted [[Slab (geology)|slabs]] that descended and came to rest at the [[core–mantle boundary]] and/or from a new mineral polymorph discovered in perovskite called [[post-perovskite]].

Earthquakes at shallow depths are a result of strike-slip faulting; however, below about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} the hot, high pressure conditions ought to inhibit further seismicity. The mantle is considered to be viscous and incapable of brittle faulting. However, in subduction zones, earthquakes are observed down to {{convert|670|km|abbr=on}}. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including dehydration, thermal runaway, and phase change.
The geothermal gradient can be lowered where cool material from the surface sinks downward, increasing the strength of the surrounding mantle, and allowing earthquakes to occur down to a depth of {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|670|km|abbr=on}}.

The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is ~136 G[[pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1.4 million [[atmospheric pressure|atm]]).&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiTuaX_1TU0C&amp;pg=PA354|title=Mineralogical Applications of Crystal Field Theory|last=Burns|first=Roger George|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43077-1|page=354|accessdate=2007-12-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure increases as depth increases, since the material beneath has to support the weight of all the material above it. The entire mantle, however, is thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales, with permanent plastic deformation accommodated by the movement of point, line, and/or planar defects through the solid crystals composing the mantle. Estimates for the viscosity of the upper mantle range between 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal second|Pa·s]], depending on depth,&lt;ref name="jena" /&gt; temperature, composition, state of stress, and numerous other factors. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly. However, when large forces are applied to the uppermost mantle it can become weaker, and this effect is thought to be important in allowing the formation of [[tectonic plate]] boundaries.

=== Exploration ===
Exploration of the mantle is generally conducted at the seabed rather than on land because of the relative thinness of the oceanic crust as compared to the significantly thicker continental crust.

The first attempt at mantle exploration, known as [[Project Mohole]], was abandoned in 1966 after repeated failures and cost over-runs. The deepest penetration was approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In 2005 an oceanic borehole reached {{convert|1416|m|ft}} below the sea floor from the ocean drilling vessel ''[[JOIDES Resolution]]''.

On 5 March 2007, a team of scientists on board the [[RRS James Cook|RRS ''James Cook'']] embarked on a voyage to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle lies exposed without any crust covering, midway between the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The exposed site lies approximately three kilometres beneath the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | title=Scientists to study gash on Atlantic seafloor | date=2007-03-01 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17407745/ | work =[[Msnbc.com]] | accessdate = 2008-03-16 | quote = A team of scientists will embark on a voyage next week to study an “open wound” on the Atlantic seafloor where the Earth’s deep interior lies exposed without any crust covering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Earth's Crust Missing In Mid-Atlantic | date=2007-03-02 | publisher= | url =https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070301103112.htm | work =[[Science Daily]] | quote = Cardiff University scientists will shortly set sail (March 5) to investigate a startling discovery in the depths of the Atlantic.| accessdate = 2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A relatively difficult attempt to retrieve samples from the Earth's mantle was scheduled for later in 2007.&lt;ref name="chikyu"&gt;{{cite news | title=Japan hopes to predict 'Big One' with journey to center of Earth | date=2005-12-15 | url =http://www.physorg.com/news9073.html | work =[[PhysOrg.com]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-16 | quote = An ambitious Japanese-led project to dig deeper into the Earth's surface than ever before will be a breakthrough in detecting earthquakes including Tokyo's dreaded "Big One," officials said Thursday. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051219103451/http://www.physorg.com/news9073.html |archivedate = 2005-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chikyu Hakken mission attempted to use the Japanese vessel ''[[Chikyū]]'' to drill up to {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seabed. This is nearly three times as deep as preceding oceanic drillings.

A novel method of exploring the uppermost few hundred kilometres of the Earth was proposed in 2005, consisting of a small, dense, heat-generating probe which melts its way down through the crust and mantle while its position and progress are tracked by acoustic signals generated in the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Ojovan M.I., Gibb F.G.F., Poluektov P.P., Emets E.P. 2005.

Atomic Energy, 99, 556–562&lt;/ref&gt; The probe consists of an outer sphere of [[tungsten]] about one metre in diameter with a [[cobalt-60]] interior acting as a radioactive heat source. It was calculated that such a probe will reach the oceanic [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho]] in less than 6 months and attain minimum depths of well over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} in a few decades beneath both oceanic and continental lithosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Ojovan M.I., Gibb F.G.F.

Exploration can also be aided through computer simulations of the evolution of the mantle. In 2009, a [[supercomputer]] application provided new insight into the distribution of mineral deposits, especially isotopes of iron, from when the mantle developed 4.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;University of California – Davis (2009-06-15).

In [[geology]], a '''mazuku''' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''evil wind'') is a pocket of [[carbon dioxide]]–rich air that can be lethal to any human or animal life inside.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platetectonics.com/article.asp?a=86&amp;c=2|title=Goma Lives in Fear of Volcano's Next Eruption; 2004 |last=Walsh |first=Declan |date=January 2004 |work=The Sunday Independent|publisher=Plate Tectonics|accessdate=23 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326020437/http://www.platetectonics.com/article.asp?a=86&amp;c=2 |archivedate=26 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazuku are created when carbon dioxide accumulates in pockets low to the ground.&lt;ref name=nova&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Volcano Under the City |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3215_volcanoc.html |series=NOVA |serieslink=Nova (TV series) |credits= |network=PBS |station= |airdate=1 November 2005 |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is heavier than air, which causes it to flow downhill, hugging the ground like a low fog, and is also undetectable by human [[olfactory]] or visual senses in most conditions.

Mazuku can be related to volcanic activity or to a natural disaster known as a [[limnic eruption]]. In the first case, noxious gases are released from the Earth's crust into the atmosphere, whereas in the second case the gases originate deep in a lake and boil rapidly to the surface. Because of their nature as sporadic and subtle events, few mazuku have been recorded, but there is a growing understanding of them based on historical and fossil evidence.

== Effects ==
[[File:Cow killed by Lake Nyos gasses.jpg|thumbnail|right|A cow killed by the release of a mazuku from [[Lake Nyos]], [[Cameroon]] ]]

Mazuku can cause a variety of effects on flora and fauna in the regions in which they occur depending on the composition and concentration of the gases that they consist of. Massive clouds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as those released from lakes in Cameroon in the 1980s, can cause widespread devastation of human and wildlife populations. However, they may have little or no effect on local vegetation. If the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is high enough, and maintained in a prolonged outgassing event, even vegetation can succumb to the mazuku, as is the case on [[Mammoth Mountain]] in [[California]], United States, where deforestation has occurred as well as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; poisonings, including the deaths of three ski patrollers in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Covarrubias | first = Amanda |author2=Doug Smith | title = 3 Die in Mammoth Ski Patrol Accident | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2006-06-07 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/07/local/me-mammoth7 | accessdate = 2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related events such as pyroclastic flows or limnic eruptions can cause the temperature of a mazuku to vary considerably from the natural environment. Reports of frostbite, condensation, and other temperature changes can occur.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/killerlakestrans.shtml BBC Horizon programme "Killer Lakes"]&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are often accompanied by other cataclysmic events such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and tsunamis, mazuku are not easy to identify as potential dangers in their own right.

In some cases, mazuku are large enough to cause a localized extinction event that is documented in the fossil record. [[Lake Kivu]], on the border between the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], is a very large lake that has a sediment record of repeated and regular massive [[Limnic eruption|lake turnover]] events that include methane explosions, tsunamis and mazuku. The [[Messel Pit]] in Germany contains a fossilized extinction pattern that could be related to a mazuku event there during the [[Eocene]] epoch.

A '''megadrought''' (or '''mega-drought''') is a prolonged [[drought]] lasting two decades or longer. Past megadroughts have been associated with persistent multiyear [[La Niña]] conditions (cooler than normal water temperatures in the tropical eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The characteristics and likely causes of the Medieval megadroughts in North America | url =http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/drought/medieval.shtml |author= Richard Seager, Celine Herweijer and Ed Cook |publisher= [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]] of [[Columbia University]] |accessdate=15 August 2011|year=2011 |quote= Consequently, despite considerable limitations of the proxy evidence, to date it does support the idea that, during medieval times, the global hydroclimate tended towards what we would now call a La Niña-like state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term megadrought is generally used to describe the length of a drought, and not its acute intensity. In [[scientific literature]] the term is used to describe '''decades-long droughts''' or '''multi-decadal droughts'''. Multiyear droughts of less than a decade, such as the [[Dust Bowl]] drought of the 1930s, are generally not described as megadroughts even though they are of a long duration. In popular literature multiyear or even single year droughts are occasionally described as megadroughts based upon their severity, the economic damage they inflict or other criteria, but this is the exception and not the rule.

== Impact ==
Megadroughts have historically led to the [[mass migration]] of humans away from drought affected lands, resulting in a significant [[population decline]] from pre-drought levels. They are suspected of playing a primary role in the [[Societal collapse|collapse]] of several pre-industrial [[civilization]]s, including the [[Anasazi]] of the North American Southwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Megadroughts | url = http://www.fortstocktonpioneer.com/news/article_686ad2aa-be00-11e0-9f51-001cc4c002e0.html|author=Bob Varmette |publisher=Fort Stockton Pioneer |accessdate=15 August 2011 |date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Khmer Empire]] of Cambodia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tree Rings Tell of Angkor’s Dying Days | url= http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~kja/access/pubs/Science0209_NV.pdf |author=Richard Stone |publisher= [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 March 2009 |quote=New findings suggest that a decades-long drought at about the time the kingdom began fading away in the 14th century may have been a major culprit.

== Historical evidence ==
[[File:Christmas Day07 018.jpg|upright|thumb|Montezuma Bald Cypress tree, 900 years old]]
There are several sources for establishing the past occurrence and frequency of megadroughts, including:
 
* When megadroughts occur, lakes dry up and trees and other plants grow in the dry lake beds. When the drought ends the lakes refill; when this happens the trees are submerged and die.

The '''Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics''' ('''SMEE''') is a regional chapter of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] (ISEE). After its foundation in 2008 at Guatemala City, the organization has already celebrated its first International Conference in 2010 at Mexico City and will carry out the second International Conference, EcoEco Alternatives, between March 4 and 8 2014 at the main campus of the [[University of Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/3 About the SMEE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826021103/http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/3 |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This branch of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics|ISEE]] has a unique emphasis within [[ecological economics]]. Topics like [[Social Justice|social justice]] and the human value in environmental conservation prevail in this region. As a consequence of the strong influence from [[Joan Martinez Alier|Joan Martinez Alier's]] "environmentalism of the poor or social environmentalism", major attention is given to ecological-distributive conflicts. Alier insists that in the South a struggle exists against these conflicts generated by economic growth, mainly by the North. These endeavors "attempt to preserve the access of the communities to natural resources and services." &lt;ref&gt;Martínez Alier J. (1998), Ecological economics as human economics, Fundación César Manrique, Lanzarote (Canary Islands).&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the negative effects on the environment by economic distribution, the cultural influence is also widely debated. For instance, the anthropologist [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] suggests that culturally-driven preferences are one of the main factors degrading the environment. For example, society naturally gives privilege to the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] model that distributes natural resources with the purposes of production and profit, instead of endorsing the [[Agroforestry|agroforestal]] ecosystem model, which is less harmful to the [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Escobar A. (1999), “An Ecology of Difference: Equality and Conflict in a Glocalized World”, in: 
Arizpe, L. (ed) World Culture Report II, Unesco, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this alternate perception in [[Mesoamerica]], [[Ecological economics]] doesn't consider that the economic valuation of natural resources nor environmental norms are effective solutions to these social-environmental conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuhem.org/media/ecosocial/File/Boletin%20ECOS/Boletin%206/Conflictos%20ambientales_M.WALTER_mar09_final.pdf Environmental, Social-Environmental, and Ecological-distributive conflicts within the environmental context... Reflections about the approaches and definitions] Walter, Mariana (2009), CIP-ECOSOCIAL – Boletín ECOS nº6&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an alternative based on community-based conservation and the management of [[sustainability]] is more advocated upon. By adding the latter cultural perspective, the three pillars of [[sustainable development]] (the social, environmental, and economic)&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/63/PDF/N0548763.pdf?OpenElement Final Document of the 2005 Global Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725205352/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/63/PDF/N0548763.pdf?OpenElement |date=2009-07-25 }} Approved Resolution of the UN General Assembly. Ratified 10/24/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; end up being addressed by these proponents.

==History==

After the second biennial meeting of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] in 1994 at [[San José, Costa Rica]], several professionals in the region became interested in creating a branch of this organization in their own countries to respond to the increasing development and worsening of social-environmental conflicts by the [[Neoclassical economics|conventional-economics]]-based policies.

However, it wasn't until 2008 that the efforts of the [[Latin American Social Sciences Institute]] in Guatemala, the [http://www.cinpe.una.ac.cr/ International Center for Political Economy] at the National University of Costa Rica, and the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University]] of Mexico resulted in the Ecological Economics Forum, May 26 and 27 2008 at [[Guatemala City]], with the participation of zealous youth, students, and 50 professionals of [[Mesoamerica]].

Highly-recognized experts spoke, such as [[Alejandro Nadal]], Coordinator of the working group on the Environment, Macroeconomics, Trade and Investments of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN); David Barkin and Roberto Constantino from the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University]] of Mexico; Eduardo García Frapolli from the Center for Ecosystem Research of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]; Bernardo Aguilar of [[Prescott College]], [[Arizona|AZ]], [[United States|U.S.]] and Executive Director of the [http://www.en.neotropica.org/ Fundacion Neotropica] in [[Costa Rica]]; Miguel Martínez of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF Guatemala), and Juan Pablo Castañeda of the Institute of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and the Environment of the Rafael Landívar University in [[Guatemala]].

This meeting undertook the writing of the organization's Constitution and the election of the first Board of Directors. Under the lead of the first President, M. Sc. Iliana Monterroso of Guatemala, the consolidation of the legal inscription and statutes took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/5 Mensaje de la Presidencia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010061529/http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/5 |date=2013-10-10 }}, Bernardo Aguilar (2013), accessed: July 18th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Forum's participants, the main objectives of the SMEE are to create an open field for discussion of the methodological and theoretical development of [[Ecological economics]], to promote interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary scientific research, and to support academic initiatives related to this thematic in the region.

In 2010, the First International (and Biennial) Conference of the SMEE was celebrated at the Ecological Park of Xochimilco, [[Mexico City]], from November 22 to the 26th. Very influential speakers such as [[Fander Falconí]]; David Barkin; Mario Pérez, and Carlos Muñóz Piña lectured about and discussed the [[Ecological economics]] platform for the advancement of [[social justice]], [[environmental justice]], and the principles of [[sustainability]].

Since then, the new Board of Directors has had to deal with a shortage of memberships and the last [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]]; but despite these challenges, it has achieved important progress in creating its [http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/ website] and completing several ecological economics studies and projects with the [http://www.neotropica.org/ Fundacion Neotropica]. Furthermore, the organization foresees the inauguration of a professional Master's program on [[ecological economics]] and [[political ecology]] at the [http://www.uci.ac.cr/ University for International Cooperation] and the proceeding of the 2014 EcoEco Alternatives Biennial Conference.

{{Quotation| We agree with the premise that the methodological pluralism characteristic of ecological economics must be understood beyond the philosophy of "everything counts." It must respond to epistemology required by the necessities established by the specific context of the conflict within that region. |Bernardo Aguilar Gonzalez, President's Letter}}

==Boards of Directors==

==EcoEco Alternatives 2014 Conference==

The Second International Conference of the Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics will take place at the Rodrigro Facio campus of the [[University of Costa Rica]] from March 4 to the 8th, 2014, with the support of the [http://www.biologia.ucr.ac.cr/ School of Biology] and the [http://www.neotropica.org/ Fundacion Neotropica]. Its purpose is to further the debate on [[Ecological economics]] and to sensitize more people about the importance of the ecological crisis and the solutions proposed by this school of thought.

The Conference's thematic will be "Advancing Towards Alternatives for People and [[Ecosystem]]s in [[Latin America]]". It will include multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary debates about the resolution of social-environmental conflicts, the alternatives within the ecological economics model for handling [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], and the social conflicts related to the [[distribution of wealth]] and [[gender]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3744">[[File:Methyl_cation.svg|thumb|180px|right|Methenium ({{chem|CH|3|+}}).]]
In [[organic chemistry]], '''methenium''' (also called '''methylium''', '''carbenium''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ions, Free Radicals, and Radical-Ion|date=June 1974|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ba-1974-0126.ch028|work=Advances in Chemistry|pages=216–224|publisher=AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY|language=EN|doi=10.1021/ba-1974-0126.ch028|isbn=0841201919|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''methyl cation''', or '''protonated methylene''') is a [[cation|positive ion]] with the formula {{chem|CH|3|+}}.  It can be viewed as a [[methylene radical]] (''':'''{{chem|CH|2}}) with an added [[proton]] ({{chem|H|+}}), or as a [[methyl radical]] (•{{chem|CH|3}}) with one [[electron]] removed.  It is a [[carbocation]] and an [[enium compound|enium ion]], making it the simplest of the [[carbenium ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Golob/&gt;

== Structure ==
Experiments and calculations generally agree that the methenium ion is planar, with threefold symmetry.&lt;ref name=Golob/&gt;  The carbon atom is a prototypical (and exact) example of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization.

==Preparation and reactions==
For [[mass spectrometry]] studies at low pressure, methenium can be obtained by [[ultraviolet]] [[photoionization]] of methyl radical,&lt;ref name=Golob/&gt; or by collisions of monatomic cations like {{chem|C|+}} and {{chem|Kr|+}} with neutral methane.&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;  In such conditions, it will react with [[acetonitrile]] {{chem|CH|3|CN}} to form the ion {{chem|({{chem|CH|3}})|2|CN|+}}.&lt;ref name=McEwan/&gt;

Upon capture of a low-energy electron (less than {{val|1|ul=eV}}), it will spontaneously dissociate.&lt;ref name=Bahati/&gt;

It is seldom encountered as an intermediate in the condensed phase. It is proposed as a reactive intermediate that forms upon protonation or hydride abstraction of methane with [[Magic acid|FSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H-SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The methenium ion is very reactive, even towards [[alkane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogeveen|first=H.|last2=Lukas|first2=J.|last3=Roobeek|first3=C.

From 1989 to 2010, the '''National Hydrogen Association''' ('''NHA''') was a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on advancing the development of [[hydrogen]] technologies and their utilization in industrial, commercial, and consumer applications and promote the role of hydrogen in the energy field.

The NHA was a member-based organization and hosted the annual Hydrogen Conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrogenconference.org/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; NHA also provided advocacy on behalf of the stakeholders in the hydrogen economy and worked to support legislation enabling the entry of hydrogen technologies to the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrogenassociation.org/policy/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the NHA merged with the [[U.S. Fuel Cell Council]] to form the [[Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1138">The [[1970s energy crisis]] led [[Luxembourg]] to briefly consider constructing a nuclear power plant. In 1972 [[RWE]] and the government negotiated a project to build a 1,200 MW [[nuclear reactors|nuclear reactor]] along the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle river]] near [[Remerschen]]. In 1974 there were already signs that there was little support for the project among public opinion. The opposition to the project grew, and became more organized, ultimately forcing the government to cancel the project at the end of 1977.

'''Ocean floor disposal''' is a method of sequestering [[radioactive waste]] in [[ocean floor]] sediment where it is unlikely to be disturbed either geologically or by human activity.

Several methods of depositing material in the ocean floor have been proposed, including encasing it in concrete and as the [[United Kingdom]] has previously done, dropping it in [[torpedo]]es designed to increase the depth of penetration into the ocean floor, or depositing containers in shafts drilled with techniques similar to those used in [[Petroleum|oil]] exploration.

Ocean floor sediment is saturated with water, but since there is no [[water table]] per se and the water does not flow through it the migration of dissolved waste is limited to the rate at which it can [[diffusion|diffuse]] through dense [[clay]]. This is slow enough that it could potentially take millions of years for waste to diffuse through several tens of meters of sediment so that by the time it reaches open ocean it would be highly [[:wikt: dilute|dilute]] and [[radioactive decay|decay]]ed. Large regions of the ocean floor are thought to be completely geologically inactive and it is not expected that there will be extensive human activity there in the future.  Water absorbs essentially all radiation within a few meters provided the waste remains contained.

One of the problems associated with this option includes the difficulty of recovering the waste, if necessary, once it is emplaced deep in the ocean. Also, establishing an effective international structure to develop, regulate, and monitor a sub-seabed repository would be extremely difficult.

Beyond technical and political considerations, the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter|London Convention]] places prohibitions on disposing of radioactive materials at sea and does not make a distinction between waste dumped directly into the water and waste that is buried underneath the ocean's floor. It remains in force until 2018, after which the sub-seabed disposal option can be revisited at 25-year intervals.

Depositing waste, in suitable containers, in [[subduction zone]]s has also been suggested. Here, waste would be transported by plate tectonic movement into the Earth's mantle and rendered harmless through dilution and natural decay. Several objections have been raised to this method, including vulnerabilities during transport and disposal, as well as uncertainties in the actual tectonic processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">The '''One Watt Initiative''' (or the proper '''One-Watt Initiative''') is an energy-saving initiative by the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) to reduce [[standby power]]-use by any appliance to not more than one [[watt]] in 2010, and 0.5 watts in 2013, which has given rise to regulations in many countries and regions.

==Standby power==
Standby power, informally called ''vampire'' or ''phantom power,'' refers to the electricity consumed by many appliances when they are switched off or in [[standby mode]]. The typical standby power per appliance is low (typically from less than 1 to 25&amp;nbsp;W), but, when multiplied by the billions of appliances in houses and in commercial buildings, standby losses represent a significant fraction of total world electricity use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/795944-XFu5mJ/native/795944.pdf One Watt Initiative : a Global Effort to Reduce Leaking Electricity] Alan Meier &amp; Benoît LeBot, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alan Meier, a staff scientist at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], standby power before the One Watt Initiative proposals were implemented as regulations accounted for as much as 10% of household power consumption. A study in France found that standby power accounted for 7% of total residential consumption, and other studies put the proportion of consumption due to standby power at 13%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5571582 Pulling the plug on standby power], [[The Economist]] Mar 9, 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEA estimated in 2007 that standby produced 1% of the world's [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://environment.guardian.co.uk/energy/story/0,,2018533,00.html Should we ban these bulbs?] [[The Guardian]], February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; To put the figure into context, total air travel contributes less than 3% of global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0212/p13s02-litr.html Flying the cleanly skies?] [[Christian Science Monitor]], February 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Standby power]] can be reduced by technological means, reducing power used without affecting functionality, and by changing users' operating procedures.

== Policy ==
The One Watt Initiative was launched by the IEA in 1999 to ensure through international cooperation that by 2010 all new appliances sold in the world use only one watt in standby mode. This would reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 50 million tons in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD countries]] alone by 2010; the equivalent to removing 18 million cars from the roads.&lt;ref&gt;Global Implication of Standby Power Use, [http://aceee.org/ ACEEE] Summer Study 2000. Lebot B. &amp; Meier A&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 US President [[George W. Bush]] issued [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/07/20010731-10.html Executive Order 13221], which states that every government agency, “when it purchases commercially available, off-the-shelf products that use external standby power devices, or that contain an internal standby power function, shall purchase products that use no more than one watt in their standby power consuming mode.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5571582 Pulling the plug on standby power], [[The Economist]], Mar 9 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005 South Korea and Australia had introduced the one watt benchmark in all new electrical devices, and according to the IEA other countries, notably Japan and China, had undertaken "strong measures" to reduce standby power use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2005/standby_fact.pdf Standby power use and the IEA, One Watt Plan – Fact Sheet], [[International Energy Agency]] 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 California's 2005 appliance standards came into effect, limiting external power supply standby power to 0.5 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fypower.org/news/?p=1386 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209212259/http://www.fypower.org/news/?p=1386 |archivedate=2011-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2010, the [[European Commission]]'s [[EC Regulation 1275/2008]] came into force regulating requirements for standby and "off mode" electric power consumption of electrical and electronic household and office equipment. The regulations mandate that from 6 January 2010 "off mode" and standby power shall not exceed 1W, "standby-plus" power (providing information or status display in addition to possible reactivation function) shall not exceed 2W (these figures are halved on 6 January 2013). Equipment must, where appropriate, provide off mode and/or standby mode when the equipment is connected to the mains power source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/nmo/docs/eup/leaflets//standby-and-off-leaflet.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109020207/http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/nmo/docs/eup/leaflets/standby-and-off-leaflet.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-11-09|title=BIS department, UK: Standby and off leaflet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is amorphous. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5 to 6 and a [[specific gravity]] of 5. It is [[radioactive]] due to its uranium content (around 6%). It occurs in [[granite|granitic]] [[pegmatite]]s.

Polycrase forms a continuous series with the niobium rich rare earth oxide [[euxenite]].

It was first described in 1870 at [[Rasvag]], [[Hittero Island|Hidra (Hittero) Island]], near [[Flekkefjord]], Norway. It is found in Sweden, Norway, and the United States.

[[File:Royal British Legion's Paper Poppy - white background.jpg|thumb|Royal British Legion remembrance poppy]]
The '''remembrance poppy''' is an [[artificial flower]] that has been used since 1921 to commemorate military personnel who have died in war, and represents a common or field poppy, ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]''. Inspired by the [[World War I]] poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]", and promoted by [[Moina Michael]], they were first adopted by the [[American Legion]] to commemorate American soldiers killed in that war. They were then adopted by [[veteran|military veterans]]' groups in parts of the [[British Empire]].

Today, they are mostly used in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to commemorate their servicemen and women killed in all conflicts. There, small artificial poppies are often worn on clothing leading up to [[Remembrance Day]]/[[Armistice Day]],&lt;ref name="bbcmagazine"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15637074 | title=Who, What, Why: Which countries wear poppies? | first=Rema | last=Rahman | date=9 November 2011 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=11 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and poppy [[wreath]]s are often laid at [[war memorial]]s. In Australia and New Zealand, they are also worn on [[Anzac Day]].

The [[Royal British Legion]]'s Poppy Appeal has caused [[#Protests and controversy|some controversy]], with some—including British Army veterans—arguing that it has become excessive, is being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that public figures are pressured to wear poppies.

==Origins==
[[File:Field poppy - Papaver rhoeas (12190335083).jpg|thumb|right|The flower of the common or field poppy ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'', on which the remembrance poppy is based]]
[[File:00MoinaMichael.jpg|thumb|right|Moina Michael on a 1948 U.S. commemorative stamp]]
The remembrance poppy was inspired by the World War I poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]". Its opening lines refer to the many poppies that were the first flowers to grow in the churned-up earth of soldiers' graves in [[Flanders]], a region of [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="bbc10nov06"&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Where did the idea to sell poppies come from?  | publisher =BBC News | date =10 November 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6133312.stm  | accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written from the point of view of the dead soldiers and, in the last verse, they call on the living to continue the conflict.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;Fox, James. "Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present", in ''Cultural Heritage Ethics: Between Theory and Practice''. Open Book Publishers, 2014. pp.23-28&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was written by [[Canada|Canadian]] physician, [[John McCrae]], on 3 May 1915 after witnessing the death of his friend, a fellow soldier, the day before. The poem was first published on 8 December 1915 in the [[London]]-based magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.

In 1918, [[Moina Michael]], who had taken leave from her professorship at the [[University of Georgia]] to be a volunteer worker for the American [[YMCA Overseas War Secretaries organization]], was inspired by the poem and published a poem of her own called "[[We Shall Keep the Faith]]".&lt;ref name=DLG&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Moina Michael | publisher =Digital Library of Georgia/[[University of Georgia]] | date = | url =http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/mmichael.htm | accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tribute to McCrae's poem, she vowed to always wear a red poppy as a symbol of remembrance for those who fought and helped in the war.&lt;ref name="bbc10nov06"/&gt; At a November 1918 YMCA Overseas War Secretaries' conference, she appeared with a silk poppy pinned to her coat and distributed 25 more to those attending. She then campaigned to have the poppy adopted as a national symbol of remembrance. At a conference in 1920, the National American Legion adopted it as their official symbol of remembrance.&lt;ref name="bbc10nov06"/&gt; At this conference, Frenchwoman Anna E. Guérin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://poppyladymadameguerin.wordpress.com/|title=Madame Guérin|author=Heather A. Johnson|date=6 August 2015|website=WHO PUT THE POPPY ON YOUR LAPEL? MADAME ANNA A. GUÉRIN DID.|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired to introduce the artificial poppies commonly used today. In 1921 she sent her poppy sellers to London, where the symbol was adopted by [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig]], a founder of the [[Royal British Legion]]. It was also adopted by veterans' groups in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="bbc10nov06"/&gt; James Fox notes that all of the countries who adopted the remembrance poppy were the "victors" of World War I.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

==Usage==
Today, remembrance poppies are mostly used in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand—countries which were formerly part of the [[British Empire]]—to commemorate their servicemen and women killed in all conflicts. They are used to a lesser extent in the United States.

===Australia===
In Australia, remembrance poppies have been used since 1921 to commemorate Australian soldiers who died in war. On Remembrance Day (11 November) and [[Anzac Day]] (25 April) they are laid at war memorials, and are sold by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL) in return for donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Red Poppy - Australian Army|url = http://www.army.gov.au/Our-history/Traditions/The-Red-Poppy|website = www.army.gov.au|accessdate = 10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the poppy is the official symbol of remembrance worn during the two weeks before 11 November, having been adopted in 1921. The [[Royal Canadian Legion]], which has [[trademark]]ed the image,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.ca/honour-remember/the-poppy-trademark/|title=The Royal Canadian Legion Poppy Trademark - The Royal Canadian Legion|work=The Royal Canadian Legion|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that poppies be worn on the left lapel, or as near the heart as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vac-acc.gc.ca/general/sub.cfm?source=teach_resources/poppy |title=Poppy Facts - Veterans Affairs Canada |publisher=Vac-acc.gc.ca |date=21 October 1999 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1996, poppies were made by disabled veterans in Canada, but they have since been made by a private contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Webmaster, Patrick Riley |url=http://www.legion.ca/Poppy/campaign_e.cfm |title=The Royal Canadian Legion |publisher=Legion.ca |date= |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511063341/http://legion.ca/Poppy/campaign_e.cfm |archivedate=11 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian poppies consist of two pieces of moulded plastic covered with [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]] with a pin to fasten them to clothing. At first the poppies were made with a black centre. From 1980 to 2002, the centres were changed to green. Current designs are black only; this change caused confusion and controversy to those unfamiliar with the original design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/16w-16e/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=180 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523035823/http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/16w-16e/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=180 |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, sticker versions of the poppy were made for children, the elderly, and healthcare and food industry workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first =Julia| last =Skikavich| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =New sticker poppies are catching on| url =http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/11/05/poppy-stickers.html| work =| publisher =CBC News| id =| pages =| page =| date =5 November 2008| accessdate =12 November 2008| language =| quote =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081209042633/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/11/05/poppy-stickers.html| dead-url =yes| archivedate =9 December 2008| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|UK}} Canada also issues a cast metal "Canada Remembers" pin featuring a gold maple leaf and two poppies, one representing the fallen and the other representing those who remained on the [[home front]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3nMfjn73O0gOWE2NDkxMGQtYTRjOS00ZDE0LTk5ZDMtOWRlNGRmY2U0ODY2&amp;sort=name&amp;layout=list&amp;pid=0B3nMfjn73O0gYzNkZGFiODktYTA4Ny00MTAxLWFkOTgtZDE3OTQ2MDk0ZTYx&amp;cindex=18 ''Canada Remembers Program Policy Manual''], Veterans Affairs Canada, 2009 revision&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the installation of the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] in [[Ottawa]] in 2000, where the national Remembrance service is held, a new tradition formed spontaneously as attendees laid their poppies on the tomb at the end of the service. This tradition, while not part of the official program, has become widely practised elsewhere in the country, with others leaving cut flowers, photographs, or letters to the dead.

Since joining Canada in 1949, the remembrance poppy and [[Armistice Day]] commemorations have largely displaced [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland's]] own commemorative floral emblem, the [[forget-me-not]], and its own [[Memorial Day (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Memorial Day]] held on 1 July.  Although in recent years the forget-me-not has had somewhat of a resurgence in Newfoundland's military commemorations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2016-06-22/article-4567810/Special-Forget-Me-Nots/1 "Special Forget-Me-Nots" {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/forget-me-not-newfoundland-legion-beaumont-hamel-1.3360692|title=Legion members given go-ahead to wear forget-me-nots in 2016 - CBC News|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remembrance poppy is more common.

===New Zealand===
[[File:NZRSA remembrance poppy.jpg|thumb|upright|New Zealand remembrance poppy]]In New Zealand, remembrance poppies are most often worn on Anzac Day (25 April) to commemorate New Zealand soldiers who died in war. They are also worn on Remembrance Day, and are sold by the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]] (RSA) in return for donations. The RSA planned to hold its first Poppy Day appeal around the time of Armistice Day 1921, as other countries were doing. The ship carrying the poppies from France arrived in New Zealand too late, and so the association waited until Anzac Day 1922. This first Poppy Day appeal was a success. Most of the money raised went to needy soldiers and their families, while the rest went to the French Children's League to help relieve suffering in war-ravaged areas of northern France.

The popularity of Poppy Day grew and there were record collections during the Second World War. By 1945, 750,000 poppies were being distributed nationwide, which equated to half the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The red poppy - Anzac Day {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/anzac-day/poppies|website = www.nzhistory.net.nz|accessdate = 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, remembrance poppies are sold by [[The Royal British Legion]] (RBL). This is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] providing financial, social, political and emotional support to those who have served or who are currently serving in the [[British Armed Forces]], and their dependants. They are sold on the streets by volunteers in the weeks before Remembrance Day. The remembrance poppy is the [[trademark]] of The Royal British Legion.&lt;ref name=ipo1&gt;{{cite web|title=EU000681452|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/4/EU000681452|website=IPO|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ipo3&gt;{{cite web|title=EU004066271|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/4/EU004066271|website=IPO|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ipo2&gt;{{cite web|title=EU000681452|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmowner/Owner/Results?name=British%20Legion&amp;postcode=|website=IPO|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RBL state, "The red poppy is our [[trademark|registered mark]] and its only lawful use is to raise funds for the Poppy Appeal";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-15654558 "Wiltshire woman's poppy teardrop 'violates trademark'"].

In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the poppies typically have two red paper petals mounted on a green plastic stem with a single green paper leaf and a prominent black plastic central boss. The stem has an additional branch used to anchor the poppy via a pin in the lapel or buttonhole. In Scotland, the poppies are curled and have four petals with no leaf. The yearly selling of poppies is a major source of income for the RBL in the UK. The poppy has no fixed price; it is sold for a donation or the price may be suggested by the seller. The black plastic centre of the poppy was marked "[[Haig Fund]]" until 1994 but is now marked "Poppy Appeal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html |title=White Poppies For Peace |publisher=Ppu.org.uk |date= |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of about 50 people—most of them disabled former British military personnel—work all year round to make millions of poppies at the [[Poppy Factory]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poppyfactory.org/|title=The Royal British Legion Poppy Factory|publisher=The Royal British Legion|accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish poppies are made in the [[Lady Haig's Poppy Factory]] in Edinburgh.

For many years after World War I, poppies were worn only on Remembrance Day itself.&lt;ref name="Letters to the Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3634134/Letters-to-the-Daily-Telegraph.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Letters to the Daily Telegraph | date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the RBL's "Poppy Appeal" has a higher profile than any other charity appeal in the UK.&lt;ref name="Letters to the Daily Telegraph"/&gt; The poppies are widespread from late October until mid-November every year and are worn by the general public, politicians, the Royal Family and other public figures. It has become common to see large poppies on buses, tube trains and aeroplanes as well as on lampposts, billboards, public buildings and landmarks. Many newspapers and magazines show a poppy on their cover page, and some [[Social network service|social network]] users add poppies to their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twibbon.com/join/Royal-British-Legion-2|title=Search for a Campaign - Twibbon|work=Twibbon|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, an official Poppy Appeal [[Single (music)|single]] has been released.&lt;ref name=jossstone&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/joss-stone-criticised-over-sentimentalising-famed-anti-war-song-for-poppy-appeal-9847312.html "Joss Stone criticised for sentimentalising famed anti-war song for Poppy Appeal"]. [[The Independent]]. 10 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There are thousands of poppy sellers on the streets and numerous fundraising events; such as concerts, fairs, marathons and competitions. There are also many other events to raise awareness. For example, in 2011, a Second World War plane dropped 6,000 poppies over the town of [[Yeovil]] in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-15507929 "WWII plane drops poppies over Yeovil"].

There has been growing controversy over the Poppy Appeal. Some—including British Army veterans—have argued that the Poppy Appeal has become excessive and garish, that it is being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that poppy wearing has become compulsory for public figures.&lt;ref name=poppyveterans&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/05/poppy-appeal-subverted-veterans-complain "Poppy appeal's original aims being subverted, veterans complain"].

The Republic has its own [[National Day of Commemoration]] in July for all Irish people who died in war.

[[National Graves Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Army's role in Northern Ireland during [[the Troubles]].

In the years following the War of Independence, the poppy was particularly controversial, with nationalists seeing it as a provocative symbol of British imperialism. In Dublin, British Legion marchers often had poppies snatched from their lapels, which led to street fights. In response, some poppy-wearers hid razor blades in their poppies.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, Fearghal. ''Republicanism in Modern Ireland''. University College Dublin Press, 2003. p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Evans &amp; Kenneth Lunn. ''War and Memory in the Twentieth Century''. Bloomsbury Academic, 1997. p.66&lt;/ref&gt; "As the 1930s progressed, 'Poppy Day' lost much of its violent edge in Dublin, but the wearing of the symbol also became less commonplace in subsequent decades".&lt;ref&gt;[http://comeheretome.com/2015/11/04/poppy-snatching-in-dublin/ "Poppy-snatching in Dublin"].

[[File:Ніколи Знову 02.svg|thumb|Never Again symbol from [[Ukraine]]]]

Since 2014, the [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]] have worn the poppy as a symbol of the [[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II|Victory over Nazism]] and commemoration of the victims of World War II. It has largely replaced the [[Ribbon of Saint George]], which became associated with [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian separatists]] and Russian military aggression. A poppy logo was designed by Serhiy Mishakin and contains the text: "1939-1945 Never Again".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/05/14/poppies-vs-ribbons-the-war-of-symbols-between-ukraine-and-russia/ "Poppies Vs.

==Other designs and purposes==

===White poppies===
[[File:Anzac poppies.JPG|thumb|A white remembrance poppy left on [[Anzac Day]] in New Zealand, 2009]]
Some people choose to wear [[White poppy (symbol)|white poppies]] as an alternative to the red poppy. The white poppy and white poppy wreaths were introduced by Britain's [[Co-operative Women's Guild]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/white_cwg.html |title=White Poppies For Peace |publisher=[[Peace Pledge Union]] |date=11 November 1938 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, white poppies are sold by [[Peace Pledge Union]] or may be home-made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html |title=White Poppies Are For Peace |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |date= |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The white poppy may be worn alone or alongside the red poppy. According to the Peace Pledge Union, it symbolises remembrance of all casualties of war including civilian casualties, and non-British casualties, to stand for peace, and not to glamorize war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html|title=WHITE POPPIES|website=www.ppu.org.uk|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was never meant to be disrespectful, some people were very offended with the use of the white poppy and some women in the 1930s lost their jobs for wearing white poppies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/remembrance/how/poppy.shtml|title=BBC - Remembrance - Why the Poppy?|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purple poppies ===
{{more|Purple poppy}}
To commemorate animal victims of war, [[Animal Aid]] in Britain has issued a [[purple poppy|purple remembrance poppy]], which can be worn alongside the traditional red one, as a reminder that both humans and animals have been – and continue to be – victims of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/living//2256/|title=BLUE POPPY: COMMEMORATING THE ANIMAL VICTIMS OF WAR|accessdate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121070658/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/living//2256//|archivedate=21 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8333733.stm|title= The dos and don'ts of poppy etiquette|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the purple poppy was replaced by a purple paw symbol that can be worn all year round. This was because people saw the poppy as implying animals had given their lives as heroes in the service of human beings. Animal Aid regards animals of having their lives taken by the abuse of humans in war, not given by the animals as could be the case with people who have the capacity to decide for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animalaid.org.uk/the-issues/our-campaigns/living-without-cruelty/the-purple-poppy/|title=Animal Aid|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2017 a UK based animal charity [[Sasha Animal Foundation]] announced that it was to introduce its own blue poppy with a different design, stating: "We will be adhering to the stance that animals are victims of war and not heroes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.SashaAnimalFoundation.com|title=Sasha Animal Foundation Home|website=Sasha Animal Foundation Home|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black poppies ===

''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)]]''. 15 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014 the black poppy was embraced as an anti war symbol by the [[Stop the War Coalition]] which reported 'anti militarists' in Glasgow distributing 16,000 black poppies in memory of World War One conscientious objectors &lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/news-comment/1131-why-no-remembrance-day-black-poppies-for-16-000-first-world-war-refusers|title=Why No Remembrance Day black poppies For 16,000 First World War Refusers|website=[[Stop the War Coalition]]|access-date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and controversy==
[[File:Stormtrooper with a remembrance poppy - stencil (2016).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stencil graffiti]] of a [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper]] with a remembrance poppy (London, 2016)]]
In 1993, The Royal British Legion complained that ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]'', a video game with an anti-war message, had planned to use a poppy on its cover. The Legion, along with some politicians, called it "offensive to millions" and "monstrous". The publisher was forced to change the cover before the game was released.

In 2010 a group of British Army veterans issued an open letter complaining that the Poppy Appeal had become excessive and garish, that it was being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that people were being pressured into wearing poppies.&lt;ref name=poppyveterans/&gt; In 2014, the group protested by holding an alternative remembrance service: they walked to [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|The Cenotaph]] under the banner "Never Again" with a wreath of white poppies to acknowledge civilians killed in war. Their tops bore the message "War is Organised Murder", a quote from [[Harry Patch]], the last survivor of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/never-again-anti-war-veterans-to-carry-white-poppy-wreath-to-cenotaph-9833246.html "'Never again': Anti-war veterans to carry white-poppy wreath to Cenotaph"].

Veterans For Peace. 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 Remembrance Day ceremony in London was disrupted by members of the radical Islamist [[Muslims Against Crusades]] group, who were protesting against British Army actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. They burnt large poppies and chanted "British soldiers burn in hell" during the two-minute silence. Two of the men were arrested and charged for threatening behaviour. One was convicted and fined £50.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12664346 "Man guilty of burning poppies at Armistice Day protest"].

Some criticised it as a "shrouded loyalty test" which implied that Muslims needed to prove their loyalty to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Chris.

In November 2011 people were arrested in Northern Ireland after a picture of two youths burning a poppy was posted on [[Facebook]]. The picture was reported to police by a member of the RBL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/03/poppy-burning-northern-ireland-arrests?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Henry | last=McDonald | title=Poppy-burning image leads to Northern Ireland arrests | date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a young [[Canterbury]] man was arrested for allegedly posting a picture of a burning poppy on Facebook, on suspicion of an offence under the Malicious Communications Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title='Poppycock': Man's arrest for posting image of burning poppy on Facebook is condemned by civil liberties activists|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/poppycock-mans-arrest-for-posting-image-of-burning-poppy-on-facebook-is-condemned-by-civil-liberties-activists-8306784.html|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=4 February 2013|location=London|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister David Cameron rejected a request from Chinese officials to remove his poppy during his visit to [[Beijing]] on Remembrance Day 2010. The poppy was deemed offensive because it was mistakenly assumed to be connected with the Anglo-Chinese [[Opium Wars]] of the 19th century, after which the [[Qing Dynasty]] was forced to tolerate the British [[History of opium in China|opium trade]] in China and to cede [[Hong Kong]] to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-09/cameron-risks-spat-with-chinese-by-wearing-poppy-during-visit-to-beijing.html|title=Cameron Risks Spat With Chinese by Wearing Poppy During Visit |date=9 November 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg LP |accessdate=12 November 2011 |first=Robert |last=Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 there was controversy when [[The Northern Whig]] public house in [[Belfast]] refused entry to a man wearing a remembrance poppy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20208930 | title=Northern Whig bar apologises after poppy-wearer refused entry | year= 2012 | publisher= BBC News | accessdate=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the owners apologised, the customer took the matter to court, supported by the [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland]] (ECNI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.equalityni.org/Footer-Links/News/Individuals/Sample-headline-text-(3) | title=Refusal of man wearing poppy | year= 2013 | publisher= Equality Commission for Northern Ireland | accessdate=5 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was significant for the decision supporting the view of the ECNI that "The poppy, although not directly linked to a specific religious belief or political opinion, would historically have been associated to a greater extent with the Protestant or unionist community in Northern Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2013/11/27/news/poppy-refusal-discrimination-76888/ | title=Poppy refusal discrimination | year= 2013 | publisher= The Irish News | accessdate=5 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the media===
In the British media, public figures have been attacked for not wearing poppies. British journalist and newsreader [[Charlene White]] has faced racist and sexist abuse for not wearing a poppy on-screen. She explained "I prefer to be neutral and impartial on screen so that one of those charities doesn't feel less favoured than another".&lt;ref&gt;Shane Hickey [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/13/charlene-white-itv-news-presenter-remembrance-day-poppy "ITV news presenter hits back after abuse for not wearing poppy"], theguardian.com, 13 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Newsreader [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] does not wear a poppy on-screen for similar reasons.

[[The Independent]]. Accessed 4 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; While all newsreaders in the UK are expected to wear the remembrance poppy, those on the [[BBC World News|BBC's international news]] service are told not to. The BBC say this is because the symbol is not widely recognised overseas. The Royal British Legion condemned this, insisting that the poppy is the "international symbol of remembrance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/mp-s-fury-at-bbc-ban-on-poppies-1-584905 "MP’s fury at BBC ban on poppies"].

[[File:Celtic team - November 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Football clubs commonly wear jerseys with a poppy emblazoned on, as [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] controversially did in 2010.]]
In the run-up to Remembrance Day, it has become common for UK [[Association football|football]] teams to play with artificial poppies sewn to their shirts, at the request of the Royal British Legion. This has caused some controversy.

At a [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] match in November 2010, a group of Celtic supporters, called the [[Green Brigade]], unfurled a large banner in protest at the team wearing poppies. In a statement, it said: "Our group and many within the Celtic support do not recognise the British Armed Forces as heroes, nor their role in many conflicts as one worthy of our remembrance". It gave [[Operation Banner]] (Northern Ireland), the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] and the [[Iraq War]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etims.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3038&amp;Itemid=29 |title=Green Brigade Statement on the Poppy Protest |date=9 November 2010 |publisher=E-Tims Online Fanzine |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Irish-born footballer [[James McClean]], who has played for several English teams, has received [[death threat]]s and abuse since 2012 for refusing to wear a poppy on his shirt during matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/18/sunderland-james-mcclean-death-threat|title=Sunderland's James McClean receives death threat over poppy protest|first=Dominic|last=Fifield|date=18 November 2012|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClean said he does not wear one because the Poppy Appeal supports British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland, and believes it would disrespect those killed in [[Derry|his hometown]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/wigan-player-james-mcclean-explains-why-he-will-not-wear-a-poppy-30730556.html "Wigan player James McClean explains why he will not wear a poppy"].

In November 2011, it was proposed that the [[England national football team|England football team]] should wear poppies on their shirts in a match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. [[FIFA]] turned down the proposal; their decision was attacked by [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]]&lt;ref name=guardian-fifa-2011&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/09/david-cameron-outrageous-poppy-ban?newsfeed=true "Prince William calls on FIFA to overturn ban on England shirt poppies"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27970">'''Renewable heat''' is an application of [[renewable energy]] and it refers to the renewable generation of heat, rather than electrical power (e.g. replacing a fossil fuel boiler using [[concentrating solar thermal]] to feed radiators). Renewable heat technologies include renewable biofuels, solar heating, geothermal heating, heat pumps and heat exchangers to recover lost heat. Significant attention is also applied to insulation.

Many colder countries consume more energy for heating than electrical power. For example, in 2005 the United Kingdom consumed 354&amp;nbsp;TWh&lt;ref&gt;Department of Trade and Industry report [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39881.pdf UK Energy in Brief July 2007, Page 25] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233923/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39881.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} (URL accessed May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; of electric power, but had a heat requirement of 907&amp;nbsp;TWh, the majority of which (81%) was met using gas. The residential sector alone consumed a massive 550&amp;nbsp;TWh of energy for heating, mainly in the form of gas. Almost half of the final energy consumed in the UK (49%) was in the form of heat, of which 70% was used by households and in commercial and public buildings. Households used heat mainly for space heating (69%) and heating water.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government Call for Evidence on Heat, Office of Climate Change, Jan 2008 [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43609.pdf 'Heat Call for Evidence', Paragraphs 11 and 12] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233914/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43609.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} (URL accessed May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative competitiveness of renewable electricity and renewable heat depends on a nation's approach to energy and environment policy. Few renewable technologies (whether for heat, electricity or transport) are competitive with fossil fuels without some form of carbon valuation or subsidy. In those countries, such as Sweden, Denmark and Finland, where [[government intervention]] has been closest to a technology-neutral form of carbon valuation (i.e. carbon and [[energy tax]]es), renewable heat has played the leading role in a very substantial renewable contribution to final energy consumption. In those countries, such as Germany, Spain, the USA, and the UK, where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies, uses and scales, the  contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support, and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption.

== Leading renewable heat technologies ==

=== Solar heating ===
[[Solar heating]] is a style of building construction which uses the energy of summer or winter sunshine to provide an economic supply of primary or supplementary heat to a structure. The heat can be used for both [[space heating]] (see [[solar air heat]]) and [[water heating]] (see [[solar hot water]]). Solar heating design is divided into two groups:
* [[Passive solar]] heating relies on the design and structure of the house to collect heat. [[Passive solar building design]] must also consider the storage and distribution of heat, which may be accomplished passively, or use air ducting to draw heat actively to the foundation of the building for storage. One such design was measured lifting the temperature of a house to {{convert|24|C|F}} on a partially sunny winter day (-7&amp;nbsp;°C or 19&amp;nbsp;°F), and it is claimed that the system provides passively for the bulk of the building's heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarhouseproject.com/index.html |title=Solar House, Solar Home, Solar Homes, Solar Houses |publisher=Solarhouseproject.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home cost $125 per square foot (or 370&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at $1,351/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), similar to the cost of a traditional new home.
* [[Active solar]] heating uses [[pump]]s to move air or a liquid from the [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] into the building or storage area. Applications such as [[solar air heat]]ing and [[solar water heating]] typically capture solar heat in panels which can then be used for applications such as space heating and supplementation of residential water heaters. In contrast to [[photovoltaic panels]], which are used to generate electricity, solar heating panels are less expensive and capture a much higher proportion of the sun's energy.
Solar heating systems usually require a small supplementary backup heating system, either conventional or renewable.

=== Geothermal heating ===
[[File:Hot Spring.jpg|thumb|right|Hot Springs located in Nevada.]]
[[Geothermal energy]] is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil. Geothermal energy is an enormous, underused heat and power resource that is clean (emits little or no greenhouse gases), reliable (average system availability of 95%), and homegrown (making populations less dependent on oil).&lt;ref name="EERE1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|title=Geothermal Basics Overview|publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|archivedate=2008-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth absorbs the sun's energy and stores it as heat in the oceans and underground. The ground temperature remains constant at a point of {{convert|42|to|100|F|C}} all year round depending on where you live on earth. A geothermal heating system takes advantage of the consistent temperature found below the Earth's surface and uses it to heat and cool buildings. The system is made up of a series of pipes installed underground, connected to pipes in a building. A pump circulates liquid through the circuit. In the winter the fluid in the pipe absorbs the heat of the earth and uses it to heat the building. In the summer the fluid absorbs heat from the building and disposes of it in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |title=What is Geothermal? - Geothermal Resources Council |publisher=Geothermal.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004048/http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat pumps===
[[Heat pump]]s use work to move heat from one place to another, and can be used for both heating and air conditioning. Though capital intensive, heat pumps are economical to run and can be powered by renewable electricity. Two common types of heat pump are [[air-source heat pump]]s (ASHP) and [[ground-source heat pump]]s (GSHP), depending on whether heat is transferred from the air or from the ground.  Air source heat pumps are not effective when the outside air temperature is lower than about -15&amp;nbsp;°C, while ground-source heat pumps are not affected. The efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the [[coefficient of performance]] (CoP): For every unit of electricity used to pump the heat, an air source heat pump generates 2.5 to 3 units of heat (i.e. it has a CoP of 2.5 to 3), whereas a GSHP generates 3 to 3.5 units of heat. Based on current fuel prices for the United Kingdom, assuming a CoP of 3-4, a GSHP is sometimes a cheaper form of space heating than electric, oil, and solid fuel heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps Ground Source Heat Pumps: Costs, savings and financial support] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202165420/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps |date=December 2, 2016 }} Retrieved 2016-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps can be linked to an inter[[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (hot or cold), doubling the CoP from 4 to 8 by extracting heat from warmer ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/gshp.html |title=GSHP &amp;#124; Ground Source Heat Pumps &amp;#124; GSHPs &amp;#124; Ground Source Heating &amp;#124; Coefficient of Performance CoP &amp;#124; Ground source heat pump efficiency &amp;#124; Thermal Energy Storage |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interseasonal heat transfer====
{{Main|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
A heat pump with Interseasonal Heat Transfer combines active solar collection to store surplus summer heat in thermal banks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html |title=Thermal Banks store heat between seasons &amp;#124; Seasonal Heat Storage &amp;#124; ThermalBanks from ICAX save carbon emissions &amp;#124; Thermal Energy Storage using Inter seasonal Heat Stores &amp;#124; Underground Thermal Energy Storage UTES &amp;#124; Reusable Heat |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ground-source heat pumps to extract it for space heating in winter. This reduces the "Lift" needed and doubles the CoP of the heat pump because the pump starts with warmth from the thermal bank in place of cold from the ground.

====CoP and lift====
A heat pump CoP increases as the temperature difference, or "Lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The CoP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g., underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g., the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional radiators require high water temperatures, affecting the choice of heat pump technology. Low temperature radiators provide an alternative to conventional radiators.

===Resistive electrical heating===
Renewable electricity can be generated by hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and by burning biomass. In a few countries where renewable electricity is inexpensive, [[Electric heating|resistance heating]] is common. In countries like Denmark where electricity is expensive, it is not permitted to install electric heating as the main heat source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/DEA_Heat_supply_in_denmark.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines have more output at night when there is a small demand for electricity, [[storage heater]]s consume this lower cost electricity at night and give off heat during the day.

=== Wood-pellet heating ===
[[File:Lincoln stove.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Stove.]][[File:Pellets hand.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Pellets.]]
[[Wood-pellet heating]] and other types of wood heating systems have achieved their greatest success in heating premises that are off the gas grid, typically being previously heated using heating oil or coal. Solid wood fuel requires a large amount of dedicated storage space, and the specialized heating systems can be expensive (though grant schemes are available in many European countries to offset this capital cost.) Low fuel costs mean that wood fuelled heating in Europe is frequently able to achieve a payback period of less than 3 to 5 years.  Because of the large fuel storage requirement wood fuel can be less attractive in urban residential scenarios, or for premises connected to the gas grid (though rising gas prices and uncertainty of supply mean that wood fuel is becoming more competitive.) There is also growing concern over the air pollution from wood heating versus oil or gas heat, especially the fine particulates.

=== Wood-stove heating ===
Burning [[wood fuel]] in an open fire is both extremely inefficient (0-20%) and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion. In the same way that a drafty building loses heat through loss of warm air through poor sealing, an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of warm air out of the building.

Modern wood [[stove]] designs allow for more efficient combustion and then heat extraction. In the United States, new wood stoves are certified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and burn cleaner and more efficiently (the overall efficiency is 60-80%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/bns/reports/stakejun2008/B%28a%29P/WoodstoveFacsheet_08.pdf|title=Burn clean: Hot tips for a better fire|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- originally at 
http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/pdfs/epa_bcflyer_press_rev4.pdf, and archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20090510060711/http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/pdfs/epa_bcflyer_press_rev4.pdf should this link ever become stale --&gt; and draw smaller volumes of warm air from the building.

"Cleaner" should not, however, be confused with clean. An Australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current Australian standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/atmosphere/airquality/publications/emission-factor.html |title=Measurement of real-world PM10 emission factors and emission profiles from woodheaters by in situ source monitoring and atmospheric verification methods |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that particle emissions averaged 9.4&amp;nbsp;g/kg wood burned (range 2.6 to 21.7).  A heater with average wood consumption of 4 tonnes per year therefore emits 37.6&amp;nbsp;kg of PM2.5, i.e. particles less than 2.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]]. This can be compared with a passenger car satisfying the current [[European emission standards|Euro 5 standards]] (introduced September 2009) of 0.005&amp;nbsp;g/km. So one new wood heater emits as much PM2.5 per year as 367 passenger cars each driving 20,000&amp;nbsp;km a year. A recent European study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://air-climate.eionet.europa.eu/reports/ETCACC_TP_2009_1_European_PM2.5_HIA |title=Assessment of the health impacts of exposure to PM2.5 at a European levelETC/ACC Technical Paper 2009/1 |publisher=Air-climate.eionet.europa.eu |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722210417/http://air-climate.eionet.europa.eu/reports/ETCACC_TP_2009_1_European_PM2.5_HIA |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified PM2.5 as the most health-hazardous air pollutant, causing an estimated 492,000 premature deaths.  The next worst pollutant, ozone, is responsible for 21,000 premature deaths.

Because of the problems with pollution, the Australian Lung Foundation recommends using alternative means for climate control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lungfoundation.com.au/consultation-looks-at-reducing-emissions-from-wood-heaters/]{date=2014-06-01}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Lung Association "strongly recommends using cleaner, less toxic sources of heat. Converting a wood-burning fireplace or stove to use either natural gas or propane will eliminate exposure to the dangerous toxins wood burning generates including dioxin, arsenic and formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lungusa.org/press-room/press-releases/cleaner-alternatives-for-winter-heat.html |title=American Lung Association Cautions Against Wood-burning and Urges Cleaner Alternatives for Winter Heat - American Lung Association |publisher=Lungusa.org |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Renewable" should not be confused with "greenhouse neutral".  A recent peer-reviewed paper found that, even if burning firewood from a sustainable supply, [[methane emissions]] from a typical Australian wood heater satisfying the current standard cause more global warming than heating the same house with gas.  However, because a large proportion of firewood sold in Australia is not from sustainable supplies, Australian households that use wood heating often cause more global warming than heating three similar homes with gas.&lt;ref&gt;"Australian wood heaters currently increase global warming and health costs", Dorothy L. Robinson, Atmospheric Poolution Research, Article in Press, {{doi|10.5094/APR.2011.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High efficiency stoves should meet the following design criteria:
* Well sealed and precisely calibrated to draw a low yet sufficient volume of air. Air-flow restriction is critical; a lower inflow of cold air cools the furnace less (a higher temperature is thus achieved). It also allows greater time for extraction of heat from the [[exhaust gas]], and draws less heat from the building.
* The furnace must be well insulated to increase combustion temperature, and thus completeness.
* A well insulated furnace radiates little heat. Thus heat must be extracted instead from the exhaust gas duct. Heat absorption efficiencies are higher when the heat-exchange duct is longer, and when the flow of exhaust gas is slower.
* In many designs, the heat-exchange duct is built of a very large mass of heat-absorbing brick or stone. This design causes the absorbed heat to be emitted over a longer period - typically a day.

===Renewable natural gas===
[[Renewable natural gas]] is defined as gas obtained from [[biomass]] which is upgraded to a quality similar to [[natural gas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas, it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgc.dk/publikationer/konference/jkj_sustain_gas.pdf|publisher=Dgc.dk|title='Sustainable Gas Enters the European Gas Distribution System'|accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Energy research Centre of the Netherlands, renewable natural gas is 'cheaper than alternatives where biomass is used in a combined heat and power plant or local combustion plant'.&lt;ref&gt;Energy research Centre of the Netherlands [http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/2005/rx05187.pdf 'Heat from Biomass via Synthetic Natural Gas'] . Retrieved March 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy unit costs are lowered through 'favourable scale and operating hours', and end-user capital costs eliminated through distribution via the existing gas grid.

==Energy efficiency==
Renewable heat goes hand in hand with energy efficiency. Indeed, renewable heating projects depend heavily for their success on energy efficiency; in the case of solar heating to cut reliance on the requirement supplementary heating, in the case of wood fuel heating to cut the cost of wood purchased and volume stored, and in the case of heat pumps to reduce the size and investment in heat pump, heat sink and electricity costs.

Two main types of improvement can be made to a building's energy efficiency:

===Insulation===
Improvements to insulation can cut energy consumption greatly, making a space cheaper to heat and to cool. However existing housing can often be difficult or expensive to improve. Newer buildings can benefit from many of the techniques of [[superinsulation]]. Older buildings can benefit from several kinds of improvement:

* '''Solid wall insulation''': A building with solid walls can benefit from internal or external insulation. External wall insulation involves adding decorative weather-proof insulating panels or other treatment to the outside of the wall. Alternatively, internal wall insulation can be applied using ready-made insulation/plaster board laminates, or other methods. Thicknesses of internal or external insulation typically range between 50 and 100&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''Cavity wall insulation''': A building with cavity walls can benefit from insulation pumped into the cavity. This form of insulation is very cost effective{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.
* '''[[Programmable thermostat]]s''' allow heating and cooling of a room to be switched off depending the time, day of the week, and temperature. A bedroom, for example, does not need to be heated during the day, but a living room does not need to be heated during the night.
* '''Roof insulation'''
* '''Insulated windows and doors'''
* '''Draught proofing'''

=== Underfloor heating ===
[[Underfloor heating]] may sometimes be more energy efficient than traditional methods of heating:

* Water circulates within the system at low temperatures (35&amp;nbsp;°C - 50&amp;nbsp;°C) making gas boilers, wood fired boilers, and heat pumps significantly more efficient.
* Rooms with underfloor heating are cooler near the ceiling, where heat is not required, but warmer underfoot, where comfort is most required.
* Traditional radiators are frequently positioned underneath poorly insulated windows, heating them unnecessarily.

=== Waste-water heat recovery ===
[[File:Hot water heat recycling unit.jpg|thumb|right|Recycling heat.]]
It is possible to recover significant amounts of heat from waste hot water via [[hot water heat recycling]]. Major consumption of hot water is sinks, showers, baths, dishwashers, and clothes washers. On average 30% of a property's domestic hot water is used for showering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47685.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming fresh water is typically of a far lower temperature than the waste water from a shower. An inexpensive heat exchanger recovers up on average 40% of the heat that would normally be wasted, by warming incoming cold fresh water with heat from outgoing waste water.

The first '''Data-Collecting Satellite''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] '''Satélite de Coleta de Dados''') (aka '''SCD-1''') was launched on February 9, 1993.  It is the first [[satellite]] developed entirely in [[Brazil]] and it remains in operation in orbit to this date. SCD-1 was designed, developed, built, and tested by Brazilian scientists, engineers, and technicians working at [[INPE - Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais|National Institute of Space Research]] and in Brazilian industries. It was made to be launched with a Brazilian rocket in 1989. Once it was officially recognized that the rocket could not be completed until many years later, SCD-1, after undergoing minor adaptations, was finally launched with a [[Pegasus rocket]] made by [[Orbital Sciences]]. The rocket was launched from a [[B-52]] airplane while flying over the Atlantic Ocean.

== SCD-1 ==
SCD-1 is an experimental communication satellite with an environmental mission. It receives data collected on the ground or at sea by hundreds of automatic data-collecting platforms (DCPs) and retransmits all the information in a combined real-time signal back to tracking stations on Earth. Applications include hydrology, meteorology, and monitoring of the environment in general. The data are used by agencies such as the Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies Center ([[Centro de Previsão do Tempo e Estudos Climáticos]]—CPTEC), hydroelectric power managers, and both private and governmental institutions with many different interests. An example is [[meteorological]] and environmental data collected in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] region, including the levels of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. These data are transmitted to INPE and are used for monitoring [[forest fire]]s.

SCD-1 weighs approximately 110&amp;nbsp;kg and goes around the Earth every 100 minutes on a nearly circular orbit at about 760&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inpe.br/scd1/site_scd/scd1/osatelite.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The inclination of the orbit with respect to the plane of the equator is 25 degrees, providing excellent coverage of equatorial, tropical, and subtropical regions (up to about 35 degrees of latitude) around the world. The spin-stabilized spacecraft has the shape of an octagonal prism, with a diameter of 1 meter and a height near 70&amp;nbsp;cm without the antennas that are mounted on both base surfaces. It was originally designed for a life of one year with 80% probability, but it has survived 14 years in operation without any crippling functional failure. However, since its chemical (nickel-cadmium) batteries are now completely run down, the satellite can no longer be used while it is in the Earth's shadow.

After the buzz of the [[New Horizons]] spacecraft flyby of [[NASA]] in July 2015, revealing feature and characteristics on [[Pluto]], the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) will scan an area on the surface of Pluto, which possibly will be named after the Sátelite Coleta de Dados (SCD-1), as “[[Coleta de Dados Colles | Coleta de Dados]]”, located in the large [[Tombaugh Regio]], inside the area [[Sputnik Planitia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ourpluto.org/maps | title = Informal Names for the Features on Pluto and Charon | publisher = Our Pluto | date = 28 Jul 2015 | access-date = 6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than thirty companies were involved in the production of the SCD-1, with INPE itself providing much of the electronics.

== SCD-2 ==

The SCD-2 has the function to collect the environmental data to be later picked up by tracer stations and be distributed to organizations and to various users. The SCD-2 was launched on October 23, 1998, by a rocket type [[Pegasus rocket|Pegasus]], he was transported under the wing of a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, that launched him to 13&amp;nbsp;km altitude. It is the second satellite fruit MECB - [[Brazilian space program|Complete Brazilian Space Mission]] - program developed by INPE which already incorporated solar panels fitted with technology developed in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], in partnership with the project team of the satellite's power subsystem by [[INPE - Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais|INPE]].

On her 10th birthday, on 23 October 2008, the SCD-2 completed 52,807 orbits around the Earth. Within a decade, covered a distance of 2,365,088,861 kilometers, which corresponds to 3,112 times round trips to the moon and back (distance between Earth and the Moon: approximately 236,000 miles).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inpe.br/noticias/noticia.php?Cod_Noticia=501&lt;/ref&gt;

== CBERS ==
INPE has plans to develop other small to medium-size satellites in Brazil with domestic industry. An important on-going program (also started in the 1980s), [[CBERS]], is a partnership of China and Brazil. It has produced two polar-orbit sun-synchronous remote sensing satellites. Both were successfully launched by the Chinese, and CBERS-2 remains in operation.( &lt;- Outdatet and misplaced)

The '''Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|subtropical coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] of northeastern and Central [[Mexico]], extending into the state of [[Texas]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Setting==
The Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests are found at elevations of {{convert|1000|-|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] range, which runs north and south between the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coastal Plain]] to the east along the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the [[Mexican Plateau]] to the west. They are also found in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]], adjacent to the southern Sierra Madre Oriental. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|65600|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The southernmost forests transition to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]] in central [[Puebla]] state, near the southern end of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The forests extend almost continuously along the range through the states of [[Veracruz]], [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Nuevo León]], and northern Puebla. North of [[Monterrey]], the forests become discontinuous, extending as a series of [[sky island]]s through the states of Nuevo León and [[Coahuila]], and on into the [[Chisos Mountains|Chisos]] and [[Davis Mountains|Davis]] mountains of the [[Big Bend (Texas)|Big Bend]] region of western Texas. Other sky islands can be found on the higher peaks of the mountain ranges rising from the Mexican Plateau to the west.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Flora==
The dominant species are many species of [[pine]] including Nelson pinyon (''[[Pinus nelsonii]]''), [[Mexican pinyon]] (''P. cembroides''), smooth-bark Mexican pine (''[[Pinus pseudostrobus|P. pseudostrobus]]''), and [[Arizona pine]] (''P. arizonica''), and the oaks ''[[Quercus castanea]]'' and ''[[Quercus affinis|Q. affinis]]''. On the wetter slopes facing the ocean the most common trees are Mexican pinyon and ''[[Juniperus deppeana]]'', while on the drier western slopes weeping pinyon (''[[Pinus pinceana]]'') is more common. The forests are home to a great variety of other flora including [[agave]] and traditional food plants.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Fauna==
Mammals that inhabit this ecoregion include the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), which migrate along the [[Rio Grande]] from northern Coahuila to the Chisos Mountains in Texas, [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''), [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), [[cliff chipmunk]] (''Tamias dorsalis''), [[collared peccary]] (''Pecari tajacu''), [[white-nosed coati]] (''Nasua narica''), [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca'') and [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans'').

The [[maroon-fronted parrot]] (''Rhynchopsitta terrisi'') and [[Colima warbler]] (''Vermivora crissalis'') are endemic to this ecoregion. [[Wild turkey]]s (''Meleagris gallapavo''), [[peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus'') and [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') are also resident.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

Pine-oak forests in Coahuila are part of the migration route of monarch butterflies (''[[monarch butterfly|Danaus plexippus]]'').

== Overview ==

=== Why is aggregate stability important? ===
Aggregate stability is one of indicators of [[soil quality]], as it combines soil physical, chemical, and biological properties (Doran &amp; Parkin, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Doran, J.W. and T.B. Parkin. 1996. Quantitative indicators of soil quality: a minimum data set. In J.W. Doran and A.J. Jones, eds. Methods for Assessing Soil Quality. SSSA, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;). The formation of soil aggregates (or so-called secondary soil particles or peds) occurs due to interactions of primary soil particles (i.e., clay) through rearrangement, [[flocculation]] and cementation.

Aggregate stability has a direct impact on soil pore size distribution, which in turn has an impact on air and water retention and movement in soil.  A soil with good [[soil structure]] typically has a mix of micro-, meso-, and macropores. Therefore, with more aggregation, you would expect to have a higher total porosity compared to a poorly aggregated soil (Nimmo, 2004&lt;ref&gt;Nimmo, J.R., 2004, Porosity and Pore Size Distribution, ''in'' Hillel, D., ed. Encyclopedia of Soils in the Environment: London, Elsevier, v. 3, p. 295-303.&lt;/ref&gt;). Micropores are important for [[Water retention curve|water retention]] and [http://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/soil-components/3-soil-water/ storage] in soils, while macro- and mesopores allow for the [http://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/soil-components/3-soil-water/ movement of water] and air into the soil. A [http://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/soil-components/4-soil-air/ well aerated] soil is important for plant and microbial health. Without access to [[oxygen]], plant roots and [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] microorganisms are unable to [[Plant respiration|respire]], and can die. To have a high biodiversity of soil organisms it is important to have a mix of different pore sizes and habitats in the soil (Menta, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5772/51091|title=Biodiversity Conservation and Utilization in a Diverse World|last=Menta|first=Cristina|date=2012-08-29|publisher=InTech|isbn=9789535107194|language=en|doi=10.5772/51091}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Soil pores create space in the soil that allows for root penetrability. In a compacted soil with few aggregates and limited pore spaces, roots have difficulty growing and may be excluded from nutrients and water stored in different parts of the soil. Soils with good aggregate stability typically have a higher water [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration rate]], allowing more water into the soil profile faster, and are not susceptible to water ponding.

== Factors affecting aggregate formation ==
Soil aggregates are formed due to [[flocculation]] and cementation processes, and are enhanced by physical and biological processes. [http://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/soil-components/1-mineral-components/ Primary soil particles] ([[sand]], [[silt]], and [[clay]]) are subjected to these processes, and can stick together to form larger sub-microaggregates (&lt; 250 μm), microaggregates, and macroaggregates (&gt; 250 μm). It has been suggested that soil aggregates form hierarchically, meaning larger less dense aggregates are composed of smaller more dense aggregates (Kay, 1990;&lt;ref&gt;Kay, B.D., 1990. Rates of change of soil structure under different cropping systems. Adv. Soil Sci., 12:1-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Oades, 1993&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oades|first=J.M.|date=March 1993|title=The role of biology in the formation, stabilization and degradation of soil structure|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7061(93)90123-3|journal=Geoderma|volume=56|issue=1-4|pages=377–400|doi=10.1016/0016-7061(93)90123-3|issn=0016-7061}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Flocculation ===
[[Flocculation]] refers to a state when primary soil particles (sand, silt, and clay) are drawn to each other by inter-particle forces to create microscopic floccules (or clumps). &amp;nbsp;Inter-particle forces include: [[van der Waals force]]s, [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], and [[hydrogen bond]]ing. This is the opposite of [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], which occurs when individual primary soil particles are held apart. Soil particle dispersion and flocculation are mainly controlled by the soil [http://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/interactions-among-soil-components/4-soil-acidity/ pH], [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] (EC), and sodium content.

=== Cementation ===
Microscopic floccules, will become aggregates once they are stabilized through cementation by one or several cementing agents such as   [[carbonate]]s, [[gypsum]], [[sesquioxide]]s, [[clay]] particles, and [[organic matter|organic matter (Tisdall &amp; Oades, 1982]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TISDALL|first=J. M.|last2=OADES|first2=J. M.|date=June 1982|title=Organic matter and water-stable aggregates in soils|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1982.tb01755.x|journal=Journal of Soil Science|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=141–163|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1982.tb01755.x|issn=0022-4588}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[organic matter|)]].

==== ''Carbonates and Gypsum'' ====
[[Calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[magnesium carbonate]] (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) can enhance soil aggregation when associated with [[clay]] minerals. The [[calcium]] ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), through its cationic bridging effect on [[flocculation]] of [[clay]] and [[organic matter]] compounds, has a crucial role in the formation and stability of soil aggregates. [[Calcium]] can exchange with [[sodium]] on exchange sites. This, in turn, reduces soil particle dispersion,  [[Soil crust|surface crusting]], and aggregate [[Slaking (geology)|slaking]] associated with [[Sodic soil|sodic]] soils and indirectly increase aggregate stability (Nadler et al., 1996&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, A., G.J. Levy, R. Keren &amp; H. Eisenberg. (1996). Sodic calcareous soil reclamation as affected by water chemical composition and flow rate. ''Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J.'' 60:252-257.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== ''Sesquioxides'' ====
Tisdall and Oades (1982)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; found that [[iron]] and [[Aluminium|aluminum]] hydrous oxides (or [[sesquioxide]]s) can act as a cementing agents to form aggregates &gt;100 μm, this effect becomes more pronounced in soil containing &gt;10% [[sesquioxide]]s. &amp;nbsp;[[Sesquioxide]]s act as stabilizing agents for aggregates because iron and aluminum in solution act as flocculants (i.e., bridging cations between negatively charged soil particles), &amp;nbsp;and sesquioxides have potential to precipitate as gel on clay particles (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Amézketa, E. (1999) Soil Aggregate Stability: A Review, Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, 14:2-3, 83-151, DOI: 10.1300/J064v14n02_08&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== ''Clay Particles'' ====
Soil [[clay]] particles have varying effects on aggregate formation, depending on its type. Soil with 2:1 type of phyllosilicate clay minerals (e.g., montmoriollinite) typically have high [[Cation-exchange capacity|cation exchange capacity]] (CEC), which allows them to bind with polyvalently charged organic matter complexes to form microaggregates (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). Soil organic matter is therefore the main binding agent in these soils (Six ''et al.,'' 2000a&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, in soils with oxides and 1:1 type of phyllosiliacte clay minerals (e.g., kaolinite), soil organic matter is not the only binding agent and aggregate formation is also due to electrostatic charges between and among oxides and [[kaolinite]] particles. Therefore, in these soils, aggregation is less pronounced (Six ''et al.,'' 2000a&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).

==== ''Soil Organic Matter'' ====
[http://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/soil-components/2-organic-components/ Soil organic matter] can increase aggregate stability in soil, and can be classified based on how it is incorporated in soil aggregates in to:

# transient ([[polysaccharide]]s fraction of soil organic matter), 
# temporary ([[Hypha|fungal hyphae]] and [[Root|plant roots)]], and 
# persistent (resistant [[Aromatic Compounds|aromatic compounds]] that are associated with polyvalent metal cations and strongly adsorbed polymers). &amp;nbsp;

Temporary organic matter stabilizes macroaggregates (&gt; 250 μm), while transient and persistent organic matter stabilizes microaggregates (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). Soil or&lt;ref&gt;Kay, B. D. (1990): Rates of change of soil structure under different cropping systems. Adv. Soil Sci. 12, 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; ganic matter’s role in aggregate stability can be difficult to determine, due to several reasons:

# only part of the total soil organic matter plays a role in aggregate stability, 
# there is a threshold of soil organic matter, above which aggregate stability cannot be improved by addition of organic matter, and  
# organic matter is not the primary binding agent in that particular soil.

=== Physical Processes ===

==== ''Wetting and Drying'' ====
Soil wetting and drying cycles can have both a beneficial effect on soil aggregation (Utomo and Dexter, 1982;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UTOMO|first=W. H.|last2=DEXTER|first2=A. R.|date=December 1982|title=Changes in soil aggregate water stability induced by wetting and drying cycles in non-saturated soil|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1982.tb01794.x|journal=Journal of Soil Science|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=623–637|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1982.tb01794.x|issn=0022-4588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter et al., 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DEXTER|first=A. R.|last2=HORN|first2=R.|last3=KEMPER|first3=W. D.|date=June 1988|title=Two mechanisms for age-hardening of soil|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1988.tb01203.x|journal=Journal of Soil Science|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=163–175|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1988.tb01203.x|issn=0022-4588}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and a negative effect on soil aggregation (Soulides and Allison, 1961;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soulides|first=D. A.|last2=Allison|first2=F. E.|date=May 1961|title=EFFECT OF DRYING AND FREEZING SOILS ON CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION, AVAILABLE MINERAL NUTRIENTS, AGGREGATION, AND BACTERIAL POPULATION|url=https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1961/05000/Effect_of_Drying_and_Freezing_Soils_on_Carbon.1.aspx|journal=Soil Science|language=en-US|volume=91|issue=5|pages=291|issn=0038-075X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tisdall et al., 1978&lt;ref&gt;Tisdall, J.M., B. Cockroft &amp; N.C. Uren. 1978. The stability of soil aggregates as affected by organic materials, microbial activity and physical disruption. ''Aust. J. Soil Res.'' 16:9-17.&lt;/ref&gt;). &amp;nbsp;To help explain these contradictory results, it was hypothesized that soils will maintain a state of aggregate stability equilibrium. If soils have certain properties, a threshold level will be reached where a period of wetting and drying will lead to increases or decreases in aggregate stability depending on the aggregate stability of the soil at that point in time.

==== ''Shrinking and Swelling'' ====
Shrinking and swelling cycles of soil are closely linked with wetting and drying cycles; however, they are also dependent on the type of clay phyllosilicate minerals present. Soils with higher content of 2:1 types of phyllosilicate minerals (such as montmoriolinite), have a stronger cementation force acting during repeated wetting and drying cycles, which can increase soil aggregate stability (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). This is because 2:1 type phyllosilicate minerals swell and increase their volume with changing water content; meaning these soils expand when wet, and contract as they dry out. Through repeated shrinking and swelling action, soil aggregation occurs because of the rearrangement of soil particles due to the stress of increasing soil-water suction (Kay, 1990). Some soils even have the ability to “self-mulch”, meaning a desirable [[Soil structure|granular structure]] is formed at the surface of the soil due to the shrinking and swelling nature of the soil particles (Grant &amp; Blackmore, 1991&lt;ref&gt;Grant, C.D., and A.V. Blackmore. (1991). Self-mulching behavior in clay soils: its definition and measurement. ''Aust. J. Soil Res''., 29:155-173.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== ''Freezing and Thawing'' ====
When soils freeze and thaw, they undergo expansion and contraction. It was found that with higher water content in the soil at the time of freezing had a reducing effect on aggregate stability overall. &amp;nbsp;The water expands in these soils and breaks apart the aggregates into smaller aggregates, while pores created by the freezing collapse once soils thaw (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

=== Soil Biological Factors ===
Soil biological processes are most important in soils that do not have 2:1 phyllosilicate clay minerals, and are therefore lacking in shrinking and swelling properties that can aid in structural formation (Oades, 1993&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;). Soil organisms can have an indirect and direct effects on soil structure at different levels of aggregate formation. Macrooaggregates (&gt;2000 μm) are held together by [[Root|plant roots]] and [[Hypha|fungal hyphae]], mesoaggregates (20-250 μm) are held together by a combination of cementing agents including: [[sesquioxide]]s and persistent organic matter, and microaggregates (2-20 μm) are held together persistent organic bonds (Tisdall &amp; Oades, 1982&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;). Soil fauna mix soil particles with organic matter to create close associations with one another.

==== ''Soil Fauna'' ====
[[Earthworm]]s, [[termite]]s, and [[ant]]s are some of the most important [[invertebrate]]s that are capable of having an effect on [[soil structure]] (Lee &amp; Foster, 1991&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lee, K.E. &amp; R.C. Foster. 1992. Soil fauna and soil structure. ''Aust J. Soil Res.'' 29:745-746.&lt;/ref&gt;). When [[earthworm]]s ingest soil mineral and organic components, they can increase the structural stability of that soil through increased carbon-mineral associations and formation of casts, which increase aggregate stability (Tisdall &amp; Oades, 1982;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Oades 1993&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;). Some [[earthworm]]s are able to create stable microaggregates by [[flocculation]] of [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions during digestion (Shiptalo &amp; Protz, 1989&lt;ref&gt;Shipitalo MJ, Protz R (1989) Chemistry and micromorphology of aggregation in earthworm casts. Geoderma 45(3):357–374&lt;/ref&gt;). Some [[Arthropod|microarthropods]], including [[mite]]s and [[Springtail|collembola]], although they are small, because there are large numbers of them, they are able to improve soil structure. These organisms are often associated with forest ecosystems, and can improve soil structure through the production of fecal pellets, from ingestion of a mixture of humic materials and plant debris (Lee &amp; Foster, 1991&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;).

==== ''Fungi and Plant Roots'' ====
Tisdall and Oades (1982)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; found that [[root]]s and [[Hypha|fungal hyphae]] are important factors in aggregate formation. They are considered a temporary aggregate binding agent, and are typically associated with early stages of aggregate formation. Roots can act as a binding agent themselves, and can produce exudates that supply carbon to the rhizosphere organisms and soil fauna. &amp;nbsp;Also, since roots uptake water, they can have a drying effect on the soil in their vicinity. [[Hypha|Fungal hyphae]] can serve as binding agent that stabilizes macroaggregates and they also secrete [[polysaccharide]]s that contribute to microaggregation.

=== Other Factors Affecting Aggregate Stability ===

==== ''Agricultural Management'' ====
How farmers manage their land can have profound changes in aggregate stability, which can either increase or decrease aggregate stability. The main disruptors of aggregate stability are: [[tillage]], traffic from [[Agricultural machinery|equipment]], and traffic from [[livestock]] (Oades, 1993&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;). [[Tillage]] can disrupt soil aggregation in several ways: (i) it brings [[subsoil]] to the surface, thereby exposing it to precipitation and freeze-thaw cycles, and (ii) it changes soil moisture, temperature, and oxygen level, thereby increasing [[decomposition]] and carbon loss (Six ''et al.,'' 2000a&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). Using reduced tillage or [[No-till farming|zero tillage]] practices have been shown to improve soil aggregation compared to conventional [[tillage]] methods (Six et al., 2000b&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.550.9255&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The use of [[cover crop]]s has been shown to increase soil aggregation (Liu et al., 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Aiguo|last2=Ma|first2=B. L.|last3=Bomke|first3=A. A.|date=2005-11-01|title=Effects of Cover Crops on Soil Aggregate Stability, Total Organic Carbon, and Polysaccharides|url=https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/69/6/2041|journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal|language=en|volume=69|issue=6|pages=2041–2048|doi=10.2136/sssaj2005.0032|issn=1435-0661}}&lt;/ref&gt;), due to the increase of soil [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and soil cover that they provide. [[Perennial crop]]s typically require a halt in [[tillage]], which prevents aggregate disruption, and allows plant to develop an extensive root system which can promote aggregate stability. Additionally, inputs of organic matter in the form of [[mulch]] or [[manure]] application can increase aggregation by adding carbon to the soil matrix and increasing rates of biological activity in the soil (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). Higher [[Livestock grazing comparison|stocking rate]] of livestock such as cattle can decrease the aggregate stability of soil due to [[Soil compaction (agriculture)|compaction]] of soil and loss of vegetation.

==== ''Soil Conditioners'' ====
[[Soil conditioner]]s are amendments that can be applied to the soil to improve properties such as [[Soil structure|structure]] and [[Soil water (retention)|water retention]] to improve soils for their intended use, but not specifically for [[soil fertility]], although many soil amendments can alter the soil fertility. Some typical amendments include: [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[gypsum]], [[sulfur]], [[compost]], wood wastes, [[peat]], [[manure]], [[biosolids]], and biological amendments. In order to be effective, soil conditioners must be spread evenly across the field, be applied at the correct time to prevent nutrient loss, and have the correct nutrient content. Additionally, application of soil conditioners is site specific, and should be approached on a case by case basis, as a soil conditioner may not work on all soils equally (Hickman &amp; Whitney, 1988&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, J. S. and D. A. Whitney. 1988. Soil conditioners. North Central Regional Extension Publication 295. 4 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== ''Climate'' ====
Variations in [[climate]] and [[season]]s can have an effect on aggregate stability of the soil. &amp;nbsp;According to Dimuyiannis (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimoyiannis|first=D.|date=2009-05|title=Seasonal soil aggregate stability variation in relation to rainfall and temperature under Mediterranean conditions|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.1785|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|language=en|volume=34|issue=6|pages=860–866|doi=10.1002/esp.1785|issn=0197-9337}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Mediterranean climate, it was found that aggregate stability varied on a nearly cyclical pattern, with lower aggregate stability in the winter and early spring compared to higher aggregate stability in the summer months. &amp;nbsp;This variation in aggregate stability was found to be highly correlated with total monthly rainfall and average monthly rainfall. Aggregate stability can be impacted by the amount and intensity of precipitation. &amp;nbsp;Higher amounts of precipitation and irregular rainfall events can decrease aggregate stability and increase erosion. &amp;nbsp;Also, higher temperatures can increase the rates of decomposition in soil, which reduces the amount of carbon on the site, which can reduce aggregate stability. Many of the influences that climate has on soil aggregate stability are due to interactions of soil type with wetting/drying, shrinking/swelling, and freezing/thawing (Amézketa, 1999&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

== How is aggregate stability measured? ==
Soil aggregate stability can be measured in several ways, since:

1. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Soils aggregates can be destabilized by various external pressures brought about by wind, water, or machinery.

2. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Soil aggregate stability can be determined at different size scales.

In most cases, the wet aggregate stability method is more relevant, because this method mimics the effects of [[water erosion]], which is the driving force of erosion in most environments. &amp;nbsp;However, in an [[Arid|arid environment]], dry aggregate stability may be the more applicable method because it mimics [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]] which is the driving force of erosion in these environments . &amp;nbsp;Gilmour et al. (1948&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, C.M., O.N. Allan, and E. Troug. (1948). Soil aggregation as influenced by the growth of mold species, kind of soil, and organic matter. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. Proc. 13:292-296.&lt;/ref&gt;) describes a method where aggregates are submersed in water, and the soil that is slaked off the aggregate is measured. Emerson (1964&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, W.W. 1964. The slaking of soil crumb as influenced by clay mineral composition. ''Aust. J. Soil Res.'' 2:211-217.&lt;/ref&gt;) used a method whereby aggregates were subjected to different internal swelling pressures from different concentrations of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl). Some common methodologies are described below.[[File:Soil sieve nest.png|thumb|Soil sieve nests]]

=== ''Wet Aggregate Stability Method'' ===
A wet sieving apparatus described by Yoder (1936&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, R.E., 1936. A direct method of aggregate analysis of soils and a study of the physical nature of erosion losses. J. Am. Soc. Agron., 28:337-351.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be used to determine wet aggregate stability in the following procedure by Kember and Chepil (1965&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, W.D., and W.S. Chepil. (1965). Size distribution of aggregates. p. 499-510. In C.A. Black (ed.) Methods of soil analysis. Part 1. Argom. Monogr. 9. ASA, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;), which was adapted by Nimmo and Perkins (2002&lt;ref&gt;Nimmo, J. R., and Perkins, K.S. (2002). Aggregate stability and size distribution. Pages 317-328 in J.H. Dane, and G.C. Topp (eds.) Methods of soil analysis, Part 4: Physical methods. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;).

1. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sieve soil to obtain soil samples with aggregates between 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm size aggregates.

2. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Weigh out 15 g of these 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm sized aggregates.

3. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Place onto top of sieve nests with sieve size openings of 4.76&amp;nbsp;mm, 2.00&amp;nbsp;mm, 1.00&amp;nbsp;mm, and 0.21&amp;nbsp;mm.

4. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Slowly wet the soils using a spray bottle and humidifier until aggregates become saturated and are glistening.

5. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Place sieve nests into the wet sieving apparatus with 30 rotations/minute for approximately 10 minutes.

6. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Remove the sieve nests and place in the oven at 105&amp;nbsp;°C for 24 hours.

7. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Place approximately 7 g of wet soil into a weighed tin, then place in the oven at 105&amp;nbsp;°C for 24.

8. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Weigh the dried soil each of the sieve nests[[File:Soil sieve nest holder.png|thumb|Soil sieve nest holder]]
[[File:Wet sieving apparatus with soil sieve nest holder and nests in place.png|thumb|Wet sieving apparatus with soil sieve nest holder and nests in place]]
[[File:Soil sieve nests placed in the oven..png|thumb|Soil sieve nests placed in the oven]]9. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Samples can then be placed in a hexametaphosphate solution, to disperse the particles, then washed through the sieve again to remove sand particles. &amp;nbsp;These sand particles can then be oven dried at 105&amp;nbsp;°C for 24 hours, weighted, and accounted for in the calculation for aggregate stability.

To calculate the mean weight, the following formulae can be used: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;= Ws&lt;sub&gt;4.76&lt;/sub&gt;/ (Ws/1+ø)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= Ws&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(Ws/1+ø)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= Ws&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(Ws/1+ø)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt;= Ws&lt;sub&gt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt;/(Ws/1+ø)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;&lt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt;= 1- (S&lt;sub&gt;4.76&lt;/sub&gt;+ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ S&lt;sub&gt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ø = (Ws&lt;sub&gt;wet&lt;/sub&gt;– Ws&lt;sub&gt;dry&lt;/sub&gt;) / Ws&lt;sub&gt;dry&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;big&gt;MWD (mm) = (S&lt;sub&gt;4.76&lt;/sub&gt;*4.76)+(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*2)+(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*1)+(S&lt;sub&gt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt;*0.21)+(S&lt;sub&gt;&lt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt;*0.105)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For formulas:
Ws&lt;sub&gt;4.76&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.76&amp;nbsp;mm sieve

Ws&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;nbsp;mm sieve

Ws&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;mm sieve

Ws&lt;sub&gt;0.21&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.21&amp;nbsp;mm sieve

Ws&lt;sub&gt;wet&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of soil wet

Ws&lt;sub&gt;dry&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of soil dry

=== ''Dry Aggregate Stability Method'' ===
A dry sieving rotary cylinder described by Chepil (1962&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chepil|first=W.S.|date=1962|title=A compact rotary sieve and the importance of dry sieving in physical soil analysis|url=https://infosys.ars.usda.gov/WindErosion/publications/Andrew_pdf/714.pdf|journal=Soil Science Society of America Proceedings|volume= 26| issue = 1|pages=4–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be used in combination with a nested sieve design, as described by the following procedure by Metting and Rayburn (1983&lt;ref&gt;Metting, B., and W.R. Rayburn. (1983). The influence of a microalgal conditioner on selected Washington soils: an empirical study. ''Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 47:682-''685.&lt;/ref&gt;):

1. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sieve soil samples to obtain aggregates from 0.92-1.68&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

2. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Weigh out 2&amp;nbsp;kg of soil sample aggregates.

3. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Arrange soil sieve nests with openings of &gt;0.84, 0.84-0.42, and &lt;0.42&amp;nbsp;mm.

4. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Aggregates were then fed onto the sieve nests using a conveyor belt at a speed of 10&amp;nbsp;mm/s.

5. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The rotary cylinder is then operated at 10 rotations per minute until the complete sample has been separated into aggregate fractions &gt;0.84, 0.84-0.42, and &lt;0.42&amp;nbsp;mm.[[File:Soil sieve nests with aggregates.png|thumb|Soil sieve nests after removal from the oven with dry soil aggregates]]6. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Dry stability is then measured as a percentage of aggregates that are &gt;0.42&amp;nbsp;mm following rotary cylinder method.

'''Tapiolite''' [([[iron|Fe]], [[manganese|Mn]])([[niobium|Nb]], [[tantalum|Ta]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is a black [[mineral]] series that is an ore of [[niobium]] and [[tantalum]]. The tapiolite group includes tapiolite-(Fe) or ferrotapiolite and tapiolite-(Mn) or manganotapiolite.&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-3887.html Mindat tapiolite group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rruff.info/doclib/hom/ferrotapiolite.pdf Ferrotapiolite in the Handbook of Mineralogy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rruff.info/doclib/hom/manganotapiolite.pdf Manganotapiolite in the Handbook of Mineralogy]&lt;/ref&gt; Tapiolite-(Fe) is by far the more common of the two.&lt;ref name=MindatFe&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-1531.html Tapiolite-Fe on Mindat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MindatMn&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-2523.html Tapiolite-Mn on Mindat]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The minerals have a submetallic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] and a high [[specific gravity]] with tapiolite-Fe having a higher specific gravity (7.90)&lt;ref name=MindatFe/&gt; versus 7.72 for tapiolite-Mn.&lt;ref name=MindatMn/&gt;

The mineral was named in 1863 after the forest god [[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]] of Finnish mythology, and the original tapiolite material came from [[Sukula]], [[Tammela, Finland|Tammela]], [[Tavastia Proper]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Tapiolite.shtml webmineral Tapiolite]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tapiolite is very close to ''[[columbite]]'' and ''[[tantalite]]''. Those minerals have the same chemical composition, but different crystal symmetry [[orthorhombic]] for tantalite or columbite and [[tetragonal]] for tapiolite.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cerny et al. "The tantalite-tapiolite gap: natural assemblages versus experimental data" Canadian Mineralogist 30 (1992) 587 [http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/cm/vol30/CM30_587.pdf free download]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal vacuum chamber''' is a [[vacuum chamber]] in which the [[Radiation|radiative]] thermal environment is controlled.

Typically the thermal environment is achieved by passing [[liquid]]s or [[fluid]]s through thermal shrouds for cold [[temperature]]s or through the application of thermal [[Lamp (fixture)|lamps]] for high [[temperature]]s.

Thermal vacuum chambers are frequently used for testing [[spacecraft]] or parts thereof under a simulated [[Outer space|space]] environment.

'''Tropical Asia''' is a region in [[Asia]] that experiences [[tropical climate]]. It is physiogeographically and economically rich in natural resources and biodiversity, including many species of agricultural value.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bydesign.com/fossilfuels/choice/html/ipccc6_tropical_asia.html|title=Tropical Asia needs to try something new|accessdate=2007-03-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110082042/http://www.bydesign.com/fossilfuels/choice/html/ipccc6_tropical_asia.html|archivedate=2006-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/regional/282.htm|title=Ecologically diverse, Urbanly worse|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 16 countries of tropical Asia ranging in size from around 610&amp;nbsp;km² (Singapore) to 3,000,000&amp;nbsp;km² (India).&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt; Its population, is dominantly rural&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;—however, in 1995, a census showed a [[region]] with 6 out of 25 of the large cities. The population is 1.6 billion, likely to reach 2.4 billion in 2025.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt; Climate in tropical Asia is subject to seasonal weather patterns with the two [[monsoon]]s and the amount of [[tropical cyclone]]s in the three core areas of [[cyclogenesis]] (the [[Bay of Bengal]], north [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[South China Sea]]). The climate varies over several environmental factors such as: growing [[urbanization]], land [[industrialization]] and [[economic development]] or the opposite [[land degradation]], [[environmental issues]], and increased [[pollution]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;

==Bionetwork==

In tropical Asia, the distribution and character of the rainforest changes with elevation in the mountains. In Thailand, for instance, the area of tropical forests could increase from 45% to 80% of the total forest cover, while in Sri Lanka, a substantial change in dry forest and decrease in wet forest might occur.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt; With predictable increases in [[evapotranspiration]] and rainfall changeability, likely a negative impact on the viability of freshwater wetlands will occur, resulting in contraction and desiccation. Sea level and temperature rises are the most likely major climate change-related stresses on ecosystems.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  Coral reefs might be capable of surviving this intensification, but suffer bleaching from high temperatures. Landward migration of mangroves and tidal wetlands is likely to be inhibited by human infrastructure and human activities.

==Coastal lands==

Coastal lands, in particular, are very vulnerable to major climate changes especially on seas.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  Particularly, heavily settled and intensified used low-level coastal plains, deltas, and islands are particularly susceptible to coastal erosion and land loss, sea flooding and barrage, especially vulnerable to coastal erosion and land loss, inundation and sea flooding, upstream movement of the saline/freshwater front and seawater incursion into freshwater lenses.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  Mainly at risk are large delta regions of [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]], and the low-lying areas of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  Socio-economic effects may be noticeable to major cities and ports, tourist resorts, artisanal and commercial fishing and coastal agriculture, and infra-structure development. Global studies have expected the dislodgment of several millions of people from the region's coastal zone, probably a 1-metre rise in sea level.

==Hydrology==

In tropical Asia, the Himalayas are crucial to the provision of water of the continental monsoon.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt; Augmented temperatures and seasonal variability could cause a backdrop of glaciers and increasing danger from glacial lake outburst floods. Then, a diminution of average flow of snow-fed rivers, mixed with an increase in peak flows and sediment yield, could have major effects on hydropower generation, urban water supply and agriculture. Supply of hydropower generation from snow-fed rivers can occur in the short term, though not in the long term—run off snow-fed rivers might change as well. As stated before, an increased amount economic, agriculture, and industrial resources, can affect climate, but it can put an extra stress on water. Lower level basins are expected to be most affected. Hydrological changes on island and drainage basins will be relatively low to tropical Asia, despite those relate to sea rise.

==Food ration==

The sensitivity of major cereal and tree crops, changes in temperature, moisture and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of the magnitudes estimated for the region has been done in many studies.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt; One instance is the influences on rice fields, wheat yield and sorghum yield imply that any increase in production associated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fertilization will most likely be offset by reductions in yield from temperature or moisture changes. Even though climate impression may result huge changes in crop yields, storage, and distribution., the continuing effect of the region-wide changes is tentative because of varietal disparity; local disparity in emergent season, crop management, etc.( the lack of inclusion of possible diseases, pests, and microorganisms in crop model simulations); and the vulnerability of agricultural (especially low-income rural population) areas to periodic environmental hazards, such as floods, droughts and cyclones.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;

==Human health==

The occurrence and level of some vector-borne diseases are anticipated to rise with global warming.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  [[Malaria]], [[schistosomiasis]] and [[dengue]], that are significant causes of humanity and morbidity in tropical Asia, are very sensitive to climate and are likely to spread into new regions on the margins of currently widespread areas as a result of climate change. Lately affected populations initially would go through higher fatality rates.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  According to one study, specifically focused on climate influences on infectious disease in present vulnerable regions, a growth in epidemic potential of 12-27 per cent for malaria and 31 to 47 per cent for dengue and a decrease of schistosomiasis of 11-17 per cent are expected under a range of GCM scenarios through climate change.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;  Waterborne and water related infectious diseases, already accounting for the majority of epidemic emergencies in the area, are also expected to increase when higher temperatures and higher humidity are placed over on existing conditions and estimated upsurge in population, urbanization, deduction of water quality and other trends.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cde"/&gt;

==Tropical rainforest resources==

===Edible plants===

Tropical Asia has an abundance of edible resources.&lt;ref name="def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/maroon/foodways/tropical_rainforest_edible_plant.htm|title=Tropical Asian Edible Rainforest plants|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following section involves various edible resource plants.

Bananas are the most famous members of ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'' with 21 species and edible subspecies.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; Especially in the Mayan area, it is probably native to Southeast Asia and widely refined in the tropics.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; Black pepper is vine to the East Indies—made by drying the whole fruit (peppercorn); white pepper is made by first hulling the fruit, then grinding. The majority of production is in India and Indonesia; outside the region, America is a chief importer. Four of the main cultivators of this plant are [[capsicum annuum]]: [[cayenne pepper]], [[sweet pepper]], [[paprika]], and [[jalapenos]] grown in temperate regions.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;

Native to India, [[saffron]], [[vanilla]], and [[cardamom]] are the most expensive spices.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; [[Cashews]], originally from tropical [[The Americas|America]], are a rich nut full of vitamins. Further on, cocoa/chocolate as well as the soft drink [[cola]], is native to lowland tropical America, but is confined through the west African tropics. Citrus fruits are of the most valued fruits in tropical Asia. More than 55 million tons are sold annually, including [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], [[grapefruit]]s, [[tangerine]]s, and more.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; The largest citrus is the [[pummelo]]. The scented flower buds of [[clove]]s come from a tropical evergreen tree native to [[Zanzibar]], [[Madagascar]], and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; [[Coconut]]s are originally native to the [[Indo-Pacific area]] and are around every tropical area except rainforests. They can be used for oil, fruit, and [[fiber]]s. Coffee, probably native to North East Africa, is grown throughout the tropics.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;

In addition, grown throughout the tropics is [[mango]], native to India (valuable in many parts) and from Southeast Asia (includes root tubers used as spice and perfumes). [[Mung bean]] is also native to India, is a potentially prosperous food.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; Nutmeg comes from the trees of an island in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. Mace is formed of nutmeg, and is used as spice. The peanut, native to [[South America]], is commercially spread in [[tropical]], [[subtropical]], and [[temperate]] regions—it is used as a chief source of oils and protein.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; Another important tropical and subtropical plant is [[pineapple]], likely domestic by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] of Brazil and [[Paraguay]] during the Pre-Columbian Era. Continuing on, Sesame is an early African oil seed plant—grown primarily in [[Southeast Asia]].  Squash is native to many American tropics and is cultivated tropical and subtropical America and temperate zones. Native to Southeast Asia and cultivated in India, [[turmeric]] is dried, ground rhizomes, and produce the spice. Then of the [[legume]] family, [[tamarind]], is thought to be originally from India. It is grown throughout the tropics and used as a table fruit, drink, preserves, and medicinal properties.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; Vanilla is indigenous to tropical America, it is most commercially important of all the 35,000 species of [[orchid]]. It is made from the dried seeds of the rainforest orchid tree.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt; It is widely grown, especially in Madagascar.

===Human-health plants===

''This is not an advertisement for these medicines, but a discussion of these plants.''

[[Anise]] manages the upper respiratory problems like bronchitis, coughs, and stuffy noses.  Moreover, it relieves upset stomach and aids digestion.&lt;ref name="efg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/maroon/foodways/medicinals_and_tonics.htm|title=Human Health plantics|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful to curb flatulence and aids asthma. It also alleviates female organ troubles and conditions. [[Castor oil]] is a cathartic reliever. The practice is a poultice of warm oil soaked in wool flannel and applied with a heating pad (1 hour, 3 times a week) to cause relief of arthritis, [[callus]]es and corns, colds, [[colitis]], [[cysts]], [[gallstones]], [[gout]], headaches, [[hepatitis]] and warts, [[ichthyoids]], [[indigestion]], [[Melanocytic nevus|mole]]s, [[seborrhea]], [[nervous tics]], [[varicose veins]], even [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt;

[[Cocoa butter]] and [[coconut]] oil are good for the complexion.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; Tropical vines such as [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and [[sweet potatoes]] also have these abilities and are good for eyes and intestines.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; [[Cinnamon]] and turmeric help regulate [[blood]] sugar (triple the capability of insulin to metabolize glucose in the laboratory).&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; It is taken in small amounts on cereal: ½ teaspoon or so. Cloves also provide short-term pain relief, cure mild depression, are a [[sedative]] and sleep tonic, and help digestion. [[Corn silk]] cures kidney problems and cleanses them, and is a diuretic. Cumin has anti-cancer properties (known to increase a chemical in the body that protects against cancer).  It blocks 83% of the chromosome damage usually caused by a cancer-causing chemical.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; It is cooked with [[beans]] and [[lentils]]. The Seminole Maroons also use cumin seed tea to relieve labor pains.

Dandelion greens work to purify the system, especially during leisure. Garlic is supposedly a life span enhancer.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; Its abilities include: lowering blood pressure, cold and flu prevention, internal vermin, diarrhea, blood sugar problems such as diabetes, pains in the muscles and joints, food poisoning, high cholesterol, urinary tract infections, heals wounds and yeast infections.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; Ginger, also has a medical use for controlling colds, helps digestion, enhances circulation, helps pain relief and [[nausea]], relieves slight arthritis pain, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, etc. Onions also possess several of those abilities.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; Lemon and Lines and Mace and nutmeg also prevents flus and viruses, the latter also helps clear thinking and helps circulation.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt;

Mint helps/aids/controls: headaches, female conditions, [[indigestion]], nausea, diarrhea, asthma and dryness of breath, toothaches, digestion; poultices for headaches, trouble in muscles and joints. Peanuts, then serve as tension preventatives.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; It is an oil for massage gout, arthritis, [[bursitis]], and more. Black Pepper is also a cancer pre-emptive, in many occasions a lifespan enhancer.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; It helps heart problems such as [[heart disease|disease]] and high cholesterol. Hot peppers, a [[capsaicin]] main ingredient, is a pain reliever that prevents colds, flus, and those above. In addition, [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]s keeps the heart healthy by containing high potassium. Poppy seeds are cancer presenters (blocking 80% of the chromosomal damage in [[carcinogen]]).

Spices have a high amount of biological activity and enhance life.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt; Next, [[Thyme]] helps with/does: helps digestion., breaks fever, relieves the following: headaches, sore throats, uterine problems, [[phlegm]], shortness of breath, [[flatulence]], [[colic]], [[stale breath]], etc. Tomatoes aid colds and flus.  Seeds of Watermelon are good for kidneys; relieves hypertension, cystitis, insomnia.&lt;ref name="efg"/&gt;

==Tropical destinations==

;Prehentian Islands, Malaysia

The [[Perhentian Island]]s is a group of two small islands in [[Northeastern Malaysia]]: [[Perhentian Besar]] (or ”Big Perhentian”) and Perhentian Kecil ( or" Small Perhentian").&lt;ref name="fgh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicaldestinations.info/asia/perhentian-islands-malaysia/#more-17|title=Preview the Prehentians|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Small abandoned of [[Susu Dara]], [[Seringgi]] and [[Pulau Rawa|Rawa]] lie off [[Kecil]].&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; The area belongs to [[Pulau Redang National Marine Park]], which is a marinal site especially for fishing. In Malay, the word “Perhentian” means “point to stop”, referring to their hoary role as a waypoint for traders between [[Bangkok]] and [[Malaysia]]. The islands were sparingly inhabited by fishermen for centuries, although tourism accounts now for most economic activity.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt;

In the Perhentian, the most common activities are scuba diving, sunbathing, and snorkeling.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; The Perhentian offers detailed diving and draw diving skills. Competition for dives is competitive, though quite cheap, averaging out to RM60-80 per dive depending on how many dives done and a person brings their own gear.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; There are 5 dive centers on Kecil’s Long Beach: Spice Divers, Coral Sky Divers, Sea dragon Divers, Turtle Bay Divers and Sunlight Divers.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; For Snorkeling, all resorts rent out snorkeling gear (RM30 a day for mask, snorkel and fins) and organize snorkeling tours throughout the islands. General snorkeling spots on Besar include [[Teluk Pauh]] (on the left of the beach in front of the PI Resort), [[Shark Point]] and [[Tanjung Basi]]. Sharks (though usually at the bottom of the reef) are most commonly seen on boat, at a very small beach, between Shark Point and the Teluk Dalam large beach.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; [[Turtle]]s, are most commonly viewed in the middle of the beach in front of Perhentian Island Resort, where the sandy bottom is covered with algae.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt;

Many of the smaller resorts of the island offer buffet-style meals with a variety of Western and Malaysian dishes. Larger beaches, such as the [[Pasir Panjang]], offer a greater variety of eating options Meals.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; Since most of the island imports seafood, it is served several times on mainland.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; Mainly people travel to the islands by the provincial capitals [[Kota Bharu]] or [[Kuala Terengganu]]. Although the nearest railroad station is [[Tenah Merah]], most tourists prefer Khotu Bharu for better service.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; Since the islands have neither roads nor airport, arriving to the islands requires a rough speedboat trip with two large outboard motors. On the islands other than from walking, the only way of transport are water taxis.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; Due to the eastern monsoon, the season in the Perhentian is effectively limited to the period between April and October.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt; Beyond this, the seas can be extremely rough and most space options are closed.&lt;ref name="fgh"/&gt;

;Rai Leh, Thailand

''Rai Leh'', or ''Railay'' in [[Thailand]] is, a tourist area located on the [[Andaman Coast]] of Thailand, in Krabi Province, is largely known as a rock climbing spot, open to climbers from all over the world and for its gigantic limestone.&lt;ref name="rai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicaldestinations.info/asia/fine-sand-beaches-and-mountains-on-rai-leh-thailand/#more-18|title=Towering limestone|accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peninsula surrounded by ocean and mountains, final entrée can only be by boat. “Long-tails” leave from Ao Nang (10 minutes, 60 baht/person) and Krabi (30 minutes), whose towns are the gateways to Rai Leh. Another way of access to Rai Leh is on the regular ferries that run between Ko Lanta, Ko Phi Phi, and Phuket (mainly in the dry season: November–May)
From [[Bangkok]] are flights go to Krabi and Phuket, direct bus services, and trains to Surat Thani and connections by bus.

The topography of the Rai leh is in four primary areas. Phra Nang is a one white sand beach, on the southern tip of the peninsula. Rai Leh (East) is the mangrove side of the peninsula, used by long-tails to/from Krabi. Rai Leh (West), a fine white sand beach with shallow water, where most long-tails arrive from Ao Nang. Then, Ton Sai, which is a cove around the corner from Rai Ley West; rock-climbers and backpackers and practice climbing.

;Boracay Island, Philippines

The '''[[Boracay]] Island of the Philippines''' is a vivid island noted by long white sand beaches among the popular beach destinations such as Indonesia, Thailand, and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="asp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicaldestinations.info/asia/boracay-island-philippines/|title=Boracay is not Boring, okay|accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boracay can only be reached by ferry from [[Caticlan]]. SEAir serves up to 28 flights a day, each flight about as 35 minutes, from Manila to Caticlan Airport. Another way is through the [[Kalibo Airport]] on the other side of [[Aklan Island]]. From Kalibo, visitors take a two-hour (2-hour) ride to Caticlan. Three transportations get tourists from Kalibo to Catlican: Mini-vans, buses and other rental vehicles.

==Wildlife==

Some vertebrates have developed the ability to glide through the air.&lt;ref name="ghi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildasia.net/main.cfm?parentID=2&amp;page=article&amp;articleID=312|title=The Flying Reptiles of Tropical Asia: Evolution Takes a Leap (part 1)|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some fish jump out of the water to escape predators, expand their large pectoral fins and glide nearly hundreds of yards.&lt;ref name="ghi"/&gt; As well, many frogs have long-webbed, elongate fingers and toes that function like parachutes when they leap from the leaves and branches of trees to glide across the forest.

Several groups of mammals, for example [[colugos]], and [[rodent]]s have developed many different ways to move through the air. In Southeast Asia, the ability to glide in modern, non-avian reptiles has arisen at least three, maybe four times for lizards, and once in snakes.&lt;ref name="ghi"/&gt;

In Southeast Asia, the [[Agamidae]] holds [[gliding lizards]] that are arboreal, diurnal, prominent predators who signal another by puffing out their throats and expanding their chests to show their radiant colour patterns.&lt;ref name="ijk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildasia.net/main.cfm?page=article&amp;articleID=324|title=The Flying Reptiles of Tropical Asia: Evolution Takes a Leap (part 2)|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, they jump from branch to branch for prey or to escape predation. When threatened, Green Crested Lizards leap from one tree to next, splay out their limbs, and expand their rib cages during flight.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt;

Open surfaces are often the place where ''[[Draco (genus)|Draco]]'', (black bearded) gilding lizards communicate with each other.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt; When not flying, their heads are usually seen sitting head up on the trunks of the trees; their wings creatively folded to their bodies.  Most of their day is spent feeding on ants up and down trees, making for the majority of their diet.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt; Once in a while, they’ll want to change outings and leap from the tree, extend their ribs to open their wings, and glide to the next tree. The degree and speed of the glide depends on a couple of aspects: the height of the lizard on the tree and the surface area of the wing comparative to the weight of the body.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt;

The orange-haired gliding lizard has a thick neck and heavy body; it has small wings however, but despite its pace, it moves relatively fast.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt; To pick up enough speed, it commonly needs to fold down its wing for a period of time.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt; Therefore, they are seen on the tallest trees where they can safely dive to gain momentum to glide. Their flight structure helps separate them ecologically, keeping them from direct opposition with one another for some of the rainforest's resources.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt; In some areas of the forest, up to eight different species of ''Draco'' may appear together. Generally, they are closely related species with unique, restrictive life histories living in the same area, the potential for opposition is likely.&lt;ref name="ijk"/&gt;

Geckos are another notable gliding reptile.&lt;ref name="klm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildasia.net/main.cfm?page=article&amp;articleID=325|title=The Flying Reptiles of Tropical Asia: Evolution Takes a Leap (part 3)|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wings lack the elaborate thoracic (chest) [[mutation]] of gliding lizards and are composed mainly of a large flap of skin along their flanks.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; The flaps stay rolled across the belly until the lizard leaps off a tree the time they become inertly opened by air during the fall. Additionally, the body flaps are extended flaps along the sides of the head, neck, and tail; back sides of the hind limbs; and extensive webbing on the hands and feet. In flight, all of their wings are extended and splayed, creating the parachute effect.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; [[The Frilly Gecko]], the smallest of them, travel from trees uniquely on the lowest part of the same tree to avoid predators. Geckos are cryptic species that are hidden during the day and active during the night, unlike the many arboreal agamids. In addition, their color patterns normally match the substrate where they stay allowing them to go ignored.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt;

The flat-tailed gecko (''Cosymbotus platyuurus''), a species strongly related to the frilly gecko, is another example of intermediacy. It similarly folds skin along the head, body, limbs, and tail as the Frilly Gecko but not nearly as developed.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; It lays these flaps out on the trunk of the tree to prevent the curving of the body from a shadow where it meets the trunk, to give away its location. These flaps inertly open up like other geckos do when the gecko jumps from one branch to another and this imparts even a small advantage by extending the length of the jump.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt;

Because of their lack of limbs, snakes are a group of vertebrates in which the ability to glide might be viewed as less likely to develop.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; However, in Peninsular Malaysia, there are three closely related species of snakes with ability to glide for significant distances. These are the tree snakes (genus ''[[Chrysopelea]]''). The flat, open body works like a parasail and its rolling movements in flight, similar to a spinning frisbee, prevents it from overturning.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; Before leaping, tree snakes hang the uncoiled forepart of their body off the branch in a "like a J".&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; Next, by shaking the body upward in tandem reaching outward by rapidly smoothing its coils and releasing, they’ll hold on the branch, the snakes take flight.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt; They also enlarge their rib cage as a defense device to expose brightly colored markings on their scales.&lt;ref name="klm"/&gt;

The '''tropical cyclones and tornadoes in Pakistan''' include the deadliest cyclone to hit the country and the deadliest tornado to struck the country. Pakistan lies in the [[temperate zone]]. The climate is generally arid, characterized by the extreme south western part of the country where [[Gwadar]] is the main port city. Though cyclones are rare in the Arabian sea which  a part of North Indian Ocean, cyclones that form in this sea mostly move towards [[Western India]] rather than Pakistan.&lt;ref name="imd.gov.in"&gt;http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/static/cyclone-history-as.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclones in the Arabian sea form mostly from May till June and then from September till October, [[monsoon]] season plays a vital role for the formation of cyclone in this basin. Tropical storms that hit Pakistan are mostly remnants by the time reach Pakistan or make landfall in south eastern [[Sindh]] which is not very much populated they rarely move towards the [[Balochistan]] coast.

==List of tropical cyclones in Pakistan==
Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650&amp;nbsp;mi) coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexmundi.com/pakistan/coastline.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gulf of Oman in the extreme south western part of the country where [[Gwadar]] is the main port city. Though cyclones are rare in the Arabian sea which is a part of North Indian Ocean, cyclones that form in this sea mostly move towards[[Western India]] rather than Pakistan.&lt;ref name="imd.gov.in"/&gt; Cyclones in the Arabian sea form mostly from May till June and then from September till October, [[monsoon]] season plays a vital role for the formation of cyclone in this basin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.associatepublisher.com/e/t/tr/tropical_cyclone.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year before the onset of monsoon that is '''15 April to 15 July''' and also after its withdrawal that is '''15 September to 15 December''', there is always a distinct possibility of the cyclonic storm to develop in the north Arabian Sea.&lt;ref name="indianweatherman.blogspot.com"&gt;http://indianweatherman.blogspot.com/2010/06/cyclone-history-for-karachi.html&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 98 per cent chance of cyclones to turn towards the Indian state of Gujarat, one per cent chance of moving towards the Gulf and one per cent chance of moving towards the Pakistani coast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/MYAI-86495X?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one tropical cyclone warning centre in Pakistan, which is in Karachi in Sindh province.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakmet.com.pk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tornadoes in Pakistan==

Tornadoes have been reported almost all over the Indian subcontinent with most in Bangladesh and eastern India.&lt;ref name="sky-fire.tv"&gt;http://www.sky-fire.tv/index.cgi/tornadoes.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[dust devil]]s are common in Pakistan, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. Tornadoes are highly uncommon in Pakistan, where they mostly occur in March and April when a [[Western Disturbance]] starts effecting the northern parts of the country.&lt;ref name="angelfire.com"&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/az3/azt_articles/wtrphenomena/chak_misran.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is also speculated that cycles of tornado years may be correlated to the periods of reduced tropical cyclone activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/252m78qj82042665/ | doi=10.1007/BF02263310 | volume=29 | title=Climatology of tornadoes of India and Bangladesh | year=1981 | journal=Archives for Meteorology, Geophysics, and Bioclimatology Series B | pages=345–356 | author=Peterson R. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following is a list of tornadoes which struck the country.

*On 10 March 1981, a killer tornado killed some 56 people and injured 600 people in [[Gujranwala]] and [[Sheikhupura]] districts of Punjab province.&lt;ref name="ndma.gov.pk"/&gt;
*On 10 March 1985, a tornado killed 18 people in the northern areas of the country.&lt;ref name="ndma.gov.pk"/&gt;
*In 1995, hundred people were reported to have been killed by a tornado in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="sky-fire.tv"/&gt;
*On 28 March 2001, a killer tornado killed 10 people and injured some 100 people in Chak Misran village near Bhalwal area in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province. The tornado had surface winds greater than 75&amp;nbsp;mph. It uprooted electric poles and bill boards in the area.&lt;ref name="angelfire.com"/&gt;
*Another Tornado hit Narang Mangi near [[Narowal]] city in Punjab province but no relevant data is available about this tornado.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/45609806/Tornadoes-in-Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Underwater World''' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 新加坡海底世界) (13 May 1991 – 26 June 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/underwater-world/2848824.html |title=Underwater World Singapore to close Jun 26 |author=Channel NewsAsia |work=Channel NewsAsia |publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Underwater World Singapore Pte Ltd, was an [[oceanarium]] located on the offshore Singaporean island of [[Sentosa]]. Opened in 1991, it had more than 2,500 [[marine animal]]s of 250 species from different regions of the world. The oceanarium was mostly underground and it was owned by the [[Haw Par Corporation]]. The Underwater World's ticket included admission to the Dolphin Lagoon at Palawan Beach.

Underwater World was also involved in several environmental and educational projects, such as the Living in the Ocean Programme, Ocean Ambassador Programme and the Coral Club.

The Underwater World also provided exclusive venues to host events, such as ocean-themed functions.

On 6 June 2016, it was announced by operator Haw Par that the venue would close on 26 June 2016, Its pink dolphins, fur seals and otters had been transferred to [[Chimelong Ocean Kingdom]] in Zhuhai, China the week before the announcement.&lt;ref name="Revamp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/underwater-world/2848824.html |title=Underwater World Singapore to close Jun 26 |date=6 June 2016 |work=[[Channel News Asia]] |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oceanarium was opened to the public on 13 May 1991.&lt;ref name="Revamp2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1855_2011-11-11.html |title=Underwater World Singapore |date=6 June 2016 |work=[[NLB E-Resources]] |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It re-opened on 23 February 2010 after a revamp of several attractions within the park.&lt;ref name="Revamp3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_494078.html |title=Underwater World revamped |date=23 February 2010 |work=[[The Straits Times]] |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underwater World Monorail Station]] used to serve this attraction, but it no longer does since the station closed in 2005.

==Attractions==
Underwater World had a {{convert|83|m|sing=on}} long [[Moving walkway|travelator]] that moved visitors along a submerged {{convert|6|mm|sing=on}} thick [[Shark tunnel|acrylic-windowed tunnel]] from which they could look at an array of marine life including [[coral reef]]s, [[Batoidea|stingray]]s, [[moray eel]]s, [[turtles]], [[shark]]s and others.

===Adventures===
The Underwater World and Dolphin Lagoon offered numerous adventures to the visitors. Some of them included:
*Marine Discovery
*Dive With the Sharks
*Swim With the Dolphins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.underwaterworld.com.sg/adventures.htm |title=Underwater World – Adventures |author=Underwater World Staff |work=Underwater World |publisher=[[Haw Par Corporation]] |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dolphin Lagoon===
[[Image:Sentosabdolphinc.JPG|thumb|Dolphin performing an agile feat at the Dolphin Lagoon]]
The Dolphin Lagoon was home to several [[Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin]]s, also known as the "pink dolphins". Several "Meet-the-Dolphins" sessions were held daily that allowed visitors to enter the waist-deep pool and interact closely with the dolphins. The ticket to the Underwater World &amp; dolphin show did not include the direct contact with the dolphins, an additional photo-coupon had to be purchased. The lagoon also included a Dolphin Suite where visitors could watch the dolphin performance from within an air-conditioned area.&lt;ref name="Revamp"/&gt;

In August 2014 the organizations Wildlife Watcher Singapore, in collaboration with Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, disclosed severe mistreatment of the dolphins in the Lagoon [https://www.dropbox.com/s/t0b9xjaezzv2nyi/DolphinLagoonUWSSingapore.pdf?dl=0 in a report].

The pink dolphins have since been rehoused in [[Chimelong Ocean Kingdom]], an oceanarium in [[Zhuhai]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sg.news.yahoo.com/underwater-world-singapore-to-close-animals-sent-082700104.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of plans for Sentosa Integrated Resort==
On 6 December 2006, Underwater World Singapore launched three new attractions{{mdash}}an interactive stingray feeding pool, a display of small marine [[reef]] species, and 'Fish Reflexology', Singapore's first fish [[reflexology]] [[Balneotherapy|spa]], where two species of [[doctor fish]] gently nibble away at the dead skin on visitors' feet. The new features cost {{dollarsign|SGD}}650,000.

This was amid plans that were being proposed for Sentosa's [[Integrated Resort]]s. [[Genting Group]]'s {{dollarsign|SGD}}5.2 billion proposal, Resorts World, would feature the world's largest oceanarium at that point in time{{mdash}}the {{Convert|8|ha|sing=on}} Quest Marine Life Park{{mdash}}which would house 700,000 marine animals in a {{Convert|30000000|l|-3|sing=on}} lagoon. Rival [[bidding|bidder]] [[Sol Kerzner|Kerzner]]-[[CapitaLand]]'s proposal would have an even larger marine habitat, with a capacity of {{Convert|109000000|l|-3}}, including the world's largest [[jellyfish]] enclosure and an [[artificial reef]] for [[Underwater diving|diving]] and [[snorkelling]].&lt;ref name="Jessica Cheam"&gt;Jessica Cheam, "Underwater World not threatened by IR plans", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 7 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A week later it was announced that Genting International won the bid. In 2012, the [[Marine Life Park]] (also known as S.E.A. Aquarium) opened in [[Resorts World Sentosa]].

'''Ushas''' ([[Vedic Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|उषस्}} / ''{{IAST|uṣás}}'') is a [[Vedas|Vedic]] goddess of [[dawn]] in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p472"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

== Etymology ==
Vedic ''{{IAST|uṣás}}'' is derived from the word ''uṣá'' which means "dawn". This word comes from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/Hušā́s|''*Hušā́s'']] ("ušā" in Avestan), which in turn is from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Hausos|''*h₂éusōs'']] ("dawn"), and is related to "héōs" in Greek and "aušrà" in Lithuanian. It is also the basis for the word "east" in Indo-European traditions, state Mallory and Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J.P.|last2=Adams|first2=D.Q.|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|year =2006| publisher= Oxford University Press|location =Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-929668-2|page= 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Uṣás'' is an ''s''-stem, i.e. the genitive case is ''{{IAST|uṣásas}}'', whereby it connotes "dawn goddess" in [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory |first1=J.P.|last2=Adams |first2=D.Q.|title= The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|year =2006| publisher= Oxford University Press|location =Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-929668-2|page= 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ushas is related to the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European goddess]] ''{{PIE|*[[h₂ausos]]-}}''. Her cognates in other Indo-European pantheons include the Greek goddess [[Eos (mythology)|Eos]], the Roman goddess [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], the Lithuanian goddess [[Austrine]], and the English goddess [[Ēostre]] (OE: ēastre), whose name is probably the root of the modern English word "[[Easter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J.P.|last2=Adams|first2=D.Q.|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-929668-2|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Ushas is the prominent goddess of dawn in the Vedas. She is depicted as the one who imbues life to all beings, as the "life of all life" and "breath of all breaths", according to Jones and Ryan.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p472"/&gt; She is revered as the deity who revivifies earth each day, drives away the chaos and the darkness, sets all things in motion, sends all living beings to do their duties in the Vedas.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p472"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p7"/&gt;

Ushas is the most important goddess in the Vedic literature, but she is not as important as the three central male deities named [[Agni]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] and [[Indra]]. She is mentioned in far less number of hymns than these three, but nearly equal or more number of hymns than all other male and female deities in the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kinsley|title=Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC |year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90883-3|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rig Veda ===
Ushas is mentioned in numerous hymns of the ''Rigveda''.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt; Forty of its hymns are dedicated to her, while her name appears in other additional hymns.&lt;ref name=dalal433&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is thanked for and petitioned for driving away darkness in hymns 7.78, 6.64 and 10.172; bringer of light urged by Surya in hymn 3.61, and the chaser of evil demons in hymn 8.47.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt; The Rigvedic hymn 1.48 describes her as drawn in a hundred chariots, revealed by the daily arrival of light, one who sets all motion to life and all life to motion, rousing people off to their duties.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dalal433/&gt; She is revered for giving strength in hymn 1.44, to [[Ṛta]] in hymn 3.61 and 7.75, and participating in daily restoration of order and fighting chaotic forces that threaten the world in hymn 1.113.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt;

Ushas is described in Vedic texts as riding in a shining chariot drawn by golden-red horses or cows, a beautiful maiden bedecked with jewels, smiling and irresistibly attractive, who brings cheer to all those who gaze upon her.&lt;ref name="Wilkins2003p48"/&gt; She dispels darkness, reveals treasures and truths that have been hidden, illuminates the world as it is.&lt;ref name="Wilkins2003p48"/&gt; Hymn 6.64 associates her with wealth and light, while hymn 1.92 calls her the "mother of cows" and one, who like a cow, gives to the benefit of all people.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p7"/&gt; Hymn 1.113 calls her "mother of the gods", while hymn 7.81 states her to be the mother of all living beings who petition her.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt; She is the goddess of the hearth, states hymn 6.64.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p7"/&gt; She symbolizes reality, is a marker of time and a reminder to all that "life is limited on earth".&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt; She sees everything as it is, and she is the eye of the gods, according to hymns 7.75–77.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p287"/&gt;

She is variously mentioned as the sister of Ratri (night),&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p472"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kinsley| title= Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC |year= 1988|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 978-0-520-90883-3|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aditya and one who goes about her ways closely with deities Savitri and Surya.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dalal433/&gt; She is also associated with [[Varuna]] (sky, water) and Agni (fire).&lt;ref name="Wilkins2003p48"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p287"&gt;{{cite book|author=George M. Williams|title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2|pages=287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RV 6.64.1-2 (trans. [[Ralph T.H. Griffith|Griffith]]), Ushas is invoked as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_6/Hymn_64 The Rig Veda, Mandala 6], Hymn 64, Ralph T.H. Griffith, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The radiant Dawns have risen up for glory, in their white splendour like the waves of waters.''&lt;br /&gt;''She maketh paths all easy, fair to travel, and, rich, hath shown herself benign and friendly.''
# ''We see that thou art good: far shines thy lustre; thy beams, thy splendours have flown up to heaven.''&lt;br /&gt;''Decking thyself, thou makest bare thy bosom, shining in majesty, thou Goddess Morning.''

In the "family books" of the ''Rig Veda'' (e.g. [[RV 6]].64.5), Ushas is the divine daughter&amp;mdash;a ''{{IAST|divó duhitâ}}'' &amp;mdash;of ''[[Dyaus Pita]]'' ("Sky Father"). This is taken literally in the traditional genealogies of [[Hindu mythology]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Contemporary reverence ==
The revered [[Gayatri mantra]], states George Williams, remains a daily reminder of Ushas in contemporary Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p287"/&gt;

According to Sri [[Aurobindo]], Ushas is "the medium of the awakening, the activity and the growth of the other gods; she is the first condition of the Vedic realisation. By her increasing illumination the whole nature of man is clarified; through her [mankind] arrives at the Truth, through her he enjoys [Truth's] beatitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sri Aurobindo|title=Secret of the Veda|publisher=Lotus Press|location=Twin Lakes|isbn=0-914955-19-5|year=1995}}, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushas is regionally worshipped during the festival of [[Chhath Puja]], in [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] ([[India]]), and in [[Nepal]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
