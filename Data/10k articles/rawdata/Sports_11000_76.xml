'''GGL Stadium''' ''(or previously known as Altrad Stadium and Stade Yves-du-Manoir)'' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Montpellier]], [[France]].  It is currently used mostly for [[rugby union]] matches and is the home stadium of [[Montpellier Hérault RC]]. The stadium is able to hold 15,697 spectators (12,734 seated). [[Rugby League]] side [[Catalans Dragons]] used the venue on 5 June 2011 with their tie against [[Wigan Warriors]].

In 2014, [[Ligue 1]] [[French Football Federation|Association football]] team [[Montpellier HSC]] temporarily used the stadium during their [[2014–15 Montpellier HSC season|2014–15 season]] for home games after October floods in [[Montpellier]]. Their stadium [[Stade de la Mosson]] faced numerous floods and subsequent damages meant the team were unable to use its facility. Altrad held 5 fixtures during this time, 4 [[Ligue 1]] matches and 1 [[Coupe de la Ligue]] game which lasted from 28 October up to their last game on 13 December 2014, before the team returned to their home stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ligue 1: Montpellier's stadium flooded for second time in a week|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12040/9507850/montpellier-hit-by-floods|website=SkySports|publisher=Sky|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is named after GGL, a property company based in Montpellier&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.midilibre.fr/2018/06/08/montpellier-l-altrad-stadium-va-devenir-le-ggl-stadium,1683734.php L'Altrad Stadium va devenir le GGL Stadium], published June 8th on [[Midi Libre]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Casey McGehee 2009.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Casey McGehee]] on the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] puts a ball in play]]In [[baseball]], a '''batted ball''' is any ball that, after a [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]], is contacted by the batter's bat.  One or more of several terms are used to describe a batted ball, depending on how it comes off the [[baseball bat|bat]] and where in the [[baseball field|field]] it lands.

There are generally three descriptive categories for balls hit in the air:
* A '''fly ball''' or simply ''fly'' is a ball that is hit in the air, usually very high.  Fielders attempt to catch fly balls on their descent.
* A '''pop fly''' or ''pop-up''  is a specific type of fly ball that goes very high while not traveling very far laterally.  From the perspective of the fielder, pop-ups seem to come straight down.  A fly ball is usually caught [[in flight]] and thus results in an [[out (baseball)|out]], called a '''fly out''' or a '''pop out''' as the case may be. Despite the subtle difference, however, the words ''fly ball'' and ''pop fly'' are often interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;A pop fly in or near the infield is almost always easily caught, because infielders (also at times the pitcher or catcher) can easily approach the fly ball before it falls. A special rule, the [[infield fly rule]], applies to any fair fly ball that looks like an easy catch for an infielder when baserunners are on first and second base. When fielder drops a fly ball, runners that expected having to tag up must run immediately to avoid the incoming batsman, allowing an easy force play on them at third base or home plate. The umpire calls "Infield fly if fair", indicating that if the batted ball remains fair, the batter is out automatically and baserunners are not obligated to vacate their bases to avoid the force-out. The infield fly rule does not apply to a bunted ball of any kind or a foul fly of any kind.
* A '''[[Glossary of baseball (L)#line drive|line drive]]''' or a ''liner''.  This is a sharply hit, low-flying batted ball. The threshold between a line drive and a fly ball is subjective; liners tend to have little noticeable arc. Liners also tend to be the hardest balls to catch due to their speed and rapid descent; however, very fast liners hit directly to an infielder are often caught by instinct without the need for judgment, making the catch easy, though perhaps unexpected.  Line drives can be especially dangerous to baseball players and spectators.  As recently as July 22, 2007, [[Tulsa Drillers]] first base coach [[Mike Coolbaugh]] was killed in a line drive accident at a minor league stadium in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

A '''ground ball''' or ''grounder'' is a batted ball that rolls or bounces on the ground.  A line drive in the infield may become a hard grounder to an outfielder; these are usually called line drives regardless.

[[Bunt (baseball)|Bunts]] are generally not considered to be ground balls; they are a distinct type of batted ball, where the batter, in effect, tries to "block" the ball with the bat held steady, rather than taking a full swing.

Any of the above types of balls might be [[fair ball]]s or [[foul ball]]s.  Umpires will also signal first signal fair or foul on fly outs near the [[Glossary of baseball (F)#foul_lines|foul line]], but the result of a foul fly out (or '''foul out''') is no different from a fair fly out; it is not a foul ball.

A ''[[foul tip]]'', a very different type of batted ball, is a ball struck with the tip of the bat, going sharply and directly to the catcher's mitt or hand.  If the catcher does not catch the ball, it is an ordinary foul ball. If the catcher has to move either his mitt/hand or body to catch the ball, it is not a foul tip, as the ball would no longer have traveled directly to the catch. However, if the ball deflects from either the mitt or hand and is subsequently caught before landing, it is still a foul tip.  A foul tip is always a strike, and is a strike-out if there are two strikes on the batter. The foul tip is a live ball and runners may advance.

'''Blackham Coliseum''' is a multipurpose arena in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].  It was built on the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] campus in 1949 as the home to the then-named [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|SLI]] Bulldogs, now called the [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball]] teams. The arena was named for Stafford Morgan Blackham, former dean of the Department of Animal Husbandry at SLI, and as such it was built to host livestock exhibitions as well as athletics (in a similar manner to the usage of LSU's [[John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum|Parker Coliseum]]).&lt;ref&gt;L [http://www.louisiana.edu/AboutUs/History/Buildings.shtml#blackham UL Lafayette: About Us: University History: Buildings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306085330/http://www.louisiana.edu/AboutUs/History/Buildings.shtml#blackham |date=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It replaced the 1,500-seat [[Earl K. Long Gymnasium]] as home to the athletics teams.  It remained the home for the men's team until the [[Cajundome]] was completed in 1984. The women continue to play the majority of their games at Earl K. Long. Blackham hosted the [[Southland Conference]] men's basketball tournament in 1982.

In the 1960s, it became popular as a venue for pop concerts where acts like [[The Supremes]], [[James Brown]] and [[Jackie Wilson]]. [[The Supremes]] played to soldout audiences on their "Symphony Tour 1965".

Today it is still in use, seating 5,500 for basketball and up to 9,800 for [[concerts]].  It also features 25,000 square feet (2,300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of space at the main arena, with two barns adding 46,500 square feet (4,300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of space.  Altogether, the three buildings can also be used for trade shows, rodeos and conventions.  It was home to the [[Acadiana Mudbugs]] of the [[Southern Indoor Football League]] for their 2009 season, and in fall 2009, the revived [[Louisiana IceGators (SPHL)|Louisiana IceGators]] began play there as a member of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foote |first=Kevin |title=IceGators to skate again; join the discussion |publisher=Lafayette Daily Advertiser |date=May 15, 2009 |url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20090515/NEWS01/905150326 |accessdate=May 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519181330/http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20090515/NEWS01/905150326 |archivedate=May 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the venue held its first heavy metal concert, the 2009 No Fear Music Tour featuring [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb Of God]], [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[God Forbid]] and [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]].

The venue serves as home to the Grammy-styled, annual Le Cajun Music Awards Festival held every August by the Cajun French Music Association, an association of [[Cajun music]] enthusiasts for the preservation of the Cajun music, language, heritage and culture.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203055855/http://www.cajunfrenchmusic.org/music/lecajun.htm]

The '''Bowling Museum of Asturias''' ({{es icon}} '''Museo de los Bolos de Asturias''') is located in the [[Panes, Asturias|Panes]] parish of [[Peñamellera Baja]], [[Asturias]], Spain. It is dedicated to the sport of [[bowling]] in its varied forms, mainly [[Asturian bowling]]. Opened 19 April 2003,&lt;ref name="vivirasturias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivirasturias.com/asturias/pe%C3%B1amellera-baja/museo-de-los-bolos-de-asturias/es|title=Museo de los Bolos de Asturias|work=vivirasturias.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum was pioneered by the municipality of [[Peñamellera Baja]], the [[Principality of Asturias]], and an eastern Asturian consortium.&lt;ref name="picopenamellera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picopenamellera.es/museo.php|title=Museo de los Bolos de Asturias |work=picopenamellera.es|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The interactive museum aims to provide information about the sport, its history, and its significance within the culture of Asturias. There are 1,000 pieces on exhibit across fourteen existing forms of bowling. Exhibits include information on the manufacturing process of [[bowling ball]]s and [[bowling pin]]s, and documents about the game's history, the oldest of which, found at [[Simancas]], dates to 1495.&lt;ref name="vivirasturias" /&gt;

Another part of the museum is a tribute to bowling players, featuring photographs of players and teams, trophies, posters, and badges. Texts written by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Armando Palacio Valdes, Camilo Jose Cela and Celso Amieva are also included.&lt;ref name="aytopanespbaja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aytopanespbaja.com/museo.asp|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070528021647/http://www.aytopanespbaja.com/museo.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-28|title=Museo de los Bolos de Asturias|work=aytopanespbaja.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Double Full''' is a [[trampoline]] move that comprises a single (normally straight) back [[somersault]] with two full twists. This move also may be executed on the ground in rapid succession as part of a cheerleading/gymnastics/acrobatics routine.

Compared to a full back (full twisting back somersault), a double full is a more advanced move. It's not often seen in high-grade routines because it has only 360° of somersault rotation.

The performer sharply and tightly brings the arms down to the sides and maintains a straight body position to speed up the rotation generated from a full back. Variations of this twist-acceleration process include folding the arms one above the other across the midsection or crossing the arms to form an "X" shape across the chest.  The latter is becoming less common due to debate over its safety.

Double fulls are usually performed in the straight position, though they may be performed in both tucked and piked shapes. The straight shape is most common, however, since it helps to slow the somersault rotation down. As somersault rotation is sped up greatly with the addition of twist, keeping rotation low is important, especially as there is a great deal of twist rotation involved in the move.

(serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The club was founded in 1932.

After the [[Kosovo war]], many of the [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo Albanian]] players left the Serbian club FK Trepča and decided to found their own club, which was carried out in 1999.&lt;ref name="Alo!" /&gt; The Albanian club received the name [[KF Trepça]], the Albanian name for FK Trepča, thus there were two clubs in the city with virtually the same name. In 2010, the Serbian FK Trepča merged with the local Serbian club ''[[FK Partizan Kosovska Mitrovica]]'' and integrated with it.

== Name ==
The football club Trepča was named after the former [[Trepča Mines]], which are located north-east of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]].  It was first known as '''FK Rudar Kosovska Mitrovica''' until 1962 when it was named '''FK Trepča'''.&lt;ref&gt;Book: "Rođeni&amp;nbsp;– Prvoligaške generacije 1952&amp;nbsp;– 1991" by Zoran Mrđenović, pag. 39 {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The club was founded in 1932 under the name Trepča by workers of the [[Trepča Mines]] in [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] during the period of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. From the founding year until 1938, the club did not have an own venue, so coached and played on a playing field in the neighboring town [[Zvečan]]. In 1938, a small field was built where they played until the [[Second World War]]. Later they received its own stadium, the [[Trepča Stadium]], which offered then about 30,000 spectators. The players that marked the pre-WWII period were Mazllum Grushti, Hasko Bula, Gota Sezair, Ejup Kerveshi, Adnan Mustafa, Ahmed and Qamil Zajmi, Hysen Murati, Xhati Zhubi, Sali Pllana, Bedri Hamza, Shinasi Rizanolli, Ahmet Shukriu, Burhan Kurkuqi, Jakup Berisha, Qazim Pllana, Sami Konjusha, Agim Deva, Ekrem Neziri, Riza Gashi, etc.&lt;ref name="kftrepca"&gt;[https://archive.li/20101020214232/http://www.kftrepca.com/Fillimi.aspx?tabindex=9&amp;tabid=12#selection-447.235-447.528 HISTORIKU I KLUBIT] at KF Trepca old website, retrieved 9-3-2017 {{al icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gota Cezair was a Prizren-born player who, after playing with Trepča, went to Italy to study Economy at the University of Firenze, and, while there, he played for [[Carrarese Calcio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviostorico.unibo.it/it/struttura-organizzativa/sezione-archivio-storico/fascicoli-degli-studenti/gota-sezair.asp?IDFolder=143&amp;IDOggetto=75504&amp;LN=IT&amp;mCJ=&amp;mCO=!%24Dphopnf%24!-!%24Opnf%24!&amp;mCW=&amp;NElemento=48115 Fascicoli degli Studenti: Gota Sezair] at archiviostorico.unibo.it&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/players/hong-players-in-it.html Hungarian Players and Coaches in Italy] at [[RSSSF]], retrieved 9-3-2017 (added wrongly in the list as "Hungarian")&lt;/ref&gt; and later returned to Yugoslavia and played with [[FK Vardar]] in [[Yugoslav First League|Yugoslav First]] and [[Yugoslav Second League|Second Leagues]].&lt;ref&gt;Asovi Yu-Fudbala, page 76 {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, the Kosovo Albanian players of Trepča, played for the Albanian football club called ''KF Skënderbeu'', which was active during the war and the fascist occupation. After the end of the war, Trepča was long in the shadow of numerous Yugoslav clubs. However, in 1977 came the first major success for the club, when they achieved the promotion to the [[Yugoslav First League]].&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt;

In the following [[1977–78 Yugoslav First League|1977/78 season]], the club relegated in the [[Yugoslav Second League]], but managed to achieve the [[1977–78 Yugoslav Cup]] final, where they lost against [[NK Rijeka]] by 0–1 after extra time. During this period, the clubs nickname ''Rudari'' (The Miners) was especially popular, and the Trepča players [[Dragan Mutibarić]], [[Dragan Simeunović]] and [[Vladan Radača]] became members of the [[Yugoslav national football team]]. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the players that emerged in the club were Sali Qubreli, Jakup Abrashi, Ajet Shosholli, Hysni Maxhuni, Luan Prekazi, Rexhep Xhaka, Erdogan Celina, Esat Mehmeti, Ramadan Cimili, Fisnik Ademi, Adnan Zeqiri, Ibrahim Prekazi, Faruk Domi, Aqif Shehu, Mensur Nexhipi, Rafet Prekazi, Genc Hoxha, Avni Juniku, Bakir Burri, Hasan Shasivari, [[Vahedin Ajeti]], Ahmet Turku, Gani Llapashtica, [[Isa Sadriu]], Bardhec Seferi, Sadik Rrahmani, among others.&lt;ref name="kftrepca"/&gt;

Due to the consequences of the [[Kosovo war]], in 1999, the Kosovo Albanian players decided to leave Trepča and found their own club. The Albanian club received the name [[KF Trepça]], the Albanian name for FK Trepča, thus there were two clubs in the city with virtually the same name.

In the season 2001–02 they finished bottom of the [[Serbian League]] Morava and were relegated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg02.html Yugoslavia 2001/02] at [[RSSSF]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the season 2003–04 they played in the 1/16 finals of the Serbia and Montenegro Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg04.html Serbia and Montenegro 2003/04] at [[RSSSF]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the season 2004–05 FK Trepča was playing in the Serbian fourth level, Šumadijska zona, and finished 15th.  They played their matches in [[Zubin Potok]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg05.html 2004/05 season in Serbia and Montenegro] at [[RSSSF]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the season 2006–07 they played again in the Šumadija zone finishing 10th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/serv4-07.html Serbia (fourth level) 2006/07] at [[RSSSF]]&lt;/ref&gt;

FK Trepča reached the pre-eliminary round of the 2011–12 Serbian Cup.  They played it after winning the Kosovo and Metohija qualifying group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/serv2012.html Serbia 2011/12] at [[RSSSF]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Trepča attended a friendly match against the Serbian top level club [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in [[Belgrade]], which symbolized the solidarity with [[Serbs of Kosovo and Metohija|Serbs from Kosovo]], which Trepča narrowly lost with 2–3.&lt;ref name="Kurir" /&gt; Both goals for Trepča were scored by Perica Ilić. A year later, they also played a friendly match with same character against the other Serbian top club [[Red Star Belgrade]], which they lost by 0–3.&lt;ref&gt;[[Red Star Belgrade]]:[http://www.crvenazvezdafk.com/sr/vesti/izvestaji/8521/Crvena+zvezda+-+Trep%C4%8Da+3%3A0+%282%3A0%29.html Crvena zvezda&amp;nbsp;– Trepča 3:0 (2:0) (serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stadium ==
From 1932 to 1938 the club not have its own venue. They coached and played on a playing field in the neighboring town [[Zvečan]]. In 1938, a small field was built where they played until the [[Second World War]]. Later they received its own stadium, the [[Trepča Stadium]], which offered then about 30,000 spectators.  There they played it home games until the outbreak of the [[Kosovo war]].&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt;

After the war in 1999, the city was divided into a southern part with almost exclusively Kosovo Albanian and a northern part with non-Albanian or predominantly Serb population.&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt; During the war, many Serbs and non-Albanians fled to the northern part of the city or were expelled. Its followed the [[2004 unrest in Kosovo]], the nationwide pogrom-like riots in March against the Serb and non-Albanian population from Albanian extremist only reinforced the ethnic division of the city.

The Trepča Stadium is located in the southern part of the city, thus the FK Trepča is not possible to play its home matches in their home stadium.&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B92]]:[http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=04&amp;nav_id=819556 Srbi s Kosova razočarani u FSS (serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, only Albanian teams play in Trepča Stadium, including the 1999 founded [[KF Trepça]], who have the stadium virtually annexed and finally renamed.&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt; The Trepča Stadium is called now by the Kosovo Albanian population as ''Olympik Stadiumi Adem Jashari'', after [[Adem Jashari]], a former leader of the Albanian paramilitary rebel organisation [[Kosovo Liberation Army|UÇK]], but the non-Albanian population still called ''Stadion Trepča''.&lt;ref name="Alo!" /&gt; Because of these current difficult political situation, Trepča plays its home games near Zvečan, in 3.500 seater Zvečan Stadium.&lt;ref name="Alo!" /&gt;

== Club colors ==
The club colors are green and black,  which are also included in the coat of arms of the city, and were also the colors prior to the merger and the integration of ''Partizan Kosovska Mitrovica''. To the club color of Partizan Belgrade belonged also red and blue. Thus, the away kit of ''Partizan Kosovska Mitrovica'' wore these colors were symbolic the main colors of the [[Serbian flag]]. It was similar at Partizan Belgrade.

== International matches ==
The club has played three international matches in 1977/78:
*Trepča 1:3 against [[Real Zaragoza]] in [[Spain]]
*Trepča 1:3 against [[OFC Sliven 2000|FK Sliven]] in [[Bulgaria]]
*Trepča 1:1 against [[SK Tirana]] in [[Albania]]

The '''Flushing Meadows Corona Park Natatorium and Ice Rink''', also known as the '''Flushing Meadows Corona Park Pool and Rink''', is a {{convert|110000|sqft|m2}} facility housing an Olympic-sized pool and an NHL-standard rink.&lt;ref name="siny"&gt;[http://www.siny.org/media/projects/fmcpnic.pdf "Highly Efficient Cable-Stayed Roof Spans the Seasons."] (PDF) ''Metals in Construction 2007: 14-19.''

Accessed December 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Located inside the historic [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park]], site of the [[world’s fair]] in [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964]], the public facility caters to all [[New York City]] residents.  Built in 2008, the $66.3 million project is the first indoor public pool to open in New York City in four decades.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;Dunlap, David W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/nyregion/29pool.html?_r=1 "Modern Pool for Public Is Opening in Flushing."] ''The New York Times''. February 2, 2008. Accessed February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the building was intended to serve as the venue for [[water polo]] events during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], but when [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|NYC's bid]] was lost to London, the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] proceeded to build the pool anyway.  The result is an innovative building with 130-foot-high twin masts and a swooping roof form. The masts are an architectural feature extending up into the Queens skyline as well as the structural supports for the cable-stayed roof.  This design provides the clear spans necessary to house an Olympic swimming pool along with an ice skating rink.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"/&gt;

The Flushing Meadows Natatorium was designed by Handel Architects in association with Kevin Hom Architects (formerly Kevin Hom +Andrew Goldman Architects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://handelarchitects.com/ghandel.html "Gary E.

===World's Fairs===
The [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World’s Fair]] pavilions, which previously occupied the site, inspired the architects to design the canopy roof suspended above the natatorium and rink.&lt;ref name="handelarchitects"&gt;[http://www.handelarchitects.com/projects/project-main/flushing-pool-and-ice-rink-main.html "Flushing Pool and Ice Rink"]. ''Handelarchitects.com''. Handel Architects. Retrieved February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The World’s Fair was a universal exposition showcasing various cultural exhibitions from all over the world. World’s fairs have become historic markers exemplifying commercial and industrial successes of various eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Bletter|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers of the 1939 World’s Fair boasted it was “the greatest exhibition ever held.” They referred to its vast size, the attractive symbolism of the Trylon and Perisphere, and most all for imagining a future after a decade of economic depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Bletter|1989|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as the Corona dumps, Robert Moses headed its transformation into a new park, for the borough of Queens; and the construction of the fair. The theme of the 1939 World’s Fair was: “Building the World of Tomorrow.” The fair was to symbolize the world’s faith in new technology and unity amongst cultures. Through the various showcases from different countries, citizens around the world were given gave a chance to learn about countries that they have only heard of in books and movies. From innovative edible products such as instant coffee, to machines that washed dishes automatically, this fair introduced its visitors to a plethora of technological advancements and new consumer products.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Bletter|1989|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magical and futuristic land also housed new buildings, including the iconic General Motors’ Futurama and Democracity, the core exhibit within the Perisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Ballon|Jackson|2007|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-five years later, the Flushing Meadows Park was selected, again to be the site of the 1964 World’s Fair.  Americans had a fascination with space and “the new frontier.” The themes of the 1964 World’s Fair were: “A Millennium of Progress” and “Man’s Achievements in an Expanding Universe.” &lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Ballon|Jackson|2007|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space-oriented pavilions such as the New York Pavilion, which housed an observation platform, symbolized the growing infatuation with the [[Space Age]].

===Role in park revival===
The [[New York State Pavilion]], designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, is one of the few structures still standing in Flushing Meadows Park. The oval roof, suspended and cable-hung, was the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Ballon|Jackson|2007|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pavilion was praised for its suspended roof and two towers that stood as the tallest structures of the fair. This large tent-like structure may have been an influence on the current Flushing Meadows Natatorium. Today, all these structures are either demolished or left in an uninhabitable, dilapidated state.

Envisioned in 1999 by Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and Borough President Claire Shulman to revive the park, the original concept of a moderately sized pool was enlarged to an Olympic-size pool with an indoor ice rink as well.  The building's foundation was completed in 2001 but after the [[September 11 attacks]] the project was halted due to funding issues. Finally, in 2003, the Natatorium was designated as the swimming arena in New York City's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="nycgovparks"&gt;[http://www.nycgovparks.org/news/daily-plant?id=20481 "Flushing Meadows Corona Park Aquatic Center Opens"].

February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parks Department partnered with the Economic Development Corporation and plans re-commenced for New York City to build its first public indoor swimming pool in 40 years.&lt;ref name="nycgovparks" /&gt; Upon its completion in February 2008, the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Natatorium and Ice Rink became the largest recreation complex ever built in a city park at 110,000 square feet.&lt;ref name="nycgovparks" /&gt;

==Description==
{{Flushing Meadows-Corona Park map|highlight=3}}

===Location===
The Flushing Meadows Natatorium is sited along the northeast perimeter of Flushing Meadows Corona Park, juxtaposed between the Van Wyck Expressway and the 1250-acre park greenery. The building mediates an urban environment to the north, which consist of major streets and highways, with the park on its western facade.

===Interior design===
[[File:Plaza of Natatorium.jpg|thumb|left|Main plaza of the Natatorium that leads to lobby within.]]
[[File:Natatorium Lobby.jpg|thumb|left|Interior lobby space of the Natatorium]]
The rectangular pavilion holds both the pool and the ice rink end to end. This placement contrasts opposing environments: liquid and frozen water, humid and dry environments, bare skin and bundled bodies.&lt;ref name="handelarchitects" /&gt; Constituents can enjoy the facilities year round. The building, a 110,000 square foot facility, engages its natural surroundings. The curtain wall wraps around the western façade, allowing swimmers to engage with the natural environment outside, from flowering crabapple trees in spring, to vibrant maple orchards in fall.&lt;ref name="FlushingMeadows"&gt;"Flushing Meadows Corona Park Natatorium &amp; Ice Rink." ''Dialogue''. July 2009: p. 78-87.{{failed verification|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As users make their way from the lobby to the pool level, they circulate in a spiral path that offers different perspectives of the entry plaza outside and the rest of the surroundings. The large plot of land, which once housed many international pavilions in the 1939 and 1964 world’s fairs, has now been paved over with acres of greenery.

The siting and procession of the building refers to the World’s Fair that preceded its existence. With entrances on both the east and west side following a radial geometry, the designer draws on the historic Fountain of the Planets exhibition.&lt;ref name="FlushingMeadows" /&gt; A plaza is located at the eastern entrance of the building that extends from three paths that circulate to the building’s park spaces.  On the western façade, another entrance opens onto a path that leads to 8 soccer fields, the Flushing Meadows Golf Center, the Industry Pond, and the Unisphere, all of which are on the westernmost part of the 1250-acre park.

===Architecture===

Influenced by the World’s Fair pavilions, the 110,000 square foot aquatic center  is the largest recreation complex ever built in a New York City park. The curved suspended roof spans over both the Olympic size swimming pool and a NHL regulation hockey rink.

The programmatic requirements of this complex shaped decisions about structure and materials. Designing the structural system and cable-stayed roof was a feat for [[Geiger Engineers]]. The structural engineers developed this structural envelope due to the necessity for a clear span- limiting chlorine from damaging building materials. A clear spanned space proved to be the solution that answered the need for minimal maintenance and avoidance of damage to structural elements. The engineers chose to place the pool and rink end-to–end, so that they would serve, structurally speaking as counterweights of a seesaw. At the midpoint are the “linchpins”: the two 130-foot masts from which the roof is suspended.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"/&gt;  The masts are composed of 1-¼” plates that are stacked at the junction of the pool and rink. The masts are designed so that as they soar through the roof, the diameter narrows to accommodate lateral movement.&lt;ref name="siny" /&gt;  In order to support the 120-foot-by-230-foot clear spans, twelve cables were extended from each mast to specific connection points on the roof. The twelve 3-inch diameter A586 strand cables are critical elements in connecting the masts to the roof. To keep the roof from lifting, the roof is decked in concrete planks that counteract windloads.&lt;ref name="siny" /&gt; The concrete planks sit on longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the envelope.

[[File:Front of the Flushing Meadows Natatorium.jpg|thumb|Front façade of concrete matrix and multicolored glass tiles]]
Erecting the structure demanded precise calculations. The standards for cable structure construction required that the engineers create a strategy of execution, documenting each step, prior to construction. In order for the structure to be erected, much shoring and preliminary bracing was done to relieve the dead load from the gravity columns prior to cable installation. Geiger Engineers devised a plan in which the perimeter columns were erected first, after which the concrete planks and roof framing were placed, followed by the erection of the masts, and lastly the installation of each cable. The concrete planks on the roof sit on steel framing, including the large longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the roof. These girders were fabricated with W36x300s in the middle of the W27x194s at the sides. All of the wide flange shapes and masts were fabricated form ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel, while the diagonal roof bracing were A 500 Grade B.  Due to the precisely choreographed steel design, the Flushing Meadow Natatorium received the 2009 Innovative Design in Engineering and Architecture with Structural Steel award. (IDEAS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The IDEAS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; awards recognize outstanding achievements in engineering and architecture on structural steel projects around the country. The project was judged on structural steel innovation, with an emphasis on creative solutions to project requirements.&lt;ref&gt;O'Berski, Tasha. [http://www.aisc.org/newsdetail.aspx?id=21290&gt;. "Pool/Ice Rink Project at Flushing Meadows Corona Park Wins National Architecture and Engineering Award"]. AISC. American Institute of Steel Construction, July 27, 2009. Retrieved April 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The form was directly derived from the structural requirements of the program.

Visual interventions within the buildings allow constant interaction between patrons and the outer environment. From floor to ceiling expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.

'''Ga-ga''' ({{lang-he|גע-גע}} literally 'touch-touch') is a variant of [[dodgeball]] that is played in a ga-ga "pit". The game combines dodging, striking, running, and jumping, with the objective of being the last person standing. Players hit the ball at each other with their hands, and are eliminated if the ball strikes them on or below the knee. The game can be played by a group of individual players or with teams, as well as in one-on-one matches. Rules, ball types, pit surfaces, and pit sizes can vary widely at different venues.

==Gameplay==
Ga-ga is played in a large fenced in area (usually an octagon or hexagon) called a ga-ga pit. The ga-ga pit generally consists of flat walls atop a smooth dirt, turf, sand, or rubberized surface. The ga-ga ball can vary in size and form, generally ranging from a foam dodgeball to a rubber kickball. The game begins when one player or a referee throws the ga-ga ball into the air; while their backs or hands are against the wall, the players shout "Ga" on each of the first three bounces.  After three bounces, the ball is in play, and the players may leave the wall and "hit" the ball at each other in the pit. A player who is hit by the ball or breaks a rule is eliminated and must leave the game.  Players may not "hit" the ball twice in a row, and a player who causes the ball to leave the pit is out.  When the ball is caught in the air on a fly, the last person to hit the ball is out.&lt;ref name="giddy"&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2009/07/giddy_over_gaga_dodgeballlike.html Giddy over Ga-ga: Dodgeball-like game from Israel is a hit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General rules==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
# A player can hit the ball with their hands, but picking up the ball and throwing it at a player is not allowed. Some versions do not permit "scooping," or curling one's fingers while hitting the ball so as to project the ball into the air. In some games, only open hand hits are allowed to prevent striking injury to small children and also to enable greater control of the ball, keeping it low and inbounds.
# If the ball touches a player anywhere on or below the knee (in some versions, below the ankle or waist), that player is eliminated from the game. If a player hits themself with the ball, accidentally or otherwise, that player is eliminated.
# A player may not hit the ball out of the pit. The penalty for breaking this rule is assigned to the last player to touch the ball before leaving the pit, rather than to the original hitter. Because this provision can result in a strategy of hitting the ball upwards to eliminate another player, the rule prohibiting scooping attempts to discourage this. In some versions, an exception is made if the ball hits a wall or the ground before leaving the pit; in this scenario, the exit is deemed to be the result of a ricochet, and the player is not eliminated.
# Holding or otherwise using the wall to assist a jump is termed "wall jumping" and is prohibited. However, some variations allow wall-jumping.
# No player may hit the ball twice in a row, unless the ball comes into contact with the wall or another player between touches. This rule is sometimes expanded to include "self-serving," which prevents the player that served the ball from being the first to touch the ball.
# If a player pops the ball up into the air, another player may catch it and ground it.  The other player is then out.  Some variations prohibit catching completely.
# A player must step out of the pit completely to show that they have been eliminated.
# A player must start the game with one of their feet (or some versions hands) touching the wall of the pit. One player or a referee has to throw the ball in and have it bounce thrice and chant "Ga-Ga-Ga". If a player removes their foot (or hand) off the wall before the chant, they are eliminated.
#The winner of the last game has the right to serve to start the next game.

Other rules may be added as necessary, and some may choose to play without all of the above rules. Additional rules that vary in frequency of implementation include the prohibition of blocking (using one's hands as a barrier between the ball and one's feet, rather than jumping), crouching, playing on the ground, and rolling. In other variations, an additional ball may enter play towards the end of the game if the two or three remaining players are making slow progress.  Commonly, there will be a 20-second count down when play is too slow and only 2 or 3 players remain.   At the end of the countdown, a new game is started.

==Popularity outside Israel==
Ga-ga was played in the Australian Jewish community of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], from the 1960s.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The 1980s saw a thriving period for junior competition Ga-ga. The game was introduced through the exchange of Israeli ''madrikhim'' (counselors) to Australia or Australian ''madrikhim'' returning from Israel.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Ga-ga was also played in US Jewish camps and Youth Movements in the 1960s, having been introduced through the same mechanism.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Mainstream Ga-ga===
In July 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that, "to the surprise of parents who recall the game from their youths, gaga is solidly mainstream." Among the things that contributed to ga-ga's expansion, the article credits children's love of the game. "They are teaching it to their parents and not vice versa. It's not like baseball or football or tennis, where they have to emulate someone else. Kids own it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/us/gaga-playground-game-is-popular-at-camps.html Move Over, Dodge Ball]&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American expansion===
It is believed to have been brought to the United States by Israeli counselors working at Jewish summer camps.&lt;ref name="giddy" /&gt; It was played as early as the mid-1960s in a wide variety of locations.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Children often learn about ga-ga through summer camps across Canada and the United States, with varying sizes of pits.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Ga-ga continued its US expansion to [[Manhattan]] with the opening of The Gaga Center, New York's first facility dedicated to the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/cuckoo_for_gaga_UjrglYzFSLjXgJcA3sdCVP You're out, dodgeball! These UES kids are into a kinder, gentler game (with a funny name)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Popular Culture==
* In the season 8 episode of [[Bob's Burgers]], "[[Bob's Burgers (season 8)|Y Tu Ga-Ga Tambien]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wellen|first1=Brianna|title=Bob's Burgers returns from a weeks-long hiatus with a schoolyard sensation|url=https://www.avclub.com/the-belchers-fall-victim-to-a-fad-in-a-middling-bobs-bu-1823688938|website=The A.V. Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; the students of Wagstaff become obsessed with Ga-Ga ball after it is introduced by guidance counsellor Mr. Frond. The game quickly takes over recess, becoming the only thing anyone wants to do or talk about. Except for Gene, who feels that just because something is [[Fad|fun and popular]], doesn't mean it should be the only thing you want to do and that others shouldn't be afraid to dislike it or want to do anything else.

==Verdict==
On 25 March 2010, Judge Tom O'Donnell granted Limerick publicans an exemption from the state ban on opening on Good Friday. He recognised the potential for "controversy in several quarters".&lt;ref name="Publicans toast court ruling on historic Good Friday opening"/&gt;

Under Section 10 of the Intoxicating liquor Act 1962, applicants must possess a license to trade in the area, the area must not be the county borough of Dublin, an event of significance must be occurring in the area and there must be "a considerable amount" of people in the area: the judge agreed with all four points.&lt;ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/&gt; O'Donnell noted that one hotelier had described the match as having "an international flavour as journalists from the UK were booked into his hotel to report on the game [...] that over 2,000-room nights would be availed of and that certain hotels [...] had to turn away pre and post match functions. He even equated the match to be on a par with the famous [[Galway Plate]]".&lt;ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/&gt; O'Donnell responded to comparisons with a 1961 application for a dance licence in [[Kilkee]], 1971 judicial remarks on the definition of a "special event" and a 1984 [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] case which sought to clarify if a wedding was considered a "special event" in law by saying that none were in any way like this case and that there was no legal definition for the term "special event".&lt;ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publicans toast court ruling on historic Good Friday opening"/&gt; O'Donnell described the application as "a last resort", observed that Thomond Park's stadium license would permit alcohol to be served on the day, that it would be "somewhat absurd" if the pubs lost out on business and also took into account that there were "health and safety reasons" for opening the pubs to serve the thousands of fans leaving the stadium when the match had ended.&lt;ref name="Limerick pubs to open on Good Friday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0325/limerick.html|title=Limerick pubs to open on Good Friday|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=27 March 2010|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Limerick pubs to open for game on Good Friday"/&gt;

Publicans in Limerick were granted legal permission to trade between 18:00 and 23:30 on Good Friday 2010 (the application had sought hours of 18:00 until midnight).&lt;ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publicans toast court ruling on historic Good Friday opening"/&gt; An area map delivered by the applicants had proposed the city of Limerick, Raheen Dooradoyle, Annacotty, Corbally, and Castletroy as the areas in which businesses would freely operate; the judge agreed with this and signed the map.&lt;ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/&gt;

{{cquote|Having considered all the submissions, I am satisfied that the match has all the vestiges and attributes of a special event.

Women's events at the Gymnastics at the Pan American Games were first held at the 1959 Pan American Games.

Three medals are awarded: [[gold medal|gold for first place]], [[silver medal|silver for second place]], and [[bronze medal|bronze for third place]]. [[Tie (draw)|Tie breakers]] have not been used in every year. In the event of a tie between two gymnasts, both names are listed, and the following position (second for a tie for first, third for a tie for second) is left empty because a medal was not awarded for that position. If three gymnastics tied for a position, the following two positions are left empty.

'''H. Dimurthala Stadium''' or previously known as '''Lampineung Stadium''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Banda Aceh]], [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]]. The stadium holds 20,000 people. It is a homebase for [[Persiraja Banda Aceh]].

==Facilities==
Since the stadium is mainly used for football match, it does not have athletic track. It has dressing rooms, a secretariat room, and a press conference room. The single seats are only available for VIP at the east tribune. The east and west tribunes are roofed, whilst the north and south tribunes are not covered with roof (open tribune).

==Usage==
It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. Besides that, it was also used for government employment test&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jpp.go.id/nasional/pemerintahan/310598-dipusatkan-di-stadion-38-000-orang-jalani-seleksi-cpns-kemenkumham-aceh |title= Dipusatkan di Stadion, 38.000 Orang Jalani Seleksi CPNS Kemenkumham Aceh|website= jpp.go.id |language= indonesian |accessdate= 3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beritakini.co/news/ribuan-orang-banjiri-stadion-lampineung-banda-aceh/index.html |title= Ribuan orang Banjiri  Stadion Lampineung Banda Aceh|website= beritakini.co |language= indonesian |accessdate= 3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a venue for music concerts, such as: [[Noah (band)|Peterpan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kapanlagi.com/amp/musik/berita/peterpan-tampil-memukau-di-nad-amygtg7.html |title= Peterpan tampil memukau di NAD|website= kapanlagi.com |language= indonesian |accessdate= 3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maher Zain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seleb.tempo.co/amp/434891/maher-zain-konser-di-banda-aceh |title= Maher Zain Konser di Banda Aceh |website= tempo.co |language= indonesian |accessdate= 3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Indoor cycling''', often also called '''spinning''', as an organized activity, is a form of exercise with classes focusing on endurance, strength, intervals, high intensity (race days) and recovery, and involves using a special stationary [[exercise bicycle]] with a weighted flywheel in a classroom setting.

== Class content and goals ==
[[File:Home cycling trainer 1897.jpg|thumbnail|"All the delight of outdoor cycling enjoyed at home" - article from 1897 describing indoor spin.]]
Classes generally use specialized [[exercise bicycle|stationary bicycle]]s. Features include a mechanical device to modify the difficulty of pedalling, specially shaped handlebars, and multiple adjustment points to fit the bicycle to a range of riders. Many have a weighted [[flywheel]], which simulates the effects of inertia and momentum when riding a real bicycle. The pedals are equipped with toe clips as on sports bicycles to allow one foot to pull up when the other is pushing down. They may alternatively have [[bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless]] receptacles for use with cleated [[cycling shoe]]s. Padded shorts aid comfort and avoid the chafing caused by the sewn seams in underwear.

If the exercise is not done correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort it is important to make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the [[Ball (anatomy)|ball of the foot]] when the pedal is pointing forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodybike.dk/inspiration/good-advice|title=Good advice {{!}} BODY BIKE indoor cycles|website=www.bodybike.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://caloriesburnedhq.com/img/Spinner-Bike-Setup.pdf|title=Spin Shoes - Guide to Indoor Cycling Shoes|last=Chapman|first=Gareth|date=2017-02-12|work=Calories Burned HQ - Zumba Calories Burned, Calories Burned Walking|access-date=2017-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.

A typical class involves a single instructor at the front of the class who leads the participants through routines that are designed to simulate terrain and situations similar to riding a bike outdoors. Some of the movements and positions include hill climbs, sprints and [[interval training]]. A well-trained instructor uses [[music]], [[motivation]], visualization and enthusiastic coaching to lead students through a ride that best suits their fitness level and goals. Most instructors will lead what is called an interval ride, where students will sprint, run, climb, and jump all in the same ride, but there will not be definable pattern to the exercises. In the early 2000s, "terrain-based" classes that simulate outdoor conditions (e.g., wind resistance) were introduced. Terrain-based classes are designed to improve a rider's outdoor skill set and increase endurance while providing an intense cardio-based workout.

Participants set goals based on their [[heart rate]], which can be measured by hand or using a [[heart rate monitor]] and ride simulated variations in terrain by altering resistance and cadence. Some participants choose to maintain a moderate, [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] intensity level, with a heart rate of between 50 and 85% of max while others drive their heart rates higher in intervals of [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity to levels of between 85 and 92%.

One of the major advantages of indoor cycling is that each participant can exactly control his/her level of intensity to suit ability or fitness level but still remain as a group together. The classes can therefore be heterogeneous. As an alternative, participants can judge their level of exertion relative to a perceived exertion scale. The instructor should advise a recommended exertion scale from 1 (no exertion at all) to 10 (maximum exertion). Each rider is permitted to dictate how hard he/she chooses to work with the instructor providing active and dynamic encouragement together with technical and practical advice throughout the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Besides burning (on average) between 300-500 kcal in 60 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Darling, A. "Be Fit: The Science of Health: Part 2: Exercise: Feel the burn: Which workout is best for you? Andy Darling is your guide." Guardian, The. 2005, January 15: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; indoor cycling also strengthens the muscles of the lower body. It tones the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]]s, along with working the back and hips. It can be difficult to stay at the moderate level in a class that is geared towards more intensity. The difficulty of the workout is modulated in two ways:

#By varying the resistance on a [[flywheel]] attached to the pedals. The resistance is controlled by a knob, wheel or lever that the rider operates, causing the flywheel brake (a common bicycle brake, a friction wheel, a magnetic eddy-current brake, a viscoelastic fluid brake, or a strap running around the flywheel) to tighten. On most bikes the brake can be adjusted from completely loose, providing no resistance to pedaling beyond the inertia of the flywheel, to so tight that the rider can not move the pedals. Usually riders who can't pedal at the resistance called out by the instructor are encouraged to ride at a level at which they feel comfortable yet challenged.
#By changing the cadence (the speed at which the pedals turn). Pedaling at a higher rate expends more energy than pedaling at a lower rate with the same resistance. Correct cadence is between the range of 80 to 110 RPM for seated flat, standing flat (running) and jumping and 60 to 80 RPM for seated climb, standing climb, running with resistance and jumps on a hill. Sprints are taken under hill resistance building cadence up to no more than 110 RPM. Seated sprints are most suitable as the rider maintains full control of posture at all times and will avoid falling due to exhaustion. A correct sprint should last from 10 to 25 seconds, leaving the rider exhausted in the 85 to 92% max heart rate range.
[[File:Foundation-20F9-0353.jpg|thumb|Typical fixed wheel ergonomically adjustable variable resistance bike]]
There are five core movements in the Spinning programme.
*'''Seated flat''', with hands at the center part of the handlebars. This is hand position one. This position should be used only when seated, for flat road simulations and during the warm-up and cool down. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*'''Standing flat''' (also known as '''running'''), with hands wide on the back 12-14" part of the handlebars that crosses the rider's body. This is hand position two. Proper form for standing while running requires the body to be more upright and the back of the legs touching or enveloping the point of the saddle, with the center of gravity directly over the crank. The pressure of body weight should never rest excessively on the handlebars. Cadence is between 80 and 110 RPM
*'''Jumps''', (also known as '''lifts'''), a combination of seated and standing with riders hands at position two for durations of between two and eight seconds. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*'''Seated climb''' with hands at position two, increased resistance and lower cadence of 60-80 RPM.
*'''Standing climb''' with hands wide and forward so the thumb tips are touching the far end of the handlebars (hand position three). The rider is canted slightly forward so that maximum force can be exerted onto the pedals with heavy resistance and a cadence of 60-80 RPM.

These five movements each work a different part of the body and focus on different leg muscle groups. The rider should always maintain control of the flywheel by having resistance applied and remaining below a cadence of 110 RPM. Not all bikes have a freewheel, or 'smart release', and it is possible that the flywheel will 'run away' with the rider with the potential for causing injury. The rider should be able to maintain perfectly even pedal rotations at high resistance. This becomes difficult below 60 RPM cadence and failing to make 'perfect circles' increases the risk of knee and hip injury. A road cyclist will normally have a natural pedal cadence, of about 85 RPM and will control changes in terrain by changing gear to maintain this rate. The goal of the spinning programme is not to exceed this natural rate by more than 25 RPM higher (110 RPM) or lower (60 RPM)
There are five further advanced movements based on those listed above.
*'''Running with resistance'''
*'''Jumps on a hill'''
*'''Seated flat sprint'''
*'''Seated hill sprint'''
*'''Standing hill sprint'''

Most indoor cycling classes are coached with [[music]]. Riders may synchronize their pedalling to be in time with the rhythm of the music, thus providing an external stimulus to encourage a certain tempo. Often, the music chosen by the instructor is [[dance music]] or [[rock music]] set to a dance beat (i.e. 4/4 time), but not necessarily. This tends to help motivate participants to work harder than they might otherwise. The instructor also may choose specific songs for sprints, climbs, and jumps. While the music provides a tempo cue, the cadence does not need to be a multiple of the beat in order for the rider to feel in rhythm; the music therefore helps a rider maintain any constant cadence, not just a cadence that matches the beat. It may depend on the level of exertion whether or not someone changes position or the instructor can tell the class to change.

A variation known as "aqua cycling" or "hydrospinning" also exists. In this, the stationary bicycles are underwater in a pool.&lt;ref name="Landreth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2014/jan/21/hydrospinning-fitness-spin-class-cycling-underwater|title=Hydrospinning: the fitness craze that makes your spin class look easy|last=Landreth|first=Jenny|date=21 January 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/08/29/aqua-cycling-new-underwater-workout/|title=Aqua cycling: A new underwater workout|date=29 August 2013|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Olympic Committee''' ('''IOC'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Comité International Olympique'', '''CIO''') is a Swiss private [[non-governmental organisation]] based in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. Created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and [[Demetrios Vikelas]] in 1894, it is the authority responsible for organising the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bartlett, Chris Gratton, Christer G. Rolf ''Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies''. Routledge, 2012, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC is the controlling body for the [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), which are the national constituents of the worldwide Olympic Movement. As of 2016, there are 206 NOCs officially recognised by the IOC. IOC is an [[United Nations Observer]] of [[Olympic Truce]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-becomes-un-observer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olympic.org/cooperation-with-the-un&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IOC was created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], on 23 June 1894 with [[Demetrios Vikelas]] as its first president. As of June 2017, its membership consists of 95 active members, 41 honorary members, an honorary president ([[Jacques Rogge]]) and one honour member ([[Henry Kissinger]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOC Members List|url=https://www.olympic.org/ioc-members-list|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC is the supreme authority of the worldwide modern Olympic movement.

The IOC organises the modern [[Olympic Games]] and [[Youth Olympic Games]], held in summer and winter, every four years. The first [[Summer Olympics]] organised by the IOC was held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]]; the first [[Winter Olympics]] was in [[Chamonix]], [[France]], in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Until 1992, both Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games, to help space the planning of the two events from one another, and improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives greater income on Olympic years. The first Summer Youth Olympics were in [[Singapore]] in [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] and the first Winter Youth Olympics were held in [[Innsbruck]] in [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]].

In 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] granted the IOC Permanent Observer status. This decision enables the IOC to be directly involved in the UN Agenda and to attend UN General Assembly meetings where it can take the floor. This has provided the possibility to promote sport at a new level. In addition, in 1993, the UN General Assembly approved a Resolution that further solidified IOC–UN cooperation with the decision to revive the [[Olympic Truce]], by adopting a Resolution entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal," which calls upon [[Member States]] to observe the Olympic Truce before every iteration of the Olympic Games, and to cooperate with the IOC and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) in their efforts to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation in areas of conflict during and beyond the period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/cooperation-with-the-un|title=Cooperation With The UN|date=21 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During each proclamation at the Olympics, announcers speak in different languages: French is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).

==Mission and roles==

==Organisation==
{{See also|President of the International Olympic Committee|Olympic Congress}}

===IOC Session===
The [[IOC Session]] is the general meeting of the members of the IOC, held once a year in which each member has one vote. It is the IOC's supreme organ and its decisions are final.

Extraordinary Sessions may be convened by the President or upon the written request of at least one third of the members.

Among others, the powers of the Session are:
* To adopt or amend the Olympic Charter.
* To elect the members of the IOC, the Honorary President and the honorary members.
* To elect the President, the Vice-Presidents and all other members of the IOC Executive Board.
* To elect the host city of the Olympic Games.

==Honours==
In addition to the Olympic medals for competitors, the IOC awards a number of other honours.
* The [[IOC President's Trophy]] is the highest sports award given to athletes who have excelled in their sport and had an extraordinary career and created a lasting impact on their sport.
* The [[Pierre de Coubertin medal]] is awarded to athletes who demonstrate a special spirit of sportsmanship in Olympic events
* The [[Olympic Cup]] is awarded to institutions or associations with a record of merit and integrity in actively developing the Olympic Movement
* The [[Olympic Order]] is awarded to ''individuals'' for particularly distinguished contributions to the Olympic Movement, and superseded the Olympic Certificate.
* The [[Olympic Laurel]] is awarded to individuals for promoting education, culture, development, and peace through sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Kip Keino to receive Olympic Laurel distinction|date=4 August 2016|publisher=International Olympic Committee|location=Lausanne|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/kip-keino-to-receive-olympic-laurel-distinction|quote=KIP KEINO (KEN) IS THE FIRST EVER RECIPIENT OF THE OLYMPIC LAUREL, A DISTINCTION CREATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE (IOC) TO HONOUR AN OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS IN EDUCATION, CULTURE, DEVELOPMENT AND PEACE THROUGH SPORT.|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Olympic town]] status has been given to some towns which have been important for the Olympic movement.

==IOC members==
{{Further information|List of members of the International Olympic Committee}}
[[File:Albert Meyer 4 Olympia 1896.jpg|thumb|The first IOC, at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens Games]]]]

For most of its existence, the IOC was controlled by members who were selected by other members. Countries that had hosted the Games were allowed two members. When named, they did not become the representatives of their respective countries to the IOC, but rather the opposite, IOC members in their respective countries.

===Oath of the International Olympic Committee===

''"Granted the honour of becoming a member of the International Olympic Committee and declaring myself aware of my responsibilities in such a capacity, I undertake to serve the Olympic Movement to the very best of my ability; to respect and ensure the respect of all the provisions of the Olympic Charter and the decisions of the International Olympic Committee which I consider as not the subject to appeal on my part; to comply with the code of ethics to keep myself free from any political or commercial influence and from any racial or religious consideration; to fight against all other forms of discrimination; and to promote in all circumstances the interests of the International Olympic Committee and those of the Olympic Movement."''

===Cessation of membership===
The membership of IOC members ceases in the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;Source: Olympic Charter, in force as from 1 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Resignation: any IOC member may cease their membership at any time by delivering a written resignation to the President.
# Non re-election: any IOC member ceases to be a member without further formality if they are not re-elected.
# Age limit: any IOC member ceases to be a member at the end of the calendar year during which they reach the age of 70 or 80.
# Failure to attend Sessions or take active part in IOC work for two consecutive years.
# Transfer of domicile or of main center of interests to a country other than the country which was theirs at the time of their election.
# Members elected as active athletes cease to be a member upon ceasing to be a member of the [[IOC Athletes' Commission]].
# Presidents and individuals holding an executive or senior leadership position within NOCs, world or continental associations of NOCs, IFs or associations of IFs, or other organisations recognised by the IOC cease to be a member upon ceasing to exercise the function they were exercising at the time of their election.
# Expulsion: an IOC member may be expelled by decision of the Session if such member has betrayed their oath or if the Session considers that such member has neglected or knowingly jeopardised the interests of the IOC or acted in a way which is unworthy of the IOC.

&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2&amp;nbsp;million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} Samaranch appointed Canadian IOC member Richard Pound to lead the initiative as Chairman of the "New Sources of Finance Commission".

In 1982 the IOC drafted ISL Marketing, a Swiss sports marketing company, to develop a global marketing programme for the Olympic Movement. ISL successfully developed the programme but was replaced by Meridian Management, a company partly owned by the IOC in the early 1990s.

In 1989, one of the staff members at ISL Marketing, [[Michael Payne (executive)|Michael Payne]], moved to the IOC and became the organisation's first marketing director. However ISL and subsequently Meridian, continued in the established role as the IOC's sales and marketing agents until 2002.&lt;ref name=Supremo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2005/07/20050711/SBJ-In-Depth/How-The-IOC-Took-On-Nike-In-Atlanta.aspx | title = How the IOC took on Nike in Atlanta | date = 11 July 2005 | accessdate=23 February 2011 | publisher=[[Sports Business Journal]] | work=Sports Business Journal Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the IOC terminated the relationship with Meridian and took its marketing programme in-house under the Direction of Timo Lumme, the IOC's managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services.&lt;ref name=Supremo&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/olympics/news/2008-08/06/content_16143673.htm | title = IOC Marketing Supremo: Smile, Beijing | date = 6 August 2008 | accessdate =23 February 2011 | publisher=china.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 17 years with the IOC,&lt;ref name=Supremo/&gt; in collaboration with ISL Marketing and subsequently Meridian Management, Payne made major contributions to the creation of a multibillion-dollar sponsorship marketing programme for the organisation which, along with improvements in TV marketing and improved financial management, helped to restore the IOC's financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/others/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=others/05/02/14/manual_103457.html |title=London Bid 'Has Improved' |publisher=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]] |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133431/http://www.sportinglife.com/others/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=others%2F05%2F02%2F14%2Fmanual_103457.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0214/olympics.html |publisher=[[RTÉ Sport]] |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |title=Boost for London's Olympic Bid |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921184651/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0214/olympics.html |archivedate=21 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Payne – London 2012 to tap fountain of youth | url = http://www.sportbusiness.com/print-edition/payne-london-2012-tap-fountain-youth | date = 22 October 2008 | accessdate =23 February 2011 | publisher=Sportbusiness.com | first = Struan | last = Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue===
The Olympic Movement generates revenue through five major programmes.

# [[Commercial broadcasting|Broadcast]] partnerships, managed by the IOC.
# [[Sponsor (commercial)|Commercial sponsorship]], organised through the IOC's worldwide TOP programme.
# Domestic sponsorship, managed by the OCOGs.
# Ticketing.
# [[License|Licensing]] programmes within the host country.

The OCOGs have responsibility for the domestic sponsorship, ticketing and licensing programmes, under the direction of the IOC.

The Olympic Movement generated a total of more than US$4&amp;nbsp;billion (€2.5&amp;nbsp;billion) in revenue during the Olympic [[quadrennium]] from 2001 to 2004.

;Revenue distribution
The IOC distributes some of the Olympic marketing revenue to organisations throughout the Olympic Movement to support the staging of the Olympic Games and to promote the worldwide development of sport. The IOC retains approximately 10% of the Olympic marketing revenue for the operational and administrative costs of governing the Olympic Movement.&lt;ref&gt;IOC: [http://www.olympic.org/ioc-financing-revenue-sources-distribution?tab=distribution Revenue Sources and Distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|OCOG}}

===Organising Committees for the Olympic Games===
The IOC provides TOP programme contributions and Olympic broadcast revenue to the OCOGs to support the staging of the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games:
* TOP programme revenue to OCOGs: the two OCOGs of each Olympic quadrennium generally share approximately 50% of TOP programme revenue and value-in-kind contributions, with approximately 30% provided to the summer OCOG and 20% provided to the winter OCOG.
* Broadcast revenue to OCOGs: the IOC contributes 49% of the Olympic broadcast revenue for each Games to the OCOG. During the 2001–2004 Olympic quadrennium, the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee]] received US$443&amp;nbsp;million, €395 million in broadcast revenue from the IOC, and the Athens 2004 Organizing Committee received US$732&amp;nbsp;million, €690 million.
* Domestic programme revenue to OCOGs: the OCOGs generate substantial revenue from the domestic marketing programmes that they manage within the host country, including domestic sponsorship, ticketing and licensing.

===National Olympic Committees===
{{further information|National Olympic Committee}}
The NOCs receive financial support for the training and development of Olympic teams, Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls. The IOC distributes TOP programme revenue to each of the NOCs throughout the world. The IOC also contributes Olympic broadcast revenue to Olympic Solidarity, an IOC organisation that provides financial support to NOCs with the greatest need.

The continued success of the TOP programme and Olympic broadcast agreements has enabled the IOC to provide increased support for the NOCs with each Olympic quadrennium. The IOC provided approximately US$318.5&amp;nbsp;million to NOCs for the 2001–2004 quadrennium.

===International Olympic Sports Federations===
The IOC is now the largest single revenue source for the majority of [[List of international sports federations|IFs]], with its contributions of Olympic broadcast revenue that assist the IFs in the development of their respective sports worldwide. The IOC provides financial support from Olympic broadcast revenue to the 28 IFs of Olympic summer sports and the seven IFs of Olympic winter sports after the completion of the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, respectively.

The continually increasing value of Olympic broadcast partnership has enabled the IOC to deliver substantially increased financial support to the IFs with each successive Games. The seven winter sports IFs shared US$85.8&amp;nbsp;million, €75 million in Salt Lake 2002 broadcast revenue. The contribution to the 28 summer sports IFs from Athens 2004 broadcast revenue has not yet been determined, but the contribution is expected to mark a significant increase over the US$190&amp;nbsp;million, €150 million that the IOC provided to the summer IFs following Sydney 2000.

===Other organisations===
The IOC contributes Olympic marketing revenue to the programmes of various recognised international sports organisations, including the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC), and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).

==The Olympic Partner programme==
The Olympic Partner (TOP) sponsorship programme includes the following commercial sponsors of the Olympic Games.
* [[Coca-Cola]]
* [[Allianz]]
* [[Alibaba Group]]
* [[Atos]]
* [[Bridgestone]]
* [[Dow Chemical Company]]
* [[General Electric]]
* [[Intel]]
* [[Omega SA]] (previously [[The Swatch Group]], its parent company)
* [[Panasonic]]
* [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]
* [[Samsung]]
* [[Toyota]]
* [[Visa Inc.]]

==Environmental concerns==
The IOC recognizes that the Olympic Games demand substantial environmental resources, activities, and construction projects that could be detrimental to a host city's environment.&lt;ref name=Jin2008{{&gt;Jin Y, Zhang JJ, Ma X, Connaughton DP. (2011). Residents' Perceptions of Environmental Impacts of the 2008 Beijing Green Olympic Games. European Sport Management Quarterly, 11:3, 275-300.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch stated, "the International Olympic Committee is resolved to ensure that the environment becomes the third dimension of the organization of the Olympic Games, the first and second being sport and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Jagemann H. (2003). Sport and the Environment: Ways toward Achieving the Sustainable Development of Sport. Retrieved 23 October 2016 from: http://thesportjournal.org/article/sports-and-the-environment-ways-towards-achieving-the-sustainable-development-of-sport/&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on this statement, in 1996 the IOC added the "environment" as a third pillar to its vision for the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer S. (2006). The green Olympic Movement: Beijing 2008. Chinese Journal of International Law, 5:2, 423-440.&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC requires cities bidding to host the Olympics to provide a comprehensive strategy to protect the environment in preparation for hosting, and following the conclusion of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;IOC. (2009). Host City Contract. Retrieved 23 October 2016 from: http://www.gamesmonitor.org.uk/files/Host%20City%20Contract.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was most notably acted upon in 2000, when the "Green Olympics" effort was developed by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Beijing Olympic Games. The Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympics]] effort to host environmentally friendly games resulted in over 160 projects meeting the goal of "green" games through improved [[air quality]] and [[water quality]], implementation of sustainable energy sources, improved waste management, and environmental education. These projects included industrial plant relocation or closure, furnace replacement, introduction of new emission standards, and more strict traffic control.&lt;ref&gt;Chen Y, Jin GZ, Kumar N, Shi G. (2012). The Promise of Beijing: Evaluating the Impact of the 2008 Olympic Games on Air Quality. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 66, 424-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these measures were adopted on a temporary basis, and although real improvements were realized (particularly in [[air quality]]), most of these improvements had disappeared one year following the Games. Although these improvements were short lived, IOC's inclusion of environmental policies in evaluating and selecting host cities demonstrates a corporate responsibility that may be built upon in years to come. Detailed frameworks for environmental sustainability have been released for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], and [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in PyeongChang, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;The PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

===IOC approaches===
The IOC has four major approaches to addressing environmental health concerns during the construction and competitions of the Olympic Games. First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olympic.org/sustainability-and-legacy-commission&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on environmental health issues like air quality and environmental impact assessments. Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare "pledges" to address specific or general environmental health concerns of hosting the Olympic Game. Fourthly, the IOC has every host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44575.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches in an attempt to minimize the negative environmental health concerns of a host city.

===Venue construction effects on air===
Cities hosting the Olympic Games have two primary concerns: traffic congestion and air pollution, both of which can result in compromised air quality during and after Olympic venue construction.&lt;ref name="Qiao Q 2011"&gt;Qiao Q, Zhang C, Huang B, Piper JDA. (2011). Evaluating the environmental quality impact of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games: magnetic monitoring of street dust in Beijing Olympic Park. Geophysical Journal International, Vol. 187; 1222.&lt;/ref&gt; Research at the Beijing Olympic Games identified particulate matter – measured in terms of PM10 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle≤10 μm in a given amount of air) – as a top priority that should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Chena DS, Chenga SY, Liub L, Chenc T, Guoa XR. (2007). An integrated MM5–CMAQ modeling approach for assessing transboundary PM10 contribution to the host city of 2008 Olympic summer games—Beijing, China. Atmospheric environment. Vol. 41; 1237-1250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang X et. al. (2009). Evaluating the air quality impacts of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games: On-road emission factors and black carbon profiles. Atmospheric environment. Vol. 43; 4535-4543.&lt;/ref&gt; The particulate matter in the air, along with other airborne pollutants, cause both serious health problems, such as [[asthma]], and contribute to the deterioration of urban ecosystems. Black Carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids contributing to global climate change and human health effects. The black carbon concentrations are highly impacted by the truck traffic due to the traffic congestion during the massive construction. Additionally, secondary pollutants like [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[NOx]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO2]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylenes]] (BTEX) are also released during the venue construction, resulting in harmful effects to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wang T et. al. (2010). Air quality during the 2008 Beijing Olympics: secondary pollutants and regional impact. Atmos. Chem. Phys. Vol. 10; 7603–7615.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods to measure particulates in the air====
Environmental magnetic methods have been established as a successful way of measuring the degree of pollution in air, water and soil. Environmental magnetism is sensitive to particle size, and has proven effective even at low detection levels. For these reasons, it is becoming more widely used.

====Measures taken to improve air quality====
Various [[air quality]] measures are undertaken before and after the Olympic Games. Research studies demonstrate that the primary method to reduce concentrations of air pollutants is traffic control, including barring heavy vehicles from the roads. For the Beijing Olympics, vehicles not meeting the Euro 1 emission standards were also banned from the roads, and the odd-even rule was implemented in the Beijing administrative area. Additional air quality improvement measures include replacing coal with natural gas, suspending construction and/or imposing strict dust control on construction sites, closing or relocating the polluting industrial plants, building long subway lines, using cleaner fluid in power plants, and reducing the activity by some of the polluting factories. These were several air quality improvement measures implemented by the Beijing government. There, levels of primary and secondary pollutants were reduced, and good air quality was recorded during the Beijing Olympics on most of the days.

===Venue construction effects on soil===
[[Soil contamination]] can occur during the process of constructing the Olympic venues. In the case of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, negative environmental impacts were observed, including impacts on soil. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas which the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They performed an extensive analysis in the types of chemicals found in the soils in these areas both before and after the Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoils post-Games, and indicated that soil was capable, as part of an ecosystem, of negating, or "buffering," the effects of many heavy metals. However, their findings also revealed that this was not the case for all metals, and that mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred into the food chain on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soil Heavy Metals Patterns in the Torino Olympic Winter Games Venue (E.U.)|journal=Soil and Sediment Contamination|pages=205–220|volume=17|issue=3|doi=10.1080/15320380802006905}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the promises made to Londoners when they won the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a "blueprint for sustainable living." However, residents of the allotments of Manor Road were relocated, due to the building of the Olympic stadium, and would later disagree that the Olympics had had any positive effect on their lives. Allotments, originally, were intended to provide low-income residents with a plot of land on which to grow their own food, thus receiving the dual health benefits of a supply of fresh food and outdoor work. Many of these sites were lost as a result of the Olympic venue construction, most notably the Manor Road site. Residents were promised that the allotments would be returned, and they eventually were. However, the soil quality would never be the same. Crops tended by allotment residents were the result of years of careful cultivation, and thus, those years of care and attention were destroyed by a bulldozer. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months prior to moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other local residents, construction workers, and onsite archeologists faced similar exposures and risks.&lt;ref&gt;Sadd D. (2012). Not all Olympic 'events' are good for the health just ask the previous occupants of the Manor Road. Allotments Perspectives in Public Health. Vol. 132; 2, 62–63.[SIC]&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 provided an opportunity to improve a highly contaminated area known as the Homebush Bay site. A study commissioned by the New South Wales Government Olympic Coordination Authority, which was responsible for the Games' site preparation, looked at soil contamination prior to the Games. The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that could pose a risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney's winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the "greenest" single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Suh J-Y, Birch G. F., Hughes K., Matthai C. (2004) Spatial distribution and source of heavy metals in reclaimed lands of Homebush Bay: the venue of the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney, New South Wales. Australian Journal of Earth Sciences. Vol. 51: 53–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venue construction effects on water===
The Olympic Games can affect water quality in the surrounding region in several ways, including water runoff and the transfer of polluting substances from the air to water sources through rainfall. Harmful particulates come from both natural substances (such as plant matter crushed by higher volumes of pedestrian and vehicle traffic) and man-made substances (such as exhaust from vehicles or industry). Contaminants from these two categories lead to elevated amounts of toxins in street dust. Street dust then reaches water sources through runoff, facilitating the transfer of toxins to environments and communities that rely on these water sources.&lt;ref name="Qiao Q 2011"/&gt; For example, one method of measuring the runoff contamination of water sources involves magnetism. Magnetism measurement systems allow specialists to measure the differences in mineral magnetic parameters in samples of water, air, and vegetation. Unlike traditional methods of measuring pollutants, magnetism is relatively inexpensive, and can identify smaller particle sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Qiao, 1223.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another method used to assess the amount and effects of water pollutants is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle≤2.5 μm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ouyang W et. al. The washing effect of precipitation on particulate matter and the pollution dynamics of rainwater in downtown Beijing. Science of the Total Environment. Vol. 505; 306–314. 1 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant "washing" effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ouyang W. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Beijing's notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.

==Controversies==
{{Olympic Games infobox}}

===Amateurism and professionalism===
{{main article|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}

[[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the IOC, was influenced by the ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[Independent school (UK)|English public schools]].&lt;ref name=OIdeology&gt;{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120–123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education and there was a prevailing concept of fairness in which practicing or training was considered cheating.&lt;ref name=OIdeology/&gt; As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.&lt;ref name=OIdeology/&gt; The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

Near the end of the 1960s, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team's full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the IIHF and IOC. [[Avery Brundage]], president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players&lt;ref name="Num17"&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html Story #17–Protesting amateur rules, Canada leaves international hockey].&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1970 World Championships in [[Montreal]] and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-40.html Story #40–Finally, Canada to host the World Championship].&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt; In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until "open competition" was instituted.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Summit Series '72 Summary |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |accessdate=2 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130920/http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs.&lt;ref name="Amateurism"&gt;

===1976 Winter Olympics (Denver, Colorado)===
{{main article|Bids for the 1976 Winter Olympics}}

The cities of [[Denver]], Colorado, United States; [[Sion, Switzerland]]; [[Tampere, Finland]]; and [[Vancouver]] (with the Garibaldi mountains), Canada, made bids for the [[1976 Winter Olympics]].

The Games were originally awarded to Denver on 12 May 1970, but a 300% rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to [[Colorado]] voters' rejection on 7 November 1972, by a 3 to 2 margin, of a $5&amp;nbsp;million bond issue to finance the Games with public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |title=Colorado only state ever to turn down Olympics |publisher=Denver.rockymountainnews.com |accessdate=23 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601181029/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |archivedate=1 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/oly/view/0,3949,40000046,00.html |title=The Games that got away – 2002 Winter Olympics coverage |publisher=Deseretnews.com |accessdate=23 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901194251/http://www.deseretnews.com/oly/view/0%2C3949%2C40000046%2C00.html |archivedate=1 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and the IOC then offered the Games to [[Whistler, British Columbia]], Canada, but they too declined, owing to a [[British Columbia general election, 1972|change of government]] following elections. Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]'s successful bid for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Games.]]

[[Salt Lake City]], Utah, a [[1972 Winter Olympics]] final candidate who would eventually host the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], offered itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of Denver. The IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined the offer from Salt Lake City and, on 5 February 1973, selected [[Innsbruck]] to host the 1976 Winter Olympics, the same city that had hosted the Games [[1964 Winter Olympics|twelve years earlier]].

===Salt Lake bid scandal===
{{main article|2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal}}

A scandal broke on 10 December 1998, when [[Switzerland|Swiss]] IOC member [[Marc Hodler]], head of the coordination committee overseeing the organisation of the 2002 Games, announced that several members of the IOC had taken bribes. Soon four independent investigations were underway: by the IOC, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC), the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|SLOC]], and the [[United States Department of Justice]].

Before any of the investigations could even get under way, both Welch and Johnson resigned their posts as the head of the SLOC. Many others soon followed. The Department of Justice filed charges against the two: fifteen charges of bribery and fraud. Johnson and Welch were eventually acquitted of all criminal charges in December 2003.

As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and another ten were sanctioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/oly/view/0,3949,35000108,00.html |title=Samaranch reflects on bid scandal with regret |work=2002 Winter Olympics coverage |publisher=Deseret News Archives |date=19 May 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020226194341/http://deseretnews.com/oly/view/0%2C3949%2C35000108%2C00.html |archivedate=26 February 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first expulsion or sanction for corruption in the more than a century the IOC had existed. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were put into place as to how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.

===Other controversies: 2006–2013===
In 2006, a report ordered by the [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]] region's governor said the Japanese city provided millions of dollars in an "illegitimate and excessive level of hospitality" to IOC members, including $4.4&amp;nbsp;million spent on entertainment alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/sports/news/20060114p2a00m0sp003000c.html |title=Mainichi Daily News ends its partnership with MSN, takes on new Web address |publisher=Mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier reports put the figure at approximately $14 million. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano, after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public, destroyed the financial records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

International groups attempted to pressure the IOC to reject Beijing's bid in protest of the state of [[human rights in the People's Republic of China]]. One Chinese dissident who expressed similar sentiments was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for calling on the IOC to do just that at the same time that IOC inspectors were touring the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beijing opens itself up to Olympic inspectors |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=25 February 2001 |first=Christopher |last=Bodeen |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010225/ai_n13899744|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115053613/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010225/ai_n13899744|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] expressed concern in 2006 regarding the Olympic Games to be held in China in 2008, likewise expressing concerns over the human rights situation.

In August 2008, the IOC issued [[DMCA]] take down notices on [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan Protest videos]] of the Beijing Olympics hosted on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;IOC backs off DMCA take-down for Tibet protest {{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/08/14/video-ioc-backs-dmca-take-down-tibet-protest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818013947/http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/08/14/video-ioc-backs-dmca-take-down-tibet-protest |archivedate=18 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) both pushed back against the IOC, which then withdrew their complaint.

In 2010, the IOC was nominated for the [[Public Eye Awards]]. This award seeks to present "shame-on-you-awards to the nastiest corporate players of the year".&lt;ref name=public&gt;{{cite web | title=The Public Eye Awards Nominations 2010 | url=http://www.publiceye.ch/en/nominations/ioc/ | work=Public Eye | accessdate=17 February 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928080152/http://www.publiceye.ch/en/nominations/ioc/ | archivedate=28 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the 2012 Olympic Games, the IOC decided not to hold a [[minute of silence]] to honor the 11 Israeli Olympians who were killed 40 years prior in the [[Munich Massacre]]. [[Jacques Rogge]], the then-IOC President, said it would be "inappropriate" to do so. Speaking of the decision, Israeli Olympian [[Shaul Ladany]], who had survived the Munich Massacre, commented: "I do not understand. I do not understand, and I do not accept it".&lt;ref name=nosilence&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/27/sport/olympics-2012-munich-shaul-ladany-survivor |author=James Montague |title=The Munich massacre: A survivor's story |publisher=CNN |date=5 September 2012|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the IOC did not include [[wrestling]] as one of its core [[Olympic sports]] for the Summer Olympic programme for the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Olympics]]. This decision was poorly received by the sporting and wrestling community. Wrestling was still part of the programme at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/wrestling/story/_/id/8939185/ioc-drops-wrestling-2020-olympics |title=Wrestling dropped from 2020 Games |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was later overturned, and wrestling will be a part of the [[2020 Olympic Games]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/olympic-sports/sport/story/236327.html |title=Wrestling reinstated for Tokyo 2020 &amp;#124; Olympics News |publisher=ESPN.co.uk |date=8 September 2013 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As planned, the alpine ski run and luge racing area of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will be built in the core area of Beijing Songshan National Reserves. A great number of valuable species such as Lonicera oblata and Cypripedium shanxiense S. C. Chen are found here and many of them can not be conserved through ex situ conservation. Many Chinese professionals of biology and environmentalists deemed that if the Olympic venues are developed in such area, the rare species and integrated ecological environment will be catastrophically collapsed. Chinese government intended to remove such area out from the range of the natural reserves and chose some other area with few rare species as the reserves. Besides, the comments regarding the strict compliance with laws and protection of Songshan National Reserves are widely deleted or restricted in China. All these actions have been criticized by some media and the professionals of biology in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/beijing-winter-olympics-2022s-environmental-impact-includes-nature-reserve-damage-2036501 |title=Beijing Winter Olympics 2022's Environmental Impact Includes Nature Reserve Damage, Critics Say |publisher=ibtimes.com |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian doping scandal===
{{See also|Doping in Russia|Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|McLaren Report|Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games|Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics}}
Media attention began growing in December 2014 when German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to [[doping in East Germany]]. In November 2015, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) published a report and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported that they were unable to fully carry out their work and noted intimidation by armed [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Update on the status of Russia testing|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/2016.06.15_russia_testing_update_final.pdf|publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]]|date=June 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by [[Richard McLaren (academic)|Richard McLaren]]. McLaren's investigation found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Ministry of Sport]] and the FSB had operated a "state-directed failsafe system" using a "disappearing positive [test] methodology" (DPM) from "at least late 2011 to August 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McLaren Independent Investigations Report into Sochi Allegations|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-control-process/mclaren-independent-investigation-report-part-i|publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]]|date=18 July 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code and recommended that Russia be banned from competing at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WADA Statement: Independent Investigation confirms Russian State manipulation of the doping control process|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-07/wada-statement-independent-investigation-confirms-russian-state-manipulation-of|publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]]|date=18 July 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that a separate decision would be made for each athlete by the relevant [[international federation|IF]] and the IOC, based on the athlete's individual circumstances.&lt;ref name= "IOCdecision"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.olympic.org/news/decision-of-the-ioc-executive-board-concerning-the-participation-of-russian-athletes-in-the-olympic-games-rio-2016 |title=Decision of the IOC Executive Board concerning the participation of Russian athletes in the Olympic Games Rio 2016|date=24 July 2016| publisher =IOC |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= ":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jul/30/ioc-sets-up-3-person-panel-to-rule-on-russian/ |title= IOC sets up 3-person panel to rule on Russian entries | newspaper = San Diego Tribune |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160731040000/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jul/30/ioc-sets-up-3-person-panel-to-rule-on-russian/ |archive-date=31 July 2016 |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day prior to the opening ceremony, 270 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 167 were removed because of doping.&lt;ref name= ":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36970627|title= Rio 2016: 270 Russians cleared to compete at Olympic Games |website= BBC |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160804174234/http://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36970627 |archive-date=4 August 2016 |access-date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag (for a non-doping related matter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Pound confident Russian athletes will be found guilty of Sochi 2014 doping despite IOC inaction|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1051180/exclusive-pound-confident-russian-athletes-will-be-found-guilty-of-sochi-2014-doping-despite-ioc-inaction|publisher=insidethegames.biz|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doping pressure mounts on IOC at German parliament|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1051180/exclusive-pound-confident-russian-athletes-will-be-found-guilty-of-sochi-2014-doping-despite-ioc-inaction|publisher=dw.com|date=27 April 2017|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I fear the answer is yes."&lt;ref name="thespec.com"/&gt; Writing for ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' in Germany, Olivia Gerstenberger said that Bach had "flunked" his first serious test, adding, "With this decision, the credibility of the organization is shattered once more, while that of state-sponsored doping actually receives a minor boost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opinion: A non-decision from the IOC|url=http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-a-non-decision-from-the-ioc/a-19424467|publisher=dw.com|date=24 July 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725145348/http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-a-non-decision-from-the-ioc/a-19424467|archivedate=25 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bild]]'' (Germany) described Bach as "Putin's poodle".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Paul Hayward, chief sports writer of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK), remarked, "The white flag of capitulation flies over the International Olympic Committee. Russia's deep political reach should have told us this would happen.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Leaders of thirteen national anti-doping organisations wrote that the IOC had "violated the athletes' fundamental rights to participate in Games that meet the stringent requirements of the World Anti-Doping Code" and "[demonstrated that] it lacks the independence required to keep commercial and political interests from influencing the tough decisions necessary to protect clean sport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian doping scandal: 'When it mattered most, the IOC failed to lead'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/31/russian-doping-scandal-ioc-failed-to-lead-national-anti-doping-organisations/|publisher=theguardian.com|date=31 July 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; WADA's former chief investigation, Jack Robertson, said "The anti-doping code is now just suggestions to follow or not" and that "WADA handed the IOC that excuse [not enough time before the Olympics] by sitting on the allegations for close to a year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Eve of Olympics, Top Investigator Details Secret Efforts to Undermine Russian Doping Probe|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/olympics-top-investigator-secret-efforts-undermine-russian-doping-probe|publisher=propublica.org|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLaren was dissatisfied with the IOC's handling of his report, saying "It was about state-sponsored doping and the mis-recording of doping results and they turned the focus into individual athletes and whether they should compete.

In contrast to the IOC, the [[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]] voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]], having found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The IPC suspends the Russian Paralympic Committee with immediate effect|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-suspends-russian-paralympic-committee-immediate-effect|publisher=espn.com|date=15 March 2017|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the [[Russian Olympic Committee]] had been suspended effective immediately from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] as an "Olympic Athlete from Russia" (OAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruiz |first1=Rebecca C. |last2=Panja |first2=Tariq |date=5 December 2017 |title=Russia Banned From Winter Olympics by I.O.C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/sports/olympics/ioc-russia-winter-olympics.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present.

On 1 February 2018, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] partially overturned IOC's doping suspensions. For 28 of 42 suspended athletes, their appeals were upheld, the sanctions annulled and their individual results achieved in Sochi 2014 were reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=1 February 2017 |title=THE COURT OF ARBITRATION FOR SPORT (CAS) DELIVERS ITS DECISIONS IN THE MATTER OF 39 RUSSIAN ATHLETES V/ THE IOC: 28 APPEALS UPHELD, 11 PARTIALLY UPHELD |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release__decision_RUS_IOC_.pdf |publisher=[[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] |accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Judo newaza.jpg|thumb|These two judoka are wearing judogi]]
'''''Judogi''''' (柔道着 or 柔道衣) is the formal [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the traditional uniform used for [[Judo]] practice and competition.

A judogi is somewhat similar to a [[karategi]] (空手着 or 空手衣, '''[[Karate]] uniform''') as it shares a common origin. [[Jigoro Kano]] derived the original Judogi from the [[Kimono]] and other Japanese garments around the turn of the 20th century, and, as such, the judogi was the first modern martial-arts-training uniform.  Over the years, the sleeves and pants have been lengthened, the material and fit have changed, the traditional unbleached cotton is now a bleached white, and blue Judogi have become available; nevertheless, the uniform is still very close to that used 100 years ago. Other martial arts, notably [[Karate]], later adopted the style of training uniform that is used in Judo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judogi comprises three parts that are usually cut from different fabrics: a very heavy jacket (uwagi), lighter canvas pants (shitabaki), and a cotton  belt (obi).  Though similar to the shorter styles of kimono, an uwagi will invariably be made from heavy-weight [[cotton]] or cotton blend.  All but the cheapest and lightest uwagi are cut from woven cotton, similar to, but much more tightly woven than, terrycloth. More expensive competition and hand-made judogi will often weigh several kilograms when finished. Due to the nature of judo practice, they commonly have heavier stitching and double-layered knee patches to provide durability. The obi's different colors denote the different ranks in judo.

[[File:Judo orange belt (Brusselsshrek).JPG|thumb|Close up view of a judogi]]
In competition, judogi sizes and fit are strictly defined by the IJF rules of judo (see below).  These rules define sleeve and pant length as well as the looseness of the fit; in competition, the referee can disqualify a competitor for wearing an ill-fitting judogi that may be used for advantage. In addition, various organizations and events oversee such matters as the attachment of commercial and team/national patches and competitors' names. All competitive judogi must be clean and free of holes, tears, or excessive wear.

In official national or international competition only white or blue judogi are allowed. Competitors must have available both colors because one contestant in each match is designated to wear a blue gi while the other wears a white gi. Most judo classes will permit students to wear either color, although white is the traditional color that is often preferred and white fits in better with the traditions of judo and Japanese culture. Less common colors, including red and black, can be found in less formal or specialized situations.

The left side of the gi must cross over the right one.

== Judogi weights ==
Judogi are sold in many thicknesses, which can be generally grouped together in the two classes: single-weave and [[Double weave|double-weave]]. Single-weave judogi are thinner and weigh less (upper jacket textile fabric weight usually 300–550&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The thinner judogi are less durable, although some judoka (judo practitioners) may prefer them for long practices as they are less likely to foster overheating. Double-weave judogi are thicker and weigh more (fabric weight usually 650–1050&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They are harder to grab than single-weave gis, which is considered an advantage in competition. Double-weave gis shrink less and those of high quality are often sold entirely pre-shrunk, this is important to know when comparing the fit of the gi. Double-weave gis generally cost considerably more than single-weave gis of comparable quality.

Pants by themselves should not be classified as single-weave or double-weave as the name only refers to the weaving style used for the upper section of the jacket. However, pants sold together with double-weave jackets will also tend to be heavier than normal due to stronger fabric or large reinforced sections.

Double-weave jackets designed for competition usually display a prominent seam that runs down the back of the jacket, joining two halves of fabric. Starting in the late nineties, some manufacturers made this overlapping part very wide, in effect doubling the fabric thickness for a large section of the back. This blocked the opponent from gripping there, which in 2005 caused the [[International Judo Federation]] to ban fighting in international competitions using a judogi with back seam area wider than 3&amp;nbsp;cm (a little more than one inch). Wider designs could still be permitted in local competitions depending on national rules. Single-weave jackets usually have no back seam, or a narrow one which only joins two fabric sections without interfering with grips.

'''Maurice Richard Arena''' ({{lang-fr|'''Aréna Maurice-Richard'''}}) is a 4,750-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] at [[Olympic Park, Montreal|Olympic Park]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. It was built in 1962. It is named in honour of [[Maurice Richard]].

The rink was renovated in 1994. Dedicated to hometown hockey hero Maurice Richard, this arena includes a multi-media exhibition on the life of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] great. Entrance to the arena is free and there is a souvenir shop onsite. Formerly home to the [[Montreal Rocket]], the ice rink is also used for training by speed and figure skaters. It can host corporate events, with banquet seating up to 2000.

The arena also hosted [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|boxing]] and [[Wrestling at the 1976 Summer Olympics|wrestling]] events at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. The building is located on the same massive city block that is home to [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] and [[Saputo Stadium]]. It is situated in the south east corner, next to the [[Montreal Biodome|Biodome]] (formerly the cycling [[Velodrome]]) and the Olympic Stadium. The arena still hosts fight cards and concerts, and hosted the 2014 [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]].

'''Octorad''' is a term coined to describe a style of [[stadium]] architecture in the late 1960s. The term suggests eight radiuses, the design incorporating four [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]s of a large circle to comprise most of the structure, and four arcs of a smaller circle to round out the corners. It was a variant on the archetypal [[multi-purpose stadiums]] of the time, many of which were either conventionally circular or oval, and were often criticized for poor sight line angles for many spectators at [[baseball]] and [[football]] games.

The most prominent examples of the octorad style were [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in [[San Diego]], which opened in 1967 and still exists; and [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], which opened in 1971 and has since been demolished.

Both stadiums accomplished the goal of providing better sight lines for spectators. However, the architecture of those two stadiums still put a large majority of the fans far away from the action.

Other terms sometimes used for this design were "[[Superellipse|super circle]]" and "square circle".

Parade Stadium is a former football stadium in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. It was Minneapolis's first public football stadium. The [[Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board]] built the 16,560-seat stadium at The Parade, a park just west of downtown, in 1951. It was meant for high school, amateur, and small-college games.&lt;ref name="mnopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Parade Stadium, Minneapolis|url=http://www.mnopedia.org/place/parade-stadium-minneapolis|website=MNopedia|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was also used for summertime [[Minneapolis Aquatennial]] festivities for over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquatennial Program Highlights|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/183355995/|work=Minneapolis Star|date=July 18, 1965|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Thomas Lowry]], who lived on a hill overlooking the grounds, and others donated most of the land for The Parade to the Minneapolis park board in 1904.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=Parade Park - History |url=https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/parade_park/#group_3_18425 |publisher=Minneapolis Park &amp; Recreation Board |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board did not act on Lowry's suggestion for a golf course for the park but did express its intent to use the area for active recreation purposes. In the spring of 1908, the park board developed five baseball fields at The Parade, which were the city's first public recreation facilities. They were so popular that a permit system was created. Two more baseball fields were added in the summer. The ball fields had practices every weeknight and games every Saturday. Athletics were not allowed on Sundays. That fall football goal posts were installed.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The first citywide track meet was held in 1910 and the park board built four tennis courts in 1911. [[Woodrow Wilson]] gave a campaign speech at The Parade in 1912. After the seven baseball and two football fields were re-graded and open for play in 1914, the park became the center of amateur sports in the city.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In the 1920s, some football games at The Parade attracted standing crowds estimated at 5,000 spectators.

The park board proposed building a stadium there in 1933, and applied for federal public-works funding, but were unsuccessful. It tried again, in 1944, when it added a stadium to its list of "post-war progress" projects. The board claimed the city needed a stadium with a seating capacity between the huge [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] and various small park and school athletic fields.&lt;ref name="mnopedia" /&gt;

In 1950, the city finally approved $600,000 in bonds over two years to build only the stadium. To make room for it, the park board moved The Parade tennis center to Nicollet Park, since renamed Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Park.&lt;ref name="mnopedia" /&gt;

The stadium hosted its first major event in July 1951, when the [[Lone Ranger]] and Silver appeared at an Aquatennial children's event. That September, an exhibition football game between the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] drew 20,000 fans. At first, the stadium was a financial success, partly because of revenue from hosting an annual [[National Football League]] (NFL) exhibition game. But Parade Stadium was never intended to host professional games. When [[Metropolitan Stadium]] was built in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]] in 1956 to attract professional baseball and football to Minnesota, the yearly NFL exhibition game was played there.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Parade Stadium continued hosting about 50 football games a year. The most popular were Friday-night and Saturday-night Minneapolis high school games. It hosted the annual Minnesota high school all-star football game for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota Football Showcase|url=http://www.allstarfootball.org/HISTORY/MNallstarlocations.pdf|website=www.allstarfootball.org|publisher=Minnesota Football Coaches Association|accessdate=28 December 2017|page=10}} Includes aerial photo.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augsburg University]]'s football team used Parade Stadium as its home field from 1951 to 1983. It also was the starting point of the two Aquatennial parades each summer. The park board booked other events, from midget-car races to circuses. But area residents objected to the noise and traffic. The costs of maintaining the stadium soon exceeded revenue.&lt;ref name="mnopedia" /&gt;

By the mid-1960s, the only moneymaker at The Parade was the parking lot. After the [[Guthrie Theater]] opened across the street in May 1963, most of its patrons parked in the stadium lot.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In the mid-1960s, Parade Stadium generated income by booking top musical acts for outdoor rock concerts. [[Buffalo Springfield]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], among others, played there. Singer [[Melissa Manchester]] drew the stadium's largest crowd of 30,000 in June 1979. The last big-name act to play at Parade Stadium was [[Simon and Garfunkel]] in July 1983.&lt;ref name="mnopedia" /&gt;

Eventually, music promoters became unwilling to meet the growing limitations placed on concerts by the park board to address complaints from people who lived near the stadium. By 1986, only five events were booked there, two of which were Aquatennial parades. The structure was 35 years old, and the park board estimated that it needed $250,000 in renovations.&lt;ref name="mnopedia" /&gt;

In 1988, the park board collaborated with the [[Walker Art Center]] to create the [[Minneapolis Sculpture Garden]] on park land next to the stadium. The Sculpture Garden's popularity led to its expansion in 1990. A heavily used softball field had to be moved to accommodate that expansion. The logical place to put it was where the little-used stadium stood. As a result, Parade Stadium was demolished in 1990, the softball field was moved, and the Sculpture Garden expanded. The Walker paid the million-dollar price tag for demolition of the stadium and relocation of the softball field.&lt;ref name="mnopedia" /&gt;

'''Pyongyang Marathon''', also known as '''Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon''', is an annual [[marathon]] race contested each April in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of [[North Korea]]. It is categorised as an [[IAAF Bronze Label Road Race]].

The marathon was held for the first time in 1981 for men, and the women's event was initiated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Today: [http://www.kcckp.net/de/periodic/todaykorea/index.php?contents+4078+2009-03+119+28 Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon Race]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 race was the 22nd event.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Central News Agency: April 12, 2009: [http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200904/news12/20090412-17ee.html Mangyongdae Prize Marathon Race Held] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610172744/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200904/news12/20090412-17ee.html |date=2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was opened for international runners again in 2000.

'''Renegades Football Club''' (formerly known as '''Lyford Cay Football Club'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahamasfa.com/clubs/club/6/lyford_cay_fc.html&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Lyford Cay]] while playing its home game in the capital [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]. The team plays in the [[BFA Senior League]]. The team is also known by its nickname of the '''Ospreys''' (the '''Dragons''' until 2015), to distinguish it from a second Lyford Cay FC that has simultaneously played in the BFA Senior League (as recently as 2013–14) nicknamed the "[[Lyford Cay FC (Warriors)|Warriors]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bahama2014.html|title=Bahamas 2013/14|author=RSSSF.com|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Warriors serve as the reserve team for the Ospreys.

The club was founded in 1989 and has grown significantly over the past twenty-five years moving from a school-based football program to an established football club and registered member of the [[Bahamas Football Association]] (BFA).

Lyford Cay FC won its first National Championship in 2013–14. Building on this title, the team became the first Bahamian team to compete in the [[CFU Club Championship]] in [[2015 CFU Club Championship|2015]].

In September 2017 Lyford Cay FC changed it name with the permission of the [[Bahamas Football Association]] to Renegades FC

The '''Singer Bowl''' was the former name for a [[stadium]] in the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] [[United States]], located in [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]]. It was an early example of naming rights in large venues.

== History ==
The stadium opened in 1964, built by the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Sewing Machine Company]],&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and was donated for use at the {{nowrap|[[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;}} It later hosted various Olympic trials and concerts, including the New York Rock Festival in 1968, a concert headlined by {{nowrap|[[The Doors]],}} with {{nowrap|[[The Who]]}} as the opening act on August 2. Later in the month&lt;!--August 23--&gt;, [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (with [[Janis Joplin]]) were also part of the festival at the stadium.

In the summer of 1972, professional boxing was held at the Singer Bowl. Some of the fighters who boxed there included [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] {{nowrap|[[Floyd Patterson]],&lt;ref name=pstoa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WpxRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5117%2C1998138 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Patterson scores TKO over Agosto |date=July 15, 1972 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbupipt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_FJYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5322%2C293492 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon)|agency=UPI|title=Patterson scores TKO over foe |date=July 15, 1972 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and future world champions [[Vito Antuofermo]] and [[Saoul Mamby]]. Other boxers of note that fought at the Singer Bowl in 1972 were [[Edwin Viruet]], John Clohessy, Roy Edmonds, Eduardo Santiago.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

===Tennis===
In the early 1970s, the [[United States Tennis Association]] was looking for a new place to host the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] as relations with the [[West Side Tennis Club]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], which had hosted the tournament, were breaking down. The USTA was initially unable to find a sufficient site, but the association's incoming president, W.E. Hester saw the old Singer Bowl from the window of an airplane flying into [[LaGuardia Airport]]. The&lt;!--old,--&gt; long rectangular stadium was renamed the [[Louis Armstrong Stadium (1978)|Louis Armstrong Memorial Stadium]] in 1973 after a famous [[Corona, Queens|Corona]] resident, jazz trumpeter [[Louis Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Heavily renovated in 1977, it reopened in [[1978 US Open (tennis)|1978]] as two venues, Louis Armstrong Stadium, which had significantly more seating than the original stadium, and the adjacent Grandstand. Both were part of the present-day [[USTA National Tennis Center]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/sports/tennis/armstrong-back-when-it-wasnt-tennis-rocking-the-house.html?_r=0 | title=Armstrong, Back When It Wasn’t Tennis Rocking the House | work=New York Times | date=9 September 2012 | accessdate=9 December 2014 | author=Belson, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the USTA built [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] next door in [[1997 US Open (tennis)|1997]], the largest tennis-only venue in the world, the [[seating capacity]] of Armstrong was reduced to be closer to its original format.

It was demolished in October 2016 as part of the Billie Jean King Tennis Center renovation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/galleries/2016-12-15/open_lens_louis_armstrong_and_grandstand_demolition.html?chip=1&lt;/ref&gt;

It was host to a number of teams, including the [[Spokane Chiefs]] of the [[Western Hockey League|WHL]]. The arena served as the home of the [[Gonzaga University]] [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|basketball team]], from its entry into [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] competition in 1958, until the opening of the on-campus John F.

The Spokane Coliseum was replaced by the [[Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena]] {{Years or months ago|1995}} in 1995, and was demolished that spring and summer.&lt;ref name=brzzg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zF5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e_EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3093%2C1212529 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |title=Barn-razing |last=Johnson |first=Kristina |date=June 23, 1995 |page=B1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The space it occupied is directly north of the new arena, towards Boone Avenue, now a parking lot.&lt;ref name=csmgg/&gt;

'''Sport Aid''' (also known as '''Sports Aid''') was a sport-themed campaign for African [[famine relief]] held in May 1986, involving several days of all-star exhibition events in various sports, and culminating in the '''Race Against Time''', a 10 km [[fun run]] held simultaneously in 89 countries.&lt;ref name="nytimesLohr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/26/world/20-million-run-to-raise-money-for-the-starving-in-africa.html|title=20 million run to raise money for the starving in Africa|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=26 May 1986|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Timed to coincide with a [[UNICEF]] development conference in New York City, Sport Aid raised $37m for  [[Live Aid]] and UNICEF. A second lower-key Sport Aid was held in 1988.

==Organisation==
The event was organised by Chris Long (Chairman and Founder), [[Bob Geldof]] ([[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] and [[Live Aid]]) and John Anderson (Head of Global Special Events, UNICEF).  

A central event was the lighting of a symbolic torch at the United Nations by [[Omar Khalifa]], a champion Sudanese 1500m runner to signal the start the 10K races around the world. Khalifa began his journey to the United Nations on May 16, when he lit a torch from the embers of fire in El Moweilih relief camp in the Sudan. He was then flown to Athens where the torch of Africa and the [[Olympic torch]] were symbolically joined. This was the first time the Olympic torch had been lit outside of an Olympic Games. He then ran through 12 European capitals, being greeted by leaders like [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Prince Charles]] and [[Princess Diana]], [[François Mitterrand]], [[Helmut Kohl]] and Pope [[John Paul II]].&lt;ref name="Rotarian"&gt;{{cite book|title=By the way: Mary Kay Magistad|journal=The Rotarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4TUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=16 April 2016|date=June 1986|volume=148|number=6|issn=0035-838X|location=Evanston, Illinois|publisher=Rotary International|pages=4, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in the United States were not widely publicized due in part to its clash with [[Hands Across America]]. Sport Aid was scheduled to take place on the eve of a UN special session on Africa, and so the timing conflict with Hands Across America could not be avoided.&lt;ref name="nytimesLohr"/&gt;

==Race Against Time==
At 15:00 [[UTC]] on Sunday May 25 1986, 19.8 million runners around the world ran, jogged or walked 10 kilometers with sponsorship's or donations given to support African famine relief charities.

274 cities held official events to allow over 19.8 million participants to follow designated courses with [[television]] coverage shown worldwide. [[London]] saw 200,000 runners complete the course, [[Barcelona]] hosted 50,000, [[Athens]] 30,000, [[Santiago]] 15,000, [[Dublin]] 20,000, [[Port of Spain]] 15,000, [[Melbourne]] 10,000 and countless millions of further runners set out at the same time to run around their local village or park, or simply to take part in this global event. In the [[United States]] [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], and [[San Francisco]] participated (along with several other Running Clubs in smaller towns) – with New York being the key race. 

The New York Times reported,{{cn|date=April 2016}} “With 200,000 Londoners setting the pace, more than 20 million runners in 76 countries ran today in Sport Aid, a global benefit to raise money for the starving of Africa. Today, Sport Aid is still the biggest sporting event ever organized".

==Other events==
Other events included the "Ultimate Cricket Match" between the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and the Rest of the World, and a [[figure skating]] exhibition featuring [[Torvill and Dean]].&lt;ref name="Rotarian"/&gt;

A [[charity record]] was released to publicize and raise money for the event, [[Tears for Fears]] rerecording their hit "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" as "[[Everybody Wants to Run the World]]".

==1988==
The 1988 Sport Aid included [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]'s charity single "Running All Over the World", an adaptation of "[[Rockin' All Over the World]]".

A '''stadium''' (plural '''stadiums''' or '''stadia''')&lt;ref&gt;''Stadia'' is the [[Latin]] plural form, but both are used in English. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stadium Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nussli Group]] [https://archive.is/20120905020454/http://www.nussli.com/en/projects/stadium-construction.html?_r=1&amp;hp "Stadium Construction Projects"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias]] noted that for about half a century the only event at the ancient Greek Olympic festival was the race that comprised one length of the [[Stadion (unit)|stade]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], where the word "stadium" originated.&lt;ref name="David C. Young p. 20"&gt;''A Brief History of the Olympic Games'' by David C. Young, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the stadiums with a capacity of at least 10,000 are used for [[association football]]. Other popular stadium sports include [[gridiron football]], baseball, ice hockey, basketball, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, Australian-rules football, Gaelic football, rugby sevens, field lacrosse, bandy, athletics, hurling, field hockey, Kabaddi, and bullfighting. A large number of large sports venues are also used for concerts. Basketball is the most popular arena (or indoor stadium) sport in the world. Large race circuits and large horse racing tracks are not stadiums, but sports venues, because the entire playing surface can't be seen from the stands. For the difference, compare [[List of stadiums by capacity]] with [[List of sports venues by capacity]].

==Etymology==
[[File:OlympicRaceTrackOlympia.JPG|thumb|[[Stadium at Olympia]]]]
"Stadium" is the [[Latin]] form of the Greek word "[[Stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]" (''στάδιον''), a measure of length equalling the length of 600 human feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsta%2Fdion Στάδιον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; As feet are of variable length the exact length of a stadion depends on the exact length adopted for 1 foot at a given place and time. Although in modern terms 1 stadion = {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}}, in a given historical context it may actually signify a length up to 15% larger or smaller.&lt;ref name="David C. Young p. 20"/&gt;

The equivalent Roman measure, the [[Stadion (unit of length)|stadium]], had a similar length&amp;nbsp;– about {{convert|185|m|ft|abbr=on}} – but instead of being defined in feet was defined using the Roman standard [[Pace (unit)|passus]] to be a distance of 125 ''passūs'' (double-paces).

The English use of ''stadium'' comes from the tiered infrastructure surrounding a Roman track of such length.

Most dictionaries provide for both ''stadiums'' and ''stadia'' as valid English plurals, although [[Etymology|etymological]] purists sometimes apply ''stadia'' only to measures of length in excess of 1 stadium.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==History==
[[File:Kallimarmaron stadium.JPG|thumb|[[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]
The oldest known stadium is the one in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], in the western [[Peloponnese]], Greece, where the [[Olympic Games]] of antiquity were held from 776 BC. Initially 'the Games' consisted of a ''single event'', a sprint along the length of the stadium. The ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]'', a measure of length, may be related to the "Stadium", but the track at the [[Stadium at Olympia]] is longer than the conventional ''stadion''.
&lt;!--
The following does not appear to be true:
"Therefore the length of Olympia's stadium became somewhat of a standard measure of distance."
The measure of distance appears to have been defined independently of the length of Olympia's stadium
--&gt;
Greek and Roman stadiums have been found in numerous ancient cities, perhaps the most famous being the [[Stadium of Domitian]], in Rome.

The excavated and refurbished ancient [[Panathenaic stadium]] hosted an early version of the Olympic Games in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Olympic Games, A Struggle for Revival'' by David C. Young, Chapters 4 &amp; 13&lt;/ref&gt; 1875, 1896 and 1906. The excavation and refurbishment of the stadium was part of the legacy of the Greek national benefactor [[Evangelos Zappas]], and it was the first ancient stadium to be used in modern times.

The first stadiums to be built in the modern era were basic facilities, designed for the single purpose of fitting as many spectators in as possible. With tremendous growth in the popularity of organised sport in the late [[Victorian era]], especially [[association football]] in the United Kingdom and [[baseball]] in the United States, the first such structures were built.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/architecture/historic_stadiums.shtml|title=Stadium History}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such early stadium was the [[Lansdowne Road|Lansdowne Road Stadium]], the brainchild of [[Henry Dunlop]], who organised the first All Ireland [[Athletics (track and field)|Athletics]] Championships. Banned from locating sporting events at Trinity College, Dunlop built the stadium in 1872. "I laid down a cinder running path of a quarter-mile, laid down the present Lansdowne Tennis Club ground with my own theodolite, started a Lansdowne archery club, a Lansdowne cricket club, and last, but not least, the [[Lansdowne Football Club|Lansdowne Rugby Football Club]] – colours red, black and yellow." Some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground, allowing Dunlop to use his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around Ireland.

Other early stadiums from this period in the UK include the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge stadium]] (opened in 1877 for the [[London Athletic Club]]) and [[Anfield|Anfield stadium]] (1884 as a venue for [[Everton F.C.]]).

In the U.S., many professional baseball teams built [[Baseball park#Wooden ballparks|large stadiums mainly out of wood]], with the first such venue being the [[South End Grounds]] in [[Boston]], opened in 1871 for the team then known as the Boston Beaneaters (now the [[Atlanta Braves]]). However, many of these parks caught fire, and even those that did not burn proved inadequate for a growing game. All of the 19th-century wooden parks were replaced, some after only a few years, and none survive today.

[[Goodison Park]] was the first purpose-built football stadium in the world. [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton]]-based building firm Kelly brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested.&lt;ref name="School of Science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbett|first=James|title=School of Science|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4050-3431-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton officials were impressed with the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of £150 and 12 [[turnstile]]s were installed at a cost of £7 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertoncollection.org.uk/exhibitions/the+anfield+split+%252d+the+move+to+goodison?p=5#foot|title=The Move to Goodison|publisher=Everton Collection|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short [[track and field athletics|athletics]] event followed by music and a fireworks display.&lt;ref name="School of Science"/&gt; Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/goodison/gp-history.asp|title=History of Goodison Park|publisher=ToffeeWeb|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Archibald Leitch]] brought his experience with the construction of industrial buildings to bear on the design of functional stadiums up and down the country. His work encompassed the first 40 years of the 20th century. One of his most notable designs was [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester. The ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |pages=234–235|location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first stadium to feature continuous seating along the contours of the stadium.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums" /&gt;

These early venues, originally designed to host football matches, were adopted for use by the Olympic Games, the first one being held in 1896 in [[Athens]], Greece. The [[White City Stadium]], built for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London is often cited as the first modern seater stadium, at least in the UK. Designed by the engineer [[John Webster|J.J. Webster]] and completed in 10 months by [[George Wimpey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Valerie|last= White|title=Wimpey: The first hundred years|publisher=George Wimpey|date=1980|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of the [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]], this stadium with a [[seating capacity]] of 68,000 was opened by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] on 27 April 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C. Frank |date=Summer 1992 | title = A Look at Olympic Costs | journal = Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–32 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n1/JOHv1n1f.pdf | accessdate =24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, the stadium had a running track {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}} and three laps to the mile (536 m); outside there was a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}, {{convert|660|yd|m|adj=on}} cycle track. The infield included a swimming and diving pool. The [[Arsenal Stadium|London Highbury Stadium]], built in 1913, was the first stadium in the UK to feature a two-tiered seating arrangement when it was redesigned in the [[Art Deco]] style in 1936.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums" /&gt;

During these decades, parallel stadium developments were taking place in the U.S. The [[Baker Bowl]], a baseball park in [[Philadelphia]] that opened in its original form in 1887 but was completely rebuilt in 1895, broke new ground in stadium construction in two major ways. The stadium's second incarnation featured the world's first cantilevered second deck (tier) in a sports venue, and was also the first baseball park to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction. Another influential venue was [[Boston]]'s [[Harvard Stadium]], built in 1903 by [[Harvard University]] for its [[Harvard Crimson football|American football team]] and track and field program. It was the world's first stadium to use concrete-and-steel construction. In 1909, concrete-and-steel construction came to baseball with the opening of [[Shibe Park]] in Philadelphia and, a few months later, [[Forbes Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. The latter was the world's first three-tiered sporting venue. The opening of these parks marked the start of the [[Baseball park#Jewel box ballparks|"jewel box" era]] of park construction. The largest stadium crowd ever was 199,854 people watching [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|the final match]] of the [[1950 World Cup]] at [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]] on 16 July 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS BOOK|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=142|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ancient stadium==
[[File:Aphrodisias stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Aphrodisias#Stadium|Stadium at Aphrodisias]]]]
Stadiums in ancient Greece and Rome were built for different purposes, and at first only the Greeks built structures called "stadium"; Romans built structures called "Circus." Greek stadia were for foot races, whereas the Roman circus was for horse races. Both, however, had similar shapes and bowl-like areas around them for spectators. The Greeks also developed the theatre, with its seating arrangements foreshadowing those of modern stadiums. The Romans copied the theatre, then expanded it to accommodate larger crowds and more elaborate settings. The Romans also developed the double-sized round theatre called amphitheatre, seating crowds in the tens of thousands for gladiatorial combats and beast shows. The Greek stadium and theatre and the Roman circus and amphitheatre are all ancestral to the modern stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Alan|title=Circus Factions: Blues and Greens at Rome and Byzantium|date=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beare|first1=W.|title=The Roman Stage: A Short History of Latin Drama in the Time of the Republic|date=1950|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
[[Dome]]d stadiums are distinguished from conventional stadiums by their enclosing roofs. Many of these are not actually domes in the pure architectural sense, some being better described as [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], some having [[truss]]-supported roofs and others having more exotic designs such as a [[tensegrity|tensegrity structure]]. But, in the context of sports stadiums, the term "dome" has become standard for all covered stadiums,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dome Dome]", Merriam-Webster&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because the first such enclosed stadium, the [[Houston Astrodome]], was built with an actual dome-shaped roof. Some stadiums have partial roofs, and a few have even been designed to have moveable fields as part of the infrastructure. The [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]] is a true dome structure made of a [[Lamellar structure|lamellar multi-ringed frame]] and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m). It is the largest fixed domed structure in the world.&lt;ref name=SBBBC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parry|first1=Haydn|title=Super Bowl XLVII: New Orleans' pride restored after Katrina|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/american-football/21292257|website=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though enclosed, dome stadiums are called ''stadiums'' because they are large enough for, and designed for, what are generally considered to be outdoor sports such as athletics, [[American football]], [[association football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], and [[baseball]]. Those designed for what are usually indoor sports like basketball, ice hockey and volleyball are generally called ''[[arena]]s''. Exceptions include:

* [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]], home to [[Duke University]]'s Blue Devils [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|men's]] and [[Duke Blue Devils women's basketball|women's]] basketball programs
* [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]], an open-air venue that is home to [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[New York Red Bulls]]
* [[Paris La Défense Arena]], a domed stadium that is home to the rugby union club [[Racing 92]]
* [[Chicago Stadium]] (demolished), former home to the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Chicago Bulls]]

===Design issues===
{{See also|Multi-purpose stadium#Criticisms}}
Different sports require fields of different size and shape. Some stadiums are designed primarily for a single sport while others can accommodate different events, particularly ones with [[movable seating|retractable seating]]. Stadiums built specifically for association football are quite common in Europe; however, [[Gaelic games]] stadiums (such as the incomplete [[Croke Park]]) would be most common in Ireland, while ones built specifically for [[baseball]] or [[American football]] are common in the United States. The most common [[multi-purpose stadium|multiple use design]] combines a football pitch with a [[running track]], a combination which generally works fairly well, although certain compromises must be made. The major drawback is that the stands are necessarily set back a good distance from the pitch, especially at the ends of the pitch. In the case of some smaller stadiums, there are not stands at the ends. When there are stands all the way around, the stadium takes on an oval shape. When one end is open, the stadium has a horseshoe shape. All three configurations (open, oval and horseshoe) are common, especially in the case of American college football stadiums. Rectangular stadiums are more common in Europe, especially for football where many stadiums have four often distinct and very different stands on the four sides of the stadium. These are often all of different sizes and designs and have been erected at different periods in the stadium's history. The vastly differing character of European football stadiums has led to the growing hobby of ground hopping where spectators make a journey to visit the stadium for itself rather than for the event held there. In recent years the trend of building completely new oval stadiums in Europe has led to traditionalists criticising the designs as bland and lacking in the character of the old stadiums they replace.

In North America, where baseball and American football are the two most popular outdoor spectator sports, a number of football/baseball multi-use stadiums were built, especially during the 1960s, and some of them were successful.

However, since the requirements for baseball and football are significantly different, the trend has been toward the construction of single-purpose stadiums, beginning with [[Truman Sports Complex|Kansas City in 1972–1973]] and accelerating in the 1990s. In several cases, an American football stadium has been constructed adjacent to a [[baseball park]], to allow for the sharing of mutual parking lots and other amenities. With the rise of MLS, the construction of [[soccer-specific stadium]]s has also increased since the late 1990s to better fit the needs of that sport. In many cases, earlier baseball stadiums were constructed to fit into a particular land area or city block. This resulted in asymmetrical dimensions for many baseball fields. [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], for example, was built on a triangular city block in [[The Bronx]], New York City. This resulted in a large left field dimension but a small right field dimension.

Before more modern football stadiums were built in the United States, many baseball parks, including [[Fenway Park]], the [[Polo Grounds]], [[Wrigley Field]], [[Comiskey Park]], [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], [[Griffith Stadium]], [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], [[Shibe Park]], [[Forbes Field]], [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and [[Sportsman's Park]] were used by the [[National Football League]] or the [[American Football League]]. (To a certain extent, this continues in lower football leagues as well, with [[TD Ameritrade Park]] being used as the home stadium of the United Football League's [[Omaha Nighthawks]].) Along with today's single use stadiums is the trend for retro style ballparks closer to downtown areas. [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] was the first such ballpark for [[Major League Baseball]] to be built, using early-20th-century styling with 21st-century amenities.

There is a solar-powered stadium in Taiwan that produces as much energy as it needs to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/20/taiwan-solar-stadium | title=Taiwan's solar stadium 100% powered by the sun | newspaper=The Guardian | date=20 May 2009 | author=Inhabitat | accessdate=2 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stadium designers often study acoustics to increase noise caused by fans' voices, aiming to create a lively atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22110898 | title=How do you give stadiums atmosphere? | first=Martin | last=Vennard | publisher=BBC News | date=13 April 2013 | accessdate=2 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lighting ====
[[File:Bramall Lane End.jpg|thumb|[[Bramall Lane]]]]
Until the advent of [[floodlights]], most games played on large areas had to rely on natural lighting.

[[Bramall Lane]] was reportedly the first floodlit stadium. Floodlighting in association football dates as far back as 1878, when there were floodlit experimental matches at [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]] during the dark winter afternoons. With no [[electrical grid|national grid]], lights were powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[dynamo]]es, and were unreliable.

Since the development of electrical grids, lighting has been an important element in stadium design, allowing games to be played after sundown, and in covered, or partly covered stadiums that allow less natural light, but provide more shelter for the public.

===Spectator areas and seating===
[[File:Hillsborough Stadium interior.jpg|thumb|[[Hillsborough Stadium]]]]
An [[all-seater stadium|"all-seater" stadium]] has seats for all spectators. Other stadiums are designed so that all or some spectators stand to view the event. The term "all-seater" is not common in the U.S., as very few American stadiums have sizeable standing-only sections. Poor stadium design has contributed to disasters, such as the [[Hillsborough disaster]] and the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Since these, all [[Premier League]], [[UEFA European Championship qualifying|UEFA European Championship]] and [[FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualifying matches]] require all spectators to be seated.

Seating areas may be known as ''terraces'',''tiers'', or ''decks''. Originally set out for standing room only, they are now usually equipped with seating. Another term used in the US is ''[[bleacher]]s'', which is mostly used for seating areas with bench seats as opposed to individual seats, and which often are uncovered; the name refers to the bleaching effect direct, unshaded  sunlight has on the benches and patrons in those sections.

Many stadiums make luxury suites or boxes available to patrons at high prices. These suites can accommodate fewer than 10 spectators or upwards of 30 depending on the venue. Luxury suites at events such as the [[Super Bowl]] can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

==== Safety and security ====
[[File:Ibrox Inside.jpg|thumb|[[Ibrox Stadium]]]]
[[File:Moscow-Exterior of Luzhniki Stadium (2).jpg|thumb|[[Luzhniki Stadium]]]]
{{See also|Category:Stadium disasters}}
Due to the number of people congregating in stadiums and the frequency of events, many notable accidents have occurred in the past, some causing injury and death. For example, the [[Hillsborough disaster]] was a [[human crush]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]], England on 15 April 1989. The resulting 96 fatalities and 766 injuries makes this the worst disaster in British sporting history.

Much effort has been spent to avoid the recurrence of such events, both in design and legislation. Especially where there is a perceived risk of [[terrorism]] or violence attention remains high to prevent human death and keep stadiums as places where families can enjoy a public event together.

In Europe and South America, during the twentieth century, it was common for violent bands of supporters to fight inside or close to association football stadiums. In the United Kingdom they are known as [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]].

Structural features that increase safety include separate entry and exit accesses for each spectator area, especially separating accesses for home and visitor supporters, dividing walls, glass parapets, vibration attenuation and sprinkler systems.

Security features that have been adopted include armed surveillance, [[Identity document]] checks, [[video surveillance]], [[metal detectors]] and security searches to enforce rules that forbid spectators to carry dangerous or potentially dangerous items.

Modern stadiums, especially the largest among them, are [[megaprojects]] that can only be afforded by the largest corporations, wealthiest individuals, or government. Sports fans have a deep emotional attachment to their teams. In North America, with its closed-league "[[North American professional sports league organization|franchise]]" system, there are fewer teams than cities which would like them. This creates tremendous [[bargaining power]] for the owners of teams, whereby owners can threaten to relocate teams to other cities unless governments subsidize the construction of new facilities.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;Lambert, Craig.  "[http://harvardmagazine.com/2001/09/the-dow-of-professional.html The Dow of Professional Sports]" ''Harvard Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and Latin America, where there are multiple association football clubs in any given city, and several leagues in each country, no such monopoly power exists, and stadiums are built primarily with private money. Outside professional sports, governments are also involved through the intense competition for the right to host major sporting events, primarily the [[Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] (of association football), during which cities often pledge to build new stadiums on order to satisfy the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) or [[FIFA]].

===Environmental issues===
Modern stadiums bring several negative environmental issues with their construction. They require thousands of tons of materials to build, they greatly increase traffic in the area around the stadium, as well as maintaining the stadium&lt;ref&gt;www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2017/12/11/big-sports-events-have-big-environmental-footprints-could-social-licenses-to-operate-help/#439494ec50cf.&lt;/ref&gt;. The increased traffic around modern stadiums has led to create exposure zones says the Health Effect Institute, exposing 30-40% of people living around the stadium to potential health issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/elj/vol25/iss1/6|title=Green Monsters: Examining the Environmental Impact of Sports Stadiums|first=Grant Jr., Thomas|last=J.|date=9 August 2018|journal=Villanova Environmental Law Journal|volume=25|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many stadiums are attempting to counteract these issues by implementing solar panels, and high efficiency lighting, to reduce their own carbon footprint.

====Corporate naming====

{{See also|Naming rights|List of sports venues with sole naming rights}}
In recent decades, to help take the burden of the massive expense of building and maintaining a stadium, many American and European sports teams have sold the rights to the name of the facility. This trend, which began in the 1970s, but accelerated greatly in the 1990s, has led to sponsors' names being affixed to both established stadiums and new ones. In some cases, the corporate name replaces (with varying degrees of success) the name by which the venue has been known for many years. But many of the more recently built stadiums, like the [[Volkswagen Arena]] in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany, have never been known by a non-corporate name. The sponsorship phenomenon has since spread worldwide. There remain a few municipally owned stadiums, which are often known by a name that is significant to their area (for example, [[Minneapolis]]' [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]). In recent years, some government-owned stadiums have also been subject to naming-rights agreements, with some or all of the revenue often going to the team(s) that play there.

One consequence of corporate naming has been an increase in stadium name changes, when the namesake corporation changes its name, or if it is the naming agreement simply expires. Phoenix's [[Chase Field]], for example, was previously known as Bank One Ballpark, but was renamed to reflect the takeover of the latter corporation. San Francisco's historic [[Candlestick Park]] was renamed as [[3Com|3Com Park]] for several years, but the name was dropped when the sponsorship agreement expired, and it was another two years before the new name of [[Monster Cable Products]]' Monster Park was applied. Local opposition to the corporate naming of that particular stadium led San Francisco's city council to permanently restore the Candlestick Park name once the Monster contract expired. More recently, in Ireland, there has been huge opposition to the renaming of [[Dublin]]'s historic [[Lansdowne Road]] as the [[Aviva Stadium]]. Lansdowne was redeveloped as the Aviva, opening in May 2010.

On the other hand, Los Angeles' [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Great Western Forum]], one of the earliest examples of corporate renaming, retained its name for many years, even after the namesake bank no longer existed, the corporate name being dropped only after the building later changed ownership. This practice has typically been less common in countries outside the United States. A notable exception is the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] league of Japan, in which many of the teams are themselves named after their parent corporations. Also, many newer European football stadiums, such as the [[Macron Stadium|Macron]] and [[Emirates Stadium]]s in England and [[Westfalenstadion|Signal Iduna Park]] and [[Allianz Arena]] in Germany have been corporately named.

This new trend in corporate naming (or renaming) is distinguishable from names of some older venues, such as [[Crosley Field]], [[Wrigley Field]], and the first and [[Busch Memorial Stadium|second Busch Stadiums]], in that the parks were named by and for the club's owner, which also happened to be the name of the company owned by those clubowners. (The current [[Busch Stadium]] received its name via a modern naming rights agreement.) SkyDome in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada was renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005, removing any reference that it is a domed stadium.

During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, some stadiums were temporarily renamed because [[FIFA]] prohibits sponsorship of stadiums. For example, the [[Allianz Arena]] in Munich was called the ''FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich'' during the tournament. Likewise, the same stadium will be known as the "München Arena" during the European Competitions. Similar rules affect the [[Imtech Arena]] and [[Veltins-Arena]]. This rule applies even if the stadium sponsor is an official FIFA sponsor—the Johannesburg stadium then commercially known as "Coca-Cola Park", bearing the name of [[The Coca-Cola Company|one of FIFA's major sponsors]], was known by its historic name of [[Ellis Park Stadium]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Corporate names are also temporarily replaced during the Olympics.

===Music venues===
{{Main|Arena rock|l1=Stadium rock}}
Although concerts such as for classical music had been presented there for decades, from the 1960s stadiums began to be used as live venues for popular music, giving rise to the term "[[arena rock]]" or "stadium rock", particularly for forms of [[hard rock]] and [[progressive rock]]. The origins of stadium rock are sometimes dated to when [[The Beatles]] [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour#The Shea Stadium show|played]] [[Shea Stadium]] in New York in 1965. Also important was the use of large stadiums for American tours by bands in the later 1960s, such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. The tendency developed in the mid-1970s as the increased power of amplification and sound systems allowed the use of larger and larger venues.&lt;ref name=Waksman2009&gt;S.
