==Biography==
'''Abraham (Avrom) Sutzkever''' was born on July 15, 1913, in Smorgon, [[Vilna Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]], now [[Smarhon’]], [[Belarus]]. During [[World War I]], his family moved to Omsk, Siberia, where his father, Hertz Sutzkever, died. In 1921, his mother, Rayne (née Fainberg), moved the family to [[Vilnius]], where Sutzkever attended [[cheder]].

Sutzkever attended the Polish Jewish high school Herzliah, audited university classes in Polish literature, and was introduced by a friend to Russian poetry. His earliest poems were written in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="yivoencyclopedia.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Sutzkever_Avrom|title=YIVO {{!}} Sutzkever, Avrom|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Sutzkever joined the Jewish [[scouting]] organization, Bin ("Bee"), in whose magazine he published his first piece. There he also met with wife Freydke.
In 1933, he became part of the writers’ and artists’ group Yung-Vilne, along with fellow poets [[Shmerke Kaczerginski]], [[Chaim Grade]], and [[Leyzer Volf]]. &lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/7252012/Avrom-Sutzkever.html |title=Avrom Sutzkever|type=obituary |work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date= February 16, 2010|accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He married Freydke in 1939, a day before the start of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="www.poemhunter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/abraham-sutzkever/biography/ |title=Abraham Sutzkever|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1941, following the Nazi occupation of Vilnius, Sutzkever and his wife were sent to the [[Vilna Ghetto]]. Sutzkever and his friends hid a diary by [[Theodor Herzl]], drawings by [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Alexander Bogen]], and other treasured works behind plaster and brick walls in the ghetto.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt; His mother and newborn son were murdered by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt; On September 12, 1943, he and his wife escaped to the forests, and together with fellow Yiddish poet [[Shmerke Kaczerginski]], he fought the occupying forces as a partisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5q2nb3z7&amp;chunk.id=d0e15359&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress |title=UC Press E-Books Collection, 1982-2004 |publisher=Escholarship.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutzkever joined a Jewish unit and was smuggled into the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;

Sutzkever's 1943 narrative poem, Kol Nidre, reached the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] in Moscow, whose members included [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Boris Pasternak]], as well as the exiled future president of Soviet [[Lithuania]], [[Justas Paleckis]]. They implored the [[Kremlin]] to rescue him. So an aircraft located Sutzkever and Freydke in March 1944, and flew them to Moscow, where their daughter, Rina, was born.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/02/abraham-sutzkever-obituary|title = Abraham Sutzkever Last great Yiddish poet and a defender of his language | website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1946, he was called up as a [[witness]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]], testifying against [[Franz Murer]], the murderer of his mother and  son. After a brief sojourn in Poland and Paris, he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]], arriving in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

In 1947, his family arrived in Tel Aviv. Within two years Sutzkever founded [[Di Goldene Keyt]] (The Golden Chain)"&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

Sutzkever was a keen traveller, touring South American jungles and African savannahs, where the sight of elephants and the song of a [[Basotho]] chief inspired more Yiddish verse.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

Belatedly, in 1985 Sutzkever became the first Yiddish writer to win the prestigious [[Israel Prize]] for his literature. An English compendium appeared in 1991.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Freydke died in 2003. Rina and another daughter, Mira, survive him, along with two grandchildren.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; 

Abraham Sutzkever died on January 20, 2010, in Tel Aviv at the age of 96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Abraham Sutzkever, 96, Jewish Poet and Partisan, Dies | publisher = ''The New York Times'' | date = January 23, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/books/24sutkever.html?ref=obituaries | accessdate = 2010-04-10 | first=Joseph |last=Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Poet and Partisan Avrom Sutzkever Dies | publisher = ''The Forward'' | date = January 20, 2010 | url = http://www.forward.com/articles/123891/ | accessdate = 2010-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Sutzkever wrote poetry from an early age, initially in [[Hebrew]]. He published his first poem in ''Bin'', the Jewish scouts magazine. Sutzkever was among the Modernist writers and artists of the ''Yung Vilne'' ("Young Vilna") group in the early 1930s. In 1937, his first volume of Yiddish poetry, ''Lider'' (Songs), was published by the Yiddish [[PEN International]] Club;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/7252012/Avrom-Sutzkever.html |title=Avrom Sutzkever|type=obituary |work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date= February 16, 2010|accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a second, ''Valdiks'' (Of the Forest; 1940), appeared after he moved from Warsaw, during the interval of Lithuanian autonomy.&lt;ref name="yivoencyclopedia.org" /&gt;

In Moscow, he wrote a chronicle of his experiences in the Vilna ghetto (''Fun vilner geto'',1946), a poetry collection ''Lider fun geto'' (1946; “Songs from the Ghetto”) and began ''Geheymshtot'' ("Secret City",1948), an epic poem about Jews hiding in the sewers of Vilna.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Sheva|title=Avrom Sutzkever Israeli Writer|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Avrom-Sutzkever|website=www.britannica.com|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Sutzkever founded the yiddish literary quarterly ''[[Di goldene keyt]]'' (The Golden Chain), Israel's only Yiddish literary quarterly, which he edited until its demise in 1995. Sutzkever resuscitated the careers of Yiddish writers from Europe, the Americas, the Soviet Union and Israel. Official Zionism, however, dismissed Yiddish as a defeatist diaspora argot. "They will not uproot my tongue," he retorted. "I shall wake all generations with my roar."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

Sutzkever's poetry was translated into Hebrew by [[Nathan Alterman]], [[Avraham Shlonsky]] and [[Leah Goldberg]]. In the 1930s, his work was translated into Russian by [[Boris Pasternak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mer |first=Benny |url=http://www.haaretz.com/abraham-sutzkever-1913-2010-1.261883|title=Abraham Sutzkever, 1913-2017 |publisher=''Haaretz''. haaretz.com |date=January 22, 2010 |access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bade''' (also spelled Bede, Bedde, or Bode) is a [[West Chadic languages|West Chadic]] language spoken by the Bade people in [[Yobe State]] and [[Jigawa State]], [[Nigeria]].  Their traditional ruler is the [[Bade Emirate|Emir of Bade]]. Similar to many other Western African languages, Bade is a vulnerable language at great risk of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blench|first=R|year=2007|title=Endangered Languages|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With 250,000 speakers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bde|title=Enthnologue Bade|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the language and the culture of the Bade people have suffered over the last several years. As the language continues to fade, the culture and historic value associated with the language perishes as well. The local dialect is shifting from Bade to Hausa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Across West Africa, the impact on local communities through the loss of the indigenous tongues will be significant. The endangerment of the Bade language represents the worldwide [[language diversity]] that is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whalen|first=D.H.|date=2012|title=Endangered language families|url=|journal=Language|volume=88|pages=155–173|doi=10.1353/lan.2012.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African languages have only received little linguistic attention, impacting these African languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lupke|first=Friederike|date=2009|title=At the margin - African Endangered Languages in the Context of Global Endangerment Discourses|url=|journal=[[African Research &amp; Documentation]] |volume=|pages=15–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Bade is classified under the following categories: [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], West, B, B.1, Bade Proper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History of Bade ==
Bade is an African language that is currently spoken in Nigeria. While historical information about the Bade language is limited in scope, many words in the Bade language take root in the Kanuri language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuh|first=R.G.|date=2003|title=The linguistic influence of Kanuri on Bade and Ngizim.|url=http://aflang.linguistics.ucla.edu/Bade/Papers/Kanuri_Bade_Ngizim.pdf|journal=Maiduguri Journal of Linguistic and Literary Studies|volume=|pages=55–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] language is primarily spoken in West Africa, including: Nigeria and Chad. Bade and Ngizim have borrowed a number of words from the Kanuri language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Bade language itself originates from the Badr of Yemen and the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] purportedly drove the Bade people out after a failure to pray.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Currently, as one of the many Nigerian endangered languages, bade serves as a local dialect. In general, Nigerian languages comprise the wealth of linguistic diversity that exists in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad Max Benedict|first=B|date=1993|title=Democratisation of Language Use in Public Domains in Nigeria|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=|pages=639|doi=10.1017/s0022278x00012283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, colonization has also played a role in the deteroriation of local languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novak|first=Amy|date=2008|title=Who speaks? Who listens?: The problem of address in two Nigerian trauma novels|url=|journal=Studies in The Novel|volume=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
The speakers of the Bade language are centered in Nigeria. It is spoken in the northern part of Yobe State, Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aflang.humnet.ucla.edu/Ngizim/ngizim.html|title=Yobe Languages Research Project|last=Schuh|first=Russell|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official status ===
The language is not the official language of Nigeria or any other country.

=== Dialects/Varieties ===
There are three dialects of the Bade language that coincide with regions, including the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Gashua Bade (Mazgarwa)
* Southern Bade (Bade-Kado)
* Western Bade (Amshi, Maagwaram, Shirawa)

== Phonology of Bade ==
Most West Chadic languages have a similar consonant inventory separated into eight major groups: labialized laryngeal, laryngeal, labialized velar, velar, lateral, alveopalatal, alveolar, and labial.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aflang.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/Bade_Ngizim/Handout_02.pdf|title=Overview of Bade/Ngizim of Phonology|last=Schuh|first=Russell|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bade/Ngizim languages, the [[Glottal stop (letter)|glottal stop]] plays no role, but the vowel hiatus relies on [[elision]] and [[Coalescence (linguistics)|coalescence]]. The sounds also feature a "yawning" and has a shift from fricative to stop.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
The grammar for the Bade language is consistent with the [[Ngizim language|Ngizim]] language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Morphology/Syntax ===
The Bade/Ngizim languages slightly differ from other Chadic languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Bade and Ngizim have long vowels in closed syllables. Mid vowels also have a restricted use compared to other vowels. Mid vowels will rather appear as loanwords from other languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The language preserves [[diphthong]]s in both native and loanwords.

== Vocabulary/Lexis ==
The Bade language has a strong root in the Kanuri langage. There are many loanwords from Kanuri to West Chadi languages, including Bade.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aflang.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/Bade_Ngizim/00bade_ngizim.html|title=The Phonology and Morphology of Bade and Ngizim|last=Schuh|first=Russell|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bade is commonly grouped with the [[Ngizim language|Ngizim]] language. As an example, the word 'healthy' is 'nga' in the Kanuri language and 'ngā' in the Ngizim language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; More recently, the Hausa language has influenced the Bade language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aflang.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/Bade_Ngizim/Bade_Ng_voice_changes.pdf|title=Changes in Obstruent Voicing in Bade/Ngizim|last=Schuh|first=Russell|date=1997|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing System ==
The Bade language uses a Latin script writing script.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Latin script is the most widely used writing system in the world, serving as the system for the English language as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&amp;key=Latn|title=Latin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartolomé de Torres Naharro''' (c. 1485, [[Torre de Miguel Sesmero]], [[Extremadura]] – c. 1530) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] dramatist and [[Leonese language writers|Leonese language writer]] &lt;ref&gt;López Morales, "Elementos leoneses en la lengua del teatro pastoril de los siglos XV y XVI". 1967&lt;/ref&gt; of Jewish converso descent.&lt;ref&gt;William Byron, ''Cervantes. A Biography,'' Doubleday: New York, 1978, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Propalladia.jpg|thumb|''Propalladia'']]

==Life==
After some years of soldiering and of captivity in [[Algiers]], Torres Naharro took [[Holy Orders|holy orders]], settled in [[Rome]] about 1511, and there devoted himself chiefly to writing plays. Though he alludes to the future pope, [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], as his protector, he left Rome to enter the household of [[Fabrizio Colonna]] at [[Naples]] as a chaplain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Bartolomé de Torres Naharro}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his works were printed under the title of ''Propaladia'' (1517). He is conjectured to have returned to his native place, and to have died there shortly after 1529.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His ''Diálogo del nacimiento'' is written in unavowed, though obvious, imitation of other [[Leonese language]] writers as [[Juan del Encina]], but in his subsequent plays he shows a much larger conception of dramatic possibilities. He classifies his pieces as ''comedias á noticia'' and ''comedias á fantasía''; the former, of which the ''Soldatesca'' and ''Tinellaria'' are examples, present in dramatic form incidents within his personal experience; the latter, which include such plays as ''Serafina, Himenea, Calamita'' and ''Aquilana'', present imaginary episodes with adroitness and persuasiveness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

According to an evaluation in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]:
{{quote|Torres Naharro is much less dexterous in stagecraft than many inferior successors, his humour is rude and boisterous and his diction is unequal; but to a varied knowledge of human nature he adds knowledge of dramatic effect, and his rapid dialogue, his fearless realism and vivacious fancy prepared the way for the [[Romanticism|romantic]] drama in Spain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} }}

Only one complete copy of the ''Propaladia'' is known to exist. This book was stolen from the [[Royal Danish Library]] in the seventies and was not seen again until it turned up at an auction at [[Christie's]] in 2003 where relatives of the original thief tried to sell it.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7548">'''Cognitive semiotics''' is the study model of [[meaning-making]], applying methods and theories from [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[computational modeling]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]] and other sciences.  Contrary to classical cognitive science, cognitive semiotics is explicitly involved with questions of meaning, having recourse, when possible, to semiotic terminology, although developing it when necessary. As against classical semiotics, cognitive semiotics aims to incorporate the results of other sciences, using methods ranging from conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.

==History==
Cognitive semiotics has many sources. The first person to suggest the integration of the cognitive sciences and semiotics seems to have been Thomas C. Daddesio (1994). The Argentinean researcher Juan Magariños de Morentin has long been using the term "cognitive semiotics" to describe his own Peircean approach to semiotics (missing direct reference dating first time using "cognitive semiotics"). This is also the name of a web forum which he directed for many years. Several other prominent semioticians have been known to subscribe to a cognitive approach, such as [[Irene Mittelberg]] in gesture studies and [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] in pictorial semiotics. 

[[Per Aage Brandt]] founded a Center for Semiotics in 1995 at [[Aarhus University]] and subsequently a Master Education in Cognitive Semiotics, to investigate the connections between semiotics and cognitive science (with a strong focus on cognitive linguistics), and he has had several followers along this line such as [[Line Brandt]] (Center for Semiotics at Aarhus University), and [[Todd Oakley]] (Case Western Reserve University). The Center for Semiotics is currently constituted by [[Frederik Stjernfelt]], [[Peer Bundgaard]], [[Mikkel Wallentin]], [[Svend Østergaard]], [[Riccardo Fusaroli]] and [[Kristian Tylén]]. Bundgaard published an anthology in Danish which brings together texts from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, and semiotics. Stjernfelt has combined the inspiration from Peirce with that from Husserl. Wallentin is conducting neuro-imaging investigations. Tylén and Fusaroli develop behavioral and neuroscientific experimental approaches to sign usage and linguistic conversations.

Since 2009, there is also a Centre for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at Lund University (Sweden), which is headed by Göran Sonesson, who has long been working in the direction of cognitive semiotics, integrating semiotic theory with experimental studies, mainly with application to the study of pictures. Sonesson started collaborating with the linguist [[Jordan Zlatev]] around 2001 and organized a number of research project together with him, before adopting the label "cognitive semiotics". Other members of the CCS are, notably,  [[Mats Andrén]], who has published a number of gesture studies, partially in collaboration with Zlatev, and Sara Lenninger, who is working with Sonesson on the semiotics of pictures. The particular direction taken by cognitive semiotics in Lund consists in experimental studies which are geared to elucidate fundamental semiotic concepts such as sign, index, icon, etc., as well as their precursor notion such as imitation, mimesis, empathy and intersubjectivity. The research at CCS centers on the phylogeny and ontogeny of human semiosis, employing apes and children, respectively, as research subjects.

==Journal of Cognitive Semiotics==

An international journal on cognitive semiotics, (Journal of) Cognitive Semiotics (JCS) – Multidisciplinary Journal on Meaning and Mind, was started  in Denmark in 2005. Its inaugural issue, edited by Lars Andreassen, Line Brandt and Jes Vang, was published in 2007 (spring). In the fall of 2007, the first peer-reviewed issue, a theme issue on ‘Consciousness &amp; Semiosis’ (eds. Per Aage Brandt and Jakob Simonsen), was published, with funding from Case Western Reserve University. The editorial board consisted of Line Brandt, Per Aage Brandt, Frank Kjørup, Todd Oakley, Jacob Orquin, Jakob Simonsen and Jes Vang. Since then, many issues have been published, in part by Peter Lang, and in part online, available from the journal web site. From 2014, the journal has been published by Mouton de Gruyter. The present board consists of Peer Bundgaard, Göran Sonesson, Todd Oakley, Merlin Donald, and Bruno Gantolucci.

The journal's website states:  "The first of its kind, Cognitive Semiotics is a multidisciplinary journal devoted to high quality research, integrating methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive science with methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with the ultimate aim of providing new insights into the realm of human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices." 

==International Association for Cognitive Semiotics==

The International Association for Cognitive Semiotics (IACS) was initiated during the conference of the Nordic Association for Semiotics Studies (NASS) in Lund in 2011, and officially founded during the conference of NASS in Aarhus in May 2013. The Journal of Cognitive Semiotics then became the official organ of the IACS. The first official conference of IACS took place in Lund in 2014, and the second conference was organized in Lublin in 2014. Selected papers from the Lund conference were published at Peter Lang at the end of 2016 (https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/22221), and the acts of the Lublin conference will appear as a thematic issue of the journal "Philosophy and Science”, published by the Polish Academy of Sciences. 

== Cognitive Semiotics of Film ==
''Cognitive Semiotics of Film'' is a [[monograph]] written by Warren S. Buckland. Within the monograph, Warren Buckland argues that the conflict between cognitive film theory and contemporary film theory is unproductive. Cognitive semiotics of film is a neglected branch of film theory that works together with the terms [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. Cognitive science is also incorporated in a combination with [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]] to form what is called cognitive semiotics.

The '''cranial vault''' is the space in the [[skull]] within the [[neurocranium]], occupied by the [[brain]]. In [[human]]s, the size and shape of the brain, may be affected by the size of the vault as shown in [[craniometry]], but studies relating it to intelligence have found no conclusive evidence. The vault is alternatively called "skullcap" or even [[Calvaria (skull)|calvaria]], though these properly refer to the upper portion of the skull only.

== Development ==
In humans, the cranial vault is imperfectly composed in newborns, to allow the large human head to pass through the [[birth canal]]. During birth, the various bones connected by [[cartilage]] and [[ligament]]s only will move relatively to each other. The open portion between the major bones of the upper part of the vault, called [[fontanelle]]s, normally remain soft up to two years after birth. 

As the fontanelles close, the vault loses some of its plasticity. The [[Suture (anatomy)|sutures]] between the bones remain until 30 to 40 years of age, allowing for growth of the brain. Cranial vault size is directly proportional to skull size and is developed early.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Changes in vault dimensions must occur by early childhood because of the early development of the vault.&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007970/ABSTRACT Secular change in craniofacial morphology]
"&lt;cite&gt;During the 125 years under consideration, cranial vaults have become markedly higher and somewhat narrower, with narrower faces. The changes in cranial [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] are probably in large part due to changes in growth at the cranial base due to improved environmental conditions. The changes are likely a combination of [[phenotypic]] plasticity and genetic changes over this period.&lt;/cite&gt;" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11451056&amp;dopt=Abstract Cranial change in Americans: 1850-1975.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and shape of the brain and the surrounding vault remain quite plastic as the brain grows in childhood. In several ancient societies, head shape was altered for [[aesthetic]] or [[religious]] reasons by binding cloth or boards tightly around the head during infancy. It is not known whether such [[artificial cranial deformation]] has an effect in mental capacity.

== Evolution ==
[[File:Skull corvus corone cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of [[carrion crow]], showing the enlarged vault found in birds.]]
The cranial vault is composed of the [[endocranium]] forming the basal parts, topped by the [[skull roof]] in [[tetrapod|land vertebrates]].&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fishes]] no distinct cranial vault as such exists, the skull being composed of loosely jointed bones. The cranial vault as a distinct unit arose with the fusion of the [[skull roof]] and the [[endocranium]] on the early [[Labyrinthodonts]].&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"/&gt; In [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] the vault is rather small and inconspicuous, only forming proper vaults in [[mammals]] and [[birds]].

[[File:dv mark.png|thumb|DVC compatibility mark]]

'''DV''' is a format for storing [[digital video]].

It was launched in 1995 with joint efforts of leading producers of video [[camcorder|camera recorders]].

The original DV specification, known as ''Blue Book'', was standardized within the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]&amp;nbsp;61834 family of standards. These standards define common features such as physical [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]]s, recording modulation method, magnetization, and basic system data in part 1. Part 2 describes the specifics of [[480i|525-60]] and [[576i|625-50]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec61834-2%7Bed1.0%7Den_d.pdf Recording – Helical-scan digital videocassette recording system using 6,35 mm magnetic tape for consumer use]&lt;/ref&gt; The IEC standards are available as publications sold by IEC and [[ANSI]].

In 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dhc725.html|title=HV10 - Canon Camera Museum|website=global.canon|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; DV was joined by a successor format [[HDV]], which used the same tape format with a different video [[codec]]. Some cameras at the time had the ability to switch between DV and HDV recording modes.

All tape-based video formats are becoming increasingly obsolete as tapeless HD cameras recording on memory cards, hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and optical discs have become the norm, although the DV encoding standard is sometimes still used in tapeless cameras.

== DV compression ==

DV uses [[lossy compression]] of [[video]] while audio is stored uncompressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DV Q&amp;A Our Expert Answers Your Questions|url=http://www.videomaker.com/article/7330|work=Videomaker magazine|publisher=Videomaker, Inc|date=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[intraframe]] [[video compression]] scheme is used to compress video on a frame-by-frame basis with the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT).

Closely following ITU-R [[Rec. 601]] standard, DV video employs [[interlaced video|interlaced]] scanning with the luminance sampling frequency of 13.5&amp;nbsp;MHz. These results in 480 scanlines per complete frame for the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz system, and 576 scanlines per complete frame for the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz system. In both systems the active area contains 720 pixels per scanline, with 704 pixels used for content and 16 pixels on the sides left for digital blanking. The same frame size is used for 4:3 and 16:9 frame aspect ratios, resulting in different [[pixel aspect ratio]]s for ''fullscreen'' and ''widescreen'' video.&lt;ref name="DVCAM_OVERVIEW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.ca/dvcam/pdfs/dvcam%20format%20overview.pdf |title=DVCAM format overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040838/http://www.sony.ca/dvcam/pdfs/dvcam%20format%20overview.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvmp.co.uk/digital-video.htm |title=Digital Video and Field Order |work=dvmp.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the DCT compression stage, [[chroma subsampling]] is applied to the source video in order to reduce the amount of data to be compressed. Baseline DV uses [[Chroma subsampling#4.1.1|4:1:1 subsampling]] in its 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variant and [[Chroma subsampling#4.2.0|4:2:0 subsampling]] in the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz variant. Low chroma resolution of DV (compared to higher-end digital video formats) is a reason this format is sometimes avoided in [[chroma key]]ing applications, though advances in chroma keying techniques and software have made producing quality keys from DV material possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060324221038/http://www.fxguide.com/article314.html fxguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamwilt.com/DV-FAQ-tech.html#DVchromakey|title=The DV, DVCAM, &amp; DVCPRO Formats -- tech details, FAQ, and links.|work=adamwilt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio can be stored in either of two forms: 16-bit [[Linear PCM]] [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] at 48&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sampling rate]] (768 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 Mbit/s stereo), or four nonlinear 12-bit PCM channels at 32&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate (384 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 MBit/s for four channels). In addition, the DV specification also supports 16-bit audio at 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz (706 kbit/s per channel, 1.4 Mbit/s stereo), the same sampling rate used for CD audio.&lt;ref name="dvsuccess"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/~hbreit/CILECT/DV_Report.htm | title=DV – A SUCCESS STORY | author=Puhovski, Nenad |date=April 2000 | website=www.stanford.edu | accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the 48&amp;nbsp;kHz stereo mode is used almost exclusively.

== Digital Interface Format ==
The audio, video, and metadata are packaged into 80-byte Digital Interface Format (DIF) blocks which are multiplexed into a 150-block sequence. DIF blocks are the basic units of DV streams and can be stored as [[computer file]]s in raw form or wrapped in such file formats as [[Audio Video Interleave]] (AVI), [[QuickTime File Format|QuickTime]] (QT) and [[Material Exchange Format]] (MXF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000173.shtml|title=DV-DIF (Digital Video Digital Interface Format)|work=digitalpreservation.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dvswitch.alioth.debian.org/wiki/DV_format/|title=DV format|work=debian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One video frame is formed from either 10 or 12 such sequences, depending on scanning rate, which results in a data rate of about 25 Mbit/s for video, and an additional 1.5 Mbit/s for audio. When written to tape, each sequence corresponds to one complete track.&lt;ref name="DVCAM_OVERVIEW"/&gt;

Baseline DV employs ''unlocked audio''. This means that the sound may be +/- ⅓ frame out of sync with the video. However, this is the maximum drift of the audio/video synchronization; it is not compounded throughout the recording.

==Variants==
Sony and Panasonic created their proprietary versions of DV aimed toward professional &amp; broadcast users, which use the same compression scheme, but improve on robustness, [[linear video editing|linear editing]] capabilities, color rendition and raster size.

All DV variants except for DVCPRO Progressive are recorded to tape within interlaced video stream. Film-like frame rates are possible by using [[Telecine#Frame rate differences|pulldown]]. DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD supports native progressive format when recorded to P2 memory cards.

===DVCPRO===
[[File:dvcpro mark.png|thumb|DVCPRO compatibility mark]]

DVCPRO, also known as DVCPRO25, is a variation of DV developed by Panasonic and introduced in 1995 for use in [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) equipment.

Unlike baseline DV, DVCPRO uses ''locked audio'' and 4:1:1 [[chroma subsampling]] for both 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variants to decrease generation losses.&lt;ref name="ADAM_WILT_DV_COLORSAMPLING"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamwilt.com/DV-FAQ-tech.html#colorSampling|title=The DV, DVCAM, &amp; DVCPRO Formats -- tech details, FAQ, and links. |work=adamwilt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audio is available in 16-bit/48&amp;nbsp;kHz precision.

When recorded to tape, DVCPRO uses wider track pitch - 18 μm vs. 10 μm of baseline DV, which reduces the chance of dropout errors during recording. Two extra longitudinal tracks provide support for audio cue and for timecode control. Tape is transported 80% faster compared to baseline DV, resulting in shorter recording time. Long Play mode is not available.

=== DVCAM ===
[[File:dvcam mark.png|thumb|DVCAM compatibility mark]]

In 1996 Sony responded with its own professional version of DV called DVCAM.&lt;ref&gt;https://cvp.com/pdf/sony_dvcam_family.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Like DVCPRO, DVCAM uses locked audio, which prevents audio synchronization drift that may happen on DV if several generations of copies are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbctraining.com/onlineCourse.asp?tID=5173&amp;cat=2782 |title=BBC Training: DV Tape Formats |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611113327/http://www.bbctraining.com/onlineCourse.asp?tID=5173&amp;cat=2782 |archivedate=11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When recorded to tape, DVCAM uses 15 μm track pitch, which is 50% wider compared to baseline. Accordingly, tape is transported 50% faster, which reduces recording time by one third compared to regular DV. Because of the wider track and track pitch, DVCAM has the ability to do a frame-accurate insert edit, while regular DV may vary by a few frames on each edit compared to the preview.

===DVCPRO50===
[[File:dvcpro50 mark.png|thumb|DVCPRO50 compatibility mark]]

DVCPRO50 was introduced by Panasonic in 1997 for high-value electronic news gathering and [[digital cinema]], and is often described as two DV codecs working in parallel.

The DVCPRO50 doubles the coded video data rate to 50 Mbit/s. This has the effect of cutting total record time of any given storage medium in half. Chroma resolution is improved by using 4:2:2 chroma subsampling.

DVCPRO50 was used in many productions where [[high definition video]] was not required. For example, BBC used DVCPRO50 to record high-budget TV series, such as ''[[Space Race (TV series)|Space Race]]'' (2005) and ''[[Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire]]'' (2006).

A similar format, [[Digital-S|D-9]], offered by JVC, uses videocassettes with the same form-factor as [[VHS]].

Comparable high quality standard definition digital tape formats include Sony's [[Betacam#Digital Betacam|Digital Betacam]], launched in 1993, and [[Betacam#MPEG IMX|MPEG&amp;nbsp;IMX]], launched in 2001.

===DVCPRO Progressive===
[[File:dvcpro p mark.png|thumb|DVCPRO Progressive mark]]

DVCPRO ''Progressive'' was introduced by Panasonic for news gathering, sports journalism and digital cinema. It offered 480 or 576 lines of progressive scan recording with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling and four 16-bit 48&amp;nbsp;kHz PCM audio channels. Like [[HDV#HDV 720p|HDV-SD]], it was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvformat.com/2001/02_feb/features/panasonic_dvcpro.htm|title=Caporale Studios Shoots Feature Films with Panasonic 480p DVCPRO50 Camcorder|work=dvformat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/mag/broadcasting_production_systems_3/ 480p production systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121045442/http://broadcastengineering.com/mag/broadcasting_production_systems_3/ |date=21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format offered six modes for recording and playback: 16:9 progressive (50 Mbit/s), 4:3 progressive (50 Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (50 Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (50 Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (25 Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (25 Mbit/s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://service.us.panasonic.com/OPERMANPDF/OM_AJ-PD900.PDF AJ-PD900WP Operating instructions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has been superseded with DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD.

===DVCPRO HD===
[[File:dvcprohd mark.png|thumb|DVCPRO HD compatibility mark]]

''DVCPRO HD'', also known as ''DVCPRO100'' is a [[high-definition video]] format that can be thought of as four DV codecs that work in parallel. Video data rate depends on frame rate and can be as low as 40 Mbit/s for 24 frame/s mode and as high as 100 Mbit/s for 50/60 frame/s modes. Like DVCPRO50, DVCPRO HD employs 4:2:2 color sampling.

DVCPRO HD uses smaller raster size than broadcast high definition television: 960x720 pixels for 720p, 1280x1080 for 1080/59.94i and 1440x1080 for 1080/50i. Similar horizontal downsampling is used in many other HD formats. To maintain compatibility with [[HDSDI]], DVCPRO100 equipment upsamples video during playback.

Variable framerates (from 4 to 60 frame/s) are available on ''VariCam'' camcorders. DVCPRO HD equipment offers [[backward compatibility]] with older DV/DVCPRO formats.

When recorded to tape in standard-play mode, DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD uses the same 18 μm track pitch as other DVCPRO flavors. A long play variant, DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD-LP, doubles the recording density by using 9 μm track pitch.

DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD is codified as SMPTE 370M; the DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD tape format is SMPTE 371M, and the [[MXF]] Op-Atom format used for DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD on P2 cards is SMPTE 390M.

While technically DVCPRO HD is a direct descendant of DV, it is used almost exclusively by professionals. Tape-based DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD cameras exist only in shoulder mount variant.

A similar format, [[Digital-S]] (D-9 HD), was offered by JVC and used videocassettes with the same form-factor as [[VHS]].

The main competitor to DVCPRO HD was [[HDCAM]], offered by Sony. It uses a similar compression scheme but at higher bitrate.

== Progressive recording ==
Tape-based DV variants, except for DVCPRO Progressive, do not support native progressive recording, therefore progressively acquired video is recorded within interlaced video stream using [[Telecine#Frame rate differences|pulldown]]. The same technique is used in television industry to broadcast movies. Progressive-scan DV camcorders for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz market record 24-frame/s video using 2-3 pulldown and 30-frame/s video using 2-2 pulldown. Progressive-scan DV camcorders for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz market record 25-frame/s video using 2-2 pulldown.

Progressive video can be recorded with interlaced delivery in mind, in which case high-frequency information between fields is blended to suppress [[interline twitter]]. If the goal is progressive-scan distribution like [[Web video]]s, progressive-scan [[DVD-video]] or [[film-out|filmout]], then no filtering is applied. Video recorded with 2-2 pulldown and no vertical filtering is conceptually identical to [[progressive segmented frame]].

Consumer-grade DV camcorders capable of progressive recording usually offer only 2-2 pulldown scheme because of its simplicity. Such a video can be edited as either interlaced or progressive and does not require additional processing aside of treating every pair of fields as one complete frame. Canon and Panasonic call this format ''Frame Mode'', while Sony calls it ''Progressive Scan recording''. 24 frame/s recording is available only on professional DV camcorders and requires ''pulldown removal'' if editing at native frame rate is required.

DVCPRO HD supports native progressive recording at 50 or 60 frame/s in 720p mode. To record video acquired at 24, 25 or 30 frame/s frame repeating is used. Frame repeating is similar to field repeating used in interlaced video, and is also called pulldown sometimes.

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}

DV was originally designed for recording onto [[magnetic tape]]. Tape is enclosed into [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] of four different sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large. All DV cassettes use tape that is ¼ inch (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) wide.

Small cassettes, also known as ''S-size'' or '''MiniDV''' cassettes, had been intended for amateur use, but have become accepted in professional productions as well. MiniDV cassettes are used for recording baseline DV, DVCAM, and [[HDV]]. Each tape holds about 13&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] for one hour of video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://westcityfilms.com/images/Filmmakers_Handbook-4th-ed_data_rates.pdf|title=The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age|edition=4th|chapter=Appendix B: Data Rates and Storage Needs for Various Digital Formats|website=WestCityFilms.com|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medium or ''M-size'' cassettes are used in professional Panasonic equipment and are often called ''DVCPRO tapes''. Panasonic video recorders that accept medium cassette can play back from and record to medium cassette in different flavors of DVCPRO format; they will also play small cassettes containing DV or DVCAM recording via an adapter.

Large or ''L-size'' cassettes are accepted by most standalone DV tape recorders and are used in many shoulder-mount camcorders. The L-size cassette can be used in both Sony and Panasonic equipment; nevertheless, they are often called ''DVCAM tapes''. Older Sony decks would not play large cassettes with DVCPRO recordings, but newer models can.

Extra-large cassettes or ''XL-size'' have been designed for use in Panasonic equipment and are sometimes called DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;XL. These cassettes are not widespread, and only two models of standalone Panasonic tape recorders can accept them.

Technically, any DV cassette can record any variant of DV video. Nevertheless, manufacturers often label cassettes with DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO, DVCPRO50 or DVCPRO HD and indicate recording time with regards to the label posted. Cassettes labeled as DV indicate recording time of baseline DV; another number can indicate recording time of Long Play DV. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO have a yellow tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO25 is used; with DVCPRO50 the recording time is half, with DVCPRO HD it is a quarter. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO50 have a blue tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO50 is used. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO HD have a red tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO HD-LP format is used; a second number may be used for DVCPRO HD recording, which will be half as long.

Panasonic stipulated use of a particular magnetic-tape formulation—Metal Particle (MP)—as an inherent part of its DVCPRO family of formats. Regular DV tape uses Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation, which was pioneered for use in [[Hi8]] camcorders. Early Hi8 ME tape was plagued with excessive dropouts, which forced many shooters to switch to more expensive MP tape. After the technology improved, the dropout rate was greatly reduced, nevertheless Panasonic deemed ME formulation not robust enough for professional use. Tape-based Panasonic camcorders do not use small DV cassettes, effectively preventing use of ME tape.

=== File-based media ===
With proliferation of [[tapeless camcorder]] video recording, DV video can be recorded on [[optical disc]]s, solid state [[flash memory]] cards and [[hard disk drives]] and used as [[computer file]]s. In particular:
* Sony [[XDCAM]] family of cameras can record DV onto either [[Professional Disc]] or [[SxS]] memory cards.
* Panasonic DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;HD and AVC-Intra camcorders can record DV (as well as DVCPRO) onto [[P2 (storage media)|P2]] cards.
* Some Panasonic [[AVCHD]] camcorders (AG-HMC80, AG-AC130, AG-AC160) record DV video onto [[Secure Digital]] memory cards.
* JVC GY-HM750 can be set to standard definition mode and in this case will record '.AVI or .MOV SD legacy format' video onto SDHC cards. ''For clarity - and contrary to what has previously been written'', the camera ''does not'' natively support SxS memory cards, has no slots for them and requires an optional add-on recorder (or 'adapter' as JVC call it) to achieve this - basically this camera is an 'XDCAM EX' High definition unit and the add-on SxS recorder was only made available to achieve better compatibility  in facilities which were Sony based. 
* Most DV and [[HDV]] camcorders can feed live DV stream over [[IEEE 1394 interface]] to an external file-based recorder.

Video is stored either as native DIF bitstream or wrapped into an audio/video [[Container format (digital)|container]] such as [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[QuickTime File Format|QuickTime]] and [[Material Exchange Format|MXF]].

* ''DV-DIF'' is the raw form of DV video. The files usually have extensions *.dv or *.dif.
* ''[[Audio Video Interleave#DV AVI|DV-AVI]]'' is [[Microsoft]]'s implementation of DV video file, which is wrapped into an AVI container. Two variants of wrapping are available: with Type 1 the multiplexed audio and video is saved into the video section of a single AVI file, with Type 2 video and audio are saved as separate streams in an AVI file (one video stream and one to four audio streams). This container is used primarily on Windows-based computers, though Sony offers two tapeless recorders, the HDD-based HVR-DR60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-HVRDR60 | title=HVR-DR60 HDV hard disk recorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CompactFlash-based HVR-MRC1K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-HVRMRC1K | title=HVR-MRC1K Memory Recording Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use with DV/HDV camcorders that can record in DV-AVI format either making a file-based copy of the tape or bypassing tape recording altogether. Panasonic AVCHD camcorders use Type 2 DV-AVI for recording DV video onto Secure Digital memory card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/pub/panasonic/business/provideo/op_manuals/AG-HMC80_OI_Advanced.pdf | title=Panasonic AG-HMC80 operating instructions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[QuickTime]]-DV'' is DV video wrapped into QuickTime container. This container is used primarily on Apple computers.
* ''[[MXF]]-DV'' wraps DV video into MXF container, which is presently used on P2-based camcorders (Panasonic) and on XDCAM/XDCAM EX camcorders (Sony).

==Connectivity==
Nearly all DV camcorders and decks have [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE 1394]] (FireWire, i.LINK) ports for digital video transfer. When video is captured onto a computer it is stored in a container file, which can be either raw DV stream, AVI, WMV or QuickTime. Whichever container is used, the video itself is not re-encoded and represents a complete digital copy of what has been recorded onto tape. If needed, the video can be recorded back to tape to create a full and lossless copy of the original footage.

Some camcorders also feature a [[USB 2.0]] port for computer connection. This port is usually used for transferring still images, but not for video transfer. Camcorders that offer video transfer over USB usually do not deliver full DV quality - usually it is 320x240 video, except for the Sony DCR-PC1000 camcorder and some Panasonic camcorders that provide transfer of a full-quality DV stream via USB by using the [[USB video device class|UVC]] protocol. Full-quality DV can also be captured via USB by using separate hardware that receives DV data from the camcorder over a FireWire cable and forwards it without any transcoding to the computer via a USB cable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvmp.co.uk/dv-capture-over-usb.htm|title=How to Capture DV video via USB|work=dvmp.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; - this can be particularly useful for capturing on modern laptop computers which frequently do not have a FireWire port or expansion slot but always have USB ports.

High end cameras and [[VTR]]s may have additional professional outputs such as [[Serial Digital Interface|SDI]], [[SDTI]] or analog [[component video]]. All DV variants have a [[time code]], but some older or consumer computer applications fail to take advantage of it.

==Usage==
The high quality of DV images, especially when compared to Video8 and Hi8 which were vulnerable to an unacceptable amount of video dropouts and "hits", prompted the acceptance by mainstream broadcasters of material shot on DV. The low costs of DV equipment and their ease of use put such cameras in the hands of a new breed of [[Video journalism|videojournalists]]. Programs such as TLC's [[Trauma: Life in the E.R.]] and ABC News's Hopkins: 24/7 were shot on DV.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

DVCPRO HD was the preferred high definition standard of the BBC Factual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525105352/http://hdmasters2007.com/pdf/Presentations/HDM2007_Quested-BBC.pdf HD at BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application software support ==
Most DV players, editors and encoders only support the basic DV format, but not its professional versions. DV Audio/Video data can be stored as raw DV data stream file (data is written to a file as the data is received over FireWire, file extensions are '''.dv''' and '''.dif''') or the DV data can be packed into [[Comparison of container formats|container files]] (ex:  Microsoft [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], Apple MOV). The DV meta-information is preserved in both file types.

Most [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] video software only supports DV packed into AVI containers, as they use [[Microsoft]]'s avifile.dll, which only supports reading avi files. A few notable exceptions exist, while [[Apple Inc.|Mac OS X]] video software support both AVI and MOV containers.
* [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iMovie]]: iMovie allows importing from HDV cameras since iMovie HD, which import in full quality, and DV cameras since iMovie 1, which decodes to half of the original quality, to preserve processing power.
* [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Final Cut Pro]]: Final Cut Pro allows importing from all DV, HDV, and AVCHD (using the [[Apple Intermediate Codec]] or [[Apple ProRes|ProRes]]) cameras. It supports rewinding, fast-forwarding, pausing, stopping and playing from the computer.
* Apple Inc.'s [[QuickTime]] Player: QuickTime by default only decodes DV to half of the resolution to preserve processing power for editing capabilities. However, in the "Pro" version the setting "High Quality" under "Show Movie Properties" enables full resolution playback.
* The [[VLC media player]] ([[Free software]]): full decoding quality
* [[MPlayer]] (also with GUI under Windows and Mac OS X): full decoding quality
* [[muvee Technologies]] autoProducer 4.0: Allows editing using [[FireWire]] [[IEEE 1394]]
* Quasar DV codec (libdv) - open source DV codec for Linux
* DVswitch - open source linear editor for DV streams, with live streaming capabilities

== Mixing tapes from different manufacturers ==
There was considerable controversy solely based on hearsay over whether or not using tapes from different manufacturers could lead to dropouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenera.com/dvtape.html#mix_brands|title=DV Tape FAQ|work=zenera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adamwilt_headgunking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamwilt.com/Tidbits.html#DVgunking|title=Adam Wilt's Video Tidbits|author=Adam J. Wilt|work=adamwilt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially this was suggested around the conception of mostly MiniDV tapes in the mid to late 90s as the only two manufacturers of MiniDV tapes (Sony, who produce their tapes solely under the Sony brand; and Panasonic, who produce their own tapes under their Panasonic brand and outsources for TDK, Canon, etc.) used two different lubrication types for their cameras - Sony uses a 'wet' lubricant ('ME' or 'Metal Evaporated'), while Panasonic uses a 'dry' lubricant ('MP' or 'Metal Particle').

Though the controversy still remain standard practice for encouraging casual and professional camera operators alike not to mix brands of tapes (as the different lubrication formulations can cause or encourage tape wear if not cleaned by a cleaning cassette), no significant problems have occurred for the last few years - meaning that switching tapes is acceptable, though sticking to one brand (and cleaning the heads with a cleaning cassette before doing so) is highly recommended.

A research undertaken by Sony claimed that there was no hard evidence of the above statement. The only evidence claimed was that using ME tapes in equipment designed for MP tapes can cause tape damage and hence dropouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pro.sony.com/bbsccms/assets/files/mkt/recmedia/solutions/hdvtapelube.pdf The Truth About Tape Lubricant]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Primary source: 'Research' undertaken by the manufacturer causing the problem|date=June 2011}} Sony has done a significant amount of internal testing to simulate head clogs as a result of mixing tape lubricants, and has been unable to recreate the problem.{{dubious|date=October 2013}} Sony recommends using cleaning cassettes once every 50 hours of recording or playback. For those who are still skeptical, Sony recommends cleaning video heads with a cleaning cassette before trying another brand of tape.

A '''definite description''' is a [[denotation|denoting]] [[phrase]] in the form of "the X" where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common [[noun]]. The definite description is ''proper'' if X applies to a unique individual or object.  For example: "[[Yuri Gagarin|the first person in space]]" and "[[Bill Clinton|the 42nd President of the United States of America]]", are proper. The definite descriptions "the person in space" and "the Senator from Ohio" are ''improper'' because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing, and the definite descriptions "the first man on Mars" and "the Senator from some Country" are ''improper'' because X applies to nothing. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the [[law of excluded middle]], [[denotation]], [[Linguistic modality|modality]], and [[mental content]].

==Russell's analysis==
{{main|Theory of descriptions}}
As [[France]] is [[French Fifth Republic|currently a republic]], it has no king. [[Bertrand Russell]] pointed out that this raises a puzzle about the truth value of the sentence "The present King of France is bald."

The sentence does not seem to be true: if we consider all the bald things, the present King of France isn't among them, since there is [[List of French monarchs|no present King of France]]. But if it is false, then one would expect that the [[negation]] of this statement, that is, "It is not the case that the present King of France is bald," or its [[logical equivalence|logical equivalent]], "The present King of France is not bald," is true. But this sentence doesn't seem to be true either: the present King of France is no more among the things that fail to be bald than among the things that are bald.  We therefore seem to have a violation of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]].

Is it meaningless, then?  One might suppose so (and some philosophers have; see below) since "the present King of France" certainly does [[Failure to refer|fail to refer]]. But on the other hand, the sentence "The present King of France is bald" (as well as its negation) seem perfectly intelligible, suggesting that "the Present King of France" can't be meaningless.

Russell proposed to resolve this puzzle via his [[theory of descriptions]].  A definite description like "the present King of France", he suggested, isn't a [[reference|referring]] expression, as we might naively suppose, but rather an "incomplete symbol" that introduces [[Quantifier (logic)|quantificational]] structure into sentences in which it occurs. The sentence "the present King of France is bald", for example, is analyzed as a conjunction of the following three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantified]] statements:

# there is an x such that x is currently King of France: &lt;math&gt;\exists xKx&lt;/math&gt; (using 'Kx' for 'x is currently King of France')
# for any x and y, if x is currently King of France and y is currently King of France, then x=y (i.e. there is at most one thing which is currently King of France): &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ((Kx \land Ky) \rightarrow x=y)&lt;/math&gt;
# for every x that is currently King of France, x is bald: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (Kx \rightarrow Bx)&lt;/math&gt; (using 'B' for 'bald')

More briefly put, the claim is that "The present King of France is bald" says that some x is such that x is currently King of France, and that any y is currently King of France only if y = x, and that x is bald: 

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''false'', since it is ''not'' the case that some x is currently King of France.

The negation of this sentence, i.e. "The present King of France is not bald", is ambiguous.  It could mean one of two things, depending on where we place the negation 'not'.  On one reading, it could mean that there is no one who is currently King of France and bald:

:&lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

On this disambiguation, the sentence is ''true'' (since there is indeed no x that is currently King of France).

On a second reading, the negation could be construed as attaching directly to 'bald', so that the sentence means that there is currently a King of France, but that this King fails to be bald:

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land \lnot Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

On this disambiguation, the sentence is ''false'' (since there is no x that is currently King of France).

Thus, whether "the present King of France is not bald" is true or false depends on how it is interpreted at the level of [[logical form]]: if the [[negation]] is construed as taking wide scope (as in the first of the above)), it is true, whereas if the negation is construed as taking narrow scope (as in the second of the above]), it is false. In neither case does it lack a truth value.

So we do ''not'' have a failure of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]]: "the present King of France is bald" (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;) is false, because there is no present King of France.  The negation of this statement is the one in which 'not' takes wide scope: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;.  This statement is ''true'' because there does not exist anything which is currently King of France.

== Generalized quantifier analysis ==

[[Stephen Neale]], among others, has defended Russell's theory, and incorporated it into the theory of [[generalized quantifier]]s.  On this view, 'the' is a quantificational determiner like 'some', 'every', 'most' etc. The definite description 'the' has the following denotation (using [[lambda calculus|lambda]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda f. \lambda g.\exists x(f(x)=1 \land \forall y(f(y)=1 \rightarrow y=x) \land g(x) = 1)&lt;/math&gt;

(That is, the definite article 'the' denotes a function which takes a pair of [[property|properties]] f and g to truth [[if and only if|if, and only if]] there exists something that has the property f, only one thing has the property f, and that thing also has the property g.) Given the denotation of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] 'present King of France' (again K for short) and 'bald' (B for short)

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.Kx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x.Bx&lt;/math&gt;

we then get the Russellian truth conditions via two steps of [[function application]]: 'The present King of France is bald' is true if, and only if &lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;.  On this view, definite descriptions like 'the present King of France' do have a denotation (specifically, definite descriptions denote a function from properties to truth values—they are in that sense not [[syncategorematic]], or "incomplete symbols"); but the view retains the essentials of the Russellian analysis, yielding exactly the truth conditions Russell argued for.

==Fregean analysis==

The Fregean analysis of definite descriptions, implicit in the work of [[Frege]] and later defended by [[P. F. Strawson|Strawson]] (1950) among others, represents the primary alternative to the Russellian theory. On the Fregean analysis, definite descriptions are construed as [[referring expression]]s rather than [[Quantifier (logic)|quantificational expressions]].  Existence and uniqueness are understood as a [[presupposition]] of a sentence containing a definite description, rather than part of the content asserted by such a sentence.  The sentence 'The present King of France is bald', for example, isn't used to claim that there exists a unique present King of France who is bald; instead, that there is a unique present King of France is part of what this sentence ''presupposes'', and what it ''says'' is that this individual is bald.  If the presupposition fails, the definite description [[empty name|fails to refer]], and the sentence as a whole fails to express a [[proposition]].

The Fregean view is thus committed to the kind of [[truth value]] gaps (and failures of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]]) that the Russellian analysis is designed to avoid.  Since there is currently no King of France, the sentence 'The present King of France is bald' fails to express a proposition, and therefore fails to have a truth value, as does its [[negation]], 'The present King of France is not bald'.  The Fregean will account for the fact that these sentences are nevertheless ''meaningful'' by relying on speakers' knowledge of the conditions under which either of these sentences ''could'' be used to express a true proposition.  The Fregean can also hold on to a restricted version of the Law of Excluded Middle: for any sentence whose presuppositions are met (and thus expresses a proposition), either that sentence or its negation is true.

On the Fregean view, the definite article 'the' has the following denotation (using [[lambda calculus|lambda]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda f: \exists x(f(x)=1 \land \forall y(f(y)=1 \rightarrow y=x)).&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; [The unique z such that &lt;math&gt;f(z)=1&lt;/math&gt;]

(That is, 'the' denotes a function which takes a property f and yields the unique object z that has property f, if there is such a z, and is undefined otherwise.)  The presuppositional character of the existence and uniqueness conditions is here reflected in the fact that the definite article denotes a [[partial function]] on the set of properties: it is only defined for those properties f which are true of exactly one object.  It is thus undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'currently King of France', since the property of currently being King of France is true of no object; it is similarly undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'Senator of the US', since the property of being a US Senator is true of more than one object.

== Mathematical logic ==
{{main|Uniqueness quantification}}
Following the example of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', it is customary to use a definite description operator symbolized using the "turned" (rotated) Greek lower case iota character "℩". The notation ℩&lt;math&gt;x(\phi x)&lt;/math&gt; means "the unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi x&lt;/math&gt;", and

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(&lt;/math&gt;℩&lt;math&gt;x(\phi x))&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to "There is exactly one &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and it has the property
&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;":

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x (\forall y (\phi(y) \iff y=x) \land \psi(x))&lt;/math&gt;

In [[formal language theory]], the '''empty string''', or '''empty word''' is the unique string of [[String (computer science)#Formal theory|length]] [[zero]].

=={{anchor|nullable symbol}}Formal theory==
Formally, a string is a finite, ordered sequence of [[character (symbol)|characters]] such as letters, digits or spaces. The empty string is the special case where the sequence has length zero, so there are no symbols in the string.
There is only one empty string, because two strings are only different if they have different lengths or a different sequence of symbols.
In formal treatments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Corcoran |first2=William |last2=Frank |first3=Michael |last3=Maloney |title=String theory |journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=39 |issue=4 |year=1974 |pages=625–637 |doi=10.2307/2272846 |jstor=2272846}}&lt;/ref&gt; the empty string is denoted with '''[[ε]]''' or sometimes '''[[Λ]]''' or '''[[λ]]'''.

The empty string should not be confused with the empty language [[∅]], which is a [[formal language]] (i.e. a set of strings) that contains no strings, not even the empty string.

The empty string has several properties:
* |ε| = 0. Its [[string (computer science)#Formal theory|string length]] is zero.
* ε ⋅ s = s ⋅ ε = s. The empty string is the [[identity element]] of the [[concatenation]] operation. The set of all strings forms a [[free monoid]] with respect to ⋅ and ε.
* ε&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; = ε. Reversal of the empty string produces the empty string.
* The empty string precedes any other string under [[lexicographical order]], because it is the shortest of all strings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.fit.edu/~ryan/cse1002/lectures/lexicographic.pdf CSE1002 Lecture Notes – Lexicographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[context-free grammar]]s, a [[production (computer science)|production rule]] that allows a [[symbol (logic)|symbol]] to produce the empty string is known as an ε-production, and the symbol is said to be "nullable".

==Use in programming languages==
In most programming languages, strings are a [[data type]].  Individual strings are typically stored in consecutive [[Memory address|memory locations]].
This means that the same string (for example, the empty string) could be stored in two different places in memory.
(Note that even a string of length zero can require memory to store it, depending on the format being used.)
In this way there could be multiple empty strings in memory, in contrast with the formal theory definition, for which there is only one possible empty string.
However, a string comparison function would indicate that all of these empty strings are equal to each other.

In most programming languages, the empty string is distinct from a [[null pointer|null]] [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] (or null pointer) because a null reference does not point to any string at all, not even the empty string.
&lt;!---A null reference is likely to cause an error if one tries to perform any operation on it, but an empty string is less likely to do so.---&gt;
The empty string is a legitimate string, upon which most string operations should work. Some languages treat some or all of the following in similar ways, which can lessen the danger: empty strings, null references, the integer 0, the floating point number 0, the boolean value [[False (logic)|false]], the [[ASCII]] character [[null character|NUL]], or other such values.

The empty string is usually represented similarly to other strings. In implementations with string terminating character ([[null-terminated string]]s or plain text lines), the empty string is indicated by the immediate use of this terminating character.

=== Examples of empty strings ===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
The empty string is a syntactically valid representation of [[0 (number)|zero]] in [[positional notation]] (in any base), which does not contain [[leading zero]]s. Since the empty string does not have a standard visual representation outside of formal language theory, the number zero is traditionally represented by a single [[decimal digit]] '''0''' instead.

Zero-filled memory area, interpreted as a [[null-terminated string]], is an empty string.

Empty lines of text show the empty string. This can occur from two consecutive [[End of line|EOLs]], as often occur in [[text file]]s, and this is sometimes used in [[text processing]] to separate [[paragraph]]s, e.g. in [[MediaWiki]].

'''FOB''', "Free On Board", is a term in [[international commercial law]] specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the [[Incoterms]] standard published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. FOB is only used in non-containerized sea freight or inland waterway transport. As with all Incoterms, FOB does not define the point at which ownership of the goods is transferred.

The term FOB is also used in modern domestic shipping within the United States to describe the point at which a seller is no longer responsible for shipping cost.

Ownership of a cargo is independent from Incoterms. In international trade, ownership of the cargo is defined by the bill of lading or waybill.

==Incoterms==
{{Further|Incoterms}}

Under the [[Incoterms|Incoterms 2010]] standard published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], FOB is only used in sea freight and stands for "Free On Board". The term is always used in conjunction with a port of loading.&lt;ref name="iccfobpreamble"&gt;{{cite web
 |title      = FOB Preamble
 |publisher  = International Chamber of Commerce
 |url        = http://www.iccwbo.org/incoterms/preambles/pdf/FOB.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicating "FOB ''port''{{-"}} means that the seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment, plus loading costs. The buyer pays the cost of [[cargo|marine freight]] transport, [[insurance]], unloading, and transportation from the arrival port to the final destination. The passing of risks occurs when the goods are loaded on board at the port of shipment. For example, "FOB Vancouver" indicates that the seller will pay for transportation of the goods to the port of [[Vancouver]], and the cost of loading the goods on to the cargo ship (this includes inland haulage, customs clearance, origin documentation charges, [[demurrage]] if any, origin port handling charges, in this case Vancouver). The buyer pays for all costs beyond that point, including unloading. Responsibility for the goods is with the seller until the goods are loaded on board the ship. Once the cargo is on board, the buyer assumes the risk.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 143195 Mackarra (ship).jpg|thumbnail|Ship loading at a wharf]]
The use of "FOB" originated in the days of [[sailing ship]]s. When the ICC first wrote their guidelines for the use of the term in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ship's rail was still relevant, as goods were often [[Stevedore|passed over the rail by hand]]. In 1954, in the case of ''[[The Pyrene Company Limited|Pyrene Co. Ltd.]] v. [[Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd.|Scindia Steam Navigation Co. Ltd.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pyrene Co. Ltd. v. Scindia Navigation Co.

:''Only the most enthusiastic lawyer could watch with satisfaction the spectacle of liabilities shifting uneasily as the cargo sways at the end of a derrick across a notional perpendicular projecting from the ship's rail.''

In the modern era of [[containerization]], the term "ship's rail" is somewhat archaic for trade purposes, as with a sealed shipping container there is no way of establishing when damage occurred after the container has been sealed. The standards have noted this. Incoterms 1990 stated,
:''When the ship's rail serves no practical purpose, such as in the case of roll-on/roll-off or container traffic, the [[Free Carrier|FCA]] term is more appropriate to use.''
Incoterms 2000 adopted the wording,
:''If the parties do not intend to deliver the goods across the ship's rail, the FCA term should be used.''&lt;ref name=iccfobpreamble/&gt;
The phrase ''passing the ship's rail'' is no longer in use, having been dropped from the FOB Incoterm in the 2010 revision.

Due to potential confusion with domestic North American usage of "FOB", it is recommended that the use of Incoterms be explicitly specified, along with the edition of the standard.&lt;ref name="iccfaq"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "FOB New York (Incoterms 2000)". Incoterms apply to both [[international trade]] and [[domestic trade]], as of the 2010 revision.

==North America==
In North America, FOB is written into a sales agreement to determine where the liability responsibility for the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. FOB stands for "Free On Board" or so there is no line item payment by the buyer for the cost of getting the goods onto the transport. There are two possibilities: "FOB origin", or "FOB destination". "FOB origin" means the transfer occurs as soon as the goods are safely on board the transport. "FOB destination" means the transfer occurs the moment the goods are removed from the transport at the destination. "FOB origin" (also sometimes phrased as "FOB shipping" or "FOB shipping point") indicates that the sale is considered complete at the seller's shipping dock, and thus the buyer of the goods is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport. With "FOB destination", the sale is complete at the buyer's doorstep and the seller is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/F/fob-shipping-point.html |title=FOB shipping point definition |publisher=AccountingCoach.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-319|title=§ 2-319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms.|first=LII|last=Staff|date=20 November 2012|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two terms have a specific meaning in commercial law and cannot be altered. But the FOB terms do not need to be used, and often are not. In this case the specific terms of the agreement can vary widely, in particular which party, buyer or seller, pays for the loading costs and shipment costs, and/or where responsibility for the goods is transferred. The last distinction is important for determining [[legal liability|liability]] or [[risk of loss]] for goods lost or damaged in transit from the seller to the buyer.&lt;ref name=ucc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title=What is the significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination?|
url=http://blog.accountingcoach.com/fob-shipping-point-fob-destination/|
publisher=AccountingCoach, LLC|
date=2006-07-12|
accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a person in [[Miami]] purchasing equipment from a manufacturer in [[Chicago]] could receive a price quote of "$5000 FOB Chicago", which would indicate that the buyer would be responsible for the shipping from Chicago to Miami. If the same seller issued a price quote of "$5000 FOB Miami", then the seller would cover shipping to the buyer's location.

[[International trade|International]] shipments typically use [[#Incoterms|"FOB" as defined by the Incoterms standards]], where it always stands for "Free On Board". Domestic shipments within the United States or Canada often use a different meaning, specific to North America, which is inconsistent with the Incoterms standards.

North American FOB usage corresponds to [[Incoterms]] approximately as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! North America
! Incoterms
|-
| FOB shipping point '''''or''''' FOB shipping point, freight collect
| [[Free Carrier|FCA]] shipping point
|-
| FOB shipping point, freight prepaid
| [[Carriage Paid To|CPT]] destination
|-
| FOB destination '''''or''''' FOB destination, freight prepaid
| [[Delivered at Place|DAP]] destination
|}

A related but separate term "CAP" ("customer-arranged pickup") is used to denote that the buyer will arrange a carrier of their choice to pick the goods up at the seller's premises, and the liability for any damage or loss belongs to the buyer.

Although FOB has long been stated as "''''F'''reight '''O'''n '''B'''oard'" in sales contract terminology, this should be avoided as it does not precisely conform to the meaning of the acronym as specified in the [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]].&lt;ref name=ucc/&gt;

Sometimes FOB is used in sales to retain commission by the outside sales representative. It is unclear where this originated.

== Accounting and auditing (FOB) ==
[[File:Container ship loading-700px.jpg|thumbnail|Container ship loading]]

In the past, the FOB point determined when title transferred for goods. For example, at year- and period-end goods in transit under "FOB destination" ([[#North America|North American usage]]) appear on the seller's balance sheet but not in the buyer's balance sheet, as the risk and rewards of ownership change to the buyer at the "destination" port.

It is much easier to determine when title transfers by referring to the agreed upon terms and conditions of the transaction; typically, title passes with risk of loss. The transfer of title may occur at a different time (or event) than the FOB shipping term. The transfer of title is the element of revenue that determines who owns the goods and the applicable value.

Import fees when they reach the border of one country to enter the other country under the conditions of FOB destination are due at the customs port of the destination country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are FOB Shipping Terms?|url=http://simplestudies.com/what-are-fob-shipping-terms.html|
publisher=Simplestudies LLC|date=2010-02-24|accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[e-commerce]], most commercial electronic transactions occur under the terms of "FOB shipping point" or "[[Free Carrier|FCA]] shipping point".

== "Freight On Board" ==
Some sources claim that FOB stands for "Freight On Board". This is not the case. The term "Freight On Board" is not mentioned in any version of [[Incoterms]], and is not defined by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the USA.&lt;ref name="UCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-319|title=§ 2-319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms.|first=LII|last=Staff|date=20 November 2012|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to that, it has been found in the US court system that "Freight On Board" is not a recognized industry term.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;[http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/SlipOpinions/Slip_op00/00-53.pdf United States Court of International Trade, Quinn v. United States and United States Secretary of the Treasury], May 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term "Freight On Board" in contracts is therefore very likely to cause confusion.

A '''helix building''' is a small structure at the base of a [[longwave]] or [[mediumwave]] [[radio transmitter]]. Within, there are [[capacitor]]s and [[Inductor|coil]]s for coupling the signal from the feed cable to the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nachrichten-Elektronik. Fachzeitschrift der internationalen Nachrichtentechnik. Band 5|last=|first=|publisher=Elektro-Welt-Verlag Dr. Hüthig|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building may also contain lightning protection devices. Active components such as [[amplifier]]s are usually not housed in a helix building.

The interior of the helix building is typically covered with copper or aluminum, in order to control stray radiation.

In operation the components can have a voltage of several hundred thousand volts. The electromagnetic fields can heat up animals and humans like a [[Diathermy|diathermy device]].

The helix building, which may be a simple switchbox for small transmitters, is usually next to the transmitting antenna array, but in some cases it can be the base of a [[mast radiator]].

Levy was born in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1950 to a Polish-American mother and a Jewish father.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-19/news/vw-857_1_japanese-language|title=Outsider Captures Soul of Japanese|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Teresa|last=Watanabe|date=November 19, 1992|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father named him after a friend who was imprisoned in an internment camp during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nihongo Institute Newsletter|date=March 1999|volume=3|url=http://www.nihoninst.jp/newsletter/newsletter%2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy's father was a diplomat, and the family moved around between [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and the United States. He graduated from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies, and later received his doctorate from the same school for studying [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]].

While at Princeton, Levy studied the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. His English translation of the text won him the 1982 U.S. [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Translation|Translation category]] (a split award).&lt;ref name=nba1982&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">{{Update|NFL’s IR rules|date=December 2017}}
The '''injured reserve list''' ({{abbr|abbr.|abbreviated}} '''IR list''') is an official designation used by the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for [[Sportsperson|athletes]] who become [[sports injury|injured]] and temporarily unable to play. It is analogous to the '''injured list''' in the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) or the [[disabled list]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) does not have a direct analog to an injured reserve list, instead using a more general-purpose "inactive list" that does not require a player to be injured.

It is used because the rules of these leagues allow for only a certain numbers of players on each team's [[Schedule (workplace)|roster]]. Designating a player as "Injured/Reserve" frees up a roster spot, enabling the team to add a new replacement player during the injured athlete's convalescence. In the NFL, when a player is placed on the injured reserve list he cannot return to play for the remainder of the regular season even if fully fit; the other leagues allow the player to return to play during the season.

==NHL rules==
A player may be placed on injured reserve if he is unable to participate due to illness or injury, provided that the player had passed the club's initial physical examination at the start of the season. To qualify for the IR due to injury, that injury must be sufficient (in the opinion of the team's medical staff) to render the player unable to participate for the seven days following that injury. Once placed on IR, the team may then replace the player on their roster. The player on IR may not return to active play for seven days, although they may participate in non-competitive events such as practice, meetings, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26377#injured|title=NHL Headquarters|publisher=[[nhl.com]]|accessdate=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL rules==
A team may place a player on injured reserve (reserve/injured list) who is "not immediately available for participation with a club". Generally, these players may not practice or return to the Active List for the rest of the season (including postseason games or the Pro Bowl) in which they are placed on injured reserve, but are allowed to be with the team.&lt;ref&gt;2009 NFL Record and Fact Book, p. 32 {{ISBN|1-60320-809-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], the league also allows players with long-term, but not season-ending, injuries to be placed into one of two designations: [[physically unable to perform]] (PUP), for injuries sustained during the previous season or during offseason training activities (a player who passes their physical at the beginning of training camp and practices is physically able to participate and is thus ineligible for the PUP list), or reserve/non-football injury, for injuries sustained outside of team or league activities (despite the name, this includes lingering injuries from [[college football]] play, should an injured player be drafted and join the team). Both designations are functionally identical in that the player can be promoted to the active roster by week 6 of the regular season or placed on injured reserve. During the regular season, players on the PUP list and injured reserve do not count against the league's 53 man roster maximum, but do count against the 90 man roster limit (also includes practice squad players). 

Starting in 2012, the NFL and the NFLPA reached an agreement allowing one player placed on injured reserve to be brought back to the active roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000056497/article/nflpa-nfl-agree-to-trade-deadline-extension-ir-exception | title=NFLPA, NFL agree to trade deadline extension, IR exception | publisher=[[NFL]] | date=2012-08-30 | accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the player was on the final 53-man preseason roster (A rule exempted for the 2012 season), and that the injury is deemed to keep this  player unable to practice or play football for an estimated six weeks, the player may be allowed to practice after Week 6, and be activated to play after Week 8.&lt;ref&gt;http://wcfcourier.com/sports/football/nfl-changes-rule-for-players-on-ir/article_19dcb07c-f329-11e1-ba45-0019bb2963f4.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, teams may now return two players from injured reserve after Week 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Andrea|first1=Christian|title=NFL approves rule to allow 2 players to return from injured reserve|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2017/5/23/15654976/nfl-officials-approve-rule-allow-2-players-to-return-injured-reserve-per-season|agency=SB Nation|date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams may also place a player on injured reserve with a minor injury designation, but the team must release the player once he is healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gehlken |first=Michael |title=Nate Kaeding passes physical, no longer a Charger |date=October 30, 2012 |newspaper=U-T San Diego |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/oct/30/nate-kaeding-passes-physical-be-waived/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bon8mRbb?url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/oct/30/nate-kaeding-passes-physical-be-waived/ |archivedate=October 31, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|NBA}}NBA rules==
{{Main|NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement}}

Due to abuses in the use of the injured reserve list, where some teams found it convenient to use the IR to stash players without independent medical oversight, the injured reserve has been renamed the Inactive List with the last [[collective agreement|collective bargaining agreement]]. Starting in the {{NBA Year|2005|app=season}}, players can enter the inactive list one hour before tip-off for as little as one game. The inactive list has a minimum of one player and a maximum of three, subject to hardship rules when a team with three injured players already on its inactive list has a fourth player injured. Players sent to the [[NBA G League]] will continue to count on a team's inactive list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''International trading tax stamp''' is kind of [[revenue stamp]]s that were used in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s and 1930s for [[taxation]] of the trade in [[Postage stamp|stamps]]. The latter were considered a commodity for which [[philatelist]]s could be taxed. This type of taxation was introduced by the [[Soviet government]] in addition to [[revenue]] it collected from stamp sales. International trading tax stamps were issued by the [[Pomgol#Pomgol Commission and famine|Posledgol Central Commission]] of [[VTsIK]], the [[Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily]] and, later, by the [[Soviet Philatelic Association]].&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, J. |date=July 1995 |title=The socialist construction of philately in the early Soviet era |url=http://cabdirect.cab.semcs.net/abstracts/19961801522.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150515113218/http://cabdirect.cab.semcs.net/abstracts/19961801522.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-05-15 |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=476–493 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500019770 |issn=0010-4175 |jstor=179216 |accessdate=2015-05-15 }} Archived from [https://www.webcitation.org/6YXgzUUR4?url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/179216?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21106833171513 the original] and [https://www.webcitation.org/6YXguzrX2?url=http://cabdirect.cab.semcs.net/abstracts/19961801522.html;jsessionid=D5AB89DF87BFD291068CC77278487A9B another source] on 2015-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stamp issues ==
In 1922, the first international trading tax stamps were introduced by {{Interlanguage link multi|Posledgol|WD=Q4373717}}. These were the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Russia#Revolution period|first two RSFSR stamps]] designed by [[Rihards Zariņš]] and [[overprint]]ed with [[surcharges]] of 250 and 500 [[ruble]]s, respectively. These newly surcharged stamps did not have [[Postal service|postal]] value and were used as a proof that taxes had been paid on stamps [[export]]ed from, or [[import]]ed into, Russia.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

This practice was continued under the [[USSR]], and in December 1923, some [[Tsarist period|tsarist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|insurance stamp|WD=Q4443495}} issues were subject to export surcharge made by the Organisation of the Commissioner for [[Philately]] and [[Scripophily]]. For the same purpose, Soviet [[definitive issue]]s of 1921 were also used.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Subsequently, similar tax stamps were issued by the government, via the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily and the Soviet Philatelic Association, in 1925, 1928, 1931, and 1932.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klein, J.

== History ==
During the period of the [[New Economic Policy]], the early Soviet government followed a policy of regarding stamp traders as just another type of the [[petit-bourgeois]] traders. They were allowed to operate by paying a tax, although some of them conducted affairs in the old way. Illegal trading was especially spread among the old specialists in the export bureau, and a few of them were even arrested and jailed.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

In conformity with the new governmental policy, the practice of taxing philatelists engaged in international stamp trading was introduced across the whole country. [[Moscow]], [[Kharkov]], [[Tashkent]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Leningrad]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Vladivostok]], and [[Simferopol]] were served as points of arrival where the trading tax had to be paid. The revenues from international trading tax stamps were directed to various relief funds.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

Members of the [[All-Union Society of Collectors]] (VOK) denounced those philatelists who did not comply with the new trading policy. For example, one of the editors stated in ''[[Soviet Philatelist|Sovetskii Kollektsioner]]'':
{{cquote|Alas, among philatelists there are several [[speculators]], [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries|forgers]], dishonest exchangers and other trading knights, who make a source of personal profit from philately.

In another article, a member advocated the VOK from blaming that it was "an organisation of private traders and consisted of speculators, disfranchised persons and similar elements which, of course do not merit the slightest trust."&lt;ref&gt;[''Anon.''] (1930). "Slova i dela Borisa Babitsogo", ''Sovetskii Kollektsioner'', 2 (102): 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the author argued:
{{cquote|To give so shameful a characterisation of a [[social organisation]] which, as is known, operates on the basis of rules set down by the [[NKVD]], and which does not have a single disfranchised member, but in fact has an impressive [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|party]] and [[komsomol]] stratum, is possible only in the presence of [an] ample supply of nerve and cynicism.|author=[Anon.]|source="Slova i dela Borisa Babitsogo", ''Sovetskii Kollektsioner'', 1930, 2 (102): 60.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;}}

Using appropriately overprinted stamps, the philatelic tax system existed at least until 1940. Fees were collected even on the samples of stamps sent abroad by the Soviet Philatelic Association and its successor, the Philatelic Department of {{Interlanguage link multi|Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga|WD=Q4288194|lt="Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cronin, A. |date=November 1996 |title=Some additional notes on the early Soviet era |url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076781/00039/15x |format=PDF |journal=Ямщик [Yamshcik = Post-Rider] |location=Toronto, Canada |publisher=Canadian Society of Russian Philately |volume=39 |pages=13–15 |id=Bibliographic ID: UF00076781 (University of Florida) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z5igCSyg?url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076781/00039/15x |archivedate=2015-06-06 |accessdate=2015-06-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italian''' (''italiano'' {{IPA-it|itaˈljaːno||It-italiano.ogg}} or {{lang|it|lingua italiana}} {{IPA-it|ˈliŋɡwa itaˈljaːna|}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]].

It formerly had official status in [[Albania]], [[Malta]] and [[Monaco]], and is still widely spoken some parts of France (especially [[Corsica]], [[Nice]], [[Savoie]]), Greece ([[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]] and [[Italian Islands of the Aegean|Dodecanese]]) and Montenegro ([[Kotor]]), as well as in former [[Italian East Africa]] and [[Italian North Africa]] regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is also spoken by large [[Italian diaspora|expatriate communities]] in the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita Ethnologue report for language code:ita (Italy)] – Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

Italian is a major European language, being one of the official languages of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and one of the working languages of the [[Council of Europe]]. It is the [[Languages of the EU|third most widely spoken first language in the European Union]] with 69 million native speakers (13% of the EU population) and it is spoken as a second language by 16 million EU citizens (3%).&lt;ref name="europa2006" /&gt; Including Italian speakers in non-EU European countries (such as Switzerland and Albania) and on other continents, the total number of speakers is around 90 million.&lt;ref name="Italian language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/modern-languages/lal/languages%20at%20lal/italian |title=Italian — University of Leicester |publisher=.le.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian is the main working language of the [[Holy See]], serving as the [[lingua franca]] (common language) in the Roman Catholic hierarchy as well as the official language of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. Italian is known as the ''language of music'' because of its use in [[musical terminology]] and [[opera]]. Its influence is also widespread in the [[arts]] and in the [[luxury goods]] market. Italian has been reported as the fourth or fifth most frequently taught foreign language in the world.&lt;ref name="becomingitalianwordbyword.typepad.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://becomingitalianwordbyword.typepad.com/becomingitalian/2014/06/italian-is-the-fourth-most-studied-language-in-the-world.html |title=Becoming Italian Word by Word: Italian Becomes the Fourth Most Studied Language in the World |publisher=Becomingitalianwordbyword.typepad.com |date=2014-06-25 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian was adopted by the state after the [[Unification of Italy]], having previously been a literary language based on [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] as spoken mostly by the [[upper class]] of Florentine society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italian-language-study.com/italian-language/modern-italian.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003014156/http://www.italian-language-study.com/italian-language/modern-italian.htm|date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development was also influenced by other [[Italian languages]] and to some minor extent, by the [[Germanic languages]] of the [[Migration period|post-Roman invaders]]. The incorporation into Italian of learned words from its own ancestor language, [[Classical Latin|Latin]], is another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language, scientific terminology and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Italians were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Italian. Its vowels are the second-closest to Latin after [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Classification of Romance languages|''Italica'' 1950: 46]] (cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0sbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Demonstrates+a+comparative+statistical+method%22] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0sbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22there+is+a+maximum+of+77+change+points%22]): "Pei, Mario A. "A New Methodology for Romance Classification." Word, v, 2 (Aug. 1949), 135–146. Demonstrates a comparative statistical method for determining the extent of change from the Latin for the free and checked stressed vowels of French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Rumanian, Old Provençal, and Logudorese Sardinian. By assigning 3½ change points per vowel (with 2 points for diphthongization, 1 point for modification in vowel quantity, ½ point for changes due to nasalization, palatalization or umlaut, and −½ point for failure to effect a normal change), there is a maximum of 77 change points for free and checked stressed vowel sounds (11×2×3½=77). According to this system (illustrated by seven charts at the end of the article), the percentage of change is greatest in French (44%) and least in Italian (12%) and Sardinian (8%). Prof. Pei suggests that this statistical method be extended not only to all other phonological but also to all morphological and syntactical, phenomena.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Classification of Romance languages|Koutna ''et al.'' (1990: 294)]]: "In the late forties and in the fifties some new proposals for classification of the Romance languages appeared. A statistical method attempting to evaluate the evidence quantitatively was developed in order to provide not only a classification but at the same time a measure of the divergence among the languages. The earliest attempt was made in 1949 by Mario Pei (1901–1978), who measured the divergence of seven modern Romance languages from Classical Latin, taking as his criterion the evolution of stressed vowels. Pei's results do not show the degree of contemporary divergence among the languages from each other but only the divergence of each one from Classical Latin. The closest language turned out to be Sardinian with 8% of change. Then followed Italian — 12%; Spanish — 20%; Romanian — 23,5%; Provençal — 25%; Portuguese — 31%; French — 44%."&lt;/ref&gt; As in most Romance languages, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is distinctive but, unlike most other Romance languages, Italian retains Latin's contrast between short and [[gemination|long consonants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdx.edu/multicultural-topics-communication-sciences-disorders/italian|title=Portland State Multicultural Topics in Communications Sciences &amp; Disorders {{!}} Italian|website=www.pdx.edu|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all words and syllables finish with pure vowels, a factor that makes Italian words extremely easy to use in [[rhyming]]. Italian has a 7 vowel sound system ('e' and 'o' have mid-low and mid-high sounds): Latin had 10, 5 with short and 5 with long sounds.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the established written language in Europe was Latin, though the great majority of people were illiterate, and only a handful were well versed in the language. In the [[Italian peninsula]], as in most of Europe, most would instead speak a local vernacular. These dialects (as they are commonly referred to) were born from [[Vulgar Latin]] over the course of centuries, evolving naturally unaffected by formal standards and teachings. They are not in any sense "dialects of" standard Italian, that itself started off being one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general. The Romance dialects of Italy can differ greatly from Italian at all levels ([[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[lexicon]], [[pragmatics]]) and are classified [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] as distinct languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17650220|title=The Italian language today|last=Lepschy|first= Anna Laura|last2=Lepschy|first2=Giulio C.|date=1988|publisher=New Amsterdam|year=|isbn=978-0-941533-22-5|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=13, 22, 19–20, 21, 35, 37|oclc=17650220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |last= Andreose | first = Alvise |last2=Renzi |first2=Lorenzo | contribution = Geography and distribution of the Romance Languages in Europe| editor-last = Maiden | editor-first = Martin |editor2-last= Smith | editor2-first = John Charles |editor3-last= Ledgeway | editor3-first = Adam |title=The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages | volume = Vol. 2, Contexts| pages =302-308 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge | year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The standard Italian language has a poetic and literary origin in the writings of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] writers of the 12th century, and, even though the grammar and core lexicon are basically unchanged from those used in Florence in the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/storia-della-lingua_(Enciiopedia_dell'Italiano)/|title=Storia della lingua|author=Vittorio Coletti|publisher=Istituto della Enciclopedia italiana|isbn=9788812000487|accessdate=10 October 2015|quote=L’italiano di oggi ha ancora in gran parte la stessa grammatica e usa ancora lo stesso lessico del fiorentino letterario del Trecento.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern standard of the language was largely shaped by relatively recent events. However, Romance vernacular as language spoken in the Apennine peninsula has a longer history. In fact, the earliest surviving texts that can definitely be called vernacular (as distinct from its predecessor Vulgar Latin) are legal formulae known as the [[Placiti Cassinesi]] from the [[Duchy of Benevento|Province of Benevento]] that date from 960–963, although the [[Veronese Riddle]], probably from the 8th or early 9th century, contains a late form of Vulgar Latin that can be seen as a very early sample of a vernacular dialect of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italian-language.biz/italian/history.asp|title=History of the Italian language|publisher=Italian-language.biz|accessdate=2006-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language that came to be thought of as Italian developed in central Tuscany and was first formalized in the early 14th century through the works of Tuscan writer [[Dante Alighieri]], written in his native [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]]. Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the "canonical standard" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|":0"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.

Italian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

Italy has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed "e", and of "s" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' "all right": is pronounced {{IPA|[va ˈbːɛne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va ˈbene]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' "at home" is {{IPA|[a ˈkːasa]}} for Roman and standard, {{IPA|[a ˈkaza]}} for Milanese and generally northern.

In contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.

The economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.

=== Renaissance ===
The [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of "rebirth", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).

[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]

During this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new a perspectives as [[humanists]]—individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential—began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58837884|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only written in [[Latin]], but after the Bible was translated, it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]]. The rediscovery of Dante's {{lang|it|[[De vulgari eloquentia]]|italic=yes}} and a renewed interest in linguistics in the 16th century, sparked a debate that raged throughout Italy concerning the criteria that should govern the establishment of a modern Italian literary and spoken language. This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:
* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.
* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.

[[File:Alessandro Manzoni.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alessandro Manzoni]] sat the basis for the modern Italian language and helped creating linguistic unity throughout Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manzoni.classicauthors.net/IPromessiSposiOrTheBetrothed/IPromessiSposiOrTheBetrothed1.html I Promessi sposi or The Betrothed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718073016/http://manzoni.classicauthors.net/IPromessiSposiOrTheBetrothed/IPromessiSposiOrTheBetrothed1.html |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. 
Eventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582–1583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.

The continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteen century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133–1172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===
An important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent). This conquest propelled the unification of Italy some decades after and pushed the Italian language into a [[lingua franca]] used not only among clerks, nobility, and functionaries in the Italian courts but also by the [[bourgeoisie]].

=== Contemporary times ===
Italian literature's first modern novel, ''I promessi sposi'' ([[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]) by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], further defined the standard by "rinsing" his Milanese "in the waters of the [[Arno River|Arno]]" ([[Florence]]'s river), as he states in the preface to his 1840 edition.

After unification, a huge number of civil servants and soldiers recruited from all over the country introduced many more words and idioms from their home languages (''[[ciao]]'' is derived from the [[Venetian language|Venetian]] word ''s-cia[v]o'' ("slave"), ''[[panettone]]'' comes from the [[Lombard language|Lombard]] word ''panetton'', etc.). Only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak the Italian standardized language properly when the nation was unified in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M.

== Classification ==
Italian is a [[Romance language]], and is therefore a descendant of [[Vulgar Latin]] (the spoken form of non-classical Latin).{{refn|group=note|It is debated, that the Sicilian language is the oldest and ''direct'' descendant of Vulgar Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babylonpost.globalist.it/Detail_News_Display?ID=78159&amp;typeb=0&amp;dante-perde-la-paternita-la-lingua-italiana-e-nata-in-sicilia |title=Dante perde la paternità: la lingua italiana è nata in Sicilia |editor=Ghetti, Noemi |date=14 June 2013 |publisher=Babylon Post |accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Standard Italian is based on [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]], especially its [[Florentine dialect]], and is therefore an [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]], to which [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and the extinct [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] also belong, among a few others.

Unlike most other Romance languages, Italian retains Latin's contrast between short and [[consonant length|long consonants]]. As in most Romance languages, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is distinctive. In particular, among the Romance languages, Italian is the closest to Latin in terms of [[vocabulary]].&lt;ref name="Grimes 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last= Grimes |first= Barbara F. |editor= Barbara F.

=== Influence and derived languages ===
{{See also|Italian diaspora}}

[[File:Aglomerado Gran Buenos Aires.png|thumb|upright|In blue color [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, where [[Cocoliche]] developed.]]
From the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, thousands of Italians settled in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and Venezuela, where they formed a physical and cultural presence.

In some cases, colonies were established where variants of regional [[languages of Italy]] were used, and some continue to use this regional language. Examples are [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], where [[Talian dialect|Talian]] is used, and the town of [[Chipilo]] near Puebla, [[Mexico]]; each continues to use a derived form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is [[Cocoliche]], an Italian–Spanish [[pidgin]] once spoken in [[Argentina]] and especially in [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lunfardo]].

[[Rioplatense Spanish]], and particularly the speech of the city of Buenos Aires, has intonation patterns that resemble those of [[Languages of Italy|Italian languages]] because Argentina has had a continuous large influx of Italian settlers since the second half of the nineteenth century: initially primarily from northern Italy; then, since the beginning of the twentieth century, mostly from southern Italy.

=== Lingua franca ===
{{See also|Mediterranean Lingua Franca}}

Starting in late [[medieval]] times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the [[Renaissance]] with the strength of Italy and the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[the arts]].

During that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the [[Grand Tour]], visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. [[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.

Within the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.

Italian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially, in culinary terms.

== Dialects ==
{{Main|Regional Italian}}
{{See also|Languages of Italy}}
[[File:Italy - Forms of Dialect.jpg|thumb|Geographical distribution of major Italian languages]]
Throughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. In Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] — other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities — are often imprecisely called "[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=2015-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered "[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.

The differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|":0"|page=19-20}}

Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations the contraction ''{{wiktit|annà}}'' replaces ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Rome for the infinitive "to go"; and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' is what [[Venice|Venetians]] say for the infinitive "to go").

There is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin—including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian—began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|":0"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|":0"|page=35}}

The Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|":0"|page=37}}

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Italian phonology}}
[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1–7 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]
{{IPA notice}}
{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}
{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}
Italian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:
* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' "fourteen" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|paișpe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/kaˈtɔʁz/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})
* Italian ''settimana'' "week" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|septimāna}} (cf. Romanian ''săptămână'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(ə)ˈmɛn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')
* Italian ''medesimo'' "same" &lt; Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''même'' {{IPA|/mɛm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')
* Italian ''guadagnare'' "to win, earn, gain" &lt; Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadanyāre}} &lt; [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/ɡaˈɲe/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')

The conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]]).

The following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].
* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|vīta}} &gt; ''vita'' "life" (cf. Romanian ''viață'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[biða]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} &gt; ''piede'' "foot" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).
* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} &gt; {{IPA|/ˈan.no/}} ''anno'' "year" (cf. Spanish ''año'' {{IPA|/aɲo/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/ˈã.nu/}}).
* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} &gt; ''pace'' "peace" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/pɛ/}}), {{smallcaps|octō}} &gt; ''otto'' "eight" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/ɥi(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|fēcī}} &gt; ''feci'' "I did" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).
* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.
* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} &gt; Italo-Western {{IPA|/fɔʎʎa/}} &gt; ''foglia'' {{IPA|/ˈfɔʎʎa/}} "leaf" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/ˈfo̯aje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/ˈoxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/ˈfœj/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/ˈfoʎɐ/}}).

Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian has a large number of inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|laxāre}} &gt; ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|captiāre}} &gt; ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)dēroteolāre}} &gt; ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|rēgīna}} &gt; ''regina'' and ''reina'', {{smallcaps|-c-}} &gt; {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{smallcaps|-t-}} &gt; {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.)

Some other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:
* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/tʃe, tʃi/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.
* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/tʃ/}}: {{smallcaps|octō}} &gt; ''otto'' "eight" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').
* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/ʎ/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} &gt; ''occhio'' "eye" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/oʎu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/œj/}} &lt; {{IPA|/œʎ/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/okʲ/}}.
* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' "male friend(s)", ''amica, amiche'' "female friend(s)" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amică, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' "male friend(s)", ''amiga(s)'' "female friend(s)"); {{smallcaps|trēs, sex}} → ''tre, sei'' "three, six" (cf. Romanian ''trei, șase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').

Standard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:
* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].
* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).

Italian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].&lt;!--(Maybe this should go under history?)---&gt;

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Italian alphabet}}
The Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use of the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean "former(ly)" as in: ''la mia ex'' ("my ex-girlfriend"), "Ex-Jugoslavia" ("Former Yugoslavia"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.&lt;ref name="Clivio"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.
* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perché'' "why, because". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azióne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''tè'' "tea". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''gioventù'' "youth". Unlike {{angle bracket|é}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andrò''), making {{angle bracket|ó}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''prìncipi'' "princes" and ''princìpi'' "principles", or ''àncora'' "anchor" and ''ancóra'' "still''/''yet". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''è'' "is", ''e'' "and").
* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' "to have") from ''o'' ("or"), ''ai'' ("to the"), ''a'' ("to"), ''anno'' ("year"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/oˈtɛl/}} and {{IPA|/ˈɔverkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[ɡ]}}: ''traggo'' "I pull" ← Lat. {{smallcaps|trahō}}.)
* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzanˈdzaːra/}} "mosquito" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/natˈtsjoːne/}} "nation". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.
* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|tʃ}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/ɡ/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|dʒ}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)
* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:

:Note: {{angle bracket|h}} is [[silent letter|silent]] in the digraphs ''[[ch (digraph)|{{angle bracket|ch}}]]'', ''[[gh (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gh}}]]''; and {{angle bracket|i}} is silent in the digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}} unless the {{angle bracket|i}} is stressed. For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/ˈtʃaː.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/ˈtʃɛː.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/ˌfar.maˈtʃiː.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/ˌfar.maˈtʃiː.e/}}.
&lt;!--
* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|ɲ}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|ʎ}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' ("glycerin"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|ñ}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|ʃ}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.
* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) — compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,&lt;ref&gt;E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia – cultural diversity and biological unity, "Science", vol. 291, pp. 2165–2167.&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.

=== Common variations ===
Some variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.
* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' "for". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read "per" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' ("for you") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perché'' ("why, because") to ''xché'' or ''xké''; ''sapere'' ("to know") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.
* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a "pseudo-nazi". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#"K" replacing "C"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.
* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' "not"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' "anyway, however"; ''cm'' for ''come'' "how, like, as"; ''d'' for ''di'' "of"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' "I am, they are"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' "I must, I have to" or for ''dove'' "where"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' "you are"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' "tomorrow".
* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' instead of ''perché''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[È]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere È|several ways]] of producing the uppercase È on a computer.

{{Main|Italian phonology}}
{{IPA notice|lang=it}}

=== Vowels ===
Italian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: "a, e, i, o, u". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/ɔ/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard "perché" {{IPA|[perˈke]}} (why, because) and "senti" {{IPA|[ˈsɛnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[perˈkɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ˈsenti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.
These are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/ˈpeska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/ˈpɛska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/ˈbotte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/ˈbɔtte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).

In general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.

The unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[ˈbwɔːno]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[ˈjɛːri]}}.

[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like "contin''uia''mo" ("we continue"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | coauthors=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile diphthongs ===
Many Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bontà'' 'goodness'.

So Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both "fire" and "optical focus"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' ("focal") the "o" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed "e" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' ("play", "game"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means "to play (a game)". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.

Note: Unlike in standard English, {{IPA|ŋ}} is ''not'' a phoneme in standard Italian; instead, when preceding a velar ({{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) {{IPA|[ŋ]}} appears as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/n/}}. More generally, nasals assimilate to the point of articulation of whatever consonant they precede. --&gt;

Italian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by [[Consonant length|length]] and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, which are always geminate when between vowels, and {{IPA|/z/}}, which is always single.
Geminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. There is only one vibrant phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in unstressed position whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy ([[Parma]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[South Tyrol]]) may pronounce {{IPA|/r/}} as {{IPA|[ʀ]}}, {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, or {{IPA|[ʋ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Canepari |first= Luciano |title= Il MªPI – Manuale di pronuncia italiana |edition= second |date=January 1999 |publisher= Zanichelli |location= Bologna |isbn= 88-08-24624-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of special interest to the linguistic study of [[Regional Italian]] is the ''[[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]'', or "Tuscan Throat", the weakening or [[lenition]] of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} in the [[Tuscan language]].

The [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/ʒ/}} is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, ''garage'' {{IPA|[ɡaˈraːʒ]}}. Phonetic {{IPA|[ʒ]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/dʒ/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[ˈdʒɛnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[laˈʒɛnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[raˈʒoːne]}} 'reason'.

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Italian grammar}}
{{See also|Italian verbs}}

Italian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.

There are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|umarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim, purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.

Nouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).

Like in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives "buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.&lt;ref name="Clivio" /&gt; The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.

There are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/ɲ/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt',  ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.

There are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of "to be" or "to have" followed by a [[past participle]]. "To have" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive ("Ha detto", "ha fatto": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while "to be" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs ("È andato", "è stato": he/she has gone, he/she has been). "To be" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive ("Ê detto", "è fatto": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.

===Conversation===
Note: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form.

The '''Message Understanding Conferences''' ('''MUC''') were initiated and financed by [[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) to encourage
the development of new and better methods of [[information extraction]]. The character of this competition—many concurrent research teams competing against one another—required the development of standards
for evaluation, e.g. the adoption of metrics like [[precision and recall]].

== Topics and exercises ==
Only for the first conference (MUC-1) could the participant choose the output format for the extracted
information. From the second conference the output format, by which the participants'
systems would be evaluated, was prescribed. For each topic fields were given, which had to be
filled with information
from the text. Typical fields were, for example, the cause, the agent, the time and place of an event,
the consequences etc. The number of fields increased from conference to conference.

At the sixth conference (MUC-6) the task of recognition of [[named entity recognition|named entities]] and [[coreference]] was added.
For named entity all phrases in the text were supposed to be marked as person, location, organization,
time or quantity.

The topics and text sources, which were processed, show a continuous move from military to civil themes, which mirrored
the change in business interest in [[information extraction]] taking place at the time.

'''Nakkheeran Gopal''' (born 10 April 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nakkheeran.in/Users/frmAbout.aspx|title=About Us|author=|date=|work=Nakkheeran.in|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a veteran journalist from [[Tamil Nadu]], India. He is the editor and publisher of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] political investigative journal ''[[Nakkeeran (magazine)|Nakkheeran]]''.

==Early life==
He completed his school education at Municipal School of [[Aruppukkottai]] and SBK Higher Secondary School. After clearing pre-university course at [[Devanga Arts College]], he graduated as Bachelor of Commerce from [[Saiva Bhanu Kshatriya College]] in 1977. Apart from academics, he was part of his college hockey team and also involved in art works that could be considered as one of the early signs of a contemporary layout artist and editor.

Post-degree, Rajagopal's father wanted him to be employed in a bank. Rather being idle waiting for a bank profession, Gopal worked in a provisional store much to his father’s displeasure. In 1978, his relative promised him of a job in then Madras however that could not be fulfilled later but eyeing, which Rajagopal had moved into capital city initially.

In 1983, Rajagopal and his friend jointly started a rubber firm investing around 3000 rupees. Things were not proceeding well from the beginning. Thought exhausted they could manage with just one meal daily. At times, they might even need to cycle all around the city. He turned ill and had returned to his native. He abstained from work for four months during recovery but improved his artistic skills meantime. His friends and neighbours suggested him to seek a relevant job that would display his splendid artworks.

In 1985, Rajagopal was rightly identified by Valampuri John, the editor of ''Thai'' magazine run by the then Chief Minister [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. He gained much knowledge on layout work supported by the encouraging editor. He also got exposed to production work during his venture in ''Thiraichuvai''. However, Rajagopal had learnt the success story when he acted as a layout director in ''[[Tharasu]]'' magazine. The readers loved the wrapper layout work that sensibly portrayed the message. At this stage, he opted to move out of Tharasu due to various conflicts.

==Founder of ''Nakkheeran'' magazine==
Rajagopal, with a sum of four thousand rupees, aggressively decided to start his own political investigative weekly magazine in 1988. He loved the epic title ''Nakkheeran'' but it was possessed by a politician named K. Subbu. When approached, K. Subbu gave away the title that led to the evolution of ''Nakkheeran'', the weekly Tamil magazine. The material suppliers offered fund for 4–10 weeks positively. The office was set up in a small room at Kilpauk on the banks of river Cooum. The first issue of ''Nakkheeran'' came out on 20 April 1988.

==Achievements==
The editor of Nakkheeran Rajagopal (widely identified as Nakkheeran Gopal) locked horns with the state government of Tamil Nadu in Supreme Court of India to receive a landmark judgement in favour of press independence on 7 October 1994. This judgement was unanimously appreciated by global media, details below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/r-rajagopal-v-state-of-t-n/|title=R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N. - Global Freedom of Expression|author=|date=|work=Columbia.edu|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3292/en/india:-rajagopal-and-another-v.-state-of-tamil-nadu|title=India: Rajagopal and Another v. State of Tamil Nadu · Article 19|author=|date=|work=Article19.org|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an act of bravery, ''Nakkheeran'' is the first ever magazine to interview and expose a portrait of South India’s forest brigand [[Veerappan]]. The editor and his team effectively acted as an emissary between Veerappan and state governments to carry out a successful mission in rescuing thespian Rajkumar that calmed down the insecure atmosphere prevailed between two states since abduction in 2000.  Earlier, Gopal had been successful in also rescuing eight forest guards kidnapped by Veerappan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/apr/19gopal.htm|title=When Veerappan captured Dr Rajkumar|author=|date=|work=Rediff.com|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hindu2&gt;{{cite news|last=Correspondent|first=Legal|title="Nakkheeran" Gopal moves SC to squash summons|url=http://hindu.com/2002/06/06/stories/2002060603481300.htm|access-date=27 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu online edition, 6 June 2002|date=6 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==POTA drama==
In 2003, he was arrested on charges of possession of an unlicensed revolver with ammunition.

After eight months of imprisonment, Gopal was ordered to be set free on bail by a division bench of the Madras High Court while allowing a habeas corpus petition filed by his brother. Emerging out of the prison, Gopal said his obtaining the bail was the 'first blow' to the "autocratic rule" of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa" This victory is Nakeeran's first step. Let the government file any number of false cases, we will emerge victorious," he said in brief remarks as he was given a rousing reception by magazine staff and others in front of the prison complex. The high court had faulted the police for not providing any reasons for his arrest under IPC and Pota. Gopal was first arrested in April this year in connection with the murder of a police informant, allegedly by forest brigand Veerappan, and was subsequently charged under Pota for alleged possession of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1718/17181300.htm A tough bargain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1719/17190220.htm A mission on hold]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1723/17230040.htm One hundred days of torment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/10/20/stories/2004102007931200.htm|title=Veerappan as `Robin Hood'|first=By Suresh|last=Nambath|date=19 October 2004|publisher=|pages=12|access-date=8 March 2017|via=The Hindu (old)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehinduimages.com/hindu/photoDetail.do?photoId=2098414 Nakkheeran Gopal coming out of the Central jail in Chennai on December 20, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/21/stories/2005092108070400.htm|title=Charge sheet submitted in Nakkeeran Gopal case|first=Special|last=Correspondent|date=20 September 2005|publisher=|pages=04|access-date=8 March 2017|via=The Hindu (old)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/gopal-released-from-prison_137662.html|title=Gopal released from prison|author=|date=20 December 2003|work=India.com|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
Nakkeeran Gopal penned a series called "Challenge" (late 1990s) and Yutham (late 2000s) in his own ''Nakkheeran'' magazine. Later, the consolidations were released as a book. "Challenge" describes the agony put forth by Jayalalithaa between 1991 and 1996 whereas his Yutham (elaborated in four parts) briefs how his team tackled the distress caused by 2001-06 TN Govt.{{Citation needed|reason=No reference to the works can be seen|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2239">An urban district named '''Neustadt''' exists in many cities in Germany and other countries wherein the administrative language of which was German for centuries.

"Neustadt" means "new town", but very often this district is not really new. 
[[File:Praha, Nove Mesto - Novomestska radnice III.jpg|thumb|City hall of Prague's Nové Město]]

== High Middle Ages ==

In lots of places already the founders, due to political purpose, already in the first decades set a second urban nucleus ("Neustadt") beneath the first one ("Altstadt"). Examples are [[Bielefeld]] in [[Westphalia]] and Elbing in the territory of the [[Teutonic Order]] (nowadays [[Elbląg]] in [[Poland]]). In Bielefeld, the ''Altstadt'' concentrated on trade, the ''Neustadt'' concentrated on logistics for ruler and government of the [[County of Ravensberg]], that sat on Sparrenburg Castle above the town.
In [[Wrocław]], [[Silesia]], the ''Neustadt'' was the German foundation beneath originally Polish ''Altstadt''.

== Late Middle Ages ==

In some places the "Neustadt" was a late medieval enlargement, sometimes consequence of a growth of population, sometimes of modernized fortifications.

[[Prague]], with the foundation of the [[New Town, Prague|Nové Město (Neustadt)]] by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1348, became one of the first widespread cities north of the Alps. Nevertheless, in mediaveal tradition it became a separate municipality, the fourth one in Prague.
The Neustadt in [[Bremen]] (without separate institutions) was built in the 17th century in order to keep distance between the new city wall (and possible besiegers) and the city's harbour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">'''Oost-Veluws''' (East Veluws) is one of the main dialects of [[Veluws]] and is therefore related to [[West-Veluws]] and [[Sallaans]]. It is spoken in the Dutch province [[Gelderland]]. However, it is quite rare to come across a native speaker of "Oost-Veluws", as few people actually still speak this dialect.

==Delimitation of Oost-Veluws==

Oost-Veluws is spoken in places such as the municipalities [[Elburg]] en [[Oldebroek]], [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]], [[Vaassen]], [[Apeldoorn]] en [[Dieren]]. The villages Elspeet, Uddel en Kootwijk in the middle of the Veluwe belong to West-Veluws.&lt;ref&gt;http://taal.phileon.nl/kaart/nedersaksisch.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] to Sallaans is problematic to the point that some linguists prefer to make a division between Veluws (consisting of West-Veluws and some Oost-Veluws places as Elburg and Oldebroek) and Sallaans (consisting of Sallaans and the rest of the Oost-Veluws region).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/weij005nede01/weij005nede01ill45.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences to other dialect groups ==

=== Differences to West-Veluws ===

Most villages of the area called [[Veluwe]] lie on its borders, that is, not in the middle of this sandy woodland. The actual Veluwe is a very sparsely populated area that was rather inaccessible in earlier days. Therefore, it is not surprising that two very important [[isogloss]]es have come to lie within the Veluwe.

The first isogloss is the border between ''old'' and ''olt'' on the Eastern side and the [[L-vocalization|vocalization of ''l'']] as in ''oud'' or ''out'' in the West. The retaining of ''ol'' is typical for [[Low German]], while its replacement by ''ou'' is characteristic for [[Low Franconian languages|Low Frankish]].

The second isogloss pertains to the [[plural]] [[inflection]] of [[verb]]s. In most West Low German dialects, the plural inflection for all person forms is ''t'': ''wiele warkt, ule warkt, zie warkt'' - 'we work, you work, they work'. West-Veluws has a unified plural inflection as well, but on ''-en'' as in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. But in the South and East of the Veluwe, ''-t'' is restricted to the second and third person plural, while the first person takes ''-en''. In the variety of Apeldoorn, for example, it is ''wiele warken, ule warkt, zie warkt''.

There are also some lexical differences. For example, Oost-Veluws has ''ledder'' 'ladder', while in West-Veluws the form ''leer'' is used which is probably a loan from 17th century [[Hollandic]]. This process during which characteristics of Hollandic were adopted in places at the shore of the [[Zuiderzee]], while the [[IJssel]] region retained the Low German forms holds also for the two isoglosses cited above.

===Differences to Achterhoeks===

But the intensive influence of Hollandic can be observed in Oost-Veluws as well as can be seen when comparing it to [[Achterhoeks]] dialect which lies in the East of the Veluwe. E.g. Achterhoeks ''good'', ''beer'', while Dutch and Veluws ''goed'', ''bier''. [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] long ''ô'' as in ''*grônaz'' 'green'' becomes ''uu'', thus ''gruun'', in comparison to Achterhoeks ''greun''. Here, Oost-Veluws patterns with Sallaans.

Dutch ''ui'' usually corresponds to Oost-Veluws ''uu'', while (eastern) Achterhoeks has ''oe''. In all of Sallaans and western Achterhoeks (as in Zutphens), [[lexical diffusion]] takes place, and words like ''huus''/''huis'' 'house' and ''moes''/''muis'' 'mouse' can both be heard.

[[File:I Own You school sign.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A message from an "owning" hacker.]]
'''Owned''' is a  [[slang word]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/an.2006.47.1.62.2|title=Society For Linguistic Anthropology newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swin.edu.au/sbs/ajets/journal/V3N2/pdf/V3N2-2-Blashki.pdf|format=PDF|title=Australian Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; that originated among 1990s [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], where it referred to "[[superuser|rooting]]" or gaining administrative control over someone else's [[computer]]. The term eventually spread to gamers, who used the term to mean defeat in gaming. ''Owned'' has now spread beyond computer and gaming contexts and become part of standard slang, and typically follows severe defeat or humiliation, usually in an amusing way or through the dominance of an opposing party.&lt;ref name="jargon"&gt;[http://catb.org/jargon/html/O/owned.html ''Owned''] from the [[Jargon File]], version 4.4.7. Retrieved 2007-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other variations of the word owned include own3d, 0wn3d, [[pwn]]ed, and pooned,&lt;ref name="jargon" /&gt; terms which incorporate elements of [[leet]]speak.

In 2009, [[Newgrounds]] described a security vulnerability in [[ActiveX]] as leaving [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows 2003 Server]] users open to a "Browse-And-Get-Owned" attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218400787&amp;subSection=Vulnerabilities+and+threats Tom Fulp, "Microsoft Warns Of 'Browse-And-Get-Owned' Attack", ''InformationWeek'', July 7, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The term's original usage was close to that of the traditional meaning of the word ''own'' – for instance, "I owned the network at MIT" indicated that the speaker had cracked the servers and had the same root-level privileges that the legitimate owner of the servers had. Some more examples are "I owned you" and "You got owned". ''Owned,or Ownded'' a later variant, became more common in the late 1990s, as did the more abstract usage referring to any compromised security mechanism.  By 1997, ''Owned'' was regularly used in website defacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1997/11/14/spice/|title=Spice Girls website defacement|publisher=attrition.org|date=14 Nov 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127183441/http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1997/11/14/spice/|archivedate=2005-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1997/12/08/www.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo website defacement|publisher=attrition.org|date=8 December 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220104043/http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1997/12/08/www.yahoo.com/|archivedate=20 February 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in gaming ==
The term "owned" subsequently spread to gaming circles, where it was used to refer to defeat in a game. For example, if a player makes a particularly impressive kill shot or wins a match by an appreciable margin in a [[multiplayer video game]], it is not uncommon for him or her to say ''owned'' to the loser(s), as a manifestation of victory, a taunt, or provocation. ''Ownage'' has become a modern equivalent to "[[turkey shoot]]"; applicable when an experienced faction predictably annihilates a beginner or disadvantaged faction. In slang form, ''owned'' can be an adjective (He is owned), ''owning'' can be a verb (He is totally owning that guy.), and ''ownage'' can be a noun.

The phrase "own" can not only refer to defeating one particular player or team, but it can also be used to indicate total domination of the competition.  The racing video game ''[[Need for Speed: Nitro]]'' follows this definition by awarding a special bonus called "Own it", in which a player earns points for every second he/she spends in first place, while also expressing his/her dominance visually to other opponents by painting every portion of the course where he/she leads with his/her tag and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NITRO Track Guide - Singapore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4unrM9WGYlE |website=YouTube |publisher=Need for Speed |date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/04/need-for-speed-nitro-review-2|title = Need for Speed Nitro Review|author = Bozon, Mark|accessdate = 2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">The '''Particle Transfer Roller''', often abbreviated to '''PTR''', is a device for cleaning [[film stock|motion picture film]]. It consists of a cylindrical roller coated with [[ethyl carbamate|urethane]], over which the surface of the film passes.

==History==
The Particle Transfer Roller was developed by [[Eastman Kodak]] and launched in 1989. It was intended to replace the [[organic solvent]]s that were the main method of film cleaning before that point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmshooting.com/scripts/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=13502&lt;/ref&gt; Although their effectiveness is not usually considered sufficient for [[film laboratory|lab]] operations, where [[ultrasonic film cleaner|ultrasonic cleaning]] with a solvent solution remains the standard, the PTR sold widely for use in projection booths and transfer houses.

==Use==
At least two PTRs are needed in the film path - one for the base side and one for the emulsion side - though four are frequently used. A set of PTRs is frequently placed in the film paths of [[movie projector|projectors]], [[telecine]] machines, [[Motion picture film scanner|scanners]] and [[Optical printer|printers]] in order to remove dust and contaminants from the surface of the film before projection, transfer or duplication. PTRs are also used in some dedicated film cleaning machines, or mounted between rewind heads and used for manual cleaning. The contaminants are lifted from the film and adhere to the roller as the film passes in contact with it. The rollers themselves are then cleaned, usually in soapy water, and dried before the next use.

'''Paulo Leminski Filho''' (August 24, 1944 – June 7, 1989) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, translator, literary critic, biographer, teacher and [[judo]]ka. He was famous for his avant-garde [[concrete poetry|concrete poems]] and ''[[haiku]]''.

==Biography==
Leminski was born in [[Curitiba]], in the Brazilian state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], in 1944. His father, Paulo Leminski II, was of [[Poles|Polish]] descent, and his mother, Áurea Pereira Mendes, was of [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] descent. In 1958, Leminski was sent to the [[Mosteiro de São Bento (São Paulo)|Monastery of Saint Benedict]] in [[São Paulo]], where he stayed throughout the whole year. During the First Congress of Brazilian Experimental Poetry in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Minas Gerais]], he would meet [[Haroldo de Campos]], who would become one of his long-time friends and major influences. In 1961, with only seventeen years old, he would marry Neiva Maria de Sousa, a [[plastic arts|plastic artist]]; their relationship would last for seven years, until they divorced. In 1964 he published his first poems in the magazine ''Invenção'', founded by [[Décio Pignatari]], Haroldo de Campos and his brother [[Augusto de Campos|Augusto]]. In 1965 he became a [[history]] and [[creative writing]] teacher, even though he had never finished college. He was also an expert [[judo]] sensei.

In 1968 he married for the second time, now with also poet [[Alice Ruiz]], and had with her three children: Miguel Ângelo (who died prematurely due to a [[lymphoma]]), Áurea (named after Leminski's mother) and [[Estrela Ruiz Leminski]], who would also become a poet, artist and musician. He moved temporarily to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1969, returning to Curitiba in the following year.

In 1975, his first major work, ''Catatau'', was published. It is an experimental novel, written in [[prose poetry]], dealing with an imaginary visit of philosopher [[René Descartes]] to Brazil alongside [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Prince John Maurice of Nassau]] during the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch invasions of Brazil]] in the 17th century. ''Catatau'' would draw the attention of some of the most important cultural personalities of the time, such as [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Tom Zé]] and [[Moraes Moreira]]. In the following years he would publish some anthologies of his poems, the most notable ones being ''Distraídos Venceremos'', ''Haitropikais'' (a collection of his ''[[haiku]]'') and ''Caprichos e Relaxos''. His second avant-garde novel, ''Agora É que São Elas'', was published in 1984; however, it was not as well-received as ''Catatau''.

Leminski was a [[Polyglotism|polyglot]]; he could fluently speak [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. He translated into Portuguese works by [[Petronius]], [[John Fante]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Yukio Mishima]]. An enthusiast of the [[culture of Japan]], Leminski would write a biography of famous 17th-century ''haiku'' poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] in 1983. He also authored biographies of [[Leon Trotsky]], [[João da Cruz e Sousa]] and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

In 1988, Leminski divorced Alice Ruiz after a 20-year marriage, with whom he was working in conjunction with in his last poetry book, ''La Vie en close'', that was published posthumously in 1991.

Leminski was a heavy drinker, and died on June 7, 1989, of liver [[cirrhosis]].

'''Peter E. Hook''' (born 1942) is professor emeritus in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130509072643/https://www.lsa.umich.edu/asian/aboutus/emeriti/ci.hookpeter_ci.detail Department of Asian Languages and Cultures] at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="peter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pehook/index.html | title=Homepage | publisher=UMICH | accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

==Academic work==

Hook's academic  interest has been in the linguistic description of languages belonging to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] family in South Asia, and more broadly in their place in Masica's Indo-Turanian linguistic area. At  Michigan, he taught [[Hindi language|Hindi]] at all levels, occasionally other South Asian languages, along with courses in linguistics and South Asian literature for three and a half decades, and published on both Indo-Aryan languages and linguistics.

His chief contributions are ''The Compound Verb in Hindi'' and numerous articles on the compound verb and other syntactic and semantic phenomena in western Indo-Aryan languages and dialects spoken in [[North India]], [[West India]], and [[Pakistan]]: [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]], [[Shina language|Shina]], and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]. After [[Jules Bloch]] in his ''La Formation de la Langue Marathe'',&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Jules (1914). ''La Formation de le Langue Marathe.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hook was the first to realize that Kashmiri, not unlike [[German language|German]], has [[V2 word order]].&lt;ref&gt;Hook (1976): Is Kashmiri an SVO language? ''Indian Linguistics'' 37: 133-142.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent publications have refined the notion of South Asia as a [[linguistic area]] &lt;ref&gt;See Hook (1987): Linguistic Areas: Getting at the Grain of History in ''Festschrift for Henry Hoenigswald'', George Cardona and Norman H. Zide, Eds. Pp. 155-68.&lt;/ref&gt; as first adumbrated by [[Murray Emeneau]] &lt;ref&gt;Emeneau, M. (1956). India as a Linguistic Area. ''Language'' 32: 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and - with the addition of Central Asia and Eastern Asia - expanded by [[Colin Masica]].&lt;ref&gt;Masica, Colin P. (1976).

'''Post in ground''' construction, also called '''earthfast'''&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0). Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hole-set posts''', is a type of construction in which vertical, roof-bearing timbers, called [[Post (structural)|posts]], are in direct contact with the ground. They may be placed into excavated post holes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stavkirke.org&lt;/ref&gt; driven into the ground, or on sills which are set on the ground without a foundation. Earthfast construction is common from the [[Neolithic architecture|Neolithic period]] to the present and is used worldwide. Post-in-the-ground construction is sometimes called an "impermanent" form such as for houses which are expected to last a decade or two before a better quality structure can be built.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Cary, Norman F. Barka, William M. Kelso, Garry Wheller Stone, and [[Dell Upton]]. "Impermanent Architecture in the Southern American Colonies." ''Material Life in America'', 1600-1860, edited by Robert Blair St. George, 113-158. Boston: Northern University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post in ground construction can also include ''sill on grade'', [[wood-lined cellar]]s, and [[pit house]]s. Most pre-historic and medieval wooden dwellings were built post in ground worldwide.

==History==
This type of construction is often believed to be an intermediate form between a palisade construction and a stave construction. Because the [[posthole]]s are easily detected in archaeological surveys, they can be differentiated from the other two.

Post-in-ground was one of the timber construction methods used for French colonial structures in [[New France]] specifically called poteaux-en-terre.

The Japanese also used earthfast construction they call Hottate-bashira (literally "embedded pillars")&lt;ref&gt;Gina Lee Barnes. Yamato: archaeology of the first Japanese state. googlebooks?id=S-sDAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; until the eighteenth century.

Some places the people still use post in ground construction such as the [[Toguna]] shelter of the [[Dogon people]] in Africa.

==Poteaux-en-terre==

In the historical region of [[New France]] ''poteaux-en-terre'' was a historic style of earthfast [[timber framing]]. This method is very similar to [[poteaux-sur-sol]] but for the ''boulin'' (hewn posts) planted in the ground rather than landing on a [[sill plate]]. The spaces between the boulin were filled with [[bousillage]] (reinforced mud) or [[pierrotage]] (stones and mud).

'''Robert T. Craig''' is a [[Communication theory|communication theorist]] from the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] who received his BA in Speech at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]], and his MA and PhD in communication from [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref name="vita"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Robert|last=Craig|title=Robert Craig Vita|publisher=University of Colorado|date=Dec 24, 2011|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Vitae.pdf|accessdate=Feb 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612062414/http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Vitae.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Craig|2006}} Craig was on the 1988 founding board of the journal "Research on Language and Social Interaction,"&lt;ref name="language editors"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1988|title=Editorial Board|journal=[http://rolsi.lboro.ac.uk/ Research on Language and Social Interaction]|volume=22|issue=1|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|format=PDF|doi=10.1080/0835181880938929|accessdate= Feb 5, 2011|url=http://rolsi.lboro.ac.uk/1stROLSIedboard1988.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he continues to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ROLSI Editorial Board|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|year=2011|url= http://rolsi.lboro.ac.uk/board.html|format=http|accessdate=Feb 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ROLSI Brief history|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|year=2011|url= http://rolsi.lboro.ac.uk/history.html|format=http|accessdate=Feb 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1991 to 1993 Craig was the founding editor of the [[International Communication Association]] journal "Communication Theory" which has been in continuous publication since 1991.&lt;ref name="vita" /&gt; He is currently the editor for the [[International Communication Association|ICA]] Handbook series.&lt;ref name="vita" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Communication Association Handbook series|publisher =[[International Communication Association]]|year=2011|url= http://www.icahdq.org/publications/commhandbooks.asp|accessdate=Feb 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 Craig was elected as a Lifetime Fellow for the International Communication Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Communication Association Fellows|publisher =[[International Communication Association]]|year=2010|url= http://www.icahdq.org/leadership/fellows.asp|format=http|accessdate=Jan 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization he was president for in 2004–2005.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Communication Association past presidents|publisher =[[International Communication Association]]|year=2010|url= http://www.icahdq.org/leadership/pastpresidents.asp|format=http|accessdate=Jan 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig's work "[[Communication Theory as a Field]]"{{sfn|Craig|1999}} received the Best Article Award from the [[International Communication Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Communication Association Awards|publisher=[[International Communication Association]]|year=2003|url=http://www.icahdq.org/publicpdf/awards_web.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=Jan 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164948/http://www.icahdq.org/publicpdf/awards_web.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Golden Anniversary Monograph Award from the [[National Communication Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=National Communication Association Awards|publisher =[[National Communication Association]]|year=2001|url= http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/Images/NCAawards2001.pdf|accessdate=Jan 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That work has since been translated into French {{sfn|Craig|2009}} and Russian.&lt;ref name="vita" /&gt;  The theory presented in "Communication Theory as a Field" has become the basis of the book "Theorizing Communication" which Craig co-edited with Heidi Muller,{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}} as well as being adopted by several other communication theory textbooks as a new framework for understanding the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}}

== Grounded practical theory ==
In 1995 Robert T. Craig and Karen Tracy published "Grounded Practical Theory: The case of Intellectual Discussion"!{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995}} This was an attempt by Craig and Tracy to create a methodological model using [[discourse analysis]] which will "guide the development and assessment of [[normative]] theories."{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250}} Craig and Tracy argue that the communication discipline has been dominated by scientific theory which is concerned with what ''is,'' while [[Normative|normative theories]] are centrally concerned with ''what ought to be.''{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=249}} This neglect of normative theories "limits the practical usefulness of communication studies."{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=249}}

Grounded practical theory (GPT) is a [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] approach based on Craig's (1989) notion of communication as a practical, rather than [[Empirical|scientific]], discipline.{{sfn|Craig|1989}}{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250-253}} The goal of communication as a practical discipline is to develop [[Normative|normative theories]] to guide practice.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250, 264-265}} Based on this argument, GPT was developed as a methodologically grounded means of theorizing communication practices.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250,253, 264}} GPT involves (1) reconstructing communicative practices, (2) redescribing those practices in less context-specific terms, and (3) identifying implicit principles which guide the practice. Generally a GPT study begins by looking for troubles or dilemmas endemic to situated interaction and observable in discourse. This constitutes the “problem level”{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} and the “grounded” component of the GPT approach.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=266}} Then, problems are reconstructed concretely and abstractly and matched with the techniques which participants employ for dealing with those problems. This constitutes the “technical level”{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} and is an important part of the theorizing process. Finally, the ideals and standards shaping the practice and how to manage its problems and techniques constitute the “philosophical level.”{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} This situates the practice both locally and generally for the purpose of normative critique. A methodological approach which is explicitly guided by GPT is action implicative discourse analysis (AIDA).{{sfn|Tracy|2004}}{{sfn|Tracy|2007}}{{sfn|Tracy|Craig|2010}}

==''Communication Theory as a Field''==
{{main|Communication Theory as a Field}}
In 1999 Craig wrote a landmark article{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}} "Communication Theory as a Field"{{sfn|Craig|1999}} which expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication.{{sfn|Donsback|2006}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}{{sfn|Penman|2000}}{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004}}{{sfn|Lindlof|Taylor|2002}}{{sfn|D'Angelo|2002}}{{sfn|Jimenez|Guillem|2009}} At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks.{{sfn|Anderson|1996|pp=200-201}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120}}  This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} In this article Craig "proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities."{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}} To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on [[communication theory]] as a practical discipline and shows how "various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication."{{sfn|Craig|2006|pp=13}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=6, 76}}  In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the "practical implications of communication theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001}} In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of Communication Theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-146}}

Craig proposes that these seven suggested traditions of communication theory have emerged through research into communication, and each one has their own way of understanding communication.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-134}}  These seven traditions are:
#[[Rhetoric]]al: views communication as the practical art of discourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-136}}
#[[Semiotic]]: views communication as the mediation by signs.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=136-138}}
#[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]]: communication is the experience of dialogue with others.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=138-140}}
#[[cybernetics|Cybernetic]]: communication is the flow of information.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=141-142}}
#[[Social psychology (sociology)|Socio-psychological]]: communication is the interaction of individuals.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=142-144}}
#[[sociocultural|Socio-cultural]]: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=144-146}}
#[[Critical theory|Critical]]: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=146-149}}

These proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed into conversation with each other on a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110805152813/http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Bibliography/Craig%20(1999)/tables.html a table]{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=133-134}} first to show how each tradition's different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces,{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,133}} and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,134}}

Craig concluded this article with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse. {{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149}} Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149,151}} A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as "connectedness to others", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as "embodied performance", an economic tradition theorizing communication as "exchange", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a "nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence." {{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=151}}

'''Roger Fletcher Gibson Jr.''' (February 21, 1944 – September 30, 2015) was an American philosopher specializing in epistemology and the philosophy of language. He was best known as a leading exponent of the philosophy of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]].

== Biography ==

Gibson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Roger Fletcher Gibson Sr. and Virginia Irene Melton. He spent his formative years moving throughout the country, eventually coming to live with his maternal grandparents about whom he would later remark were the most influential people in his life. Gibson joined the United States Marine Corps out of high school and volunteered for duty in Vietnam. He served in Saigon from October 1965 to October 1966. He considered his military service one of his greatest achievements.

Gibson embarked upon the pursuit of philosophy as an academic career in 1967 upon the completion of his military service. He was ready to resume his education that year, having served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] immediately after high school, between 1962 and 1966, attached for part of that time as aide to [[William Childs Westmoreland|General Westmoreland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://philosophy.artsci.wustl.edu/articles/637 | title = Roger F. Gibson Jr. | publisher = Washington University in St. Louis | accessdate = 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the height of the [[Vietnam War]]. He enrolled in Northeast Missouri State College, currently [[Truman State University]], where he graduated in 1971 with a B.A. in philosophy.

Encouraged by his undergraduate philosophy professors, Henry Smits and Kay Blair, both holding doctorates from the [[University of Missouri]], he applied to their graduate program in philosophy and was admitted in the fall of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://philosophy.missouri.edu/alumnialumnae | title = Roger F. Gibson Jr. | publisher = University of Missouri | accessdate = 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a budding affinity for analytic philosophy while at the University of Missouri, receiving an M.A. in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977. His experience there was shaped by Arthur Berndtson, Donald Oliver, and John Kultgen, among others, the latter also directing his dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://philosophy.missouri.edu/alumnialumnae | title = Roger F. Gibson Jr. | publisher = University of Missouri | accessdate = 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson served the discipline both as a leader and as a scholar. His first notable leadership role was as President of the Central States Philosophical Association in 1983–1984. His scholarly initiatives attracted attention from the outset, earning him grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] in 1984–1985 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=FB-22459-84 | title = Grant (#FB-22459-84) for the study of Willard Van Orman Quine | publisher = National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate = 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=FT-31150-88 | title = Grant (#FT-31150-88) for the study of Donald Davidson | publisher = National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate = 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic career flourished at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where he began teaching in 1985. He served as the Chair of the Department of Philosophy there for a decade between 1989 and 1999. His many contributions to the department included spearheading the creation of the school's Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) Program in 1993, playing a prominent role in securing grants for that purpose from the [[James S. McDonnell Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://pnp.artsci.wustl.edu/about | title = Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) Program | publisher = Washington University in St. Louis | accessdate = 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson's formal areas of expertise were epistemology and the philosophy of language, with further competence in the philosophy of science. While publishing extensively in these areas, his overall engagement with philosophy was broad and deep enough for publication in other specialties as well, including those as diverse as logic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = Logic as a Core Curriculum Subject: Its Case as an Alternative to Mathematics | journal = Journal of Philosophy of Education | volume = 20:1 | date = July 1986 | pages = 21–37 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9752.1986.tb00107.x | issn = 1467-9752}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = On an Inconsistency in Thomson's Abortion Argument | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 46:1 | date = July 1984 | pages = 131–139 | doi = 10.1007/BF00353495 | issn = 0031-8116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = Corporations, Persons, and Moral Responsibility | journal = Journal of Thought | volume = 21:2 | date = Summer 1986 | pages = 17–26 | issn = 0022-5231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his works, even on the rare occasion he turned to ethics, tend to revolve around the philosophy of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = Flanagan on Quinean Ethics | journal = Ethics: An International Journal of Social, Political, and Legal Philosophy | volume = 98:3 | date = April 1988 | pages = 534–540 | doi = 10.1086/292970 | issn = 0014-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that do are all well-received (as are the few that do not), earning him a reputation as one of the world's leading exponents of Quine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Wrenn | editor-first = Chase B. | title = Naturalism, Reference, and Ontology: Essays in Honor of Roger F. Gibson | location = New York | publisher = Peter Lang | date = 2008 | pages = 6 | isbn = 978-1-4331-0229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That reputation is the culmination of an early and steadfast interest in Quine. His master's thesis (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type = M.A. | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = Quinean Analysis | publisher = University of Missouri-Columbia | date = 1973 | oclc = 9144809 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and doctoral dissertation (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type = Ph.D. | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = The Logical Structure of Quine's Philosophy | publisher = University of Missouri-Columbia | date = 1977 | oclc = 3961078 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are both on Quine. His persistent appeals to the Harvard philosopher for permission to sit in on his classes at Harvard University, while himself still enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Missouri, are something of an academic legend, related by Quine himself both in his autobiography, ''The Time of My Life: An Autobiography'' (1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] | first = W. V. | title = The Time of My Life: An Autobiography | location = Cambridge | publisher = MIT Press | date = 1985 | pages = 422 | isbn = 978-0-2621-7003-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his foreword to Gibson's first book, ''The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay | location = Tampa | publisher = University Presses of Florida | date = 1982 | pages = xi | isbn = 978-0-8130-0707-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permission granted paved the way for some of the most influential secondary literature on Quine, including two monographs, three edited volumes, and numerous articles. Gibson's two monographs — ''The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay'' (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay | location = Tampa | publisher = University Presses of Florida | date = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-8130-0707-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Enlightened Empiricism: An Examination of W. V. Quine's Theory of Knowledge'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = Roger F. Jr. | title = Enlightened Empiricism: An Examination of W. V. Quine's Theory of Knowledge | location = Tampa | publisher = University Presses of Florida | date = 1988 | isbn = 978-0-8130-0886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; — are held in especially high regard.

His personal output on Quine was complemented by his ability to bring out the same in others. Attesting to his dedication to the enrichment of Quine studies, he organized, together with Robert B. Barrett Jr., a conference (April 9–13, 1988) bringing together at Washington University in St. Louis the world's foremost authorities on the subject, including Quine himself, as well as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], [[Susan Haack]], [[Gilbert Harman]], [[Jaakko Hintikka]], [[Jerrold Katz]], [[Barry Stroud]], and Joseph S. Ullian. The proceedings were published in 1990 as ''Perspectives on Quine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Barrett | editor-first1 = Robert B.

A festschrift organized in his honor in 2008 brought together eminent analytic philosophers from around the world: Robert B. Barrett Jr.; Lars Bergström; Richard Creath; David Henderson; Terence Horgan; Ernest Lepore; Pete Mandik; Alex Orenstein; Kenneth Shockley; J. Robert Thompson; Josefa Toribio; Joseph S.

Gibson died at the age of 71 in Reston, Virginia, after a long battle with Parkinson’s and Parkinson’s dementia.

In [[sociolinguistics]], '''SPEAKING''' or the '''SPEAKING model''', is a model socio-linguistic study (represented as a [[mnemonic]]) developed by [[Dell Hymes]]. Hymes developed this model as part of a new methodology referred to as the [[Ethnography of speaking]]. This model is a tool to assist the identification and labeling of components of interactional linguistics that was driven by his view that, in order to speak a language correctly, one needs not only to learn its vocabulary and grammar, but also the context in which words are used. In essence, the learning the components of the SPEAKING model is essential for [[Linguistic competence]].

To facilitate the application of his representation, Hymes constructed the [[acronym]], '''''S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G''''' (for ''setting and scene, participants, ends, acts sequence, key, instrumentalities, norms, &amp; genre'') under which he grouped the sixteen components within eight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the categories are simply listed in the order demanded by the mnemonic, not by importance&lt;/ref&gt;

The model had sixteen components that can be applied to many sorts of discourse: message form; message content; setting; scene; speaker/sender; addressor; hearer/receiver/audience; addressee; purposes (outcomes); purposes (goals); key; channels; forms of speech; norms of interaction; norms of interpretation; and genres.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes (1974), p.53-62.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dell hymes.JPG|thumb|Dell Hymes (above) developed the '''SPEAKING''' model for the ethnography of speaking in the 1960s&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Speaking: an Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology|last=Ottenheimer|first=Harriet|publisher=Wadswoth|year=2009|isbn=9781111828752|location=Belmont, CA|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
The '''SPEAKING''' model is used by linguistic anthropologists to analyze speech events (one or more [[Speech act]] involving one more participants) as part of an [[Ethnography]]. This approach can be used to understand relationships and power dynamics within a given [[Speech community]] and provide insight on cultural values.

== Divisions ==

===Setting and Scene===
"Setting refers to the time and place of a [[speech act]] and, in general, to the physical circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Hymes (1974), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; The living room in the grandparents' home might be a setting for a family story. Scene is the "psychological setting" or "cultural definition" of a scene, including characteristics such as range of formality and sense of play or seriousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes (1974), pp.55-56.&lt;/ref&gt; The family story may be told at a reunion celebrating the grandparents' anniversary. At times, the family would be festive and playful; at other times, serious and commemorative.

Setting and scene also refer to implicit rules and expectations surrounding the speech event. For instance, the setting of the speech event determines who should speak and who should not, what type of speech is appropriate ([[Code-switching]]), and when interrupting is acceptable. For instance, speech events in the classroom have specific implicit rules for teachers speaking and students listening, certain words are not viewed as appropriate in the classroom, and interrupting is often met with consequences. Conversely, different implicit rules and expectations apply at social gatherings and work settings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Language: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology|last=Ottenheimer|first=Harriet|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=9781428848849|location=Belmont, CA|pages=129–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scene of the speech event also refers to the location of participants and any physical barriers that may be present. For instance, whether participants are facing one another, what body language they are exhibiting, and whether or not they are separated by a table, chairs, or space in the room. Documentation of the physical setting is especially useful for completing an ethnography of a given community.

===Participants===
Participants include the speaker and the audience. Linguist anthropologists will make distinctions within these categories. The audience may include those to whom the speech act is directed, and those who are not addressed but overhear.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes (1974), pp.54 and 56.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the family reunion, an aunt might tell a story to the young female relatives, but males, although not addressed, might also hear the narrative.

When considering the participants in a speech event, one should consider implicit and explicit rules about who is, can, and should be involved; what expectations are established for the participants; who is speaking and who is being addressed. Certain ideologies are at play regarding participants in speech events. For instance, cultural norms about how child should speak to adults, how ladies should speak around men, how employees should speak to their boss. Each participant in a [[Speech event|speech]] event is operating with specific rules and expectations, which are important for linguistic competence.

===Ends===
The end of the speech event are the purposes, goals, and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes (1974), pp.56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; The aunt may tell a story about the grandmother to entertain the audience, teach the young women, and honor the grandmother. Additionally, the ends of a speech event may differ for those participating. The exampled provided by Harriet Joseph Ottenheimer was that of a tourist seeking directions and a New Yorker providing vague answers, "your goal may be to get information and get to your destination, but their goal is to appear knowledgeable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Differences in the goals and outcomes for speech events can be frequent, especially in classrooms and work spaced. Similarities and differences in the ends of a speech events are important for successful communication and acceptance into a culture or a speech community.

===Act Sequence===
Act sequence refers to the sequence of speech acts that make up the event. The order of speech acts greatly influences of the speech event. For instance the initial speech acts sets the tone for the conversation; beginning a lecture by saying, "Ladies and gentlemen..." sets a different tone than beginning a lecture by saying, "Hello! How is everyone today?"

Act sequence for an event also orients the participants to social cues. Important aspects of act sequence include turn-taking and interrupting. For example, an aunt's story might begin as a response to a toast to the grandmother; the story's plot and development would have a sequence structured by the aunt. Possibly there would be a collaborative interruption during the telling. Finally, the group might applaud the tale and move onto another subject or activity.

===Key===
"Key" refers to the clues that establish the "tone, manner, or spirit" of the speech act. The aunt might imitate the grandmother's voice and gestures in a playful way, or she might address the group in a serious voice emphasizing the sincerity and respect of the praise the story expresses. Generally, different keys are used in different situations, for instance different tones are used at birthday parties and funerals. Intonation in sentences can provide additional meaning; lighter tones communicate humor and friendship, meanwhile monotone speech acts communicate seriousness or a lack of emotion. Similarly, keys can be formal or informal, and can be influenced by word choice. For instance informal keys include the use of contractions (can't instead of cannot), use of slang or profanity, condensed or loose pronunciations (gonna), missing infinitives ("the kids need bathed" versus "the kids need to be bathed), and prepositional endings "what did you do that for?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, the key in a speech act adds a human element to communication and provides valuable information for informing social norms and expectations for the speech event. Proper application of the appropriate key in a speech event is vital for linguistic competence.

===Instrumentalities===
Instrumentalities are the channels used to complete the speech act. These include the method of communication (writing, speaking, signing or signaling), the language, dialect (a mutually intelligible subset of a language) or register (a variety of a language that is used in specific settings).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Speaking: an Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology|last=Ottenheimer|first=Harriet|publisher=Wadswoth|year=2009|isbn=9781111828752|location=Belmont, CA|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hymes described these instrumentalities generally as the Forms and styles of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes (1974), pp.58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the instrumentality of the spoken word is different from the written word; the language spoken is unique to the speech act, as is the dialect. Similarly, the register that is spoken influences the speech event. For example, an aunt might speak in a casual register with many dialect features, but if her niece continues the conversation in a more formal register with careful grammatically "standard" forms the conversation may seem awkward.

===Norms===
Social rules governing the event and the participants' actions and reactions. In a playful story by the aunt, the norms might allow many audience interruptions and collaboration, or possibly those interruptions might be limited to participation by older females. A serious, formal story by the aunt might call for attention to her and no interruptions as norms.

Norms will vary for each [[speech community]]. Examples of questions regarding established norms include: 
* When is it okay to speak?
* Who should listen?
* When is silence preferred?
* How loud is too loud?
* What speed should be used in the conversation?
* What topics are acceptable?

===Genre===
The kind of [[speech act]] or event; for the example used here, the kind of story. The aunt might tell a character anecdote about the grandmother for entertainment, or an [[exemplum]] as moral instruction. Different disciplines develop terms for kinds of speech acts, and speech communities sometimes have their own terms for types.&lt;ref&gt;Anticipating that he might be accused of creating an (English language) "ethnocentric" mnemonic — and, thus, by implication, an (English language) "ethnocentric" theory — Hymes comments that he could have, for instance, generated a French language mnemonic of '''''P-A-R-L-A-N-T''''': namely, ''participants'', ''actes'', ''raison'' (''resultat''), ''locale'', ''agents'' (instrumentalities), ''normes'', ''ton'' (key), ''types'' (genres) (1974, p.62).&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of speech genres include gossip, jokes, and conversations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Rich Points ==
Rich points are instances where there is a disconnect between two speakers in a speech event resulting from differences in perceived implicit rules and expectations. These instances represent a conflict in the SPEAKING model between two people. This difference and the negotiation to reestablish the conversation is referred to as MAR (Mistake, Awareness, Repair)

=== Mistake ===
Mistakes in conversation occur when participants in the conversation are operating with different implicit rules and expectations for the SPEAKING model. Mistakes often results from disagreements about inclusion of participants, mismatched ends, unexpected act sequences, keys or instrumentalities.  In general mistakes and conflicts arise when there is a deviation in the conversation from the norm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some genres, such as gossip, rapid turn-taking and interrupting is not only accepted, but expected. If one participant is not active in this type of speech they may come across as ambivalent to the conversation; this would be an example of a mistake.

=== Awareness ===
Awareness occurs when one or more of the participants recognized the differences in expectations for the conversation. In some cases, this may mean that one speaker recognizes that the other is speaking faster or slower, using act sequences that rely heavily on fast turn-taking or accepted interrupting, speaking in a more formal or informal register, etc. In the instance of gossip, it would be important to recognize if one is not matching the speech pattern.

=== Repair ===
Repair of the conversation occurs when one or more participants in the speech event change one or more of the SPEAKING components in order to ameliorate the mistake. In some instances this may mean that the speaker increases the speed of their speech, participates in rapid turn-taking and interrupting. When repair does not occur the speech event can seem awkward. However, when one learns to repair speech events they can more easily connect with participants in the speech event, building rapport.Speaking through by maintaining grammartical rules for understand correctly.

The speaking model has been applied to understand a variety of communities and situations. Speech events are key to the foundation of culture, thus they are the subject of much analysis.

A '''scenery wagon''', also known as a ''stage wagon'', is a mobile [[platform (theatre)|platform]] that is used to support and transport movable, three-dimensional [[theatrical scenery]] on a [[theater]] [[stage (theatre)|stage]]. In most cases, the scenery is constructed on top of the wagon such that the wagon, and the scenery it supports, forms a single, integrated structure. Heavy duty [[caster]]s are mounted to the underside of the platform so that the entire assembly can be quickly moved onstage or offstage, so as to facilitate rapid scenery changes during live productions. Scenery wagons are built in a wide range of sizes, ranging from less than one square foot up to the size of the playing area of the stage.&lt;ref name="TDaP"/&gt;

Scenery wagons comprise one of the four methods used to move scenery during the course of a theatre performance, the other three being "flying" (suspending) scenery from a [[fly system]], elevating or lowering scenery on a [[stage lift]], or "running" (manually carrying) the scenery.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

==Components==
===Casters===

[[File:Swivel caster.jpg|thumb|A swivel caster.]]

Various caster types are used on scenery wagons. The choice of caster type for any particular wagon depends on a number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, casters are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of casters required for a wagon depends on caster type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight of the wagon and scenery.

[[Caster#Swivel_casters|Swivel casters]] are commonly used on smaller wagons because of the flexible, {{Linktext|omnidirectional}} mobility they offer. As the number of swivel casters attached to a wagon increases, though, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them. Consequently, it may be difficult or impossible to move a wagon that has a large number of swivel casters when the casters are unaligned. As a result, [[Caster#Rigid_casters|rigid casters]] are preferred for larger wagons, which typically require a proportionally higher number of casters.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

[[Air caster]]s are sometimes used in place of rolling casters. These require pressurized air to operate, which produces audible hiss that is undesirable in some situations, and are typically more expensive than rolling casters, but they have the advantage of "locking" the scenery securely in place when depressurized and, like swivel casters, they permit omnidirectional movement.

===Anchoring systems===
To effect a scenery change, a wagon is simply rolled offstage to remove it from the set or rolled onstage to its designated position to add it to the set. In the latter case, the wagon must be immobilized after it has been positioned on the stage so that actors can safely interact with it (e.g., walk, stand, or jump on it) without causing the wagon to move. A number of methods and mechanisms are commonly used to immobilize, or "lock" scenery wagons in place:

====Wedges====
Wooden [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]]s may be forced between the stage and the bottom edge of the wagon perimeter. Ideally, the wedges are driven under the wagon to the extent that the wagon is supported by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of the wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

====Slip bolts====
Slip bolts may be used to hold scenery wagons in position when high lateral strength is required and it is permissible to drill holes in the stage. The bolts are mounted to the wagon base and, when the wagon is in position, the bolts are lowered into their designated, predrilled holes.

====Lift jacks====
A lift jack is fundamentally a [[lever]] that attaches to the scenery wagon platform with a [[hinge]], with a caster mounted to the underside of the lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, the caster serves as a {{Linktext|fulcrum}} to lift the wagon slightly above the stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

Lift jacks may be built into a wagon or onto a wagon's exterior, as circumstances dictate.

====Wagon brakes====
[[File:SceneryWagonBrake.jpg|thumb|right|A push-pull [[toggle clamp]] employed as a heavy-duty wagon brake.]]
A wagon [[brake]] has a handle which, when pushed down, extends a steel rod down and onto the stage. When fully extended, the steel rod actually lifts a section of the wagon slightly off the stage floor. The bottom end of the rod has a threaded cavity that will accept an extension spindle, which in turn can be used to adjust the height of the wagon above the stage. The brake is released by raising its handle, thereby retracting the steel rod away from the stage.

Wagon brakes provide a very fast means of locking and unlocking wagons, but the brakes and stage can be damaged if the [[running crew]] attempts to move a wagon while its brakes are engaged. Damage to the stage can be mitigated by using extension spindles with compliant (e.g., polyurethane) tips. [[Toggle clamp]]s, which are functionally similar to wagon brakes, are sometimes used in lieu of theatrical wagon brakes due to their higher load ratings and more durable construction.

====Hinged foot irons====
Hinged foot irons may be bolted to the sides of the wagon. To lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded down and then secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a reliable method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the stage floor can be damaged.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

While phenology fairly consistently points to an earlier spring across temperate regions of North America, a recent comprehensive study of the [[subarctic]] showed greater variability in the timing of green-up, with some areas advancing, and some having no discernible trend over a recent 44-year period.&lt;ref name=Delbart2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delbart, N. |author2=Picard, G. |author3=Kergoat, L. |author4=Letoan, T. |author5=Quegan, S. |author6=Dye, D. |author7=Woodward, I. |author8=Fedotova, V. |year=2007 |title=Spring phenology in taiga and tundra |url=http://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/wais?jj=B53D-07 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121220164316/http://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/wais?jj=B53D-07 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2007-12-29 |quote=The model was applied over the whole low arctic region from 1958 to 2002.

Another 40 year phenological study in [[China]] found greater warming over that period in the more northerly sites studied, with sites experiencing cooling mostly in the south, indicating that the temperature variation with latitude is decreasing there.&lt;ref name=China&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Impacts of climate warming on plants phenophases in China for the last 40 years |url=http://www.igbp-cnc.org.cn/cpn/resource/ky1826.pdf |year=2002 |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |pages=1826–1831 |volume=47 |issue=21 |last1=Jingyun |first1=Z. |last2=Quansheng |first2=G. |last3=Zhixin |first3=H. |accessdate=2009-06-27 |quote=There is a statistically meaningful relation between inter-annual changes in the spring phenophase and the spring temperature in China for the last 40 years....

This study also confirmed that season creep was [[correlated]] with warming, but the effect is [[non-linear]]—phenophases advanced less with greater warming, and retarded more with greater cooling.&lt;ref name=China/&gt;

Shorter winters and longer growing seasons may appear to be a benefit to society from [[global warming]], but the effects of advanced phenophases may also have serious consequences for human populations. Modeling of snowmelt predicted that warming of 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C in the [[Western United States]] could cause snowmelt-driven runoff to occur as much as two months earlier, with profound effects on [[hydroelectricity]], land use, agriculture, and water management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = S.

Since 1980, earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the [[wildfire]] season there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last3 = Cayan | first1 = L. | first2 = G.| last2 = Hidalgo| first3 = R. | first4 = W.| title = Warming and earlier spring increase western U.S. Forest wildfire activity| last1 = Westerling| journal = Science| last4 = Swetnam| volume = 313| issue = 5789| pages = 940–943| date = Aug 2006| issn = 0036-8075| pmid = 16825536| doi = 10.1126/science.1128834|bibcode = 2006Sci...313..940W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season creep may also have adverse effects on plant species as well. Earlier flowering could occur before pollinators such as [[honey bee]]s become active, which would have negative consequences for [[pollination]] and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Chung2011/&gt; Shorter and warmer winters may affect other environmental [[adaptation]]s including [[cold hardening]] of trees, which could result in frost damage during more severe winters.&lt;ref name=Chung2011/&gt;

The '''phonology''' of '''second languages''' is different from the [[phonology]] of [[first language]]s in various ways. The differences are considered to come from general characteristics of [[second language]]s, such as slower [[speech rate]],{{sfn|Derwing|Munro|1997}} lower proficiency than native speakers, and from the interaction between non-native speakers' first and second languages. 

Research on second-language phonology has been done not only on [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Best|1994}}, {{harvnb|Best|1995}}, {{harvnb|Flege|1986}}, {{harvnb|Flege|1991}}, {{harvnb|Flege|1995}}, {{harvnb|Iverson|Kuhl|1995}}, {{harvnb|Kuhl|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but also on '''prosody'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Archibald|1995}}, {{harvnb|Derwing|Munro|1997}}, {{harvnb|Flege|Bohn|1989}}, {{harvnb|Magen|1998}}, {{harvnb|McGory|1997}}, {{harvnb|Mennen|2004}}, {{harvnb|Willems|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Second-language [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], like second-language segments, has been studied in terms of both its global characteristics and the interactions between first languages and second languages.

== First language to second language ==
=== Global second-language prosody characteristics ===
==== Speech rate ====
[[Second language|L2]] [[speech rate]] is typically slower than native speech. For example, [[Mandarin Chinese]] speakers’ speech rate in an English [[utterance]] is slower than native English speakers’ speech rate (Derwing and Munro, 1995), and speech rates in a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] by highly experienced [[Italian people|Italian]] and [[Korean people|Korean]] nonnative speakers of English are slower than that of native English speakers' (Guion et al., 2000). In this study, the main factor of the slower speech rate for the Italian and Korean accented English was the durations of the [[vowels]] and [[sonorant|sonorant consonants]] (Guion et al., 2000). Another source of the slower speech rate in L2 speech is that L2 speakers tend to not reduce [[function words]], such as "the" or "and," as much as native speakers (Aoyama and Guion, 2007). The generally slower speech rate in L2 speech is correlated with the degree of perceived [[Accent (dialect)|foreign accent]] by native listeners (Derwing and Munro, 1997).

=== Interaction between first- and second-language prosody ===

[[Second language|L2]] speech is influenced by the speaker’s [[First language|L1]] background. Such influences have been explored in relation to many [[prosodic]] features, such as [[Pitch accent|pitch]] [[perception]] and pitch excursion (Beckman, 1986; Aoyama and Guion, 2007), [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] placement (Archibald, 1995, 1998a, 1998b; Flege and Bohn, 1989; Archibald, 1997), [[syllable]] structure (Broselow and Park, 1995; Broslow, 1988; Eckman, 1991), and [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] (Sereno and Wang, 2007; Guion and Pederson, 2007).

==== Pitch perception and pitch excursions ====

When perceiving accented syllables in [[English language|English]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] nonnative speakers of English tend to rely only on F0, or [[Pitch accent|pitch]] of the accented syllables, while native speakers use F0, [[Length (phonetics)|duration]], and [[amplitude]] (Beckman, 1986). This finding was confirmed in [[speech communication|production]], by showing that the excursions of F0 of English [[content word]]s were larger for Japanese nonnative speakers of English than for native English speakers (Aoyama and Guion, 2007).

In both studies, the reason for this phenomenon was proposed to be related to the characteristics of the nonnative speakers’ [[First language|L1]], Japanese. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a [[mora-timed language]], and because of this, longer [[syllable]] duration makes a [[phonological]] difference in Japanese. Therefore, when expressing [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Japanese, Japanese speakers may rely more on F0 than [[Length (phonetics)|duration]], which is a critical cue for a different [[phonological]] distinction. This [[First language|L1]] characteristic might interfere with Japanese speakers’ [[perception]] and [[speech communication|production]] of English, which is a [[stress-timed language]] and might be free of such durational restrictions.

==== Stress placement on words ====

Influence from [[First language|L1]] to [[Second language|L2]] was also found in [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] placement on words. [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] learners of English tend to place initial [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] on [[English language|English]] words that do not have initial [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], because [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] has fixed initial [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and this is transferred to Hungarian speakers' [[Second language|L2]] English [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (Archibald, 1995; 1998a; 1998b). [[Spanish people|Spanish]] speakers of English were found not to stress target stressed syllables in English, and this might be due to the lack of stress in Spanish [[cognates]] and the [[lexicon|lexical]] similarity between Spanish and English words (Flege and Bohn, 1989). In addition, it is suggested that speakers of  [[tone languages]] (e.g., [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) and [[pitch-accent]] languages (e.g., [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), both of which use [[Pitch accent|pitch]] as a [[phonologically]] meaningful item, do not compute [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] placement in English, but rather store the stress information lexically (Archibald, 1997).

==== Syllable structure ====

[[Second language|L2]] speakers can also perceive some innate characteristics of the [[Second language|L2]], which lead to different repair strategies for different [[phonological]] patterns. [[Korean people|Korean]] [[Second language|L2]] speakers of English add an extra final vowel to some English words but not to all (Broslow and Park, 1995), as in (1). 

(1) Korean pronunciations of English words 
{| class="wikitable"

| “good”
|-
| k&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ot&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;i
| “coat”
| buk
| “book”
|}

The problem is that modern [[Korean language|Korean]] does not have a phonological [[vowel length]] difference, and Korean speakers show their own repair mechanism for [[English language|English]] [[minimal pairs]] that have [[Tenseness|tense/lax]] difference, by adding an extra final vowel to English words with tense vowels. This might be because Korean learners of English attempt to preserve the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] count of the original English word, by adding an extra final vowel to words that have two moras (Broslow and Park, 1995). The [[syllable]] structure of such a word might look like in (2)

(2)  Syllable structure of English “beat” by Korean nonnative speakers of English (adapted from Broslow and Park, 1995).

==== Tone: second-language perception, production, and learning ====
[[Second language|L2]] listeners show different patterns of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] perception in [[tone languages]], such as [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In Guion and Pederson (2007), [[Native speaker|native]] listeners of Mandarin judged the similarity of synthesized [[Mandarin phonology#Tones|Mandarin tone]]s on the basis of both [[Fundamental frequency|F0]] and F0 slope, while English and Japanese listeners used only F0, not [[F0 slope]]. However, it was also observed that late learners of Mandarin showed similar patterns of tone perception as native listeners of Mandarin, focusing on both F0 and F0 slope of the tones. This suggests that [[Second language|L2]] learners can learn to attend to the cues that [[First language|L1]] speakers use for the tone distinction. 

The possibility of learning new [[Second language|L2]] [[prosodic]] distinction was further explored in a training study on [[Mandarin phonology#Tones|Mandarin tones]] (Sereno and Wang, 2007). English [[Second language|L2]] listeners’ perception and production of Mandarin tones improved after [[perceptual training]], and this was observed both [[Behaviour|behaviorally]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortically]]: [[Second language|L2]] listeners’ accuracy of tone perception and production improved, and increased activity of language areas in the [[left hemisphere]] ([[superior temporal gyrus]]) and [[neighboring effects]] on relevant [[neural]] areas were observed.

The '''Switching Control Center System''' was an [[operations support system]] developed by [[Bell Laboratories]] and deployed during the early 1970s.  This [[computer]] system was first based on the [[PDP-11]] product line from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and used the [[CB Unix]] [[operating system]] and custom [[application software]] and [[device drivers]] that were developed and maintained by [[Bell Labs]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] USA. SCCS was ported to the [[AT&amp;T Computer Systems|AT&amp;T 3B20 and 3B5]] computers running [[UNIX System V]] Release 2 in the early 1980s.

Prior to the SCCS, many [[telephone company]] switching centers were staffed 24 hours a day 365 days a year.  Deployment of the SCCS allowed telephone companies to significantly reduce the number of technicians by implementing a local switching control center office and dispatch technicians as required to resolve problems or perform [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] operations.

During the early 1970s, telephone companies began to phase out the older electromechanical switching systems such as the [[1XB switch|Number 1 Crossbar]], [[5XB switch|Number 5 Crossbar]], and [[Strowger switch|step-by-step]] circuit switching systems and replace them with newer [[electronic switching system]]s that were controlled by proprietary computers but still used analog switch fabrics such as Bell-proprietary ferreed switch devices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs_iportals/iportals/aboutus/history_center/oral_history/pdfs/Andrews380.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

The SCCS system was phased out during the late 1980s and replaced by an [[Operations Support Systems|OSS]] known as Network Monitoring and Analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telcordia.com/products/nma/index.html | title=Telcordia® NMA® System CE | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409075654/http://www.telcordia.com/products/nma/index.html | archivedate=2004-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Network Monitoring and Analysis|NMA]] that was developed by [[Bell Communications Research]] now Telcordia Technologies.  AT&amp;T developed additional products based on SCCS software, such as Compulert.

The primary purpose of the SCCS system was to provide [[Business operations|operations]], [[System administrator|administration]], [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], and [[provisioning]] ([[OAMP]]) functions for [[telephone company]] network operations staff. The SCCS accepted as input the slow 110 [[baud]] [[teleprinter|Teletype]] messages from [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]] [[switching systems]] such as the [[1ESS switch|Number 1 ESS]], Number 2 ESS, Number 3 ESS, [[5ESS switch|Number 5 ESS]], and [[Traffic Service Position System]] ([[TSPS]]) network switches and provide analysis, reports, troubleshooting support, and other functions using newer faster DataSpeed-40 terminals.

This system was documented in the Bell System Technical Journal and [[AT&amp;T]] internal [[Bell System Practices]] during the 1970s.

'''São Pedro do Butiá''' is a municipality in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Brazil.

==Minority language==
Like many towns in the state which were first settled by [[German language|German-speaking]] Brazilians from the ''Altkolonie'' or the old colonies in the East, the regional German language is still present in daily family and community life, if not as much in the public sphere since [[World War II]] due to language repression public policies implemented by the State (i.e [[Getúlio Vargas|Getúlio Vargas']] aggressive nationalization campaign). 

Among other informal names (and often pejorative descriptions), the local dialect is gaining recognition by its formal name, [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] (international language code: ISO 639-3 hrx), a reference to the [[Hunsrück]] region of southwest Germany, where the language has strong linguistic roots (see: [[West Middle German]] dialects). 

In 2012 the state chamber of deputies voted unanimously in favor of recognizing this Germanic dialect an official historical intangible culture good to be preserved. Later, in 2014, the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN in Portuguese), under the overview of the [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture of Brazil]], officially announced of a project of recognition, survey and support to the maintenance of the local language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://e-ipol.org/comunidade-hunsriqueana-comemora-a-aprovacao-do-projeto-para-inventario-de-sua-lingua/ | publisher=IPOL - Instituto de Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Política Linguística | language=pt | title=Comunidade Hunsriqueana comemora a aprovação do Projeto para Inventário de sua Língua | date=26 November 2014 | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneer park==

Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul - Ein Beitrag zur Beschreibung einer deutschbrasilianischen Dialektvarietät im Kontakt mit dem Portugiesische (Mainzer Studien zur Sprach- und Volksforschung 21). Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; in German, has a popular pioneer village park called ''Centro Germânico Missioneiro''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.portaldasmissoes.com.br/site/view/id/539/centro-germanico-missioneiro-de-sao-pedro-do-butia.html | publisher=Portal das Missões | language=pt | title=Centro Germânico Missioneiro de São Pedro do Butiá | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (here ''missioneiro'' is a reference to the old [[Misiones Orientales|Jesuit Missions]], established in the general area during colonial times, around three hundred years before the more modern settlement of the area). The village has many different structures, like a general store, a country school, and some relocated old homes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.portaldasmissoes.com.br/site/view/id/1692/museu-casa-do-colono.html | publisher=Portal das Missões | title=Museu Casa do Colono | language=pt | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are all set around a large statue of [[Saint Peter]], the patron saint of this mostly catholic municipality. According to official information, the 30 meters tall statue of St. Peter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clicrbs.com.br/zerohora/jsp/default2.jsp?uf=1&amp;local=1&amp;source=a2326724.xml&amp;template=3898.dwt&amp;edition=11279&amp;section=1003 Zeho Hora: ''São Pedro é inaugurado hoje'']&lt;/ref&gt; is the same size as the world-famous statue of [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]], found at the top of the [[Sugarloaf Mountain]] in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. 

==Neo-gothic architecture==
The church of São Pedro Apóstolo (St. Peter Apostle) of São Pedro do Butiá is a very good example of the [[neo-gothic]] architecture which prevailed and characterizes most of the earlier larger religious structures in the Germanic regions in the Northwest of the state. Even more impressive is its parish church: 

The main church Paróquia Sagrada Família de Narazé (Sacred Family of Nazareth Church) is a much larger and a two-towered neo-gothic construction. Located 15 kilometers away from São Pedro do Butiá, the Igreja Matriz, as it is known, was built between 1913 and 1921 and in the same general revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.portaldasmissoes.com.br/site/view/id/1266/igreja-matriz-de-cerro-largo-sagrada-familia-de-na.html | publisher=Portal das Missões | language=pt | title=Igreja Matriz de Cerro Largo Sagrada Família de Nazaré | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4231">In [[mathematics]], the '''tameness theorem''' states that every complete [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]] with finitely generated [[fundamental group]] is [[topologically tame]], in other words [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the interior of a [[compact space|compact]] 3-manifold.

The tameness theorem was conjectured by {{harvtxt|Marden|1974}}. It was proved by {{harvtxt|Agol|2004}} and, independently, by [[Danny Calegari]] and [[David Gabai]]. It is one of the fundamental properties of geometrically infinite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, together with the [[density theorem for Kleinian groups]] and the [[ending lamination theorem]].
It also implies the [[Ahlfors measure conjecture]].

== History ==
Topological tameness may be viewed as a property of the [[end (topology)|ends]] of the manifold, namely, having a local product structure. An analogous statement is well known in two dimensions, i.e. for [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s. However, as the example of [[Alexander horned sphere]] shows, there are wild embeddings among 3-manifolds, so this property is not automatic.

The conjecture was raised in the form of a question by [[Albert Marden]], who proved that any ''geometrically finite'' hyperbolic 3-manifold is topologically tame.  The conjecture was also called the '''Marden conjecture''' or the '''tame ends conjecture'''.

There had been steady progress in understanding tameness before the conjecture was resolved. Partial results had been obtained by [[William Thurston|Thurston]], Brock, Bromberg, Canary, Evans, Minsky, Ohshika.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} An important sufficient condition for tameness in terms of splittings of the fundamental group had been obtained by [[Francis Bonahon|Bonahon]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The conjecture was proved in 2004 by [[Ian Agol]], and independently, by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. Agol's proof relies on the use of manifolds of pinched negative curvature and on Canary's trick of "diskbusting" that allows to replace a compressible end with an incompressible end, for which the conjecture has already been proved. The Calegari–Gabai proof is centered on the existence of certain closed, non-positively curved surfaces that they call "shrinkwrapped".

'''''The Interpreter''''' is a 2005 [[political thriller]] film directed by [[Sydney Pollack]], starring [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Catherine Keener]], and [[Jesper Christensen]]. It is notable for being the first movie to have been shot inside the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City.

==Plot==
The movie opens in a dusty African landscape: the Republic of Matobo, where rebel leader Ajene Xola (Curtiss Cook) is driving two men, Simon and Philippe, to the abandoned Centennial Stadium. They briefly discuss how President Edmond Zuwanie ([[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]])'s regime has ruthlessly exterminated most of the population, and intimidated the survivors into silence. Upon their arrival at the stadium, they discover that the informants are schoolboys, who point Ajene and Simon in the direction of corpses left by Zuwanie's security apparatus, while Philippe stays in the car.

Shouting lures Ajene and Simon back to the field, where they are promptly executed by the boys, who are revealed to be willing accomplices of Zuwanie's secret police. Upon hearing the gunshots, Philippe clambers out of the car and hides, taking pictures of a car arriving carrying Matoban officials, and then escapes the vicinity.

Meanwhile, Silvia Broome ([[Nicole Kidman]]) is an interpreter for the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. Born in the United States to a British mother and white African father, she spent most of her life in her father's homeland of Matobo (a stand-in for [[Zimbabwe]]), studied music in [[Johannesburg]], lingustics at [[Sorbonne University]], Paris, and various other European countries, and is a dual citizen of both Matobo and the United States (with the possibility of deriving British citizenship through her mother). Her diverse background leads to UN Security Chief Lee Wu ([[Clyde Kusatsu]]) wryly describing her as "being the UN".

The U.N. is considering [[indictment|indicting]] Zuwanie, to stand trial in the [[International Criminal Court]]. Initially a liberator, over the past 20 years he has become as corrupt and tyrannical as the government he overthrew, and is now responsible for [[ethnic cleansing]] and other atrocities within Matobo. Zuwanie is soon to visit the U.N. and put forward his own case to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], in an attempt to avoid the indictment.

A security scare caused by a malfunctioning metal detector forces the evacuation of the U.N. building, and, as Silvia returns at night to reclaim some personal belongings, she overhears two men discussing an assassination plot in [[Ku (fictional language)|Ku]] (the Matoban [[lingua franca]]). Silvia runs from the building when those discussing the plot become aware of her presence. The next day, Silvia recognizes words in a meeting, where she is interpreting, from phrases she overheard the night before, and reports the incident to U.N. security; the plot's target appears to be Zuwanie himself. 

They, in turn, call in the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], which assigns Dignitary Protection Division agents Tobin Keller ([[Sean Penn]]) and Dot Woods ([[Catherine Keener]]) to investigate, as well as protect Zuwanie when he arrives, as well as Zuwanie's personal head of security, Dutch mercenary Nils Lud ([[Jesper Christensen]]). Keller, whose estranged wife was accidentally killed just days earlier, learns that Silvia has, in the past, been involved in a Matoban [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla group]], that her parents and sister were killed by land mines laid by Zuwanie's men, and that she has dated one of Zuwanie's political opponents. Although Keller is suspicious of Silvia's story, the two grow close, in part because of their shared grief, and Keller ends up protecting her from attacks on her person. 

Philippe calls Silvia to meet and informs her of Xola's death, but, unable to bear her grief, lies and says he doesn't know what happened to Simon (her brother). Silvia attempts to obtain information by way of Kuman-Kuman, an exiled Matoban minister living in New York, only to almost be killed in a bus bombing perpetrated by Gabonese national Jean Gamba, Nils Lud's right-hand man, and part of the opening scene's coterie.

Philippe is later found dead in his hotel room, and Silvia finds out  that her brother was killed along with Ajene Xola (as shown in the opening scene). She narrowly avoids an assassination attempt by Gamba (who Tobin kills) and leaves a voicemail on Tobin's phone saying she's going back home. Keller takes this to mean she's returning to Matobo, and dispatches an agent to intercept her at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].

The purported assassin is discovered (and shot to death) while Zuwanie is in the middle of his address to the General Assembly, and security personnel rush Zuwanie to a safe room for his protection. Silvia, anticipating this, has been hiding in the safe room, and confronts Zuwanie and intends to kill him herself. Keller determines that the assassination plot is a [[false flag]] operation created by Zuwanie to gain credibility that his rivals are terrorists and to deter potential supporters of his removal. Keller realizes that for Silvia, returning home to Matobo would not be possible without Zuwanie being removed from the equation, and rushes to the safe room, just in time to prevent Silvia from murdering Zuwanie. Zuwanie is indicted, and Silvia reconciles with Tobin before leaving for Matobo.

==Production==
''The Interpreter'' was shot almost entirely in [[New York City]]. The opening sequence was shot in [[Mozambique]] with a support crew made up largely of [[South Africa]]n nationals.

===Filming in U.N. buildings===
Parts of ''The Interpreter'' were filmed inside the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] chambers. The producers approached the U.N. about filming there before, but their request was turned down. The production would have relocated to Toronto with a constructed set; however, this would have substantially increased costs, and so Sydney Pollack approached then-[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] directly, and personally negotiated permission to film inside the United Nations. Annan commented on ''The Interpreter'' that "the intention was really to do something dignified, something that is honest and reflects the work that this Organization does. And it is with that spirit that the producers and the directors approached their work, and I hope you will all agree they have done that."

Ambassadors at the U.N. had hoped to appear in the film, but actors were asked to play the roles of diplomats. Spain's U.N. Ambassador [[Inocencio Arias]] jokingly complained that his "opportunity to have a nomination for the Oscar next year went away because of some stupid regulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3672605.stm|title=Diplomats' movie hopes dashed|date=30 April 2004|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matobo and Ku===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fictional country]] --&gt;
The country "Republic of Matobo" and its corresponding [[constructed language]] "[[Ku (fictional language)|Ku]]" were created for this film. The director of the ''Centre for African Language Learning'' in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]], [[England]], Said el-Gheithy, was commissioned in January 2004 to create Ku. It is based on [[Bantu languages]] spoken in Eastern and Southern Africa, and is a cross between [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Shona language|Shona]], with some unique elements.

In Ku, the film's tagline "The truth requires no translation" is "Angota ho ne njumata".

==Reception==
''The Interpreter'' earned mixed reviews from critics, as it now holds a 56% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 192 reviews.

===Box office===
The picture was No. 1 In its opening weekend. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''The Interpreter'' had a domestic gross of $72,708,161 and an international tally of $90,236,762, bringing the picture's worldwide gross to $162,944,923 versus an $80 million budget, so the film was considered a box office success.

==Awards==
In 2005, the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] awarded [[Catherine Keener]] as Best Supporting Actress for her performances in several films, including ''The Interpreter''.

[[File:Satellite science fiction 195712.jpg|thumb|right|''The Languages of Pao'' was originally published in the December 1957 issue of ''[[Satellite Science Fiction]]'', under what is likely the last SF magazine cover by [[Frank R. Paul]].]]
'''''The Languages of Pao''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Jack Vance]], first published in 1958, in which the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is a central theme. A shorter version was published in ''[[Satellite Science Fiction]]'' in late 1957. After the [[Avalon Books]] hardcover appeared the next year, it was reprinted in paperback by [[Ace Books]] in 1966 and reissued in 1968 and 1974. Additional hardcover and paperback reprints have followed, as well as British, French and Italian editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?9683 ISFDB bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The planet Pao is a quiet backwater with a large, homogeneous, stolid population ruled by an absolute monarch: the Panarch. Pao's cultural homogeneity contributes to making it vulnerable to external military and economic pressures. The current Panarch attempts to hire an offworld scientist, Lord Palafox from the Breakness Institute on the planet Breakness, as a consultant in order to reform Pao. Before the deal can be concluded, however, the Panarch is assassinated by his brother Bustamonte, using mind-control over the Panarch's own son, Beran Panasper, to do so. Lord Palafox saves Beran Panasper and takes him to Breakness as a possible bargaining chip in his dealings with Pao.

Somewhat later, the predatory Brumbo Clan from the planet Batmarsh raids the virtually defenseless Pao with impunity, and the Panarch Bustamonte is forced to pay heavy tribute. To rid himself of the Brumbos, he seeks the aid of Palafox, who has a plan to create warrior, technical and mercantile castes on Pao using customized languages (named Valiant, Technicant and Cogitant) and other means to shape the mindsets of each caste, isolating them from each other and the general populace of Pao. To achieve this, each caste gets a special training area where it is completely segregated from any outside influence; the necessary land is confiscated from families, some of which have held it for countless generations&amp;nbsp;— which creates some disaffection in the conservative Paonese population and earns Bustamonte the name of a tyrant.

In order to return with them to Pao incognito, Beran Panasper infiltrates a corps of interpreters being trained on Breakness. Mostly to amuse themselves, some of the young people create a language they call "[[Pastiche]]", mixing words and grammatical forms, seemingly at random, from the three newly created languages and from the original Paonese language. Palafox looks upon this development with indulgence, failing to realize the tremendous long-term significance.

Beran returns to Pao under the name Ercolo Paraio and works for a few years as a translator at several locations. Once Beran Panasper reveals to the masses that he is still alive, his uncle Bustamonte's popular support melts virtually overnight and Panasper claims the title of Panarch that is rightfully his. The Brumbo Clan is repulsed by the warrior caste. For a few years, the castes of Pao are highly successful in their respective endeavors and the planet experiences a short golden age. However, Panasper is upset about the divisions in the populace of Pao caused by the Palafox program; the three new castes speak of the rest of the Paonese as "they" rather than "we" and regard them with contempt.

Beran attempts to return the planet to its previous state by re-integrating the castes into the general populace. Palafox opposes this move and is killed, but the warrior caste stages a coup and takes command of Pao. Panasper convinces them that they cannot rule the planet alone, since they share no common language with the rest of the population and cannot rely on the cooperation of the other segments of the people of Pao, and they allow him to keep his office.

One interpretation of the end of the novel is that Beran Panasper is only in nominal charge of the planet, on the sufferance of the warrior caste, and that it is uncertain what will become of him and his plans of re-uniting the populace of Pao. Another way of seeing the ending is that Beran has outfoxed the warriors by getting them to agree to his decree that "every child of Pao, of whatever caste, must learn Pastiche even in preference to the language of his father". In the end, Beran looks ahead twenty years, to a future when all inhabitants of Pao will be Pastiche-speakers&amp;nbsp;— i.e., will speak a language which mixes some attributes and mindsets appropriate to peasant cultivators, proud warriors, skilled technicians and smart merchants&amp;nbsp;— which will presumably shape a highly fluid and socially mobile society, composed of versatile and multi-skilled individuals.

==Reception==
[[Frederik Pohl]] reported that Vance had "pretty carefully" worked out his extrapolation, but that "it isn't terribly convincing as presented". Pohl also noted that "Vance writes well -- sometimes even brilliantly", but that his prose sometimes seemed uneven and artificial.&lt;ref&gt;"In the Balance", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], July 1959, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Floyd C. Gale]] called the novel "a good idea well handled".&lt;ref name="gale195908"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1959-08/Galaxy_1959_08#page/n135/mode/2up | title=Galaxy's 5 Star Star Shelf | work=Galaxy |date=August 1959| accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Gale, Floyd C. | pages=138–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Langford]] cited Vance's "engaging speculation", but concluded that the protagonist "seems too weak a character for his leading role", while "the culture and landscape of Pao are grey and ill-defined, in strong contrast to the exotically colourful societies and ecologies which became Vance's trademark".&lt;ref&gt;David Langford, ''Up Through an Empty House of Stars'', Wildside Press, 2003, p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==
In linguistics, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis asserts that a language's structure and grammar construct the perception and consciousness of its speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This novel centers on a fictional experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. As the mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."

==Euphemisms==
Vance uses some unusual [[euphemism]]s in this book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2005/01/ithe_languages__1.html Tenser, said the Tensor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "subaqueation" for "drowning", the traditional method of execution on Pao

{{Orphan|date=October 2015}}

In [[linguistics]], the term "'''universal grinder'''" refers to an idea that in some languages, most [[count noun]]s can be used as if they were [[mass noun]]s, which causes a slight change in their meaning. The term "universal grinder" was first used in print by F. Jeffry Pelletier in 1975, after a personal suggestion by David Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, F. Jeffry: ''Non-singular reference: some preliminaries''. In ''Philosophia'' Vol. 5 No. 4 Pp. 451–465, October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related concepts, the '''universal sorter''' and '''universal packager''' refer to similar processes that allow mass nouns to be used as count nouns.

==Universal grinder==
The idea of the "universal grinder" is that while count nouns usually denote whole, distinct objects (such as ''a steak'', ''two steaks''), the equivalent mass noun connotes a non-distinct quantity of whatever constitutes these objects (''some steak''). The universal grinder suggests that most count nouns can be used as mass nouns, and the distinct thing named by the noun will be thought of as a general quantity.

While the "universal grinder" can be used in many [[Indo-European language]]s, most particularly [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], it does not apply in all languages; there is considerable cross-linguistic variation in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and semantics of the mass/count and singular/plural distinctions. For example, bare count nouns in [[Mandarin Chinese]] do not receive mass interpretations: a sentence such as ''Qiáng-shang dōu shì gǒu'' can only be interpreted as 'There are dogs all over the wall,' not as 'There is dog all over the wall.'&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Lisa L.S., Doetjes, Jenny, and Sybesma, Rint: ''How universal is the Universal Grinder?'' In ''Linguistics in the Netherlands 2008'', pp. 50–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal sorter and packager==
The "universal sorter" describes one way in which mass nouns are understood when they are used in the [[plural]]. Harry Bunt suggested the universal sorter in his 1981 doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Bunt|first=Hendrik C. |year=1981|title=The formal semantics of mass terms|publisher=Universiteit van Amsterdam|oclc=251587734}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an ordinarily uncountable noun such as ''wine'' appears with plural form (''several wines''), it can be understood as referring to various abstract kinds (for example, varieties of wine).&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zhang|first=Niina Ning|title=Classifier Structures in Mandarin Chinese|year=2013|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-030499-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "universal packager" likewise describes how mass nouns are understood when they are used as countable nouns. In this case, the plural noun may be understood as naming individual servings or "packages" (e.g. ''two coffees'' may mean "two cups of coffee"), or as naming abstract kinds (''two coffees'' can also refer to e.g. [[Colombian coffee]] and [[Indonesian coffee]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filip|first=Hana |title=Aspect, Eventuality Types, and Nominal Reference|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8153-3271-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars use the phrase ''universal packager'' to refer to both the concrete and abstract understanding of plural nouns; others use it to refer only to the concrete sense, and use ''universal sorter'' for abstract meaning.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

[[File:Valentín Lamas Carvajal.jpg|thumb|200px|Lamas Carvajal.]]
'''Valentín Lamas Carvajal''' (1849–1906) was a Spanish journalist. He was one of the founders of [[Royal Galician Academy]].

He studied high school in his hometown and in 1870 he moved to [[Santiago de Compostela]] to study medicine that he failed to finish due to an eye disease that would eventually leave him blind.

The '''Yagua''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɑː|ɡ|w|ɑː|}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; language is spoken primarily in northeastern [[Peru]] by the [[Yagua people]].  As of 2005, it appears that a few speakers may have migrated across the Peruvian-[[Colombia]]n border near the town of [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]]. A third of the population is monolingual, and Yagua is the language of instruction in local primary schools.

==Name==
The exonym is spelled ''Yagua, Yawa, Yahua, Llagua, Yava, Yegua''. They also go by ''Nijyamïï Nikyejaada''.

== Genetic affiliation ==
The Yagua language is a branch of the [[Peba–Yaguan languages|Peba–Yaguan]] language family.

== Sociolinguistic situation ==
By the end of the 20th century, there were about 6,000 speakers of the language.  At that time, a majority of [[Yagua]] individuals were bilingual in both Spanish and the Yagua language.  A few distant communities were still largely monolingual, and children were learning the language, though in at least some communities there was parental pressure on children to just speak Spanish.  Some ethnic Yaguas are monolingual in Spanish.

There is some degree of semilingualism among certain Yagua women who are culturally assimilated into the main Peruvian culture, not having native-like command of either Spanish or Yagua. They contrast with three other groups of Yagua: 1) older women who are fluent Yagua speakers with some degree of Spanish, 2) unassimilated monolingual Yaguas, and 3) men, who all speak Yagua with varying degrees of Spanish fluency. These young women are primarily addressed in Yagua, but respond in a simplified Spanish.&lt;ref name="Morphosyntax"&gt;Payne, Thomas E. (1997).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}

== Phonology ==
Yagua has 6 vowels and 11 consonants, as shown in the chart below. (Orthographic symbols in bold, IPA values in square brackets.)

=== Vowels ===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center" border="1"

* Some vowels show a significant degree of allophonic variation, notably /u/ which can be {{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[o]}}, and /a/, which can be {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}}.
* Vowels are both oral and nasal.

# A nasal consonant preceding a nasal vowel is a simple nasal sound ( [m], [n]); but a nasal consonant preceding an oral vowel has an oral release ([mb], [nd])
# All phones except for /s/, /tʃ/, and /j/ may be palatalized.  In addition, bilabial stops may be labialized.
# /s/ and /tʃ/ show significant allophonic variation, being either pre-stopped or not.  Thus /s/ ranges from [s] to [ts], and /tʃ/ ranges from [tʃ] to [ʃ].
# The rhotic '''r''' is often [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] ({{IPA|[ɽ]}}) and may have some laterality ({{IPA|[ɺ]}}); simple taps ({{IPA|[ɾ]}}) are also heard. /r/ can also be realized as [d], especially when palatalized.
# /w/ can be realized as [β], especially when palatalized.
# Within a word, there is metathesis of any morpheme-final /j/ with the onset of the following syllable

The language has either tone or a complex pitch-accent system, but this has never been adequately described.

== Morphology ==
The language is highly [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], such that most words consist of multiple [[morpheme]]s, and a single word may contain more than one root.

== Syntax ==
Most Yagua sentences begin with the verb, followed by the subject and object in that order (VSO).  It is a "double object" language, with no known syntactic differences between the two objects of verbs like 'give', for example, or applied objects.

The language has numerous postpositions (and no prepositions, which is generally unexpected for VSO languages).  There are over 40 noun classifiers, and essentially no "adjectives".  Nouns are modified either by nouns, by classifiers, or by other suffixes.

Yagua uses adjective-like nouns as adjectives. The problem then occurs in a sentence like ''the red hen'', which would be more like "the red one, the hen". Both "the red one" and "the hen" could be the head of the noun phrase. This is solved by determining which of the two nouns persists in the following discourse. If "the red one" persists, then "red" is the head; if "the hen" persists, then "hen" is the head.&lt;ref name="Morphosyntax" /&gt;{{rp|35}} The order of elements is sensitive to determining the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Doris L.|title=The Pragmatics of Word Order: Typological Dimensions of Verb-initial Languages|year=1990|publisher=Mouton|location=Berlin and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is documented in various works by Paul Powlison, Esther Powlison, Doris L. Payne, and Thomas E. Payne.

== Vocabulary ==
Yagua has a [[quinary]] (base 5) counting system.  Different numbers are used for inanimate objects/counting and animate objects (see [[measure word]]).
