'''Allorecognition ''' is the ability of an individual organism to distinguish its own tissues from those of another. It manifests itself in the recognition of antigens expressed on the surface of cells of non-self origin. Allorecognition has been described in nearly all multicellular phyla.

This article focuses on allorecognition from the standpoint of its significance in the evolution of multicellular organisms. For other articles which focus on its importance in medicine, molecular biology, and so forth, the following topics are recommended as well as those in the '''Categories''' links at the bottom of this page.

* [[Transplant rejection]]
* [[Tissue typing]]
* [[Major histocompatibility complex|Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)]]

The ability to discriminate between self and non-self is a fundamental requirement for life. At the most basic level, even single-celled organisms need to be able to distinguish between food and non-food, to respond appropriately to invading pathogens, and to avoid cannibalism. In sexually reproducing organisms, self/non-self discrimination is essential to ensuring species-specific egg/sperm interaction during fertilization. Hermaphroditic organisms, such as [[annelid]]s and certain plants, require recognition mechanisms to prevent self-fertilization. Such functions are all carried out by the [[innate immune system]], which employs evolutionarily conserved [[pattern recognition receptor]]s to eliminate cells displaying "nonself markers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Innate immune recognition|journal = Annual Review of Immunology|date = 2002-01-01|issn = 0732-0582|pmid = 11861602|pages = 197–216|volume = 20|doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.20.083001.084359|first = Charles A.|last = Janeway|first2 = Ruslan|last2 = Medzhitov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of multicellularity==
The evolution of [[multicellularity]] brought about various challenges, many of which could be met by increasingly sophisticated innate immune systems, but which also served as an evolutionary driving force for the development of [[adaptive immune system]]s. The adaptive or "specific" immune system in its fully qualified form (''i.e.'' based on [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC), [[T-cell receptor]]s (TCR), and [[antibodies]]) exists only in [[jawed vertebrate]]s, but an independently evolved adaptive immune system has been identified in [[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s (non-jawed vertebrates).&lt;ref name="Dz2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

Multicellularity has arisen independently dozens of times in the history of life, in plants, animals, fungi, and prokaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Buss |first=Leo |title=The Evolution of Individuality |year=2006 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-08469-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing first several billion years ago in [[cyanobacteria]]. Two categories of advantages have been attributed to the early development of multicellular existence: advantages related to size, and advantages related to functional specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;

|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102403.114735 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Size advantages may include greater feeding efficiency or increased robustness. For example, [[myxobacteria]], moving in swarms, are able to maintain a high concentration of extracellular enzymes used to digest food, from which all the bacteria in the swarm benefit. Under various conditions, many microorganisms form [[biofilm]]s which provide them with a protected environment. In organisms that have evolved functional specialization, an important division of labor may exist over reproduction: only a small fraction of cells contribute to the next generation. [[Somatic (biology)|Somatic]] growth represents a form of altruism, where somatic cells give up reproduction helping [[germline]] cells reproduce.

==Free rider problem==
The extracellular enzymes secreted by swarming bacteria, the slime of a biofilm, or the soma cells in a differentiated organism represent public goods which are vulnerable to exploitation by cheaters.&lt;ref name="AsDeDeHo2008"&gt;

|journal=BioEssays |volume=30 |issue=11–12 |pages=1193–1203
|doi=10.1002/bies.20840 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is well known in economics and [[evolutionary biology]] as the "[[free rider problem]]" or the "[[tragedy of the commons]]." A free rider (or freeloader) is an individual that consumes a resource without paying for it, or pays less than the full cost. In multicellular organisms, cheaters may arise from mutations in somatic cells that no longer contribute to the common good, or ignore controls on their reproduction. Another possibility may arise from somatic fusion: there are multicellular life-styles where there are few if any physical barriers to the intermingling of cells (for example: sponges, fungal mycelia) and even among organisms that have evolved physical integuments representing a first line of defense against invasion, opportunities for cellular exchange occur. Witness, for example, the spread of [[devil facial tumour disease]] among [[Tasmanian devil]]s and [[transmissible venereal tumor]] in dogs.

In [[metazoan]]s, defense against disruption of the multicellular life style by such cheaters takes two major forms. First, a consistent feature of the multicellular life cycle is the interposition of a unicellular phase, even among organisms whose major mode of propagation may be via many-celled vegetative propagules.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This unicellular phase usually takes the form of a sexually produced zygote. Passage through a unicellular bottleneck assures that each representative of the next generation of organisms represents a distinct clone. Some offspring will carry a large number of deleterious mutations and will die off, while other offspring will carry few. In this manner, the organism bypasses "[[Muller's ratchet]]," the process by which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner. The second defense against cheaters is the development of allorecognition mechanisms that guard against invasion by parasitic replicators.&lt;ref&gt;Plants have a third, physical line of defense. In animals, cancers can spread through the circulatory system to other parts of the organism. Plants do not have such circulatory systems and their cells are fixed in place. Hence, tumors in plants (known as [[gall]]s) are generally limited to a small part of the plant.&lt;/ref&gt; Allorecognition acts as an agent of [[kin selection]] by restricting fusion and community acceptance to related individuals. If related individuals fuse, the benefits of fusion will still apply, while the costs of competition for shared resources or reproductive opportunities will be reduced by a fraction proportional to the degree of relatedness between the fusing partners.&lt;ref name="AsDeDeHo2008"/&gt; If unrelated individuals fuse, or if a mutated cell arises within an organism that is distinguishable from self by the allorecognition system, a rejection response will be activated. As a general rule, rejection is mediated by the gene products of highly variable loci, which must match (or nearly match) between organisms for fusion to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sherman LA, Chattopadhyay S |year=1993 |title=The Molecular Basis of Allorecognition |journal=Annual Review of Immunology |volume=11 |pages=385–402 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.iy.11.040193.002125?journalCode=immunol |doi=10.1146/annurev.iy.11.040193.002125 |pmid=8476567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and of course, vertebrates. The manner in which allorecognition manifests itself in these different systems varies greatly. Bacteria, for instance, secrete [[bacteriocin]]s, proteinaceous toxins specifically targeted against members of their own species. Colonies of marine invertebrates, each representing a single genotype, expand across the ocean floor by asexual reproduction. Where colonies meet, they may, if compatible, fuse to form a single unit, or if incompatible, they may aggressively attempt to overgrow, poison, sting, or consume each other.&lt;ref name="RoNi2011"/&gt;

==Innate and adaptive immune systems==
Vertebrate immunity is dependent on both adaptive and innate immune systems. In vertebrates, the innate immune system is composed of cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]] (which also have a role in the adaptive immune system as [[antigen presenting cells]]), as well as molecular pathways such as the [[complement system]] which react to microbial non-self. The innate immune system enables a rapid inflammatory response that contains the infection, and it activates the adaptive immune system, which eliminates the pathogen and, through [[immunological memory]], provides long term protection against reinfection.

Comprehensive sequence searches across multiple taxonomic groups have failed to identify MHC and TCRs outside of the jawed vertebrates. Allorecognition in these animals rely on molecular mechanisms distinct from those of the jawed vertebrates. In sponges, various receptors (sponge adhesion molecules, receptor tyrosine kinase) with domains similar to those found in [[immunoglobulins]] have been identified. Sequence variability in "hot spots" have been identified in these receptors.&lt;ref name="Dz2010"/&gt; It would appear that molecules which, later in evolution, were exploited in the adaptive immune response, had an earlier role in innate recognition. Lampreys and hagfish appear to have evolved, by [[convergent evolution]], an adaptive immune response that is independent and distinct from the adaptive immune systems of higher vertebrates. [[Lymphocyte]]-like cells in these fish express highly [[variable lymphocyte receptor]] genes, which undergo somatic rearrangements reminiscent of the manner in which mammalian immunoglobulin genes are rearranged during development.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In summary, allorecognition, the ability to distinguish self from non-self, is basic to all life, unicellular as well as multicellular. The earliest recognition systems were innate, and were based on the recognition of self molecules. The evolution of multicellular forms brought about selective pressures for ever-increasing sophistication to innate immune systems. Adaptive immune systems, based on the recognition of non-self, have arisen independently in two lines of [[chordates]], and exploit molecules and cellular systems which had a previous role in innate immune responses. Allorecognition as it currently exists in mammals can be traced back as the result of sequential modification to immunity mechanisms dating back to some of the earliest multicellular organisms.

The '''Byzantine text-type''' (also called '''Majority Text''', '''Traditional Text''', '''Ecclesiastical Text''', '''Constantinopolitan Text''', '''Antiocheian Text''', or '''Syrian Text''') is one of several [[Textual criticism#New Testament|text-types]] used in [[textual criticism]] to describe the textual character of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[New Testament]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]]. It is the form found in the largest number of surviving [[manuscript]]s, though not in the oldest. The New Testament text of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], the [[Patriarchal Text]], as well as those utilized in the [[lectionaries]], is based on this text-type. While considerably varying, it also underlies the [[Textus Receptus]] Greek text used for most Reformation-era translations of the New Testament into vernacular languages. Modern translations mainly use [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] editions that conform more often to the [[Alexandrian text-type]].

The Byzantine text is also found in a few modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] editions, as the Byzantine textual tradition has continued in the Eastern Orthodox Church into the present time. The text used by the Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts. It is commonly accepted as standard Byzantine text.

The Byzantine textform is often marked with the abbreviations &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}&lt;/math&gt; or '''Byz'''.

== Manuscripts of the Byzantine text ==

[[File:Codex alexandrinus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Codex Alexandrinus''', the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the Gospels, close to the Family Π (''Luke 12:54-13:4'')]]

For some time following the fourth century different types of text were current in the East, but at the end the Byzantine text "almost wholly displaced the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort. ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'', 1925. p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine text-type has by far the largest number of surviving manuscripts, many of them written in the newer [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower case) style and in [[Polytonic orthography]] handwriting, which had been invented in the 3rd century BC by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] but which took many centuries to catch on outside scholarly circles. For example, of 522 complete or nearly complete manuscripts of the [[General epistles|General Epistles]] collated by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in [[Münster]], [[Germany]], 372 of them attest the Byzantine reading in at least 90% of 98 test places. Amongst the earliest surviving manuscripts, the position is reversed. There are six manuscripts earlier than the 9th century which conform to the Byzantine text-type; of which the 5th century [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (the oldest), is Byzantine only in the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament being Alexandrian. By comparison, the [[Alexandrian text-type]] is witnessed by nine surviving [[uncials]] earlier than the ninth century (including the Codex Alexandrinus outside the Gospels); and is also usually considered to be demonstrated in three earlier [[papyrus|papyri]]. Modern critical editions of the New Testament tend to conform most often to Alexandrian witnesses — especially [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]].

The earliest [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] to witness to a Byzantine text-type in substantial New Testament quotations is [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 349 — 407); although the fragmentary surviving works of [[Asterius the Sophist]] († 341) have also been considered to conform to the Byzantine text,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Fee, "The Use of Greek Patristic Citations in New Testament Textual Criticism: The State of the Question," pp. 344-359 in ''Studies in the Theory and Method of New Testament Textual Criticism'' (ed. Eldon J. Epp and Gordon D. Fee; Studies &amp; Documents 45; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and the incomplete surviving translation of [[Ulfilas|Wulfila]] (d. 383) into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is often thought to derive from the Byzantine text type or an intermediary between the Byzantine and Western text types.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William, 1980, ''An Introduction to the Gothic Language'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysostom and Asterius used text only in 75% agreed with the standard Byzantine text. The second earliest translation to witness to a Greek base conforming generally to the Byzantine text in the Gospels is the Syriac [[Peshitta]] (though it has many Alexandrian and Western readings);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations |year=1977 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=0-19-826170-5 |pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M. Metzger |last2=Ehrman |first2=Bart D. |authorlink2=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=978-0-19-516122-9 |pages= 86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in respect of several much contested readings, such as Mark 1:2 and John 1:18, the Peshitta rather supports the Alexandrian witnesses. Dating from the fourth century, and hence possibly earlier than the Peshitta, is the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] version of the Gospels; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the [[Garima Gospels]] and classified by Rochus Zuurmond as "early Byzantine". Zuurmond notes that, especially in the Gospel of John, the form of the early Byzantine text found in the Ethiopic Gospels is quite different from the later Greek Majority Text, and agrees in a number of places with [[Papyrus 66]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Zuurmond |first1=Rochus |last2=Niccum |first2=Curt |title="The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament" in Bart D. Ehrman and Michael W. Holmes eds "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research" 2nd edn|year=2013|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-23604-2|pages= 231–252}}"One would say that the Ethiopian ''Versio Antiqua'' is basically a Byzantine text, with some Western elements and some remnants of the early Egyptian text.  For lack of a better term one could coin this "early Byzantine".&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the Byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole, and sometimes differs from a Byzantine sub-group of manuscripts that proliferated after the 11th century. Amongst the bulk of later manuscripts however, it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear Byzantine majority reading for each variant; and a Greek New Testament text based on these majority readings — "The Majority Text" — has been produced by [[Zane C. Hodges]] and Arthur L. Farstad, although this text does not correspond to any one particular manuscript.

== Characteristics of the Byzantine text ==
{{see also|List of major textual variants in the New Testament}}

Compared to [[Alexandrian text-type]] manuscripts, the distinct Byzantine readings tend to show a greater tendency toward smooth and well-formed Greek, they display fewer instances of textual variation between parallel [[Synoptic Gospel]] passages, and they are less likely to present contradictory or "[[Lectio difficilior potior|difficult]]" issues of [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Syrian text has all the appearance of being a careful attempt to supersede the chaos of rival texts by a judicious selection from them all." [[Brooke Foss Westcott]], [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]. ''The New Testament In The Original Greek'', 1925. p. 551&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 1:2 reads "As it is written in the prophets..." in the Byzantine text; whereas the same verse reads, "As it is written in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] the prophet..." in all other early textual witnesses. Since the quotation introduced is partly from [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], the Byzantine form of the verse avoids the difficulty that might be adduced were it to be concluded that Mark was presenting a factual inaccuracy.

Another characteristic is the grammar (e.g., οι δε ειπον; in Alexandrian text: οι δε ειπαν) and the different order of words. For example:

John 6:49

: εν τη ερημω το μαννα – codices [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|B]], [[Codex Ephraemi|C]], [[Codex Bezae|D]], T, [[Codex Washingtonianus|W]], [[Codex Koridethi|Θ]]
: το μαννα εν τη ερημω – codices [[Codex Sinaiticus|ﬡ]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|A]], [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|L]], [[Codex Athous Lavrentis|Ψ]], [[Family 1|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Family 13|''f''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]], mss. of the Byzantine text-type

Mark 1:9

: εις τον Ιορδανην υπο Ιωανου – codices ﬡ, B, D
: υπο Ιωανου εις τον Ιορδανην – codices A, W, and manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type

Also, the Byzantine text does not contain verses included by Textus Receptus: Luke 17:36; Acts 8:37; 15:34.

There are no consistent Byzantine witnesses amongst the early New Testament [[papyri (chronology)|papyri]]. Nevertheless, instances of distinctive Byzantine readings are not unusual in the earliest texts — even though they otherwise conform more to other text-types or none. Hence, many (and possibly most) distinctive Byzantine readings are likely to be early in date. Two broad explanations have been offered for this observation:

* that the Byzantine text-type transmits a text closest to the primary form of the New Testament books; whose early manuscript witnesses have not survived, as this text-type predominated in regions where the climate did not favour the preservation of papyrus;
* that the Byzantine text represents a consistent exercise in textual compilation and correction from around the 4th century, the editors having eclectically selected those readings from a range of early manuscripts, that best conformed to their presupposed standards of the characteristics to be expected in the New Testament text.

=== Special cases ===

In Mark 6:33 and Luke 24:53 the Byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Western text. In other cases the situation is more complicated. Mark 1:13 looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Caesarean text.

== Origin of the Byzantine text ==

In order to displace the [[Textus Receptus]] (see the following section) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the Greek New Testament, later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the Byzantine text which formed its base. This [[Westcott-Hort|Wescott and Hort]]'s Introduction accomplished in masterful detail (over the course of 600 pages) as the culmination of 28 years of laborious effort on their part.

They summarize the problem early on in their work (p.&amp;nbsp;45) as follows:
"A theoretical presumption indeed remains that a majority of extant documents is more likely to represent a majority of ancestral documents at each stage of transmission than vice versa." In the discussion that follows, they reason that the "incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work" in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that "every ground for expecting 'a priori' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westcotthort.com/books/Westcott_Hort_-_Introduction_to_the_New_Testament_in_the_Original_Greek_(2nd_1896).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those modern scholars who believe that the Byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs, there is some debate concerning the origin of the Byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use. The suggestions that have been put forward are:

* That [[Lucian of Antioch]] used his [[Textual criticism|text critical]] skills to produce a [[recension]]. ([[Jerome]] makes reference to Lucian's recension of the Old Testament only. Wescott and Hort favored this theory.)
* That [[Constantine I]] paid for the wide distribution of manuscripts which came from a common source. (There are several references by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to Constantine paying for [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|manuscript production]]).
* That after the [[Western Roman Empire]] stopped using Greek, and because of [[Barbarian]] and [[Muslim]] invasions, eliminating the possibility for either [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] or [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]] to exercise any further influence on the text of the Greek New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

(See also [[State church of the Roman Empire]].)

The standard Byzantine text used by the Eastern, Greek-speaking Greek Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century. However, some are earlier and a few papyri are also classified here. The early Byzantine text is near to the Alexandrian text in that it differs from the late Byzantine text in roughly 3000 places. Kurt Aland did not consider early Byzantine families such as E and Π to be classified as Byzantine manuscripts. He placed some of them into Category III of the Greek New Testament manuscripts. Aland placed all manuscripts with standard Byzantine text into Category V.

== The Textus Receptus ==

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by [[Erasmus]] and published by [[Johann Froben]] of Basel on March 1, 1516 ([[Novum Instrumentum omne]]). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglot]], Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the Byzantine text-type. Six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources, he back-translated from the Latin [[Vulgate]], and Erasmus also introduced many readings from the Vulgate and [[Church Fathers]]. This text came to be known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' or ''received text'' after being thus termed by [[Bonaventura Elzevir]], an enterprising publisher from the Netherlands, in his 1633 edition of Erasmus' text. The New Testament of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible was translated from editions of what was to become the ''Textus Receptus''. The different Byzantine "Majority Text" of Hodges &amp; Farstad  as well as [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] &amp; Pierpont is called "Majority" because it is considered to be the Greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the Greek manuscripts. The Textus Receptus differs from the Majority Text in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent "translatable" differences.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Marlowe states:[http://www.bible-researcher.com/majority.html] ''yet it differs from the Received Text in about a thousand places, most of them being trivial.'' while [[Daniel B. Wallace]] [http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=673] ''has counted 1,838 differences between it and the Textus Receptus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern critical texts ==

[[Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann|Karl Lachmann]] (1850) was the first New Testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the ''Textus Receptus'', relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the [[Alexandrian text-type]]. Although the majority of New Testament textual critics now favor a text that is [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] in complexion, especially after the publication of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]]'s [[Westcott-Hort|edition]], there remain some proponents of the Byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs. These critics include the editors of the Hodges and Farstad text (cited below), and the [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] and Pierpont text. Depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the Alexandrian text-type, then this will differ from the Hodges and Farstad text in around 6,500 readings (Wallace 1989).

To give a feel for the difference between the Byzantine form of text and the [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] text, which is mainly Alexandrian in character, of 800 variation units in the [[Epistle of James]] collected by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]], the Byzantine and Eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places (a rate of 92.3%). Many of the 69 disagreements involve differences in word order and other variants that do not appear as translatable differences in English versions. According to the preface to the [[New King James Version]] of the Bible, the [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Alexandrian text-type]] and the Byzantine text-type are 85% identical (that is, of the variations that occur in any manuscript, only 15% actually differ between these three).

The Byzantine type is also found in modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] editions. A new scholarly edition of the Byzantine Text of John's gospel, (funded by the [[United Bible Societies]] in response to a request from Eastern Orthodox Scholars), was begun in [[Birmingham]], UK. and in 2007, as a result of these efforts, ''The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-According-John-Byzantine-Tradition/dp/1598563076|title=The Gospel According to John in The Byzantine Tradition|author=|editor-first1=Roderic L.|editor-last1=Mullen|editor-first2=Simon|editor-last2=Crisp|editor-first3=D. C.|editor-last3=Parker|date=14 July 2008|publisher=Hendrickson Pub|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Soden divided manuscripts of the Byzantine text into five groups:

* K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, hundreds of minuscules, among them codex [[Minuscule 2|2]], [[Minuscule 3|3]], [[Minuscule 8|8]], 14, 45, 47, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 73, 75, 76, 78, etc.
* K&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, no early minuscules, hundreds of minuscules: 18, 35, 55, 66, 83, 128, 141, 147, 155, 167, 170, 189, 201
* K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (subfamily of K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;) — S V Ω 461
* K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (Family E) — [[Codex Basilensis A. N. III. 12|E]] [[Codex Boreelianus|F]] [[Codex Seidelianus I|G]] [[Codex Seidelianus II|H]]
* I&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; (also K&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), now Family Π — (A) K Y Π; this subgroup is the oldest, but only 5% of manuscripts belong to it. Majority of them have text mixed with other Byzantine subfamilies.

Since the discovery of the [[Papyrus 45]], [[Papyrus 46]], and [[Papyrus 66]], proof is available that occasionally the Byzantine text preserves a reading that dates from early witness. Examples:

Luke 10:39

: Ιησου — p&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; p&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt; A W Byz b

Other examples of Byzantine readings were found in p&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; in John 1:32; 3:24; 4:14.51; 5:8; 6:10.57; 7:3.39; 8:41.51.55; 9:23; 10:38; 12:36; 14:17. This supports the views of scholars such as Harry Sturz (1984) and [[Maurice A. Robinson|Maurice Robinson]] (2005) that the roots of the Byzantine text may go back to a very early date. (In 1963 Bruce Metzger had argued that early support for Byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text.)&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''Chapters in the History of New Testament Textual Criticism'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids 1963, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have interpreted this as a rehabilitation of Textus Receptus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''Dean Burgon in the Light of Recent Research''; D. A. Waite, ''Defending the King James Bible'', Bible For Today, Collingswood, New Jersey 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively Byzantine. Daniel Wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and Byzantine readings.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wallace, ''The Majority Text Theory: History, Methods, and Critique'', in Studies &amp; Documents 1995, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Camphill Svetlana is located on 57 [[hectare]]s of land, about 140 km east of [[Saint Petersburg]], near [[Lake Ladoga]]. The community currently consists of three houses, a farm building housing cattle and other livestock, and an adjoining dairy to process the milk. The village's primary activity is agriculture. Other activities include gardening, a bakery and a doll-making workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=702 "Svetlana Village Offers Therapeutic Refuge"], ''St. Petersburg Times'', June 8, 2004. Accessed 2009-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Camphill Svetlana Village was founded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] Margit Engel and Michael Michaelov of St Petersburg and received significant financial support from the Norwegian Camphill Village Trust and the Bennett Trust of Norway. In 1994, a 20-room prefabricated house was brought from Norway and assembled in a few weeks.  The house was subsequently named [[Fridtjof Nansen]] House, in honor of the Norwegian explorer and diplomat who intervened to alleviate [[Russian famine of 1921|famine in Russia]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=norway&gt;[http://www.camphillsvetlana.org/pages/norwegian_village.html Camphill Svetlana: a pioneering community: the "Norwegian Village"]. Accessed 2009-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The village participates on a regional level in an association of Village Communities from [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] which provides mutual support on cultural, educational, social and practical levels.&lt;ref name=norway/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">'''Christian materialism''' is the combination of Christian [[theology]] with the ideas of (ontological) [[materialism]], which says that matter is a fundamental substance of the world and mental phenomenon are part of it.

==Historical background==

Throughout history, Christian thought has struggled with the ideas of flesh, world, and spirit, and their interplay in each person's salvation. As [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Joseph Ratzinger]] said in ''What It Means To Be a Christian'' (2006), “Christian theology... in the course of time turned the kingdom of God into a kingdom of heaven that is beyond this mortal life; the well-being of men became a salvation of souls, which again comes to pass beyond this life, after death." 

This tendency of spiritualization, Ratzinger said, is not the message of Jesus Christ. "For what is sublime in this message," he stated, "is precisely that the Lord was talking not just about another life, not just about men’s souls, but was addressing the body, the whole man, in his embodied form, with his involvement in history and society; that he promised the kingdom of God to the man who lives bodily with other men in this history."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ratzinger, ''What It Means To Be a Christian'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Josemar&amp;#237;a Escriv&amp;#225; and Opus Dei==

The most visible use of the term is found in the writings of [[Josemaría Escrivá]], a Spanish [[Saint#Catholic hurch|Catholic saint]] of the twentieth century, who said that all temporal realities have a sanctifying power and Christians can find God in the most ordinary material things. As such, it is associated with the Roman Catholic prelature of [[Opus Dei]] which Escriva founded. It is an organization which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life, even the most material activity, is a path to sanctity.  

Escriva criticized those who "have tried to present the Christian way of life as something exclusively spiritual, proper to pure, extraordinary people, who remain aloof from the contemptible things of this world, or at most tolerate them as something necessarily attached to the spirit, while we live on this earth. When things are seen in this way, churches become the setting par excellence of the Christian life. And being a Christian means going to church, taking part in sacred ceremonies, being taken up with ecclesiastical matters, in a kind of segregated world, which is considered to be the ante-chamber of heaven, while the ordinary world follows its own separate path."

Instead, he affirmed the "high value of the material." According to him, "Authentic Christianity which professes the resurrection of all flesh, has always quite logically opposed 'dis-incarnation,' without fear of being judged materialistic. We can, therefore, rightfully speak of a ''Christian materialism,'' which is boldly opposed to those materialisms which are blind to the spirit." (Italics added; see also [http://www.escriva.it/Ing/19970301.htm])

In an address to a theological symposium, ''Holiness and the World'', which studied the teachings of Josemaria Escriva, [[John Paul II]] referred to one of his homilies: 

:There is nothing that is outside of the concern of Christ. Speaking with theological rigor ... one  cannot say that there are things — good, noble or even indifferent — which are exclusively profane; for the Word of God has made his dwelling the sons of men, he was hungry and thirsty, worked with his hands, knew friendship and obedience, experienced sorrow and death.&lt;ref&gt;(''Conversations'' 112)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In connection with this quote, John Paul II said that the Catholic Church today is "conscious of serving a redemption that concerns every aspect of human existence," an awareness which was "prepared by a gradual intellectual and spiritual development." He also said that the message of Escriva, which has contributed in this direction, stems "from a unique grasp of the radiant, universal force of the Redeemer's grace." He later called Escriva "one of Christianity's great witnesses."&lt;ref&gt;Syposium Holiness and the World&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dancemeditation''' is a moving meditation system incorporating [[Art]], Somatics and the [[Mysticism]] of Sufism.&lt;ref name="consciousdancer.com"&gt;http://www.consciousdancer.com/articles/careers-motion-body-language-dancemeditation-where-matter-and-inspiration-meet&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was developed in 1995 by Dunya Dianne McPherson after completing 1001 days of [[Sufi]] training with Sufi Master Adnan Sarhan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sufifoundation.org/about.htmAdnan%20Sarhan&lt;/ref&gt; The materials resourced provide doorways and ignition points to embodied spiritual illumination, healing, and growth. Teaching Dancemeditation means to come from the embodied practices that have been honed within the practicing Dancemeditation community over the past 20 years.

Dancemeditation can be done alone, as a personal practice. It is primarily offered in group environments with approximately {{fraction|2|3}}–{{fraction|3|4}} of the session engaged in shared, side-by-side solitude with the remaining time devoted to group interaction. "Shared Solitude" can include quiet exercises with eyes closed on one’s mat, to active dancing with eyes closed. Group interactions include partner and small group exercises, entire group improvisation, and circles led by individuals.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;http://www.intelligentexercise.com/articles.html, The Feeling of Me&lt;/ref&gt; Dancemeditation is occasionally offered in private session according to the teacher’s preference, demographic, and goals. There is an annual Movement Monastery which is a retreat period under the direction of Principal Teacher Dunya Dianne McPherson.

The official school of Dancemeditation is a network of independent, inter-connected teachers who have completed an intensive Certification training with Founder. The training is completed primarily at Movement Monastery which includes time in a secluded setting to focus on practices, [[body cleansing]] diet, spiritual discussion, and silence. In order to receive the initial Certificate level, teachers have completed 80 days of dedicated training. Advanced Levels of Teaching Certification with more stringent criteria follow.Teachers offer work in various formats and locations. Many events are public offerings. In addition, Dancemeditation teachers work through institutional settings—universities, hospitals, school systems.

==Spirituality vs. religious systems==
Dancemeditation allows practitioners to explore and experience that which is deep, profound, and spiritual without having to adopt or contain that experience in a belief system. In Dancemeditation, practitioners are free to follow their own intuition to where it needs to leads them. A helpful guiding comment comes from Sufi Shervin Nekuee, (director of the Mystic Festival in Netherlands.) "Who am I to judge your mysticism?" regarding Dancemeditation as a Sufi practice.

Dancemeditation doesn't ask its practitioners to define a higher power, or even have one, nor does it prevent them from having one. It is primarily an ecumenical spiritual system, or a spiritual system that embraces interfaith pluralism. There has never been, nor will there be, a request to follow doctrine.

The Path of Dancemeditation is a full valid Path in itself. It is not an ancillary discipline to any other established Path. 
At the same time, the Path of Dancemeditation does not obstruct practitioners from including other work on an equal level with the Path of Dancemeditation within their own hearts and efforts.

==The music==
The music for Dancemeditation is primarily acoustic or "mildly enhanced". Genres include [[world music]], contemplative, classical, folk much of which has no lyrics or lyrics in languages that students will not typically understand. This allows for deeper levels of concentration within the Self as opposed to the lyrics moving the emotions.

==Basic components==
Basic components include:
*Rocking array: Rocking the body with focus on specific body parts.
*Sand tracings: executed from a prone position this series of exercises.
*Opening sequence: a breath-based series of repetitive stretches.

Basic practice subjects include:
*Breath dances: Rhythmic and non-rhythmic breathing.
*Gesture: Hands are most commonly used in gesturing, but the whole body or parts of it can create gestures.
*Deep state motion: "Deep State" practices are a direct handing of the lineage of Sufism.
*[[Sufi whirling]]: Whirling is a Sufi purification practice most commonly associated with the Whirling Dervishes of the Mevlevi Order of Sufi.

Spiritual [[belly dance]] components of Dancemeditation consists of the following subjects and exercises.
* Vibration
** Rocking: Rocking the body in parts or as a whole.
** Fragmentation: Breaking down movement into smaller and smaller parts, or "micromotions".
*Undulation
** Ornamental movement: Drawing curves with the body, in part or whole.
** [[Fascia]] awareness: Attention to the connective tissue brings deeper focus with greater sensitivity to subtle movement.
** Non-rhythmic breath extends movement beyond the normal breath pulse.
* Veil work: Use of a silk veil draws attention to imagery, design, tempo and sensation.
* Layers and momentum: The exercises used to develop physical awareness and deep focus through "micromotion", breathing and repetition are combined.

==Training==
Spiritual belly dance has been offered at [[Kripalu]] since 2009. 
Summer Movement Monasteries are offered yearly for two weeks in June.
Long and short training intensives, weekly classes, gatherings, performances and workshops are offered by Dunya, as well as by over 30 licensed instructors, internationally.&lt;ref name="consciousdancer.com"/&gt;

'''ESP-r''' is an [[open-source]]d building performance energy modeling software that was created by the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strath.ac.uk/esru/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is primarily used in research, as a tool for consultants or as a teaching tool.  ESP-r can model the thermal, visual and acoustic performance of a building as well as to estimate the heat, moisture and electrical power of the modeled building.

ESP-r calculates [[building performance]] values based on a finite volume approach where it solves a set of conservation equations. It was developed in 1974 and was converted in 2002 to the [[GNU Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=39/pagename=alpha_list&lt;/ref&gt;  ESP-r is designed to work on the [[Unix]] operating system yet can be run in Windows using a Unix modulator or run with the Windows version. The current ESP-r Archivist is [[Ian Beausoleil Morrison]].

Some advantages that ESP-r has are its power and flexibility enables a well-informed user to optimize a house.  The power behind ESP-r is its holistic nature and range to features.  The downside is that the details and lack of documentations means users need specific knowledge to complete complex tasks.  ESP-r is still mainly a research tool even though it is used for some consulting and teaching applications.

ESP-r has been extensively validated and there are various studies and thesis done on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Strachan P A. 2000. 'ESP-r: Summary of Validation Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Bloch''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɛʁnst ˈblɔx|lang}}; July 8, 1885 – August 4, 1977) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

Bloch was influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]], as well as by apocalyptic and religious thinkers such as [[Thomas Müntzer]], [[Paracelsus]], and [[Jacob Boehme]].&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kołakowski, Leszek |title=Main Currents of Marxism Volume 3: The Breakdown |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |pages=421–449 |isbn=0-19-285109-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established friendships with [[György Lukács]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Kurt Weill]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. Bloch's work focuses on the thesis that in a [[Humanism|humanistic]] world where [[oppression]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] have been eliminated there will always be a truly [[revolutionary]] force.

==Life==
Bloch was born in [[Ludwigshafen]], the son of a [[Jews|Jewish]] railway-employee. After studying philosophy, he married Else von Stritzky, daughter of a Baltic brewer in 1913, who died in 1921. His second marriage with Linda Oppenheimer lasted only a few years. His third wife was [[Karola Bloch|Karola Piotrowska]], a [[Poland|Polish]] [[architect]], whom he married in 1934 in [[Vienna]]. When the Nazis came to power, they had to flee, first into Switzerland, then to Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, and finally the United States.

In 1948, Bloch was offered the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]], and he returned to [[East Germany]] to take up the position. In 1955 he was awarded the National Prize of the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]]. In addition, he became a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]] (AdW). He had more or less become the political philosopher of the GDR. Among his many academic students from this period was his assistant [[Manfred Buhr]], who earned his doctorate with him in 1957, and was later professor in [[Greifswald]], then director of the Central Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences (ADC) in Berlin and who became a critic of Bloch.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

However, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising in 1956]] led Bloch to revise his view of the SED (Socialist Unity Party) regime, whilst retaining his Marxist orientation. Because he advocated [[humanism|humanistic]] ideas of freedom, he was obliged to retire in 1957 for political reasons – not because of his age, 72 years. A number of scientists and students spoke publicly against this forced retirement, among them the renowned professor and colleague [[Emil Fuchs (theologian)|Emil Fuchs]] and his students as well as Fuchs's grandson [[:de:Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski|Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

When the [[Berlin Wall]] was built in 1961, he did not return to the GDR, but went to [[Tübingen]] in [[West Germany]], where he received an honorary chair in Philosophy. He died in Tübingen.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Thought==
Bloch's ''[[The Principle of Hope]]'' was written during his emigration in the United States, where he lived briefly in [[New Hampshire]] before settling in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He wrote the lengthy three-volume work in the reading room of Harvard's [[Widener Library]]. Bloch originally planned to publish it there under the title ''Dreams of a Better Life''. ''The Principle of Hope'' tries to provide an encyclopedic account of mankind's and nature's orientation towards a socially and technologically improved future.

==Influence==
[[File:EndloseTreppeLutherturm.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Endlose Treppe]]'' by [[Max Bill]], which is dedicated to the ''Principle of Hope'' by Bloch.]]
Bloch's work became very influential in the course of the student [[Protests of 1968|protest movements in 1968]] and in [[liberation theology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} 
It is cited as a key influence by [[Jürgen Moltmann]] in his ''Theology of Hope'' (1967, Harper and Row, New York), by [[Dorothee Sölle]], and by [[Ernesto Balducci]]. Psychoanalyst [[Joel Kovel]] has praised Bloch as, "the greatest of modern utopian thinkers".&lt;ref name="Kovel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kovel, Joel |title=History and Spirit: An Inquiry into the Philosophy of Liberation |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |year=1991 |page=261  |isbn=0-8070-2916-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. Corrington]] has been influenced by Bloch, though he has tried to adapt Bloch's ideas to serve a liberal rather than a Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Corrington, Robert S. |title=Nature and Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |year=1992 |page=113 |isbn=0-8232-1363-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch's concept of concrete utopias found in ''The Principle of Hope'' was used by [[José Esteban Muñoz]] to shift the field of [[performance studies]]. This shift allowed for the emergence of utopian performativity and a new wave of performance theorizing as Bloch's formulation of utopia shifted how scholars conceptualize the ontology and the staging of performances as imbued with an enduring indeterminacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cruising Utopia The Then and There of Queer Futurity|last=Muñoz|first=José Esteban|publisher=NYU Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to dominant performance theories found in the work of [[Peggy Phelan]], who view performance as a life event without reproduction.

== Awards ==
In 2005, the Presidency of the French Republic has awarded him with the "Palmes Académiques". In 2009, he received the International Price of Philosophy "Karl-Otto Apel", and in 2013 the title of Doctor honoris causa by the Universidad Nacionál de Córdoba (Argentina).

== Works ==
In his book ''Marxism and Revisionism in Italy'' (1971) he regards [[Gentile]]'s thought as the philosophical keystone of Italian Marxism. He is the author of ''The Political and the Transformations'' (1979) and ''Power and Secularization'' (1985). He has been one of the most important re-discoverers of [[Carl Schmitt]]'s thought and of [[decisionism]].

In 2006 a collection of essays was published to celebrate his 60th birthday (Figure del conflitto, Valter Casini Editore, Roma), with international contributions by, among others: [[Remo Bodei]], [[Massimo Cacciari]], Franco Rella, [[Manfred Frank]], [[Jean L. Cohen]], [[Adriana Cavarero]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Rüdiger Bubner]], [[Axel Honneth]], [[Marc Augé]], Manuel Cruz, Jorge E. Dotti, and [[Salvador Giner]].

In 2015, to Marramao's thesis on the "philosophy of globalization" was devoted an entire issue of the US magazine "Politica Común": ''On Giacomo Marramao's "The Passage West"'', University of Michigan Library, Ann Arbor (with contributions of Peter Baker, Stefano Franchi, Martin Jay, Andy Lantz, Manuela Marchesini, Alberto Moreiras, Pedro Ángel Palou, Carlos Rodríguez, Teresa M. Vilarós, Hayden White, and with a broad response of Marramao). Of this volume was published an Italian edition: ''Filosofia dei mondi globali. Conversazioni con Giacomo Marramao'', ed. by Stefano Franchi and Manuela Marchesini, Bollati Boringhieri, Torino 2017 ({{ISBN|978-88-339-2845-6}}).

== Philosophical stance ==
Starting from the study of Italian and European Marxism (''Marxism and Revisionism in Italy'', 1971; ''Austro-Marxism and left wing Socialism between the two Wars'', 1977), Marramao has analysed the political categories of modernity suggesting – on the same wavelength as the [[Frankfurt School]] (''The political and its transformations'', 1979) and [[Max Weber]] (''The disenchanted order'', 1985)– an innovative symbolic-genealogical reconstruction of them. According to this view, which recovers [[Karl Löwith]]'s historical-philosophical hypothesis, in modern forms of social organizations there are settled meanings deriving from a process of secularization of religious contents – that is, the re-proposal of the Christian symbolic horizon inside a worldly dimension. In particular, secularization finds its centre in a process of "temporalization of history" thanks to which the categories of time (that translate Christian [[eschatology]] into a generic opening to the future: progress, revolution, liberation, etc.) gain an increasing centrality in the political representations of Modernity.

Based on these reflections, also exposed in ''After the Leviathan'', 1995 (third edition in 2013) and ''The Passion of the Present'', 2008, a clear thematization of the philosophical problem of time has grown up. In opposition to [[Henri Bergson]]'s and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s views, which delineate with different shades a pure form of temporality, more original than its representations and spatializations, Marramao declares that the link time-space is inseparable and, also connecting to contemporary Physics, he asserts that the structure of Time possesses an aporetic and impure profile, compared to which the dimension of space is the formal reference necessary to think its paradoxes (''Minima temporalia'', 1990, new edition in 2005; ''Kairos: Towards an Ontology of Due Time'', 1992, new edition in 2005).

{{nihongo|'''Hayashi Ryūkō'''|林 榴岡||1681 &amp;ndash; December 11, 1758}} was a Japanese [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar, teacher and administrator in the system of higher education maintained by the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa ''bakufu'']] during the [[Edo period]]. He was a member of the [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi clan]] of Confucian scholars.

==Academician==
Hōkō was the fourth Hayashi clan ''Daigaku-no-kami'' of the Edo period.

Hōkō is known as the second official [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Shōhei-kō]].&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric ''et al.'' (2005). ''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt;  This academy would come to be known as the [[Yushima Seidō]]) . This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  Ryūkō's hereditary title was ''[[Daigaku-no-kami]],'' which, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as "head of the state university.''&lt;ref&gt;De Bary, William ''et al.'' (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA443&amp;dq= ''Sources of Japanese Tradition,'' Vol. 2, p. 443.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Beebee''' is the Samuel Hall Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name=directory&gt;{{cite web|title=Online directory (The University of Manchester)|url=http://directory.manchester.ac.uk/advanced.php?dn=cn%3DHelen+Beebee%2Bumanroleid%3D1584%2Cou%3DPhilosophy%2Cou%3DSchool+of+Social+Sciences%2Cou%3DFaculty+of+Humanities%2Cou%3DPeople%2Co%3DUniversity+of+Manchester%2Cc%3DGB&amp;employeeType=STAFF&amp;action=read&amp;form_input=Submit|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beebee's work has been influential across a wide variety of fields, including [[Causality|causation]], [[free will]], and natural kinds.&lt;ref name=newapps&gt;{{cite web|last=Schliesser|first=Eric|title=Most underrated philosopher of the week: Helen Beebee|url=http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/05/most-underrated-philosopher-of-the-week-helen-beebee.html|publisher=NewApps|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Schliesser]], writing on NewApps, described Beebee as 'one of the most prominent [[metaphysic]]ists of our time.'&lt;ref name=newapps/&gt; Beebee has a significant interest in the problem of underrepresentation of women in the field of philosophy, and has spoken about the problems that face women philosophers in a modern academic context, such as in her paper "Women and Deviance in Philosophy".&lt;ref name=na2&gt;{{cite web|last=Protevi|first=John|title=Women in Philosophy: What Needs to Change?|url=http://www.newappsblog.com/2013/07/women-in-philosophy-what-needs-to-change.html|publisher=Newapps|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Education and career==
Beebee received her bachelor's from the [[University of Warwick]], her master's from the [[University of Liverpool]], and her doctorate from [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web|last=Beebee|first=Helen|title=Prof Helen Beebee, research profile - personal details|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/hum/Helen.beebee/|publisher=The University of Manchester|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beebee is currently the Samuel Hall Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, a position she has held since 2012.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; Before her current position, Beebee held full-time appointments at the University of Manchester, and the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;  During her time at Birmingham, she served as Head of Department, and later as Head of School.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;  Besides for her permanent appointments, Beebee has also held temporary appointments at the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[University of St. Andrews]], and the [[University College, London]], and has also held a postdoctoral position at [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Research areas==
A majority of Beebee's research could be broadly classed as dealing with [[David Hume|Humeanism]] and related issues.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; She has written on a wide variety of topics related to Humeanism, including attempting to tackle the question of whether or not the laws of nature govern what happens, whether inductive scepticism follows necessary from a Humeanistic approach, and whether or not it is possible to observe causal relations in a meaningful way.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;  She has also written on Hume himself.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;  Beebee also has a secondary interest in free will, particularly in bringing Humean approaches to the problem of compatibilitism.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Publications==
Beebee is on the editorial boards of ''[[Hume Studies]]'' as well as the ''[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]]''.  She's also an associate editor of the ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]''.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;  She has co-authored two textbooks, written two books and numerous book chapters, and published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals of philosophy.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Controversy==
In August, 2011, the ''[[Times Higher Education]] Supplement'' reported on an email sent by Beebee, then Head of School of Philosophy, Theology and Religion at Birmingham University, to staff in the School. The email urged staff to be "VERY generous" when assessing postgraduate applications, warning that they "simply cannot afford to be very choosy". Malcolm McCrae, chair of the UK Council for Graduate Education, in voicing his opinion of the email and practice at Birmingham said, "It is well known that students whose capabilities are not on a par with the demands of the programme they are following always turn out to be much more work, accentuating the pressure to compromise academic standards in an effort to get already recruited students through to...completion," and added that when such students started jobs, it would "quickly become apparent that they aren't up to the quality their qualification says they should be".&lt;ref name=timeshighered&gt;{{cite web|last=Jump|first=Paul|title=Head urges staff to go easy on postgrad applicants|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/head-urges-staff-to-go-easy-on-postgrad-applicants/417092.article|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Hirata}}
{{Nihongo|'''Hirata Atsutane'''|平田 篤胤||6 October 1776 &amp;ndash; 2 November 1843}} was a [[Japan]]ese scholar, conventionally ranked as one of the [[Four Great Men of Kokugaku]] (nativist) studies, and one of the most significant theologians of the [[Shinto|Shintō]] religion. His literary name was '''Ibukinoya'''.

==Life and thought==
Hirata was born to a low-ranking ''[[samurai]]'' family of Akita domain (in present-day [[Akita Prefecture]]) in the [[Tōhoku region]] of northern Japan. His father was named Ōwada Yoshitane, and Hirata was adopted by [[Bitchū-Matsuyama Domain|Matsuyama]] retainer Hirata Tōbei, from whom he received the family name of Hirata in 1800. Little is known of his early life, but Hirata was a student of the [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Yamazaki Ansai]] (1619–1682) in [[Edo]]. He later turned towards [[Daoism]] as found in the works of the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], and towards Shintō as per the works of [[Motoori Norinaga]], founder of the ''kokugaku'' movement.

Though he is traditionally ranked fourth in the lineage of ''kokugaku'' scholars, Hirata actually represents a break with the purely scholarly urban culture characteristic of the revival of classical nativist learning, and represents a trend toward a populist message. Hirata laid particular emphasis on reaching the average man, and adapted his own style to them by employing at times the vernacular idiom.

Hirata claimed later to have received the mantle of ''kokugaku'' teacher in a dream directly from [[Motoori Norinaga]], but the story is apocryphal. Hirata's interest in ''kokugaku'' postdates Motoori's own death.

Hirata was a prolific writer. Representative works in the study of ancient Japanese traditions include ''Tama no mihashira'' (The True Pillar of Spirit), ''Koshi seibun'' (Treatise on Ancient History), ''Kodō taii'' (True Meaning of the Ancient Way) and ''Zoku Shintō taii'' (True Meaning of Common Shintō), and the commentaries ''Koshi-chō'' and ''Koshi-den''. He is also noted for his studies of ancient Indian and Chinese tradition (''Indo zōshi'' and ''Morokoshi taikoden''), and texts dealing with the spirit world, including ''Senkyō ibun'' (Strange Tales of the Land of Immortals) and ''Katsugorō saisei kibun'' (Chronicle of the Rebirth of Katsugorō). His early work ''Honkyō gaihen'' indicates an acquaintance with Christian literature that had been authored by Jesuits in China.

Hirata frequently expressed hostility to the Confucian and Buddhist scholars of the day, advocating instead a revival of the “ancient ways” in which the [[Imperial House of Japan|emperor]] was to be revered. Hirata's first published work, ''Kamosho'' (1803) was a scathing attack on the works of Confucian philosopher [[Dazai Shundai]] (1680–1747)  on Buddhism, and resulted in an invitation to teach from the Yoshida family, the hereditary clan leading [[Yoshida Shinto]].

The contents of his 1841 treatise ''Tenchō mukyūreki'' (Chronicle of the Perpetual Rule of the Emperor) angered the ruling [[Tokugawa bakufu]] government, and he was sentenced to confinement in Akita until his death in 1843.

Hirata's activities eventually attracted over 500 pupils, including [[Okuni Takamasa]] and [[Suzuki Shigetane]]. His [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]] writings had considerable impact on the ''samurai'' who supported the ''[[Sonnō jōi]]'' movement and who fought in the [[Boshin War]] to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate during the [[Meiji Restoration]].

==Influence==
Atsutane's influence on kokugaku has recently been thought to be overestimated. While he is called one of the "four great men of kokugaku", this is a phrase he invented himself.  His work more often influenced religious groups than the government in the [[Empire of Japan]].

Among Atsutane's more enduring contributions to Japanese thought was the idea that all Japanese were descended from the gods, not only the Imperial family and certain aristocratic families. As he put it, "this, our glorious land, is the land in which the gods have their origin, and we are one and all descendants of the gods. For this reason, if we go back from the parents who gave us life and being, beyond the grandparents and great-grandparents, and consider the ancestors of ancient times, then the original ancestors of those must necessarily have been the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Earl, David Margarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan, Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, 1964, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50035">The historical reliability of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the principal historical source for the [[Apostolic Age]], is of interest for [[biblical scholars]] and historians of [[Early Christianity]] as part of the debate over the [[historicity of the Bible]].

Archaeological inscriptions and other independent sources show that Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. However, the historicity of the depiction of [[Paul the Apostle]] in Acts is contested. Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cain |first1=Seymour |last2=et al |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |chapter-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature/73440/The-Acts-of-the-Apostles?anchor=ref598122 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en |chapter=Biblical literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts differs with Paul's letters on important issues, such as the [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Law]], Paul's own [[Apostle (Christian)#The Apostle to the Gentiles: Paul of Tarsus|apostleship]], and his relation to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]].&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;  Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stephen|author-link=Stephen L Harris |title=Understanding the Bible: A Reader's Introduction |date=1985 |publisher=Mayfield Pub.

==Composition==

===Narrative===
''[[Luke–Acts]]'' is a two-part historical account traditionally ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], who was believed to be a follower of Paul. The author of ''Luke&amp;ndash;Acts'' noted that there were many accounts in circulation at the time of his writing, saying that these were eye-witness testimonies. He stated that he had investigated "everything from the beginning" and was editing the material into one account from the birth of Jesus to his own time. Like other historians of his time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aune|first=David|author-link=David Aune|title=The New Testament in Its Literary Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7F_5kPoTTnoC&amp;pg=PA77|year=1988|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-227-67910-4|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marguerat2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Marguerat|title=The First Christian Historian: Writing the 'Acts of the Apostles'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2FM_F_jAd4C&amp;pg=PA63|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43630-4|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothschild2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare K.

However, most scholars understand ''Luke&amp;ndash;Acts'' to be in the tradition of [[Greek historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert M., "A Historical Introduction to the New Testament" (Harper and Row, 1963) {{cite web |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1116&amp;C=1230 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621102923/http://religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1116&amp;C=1230 |archivedate=2010-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Thomas E. "The Genre of Acts: Moving Toward a Consensus?" ''[[Currents in Biblical Research]]'' 4 [2006] 365 – 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hengel classifies Acts as a "historical monograph," as accurate as the work of any other ancient historian. Cadbury thinks the author is closest to being a historian, but writes on a popular level. Others compare the author to the ancient historian Thucydides, particularly in the matter of composed speeches that strive for verisimilitude. L. Donelson characterizes the author as a cult historian who travels from place to place gathering traditions, setting down the origin of the sect. Pervo observes that even scholars such as Haenchen who rate the author as highly unreliable nevertheless classify him as a historian.", Setzer, "Jewish responses to early Christians: history and polemics, 30–150 C.E." (1994). Fortress Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of sources===
It has been claimed that the author of Acts used the writings of Josephus (specifically "[[Antiquities of the Jews]]") as a historical source.&lt;ref&gt;‘This theory was maintained by F. C. Burkitt (The Gospel History and its Transmission, 1911, pp. 105–110), following the arguments of Krenkel’s Josephus und Lucas (1894).’, Guthrie, ‘New Testament Introduction’, p. 363 (4th rev. ed. 1996). Tyndale Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Clearly Luke makes significant use of the LXX in both the gospels and Acts. In addition it is often alleged that he made use of the writings of Josephus and the letters of Paul. The use of the LXX is not debatable, but the influence of Josephus and Paul has been and is subjected to considerable debate.', Tyson, 'Marcion and Luke-Acts: a defining struggle', p. 14 (2006).University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of scholars reject both this claim and the claim that Josephus borrowed from Acts,&lt;ref&gt;‘Neither position has much of a following today, because of the significant differences between the two works in their accounts of the same events.’, Mason, ‘Josephus and the New Testament’, p. 185 (1992). Baker Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'After examining the texts myself, I must conclude with the majority of scholars that it is impossible to establish the dependence of Luke-Acts on the Antiquitates.', Sterling, 'Historiography and Self-Definition: Josephus, Luke-Acts, and Apologetic Historiography', Supplements to Novum Testamentum, pp. 365–366 (1992). Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Most scholars today deny any dependence one way or the other, and we think this judgment is correct.', Heyler, 'Exploring Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period: A Guide for New Testament Students', p. 362 (2002). InterVarsity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing instead that Luke and Josephus drew on common traditions and historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;'Sterling concludes that, while it is impossible to establish a literary dependence of Luke-Acts on the writings of Josephus, it is reasonable to affirm that both authors not only had access to similar historical traditions but also shared the same historiographical techniques and perspectives.', Verheyden, 'The Unity of Luke-Acts', p. 678 (1990). Peeters Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'It seems probable that Luke and Josephus wrote independently of one another; for each could certainly have had access to sources and information, which he then employed according to his own perspectives. A characteristic conglomerate of details, which in part agree, in part reflect great similarity, but also in part, appear dissimilar and to stem from different provenances, accords with this analysis.', Schreckenberg &amp; Schubert, 'Jewish Historiography and Iconography in Early and Medieval Christian Literature', Compendia Rerum Iudicarum Ad Novum Testamentum, volume 2, p. 51 (1992). Uitgeverij Van Gorcum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The relationship between Luke and Josephus has produced an abundant literature, which has attempted to show the literary dependence of one on the other. I do not believe that any such dependence can be proved.', Marguerat, 'The First Christian Historian: writing the "Acts of the Apostles"', p. 79 (2002). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Arguments for the dependence of passages in Acts on Josephus (especially the reference to Theudas in Acts v. 37) are equally unconvincing. The fact is, as Schurer has said: "Either Luke had not read Josephus, or he had forgotten all about what he had read"', Geldenhuys, 'Commentary on the Gospel of Luke', p. 31 (1950).Tyndale Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'After examining the texts myself, I must conclude with the majority of scholars that it is impossible to establish the dependence of Luke-Acts on the Antiquitates. What is clear is that Luke-Acts and Josephus shared some common traditions about the recent history of Palestine.', Sterling, 'Historiography and Self-Definition: Josephus, Luke-Acts, and Apologetic Historiography', Supplements to Novum Testamentum, pp. 365–366 (1992). Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'When we consider both the differences and the agreement in many details of the information in the two accounts, [of the death of Herod Agrippa I] it is surely better to suppose the existence of a common source on which Luke and Josephus independently drew.', Klauck &amp; McNeil, 'Magic and Paganism in Early Christianity: the world of the Acts of the Apostles', p. 43 (2003). Continuum International Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have criticised the author's use of his source materials. For example, Richard Heard has written that, "in his narrative in the early part of Acts he seems to be stringing together, as best he may, a number of different stories and narratives, some of which appear, by the time they reached him, to have been seriously distorted in the telling."&lt;ref&gt;Heard, Richard: An Introduction to the New Testament Chapter 13: The Acts of the Apostles, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

===Textual traditions===
Like most New Testament books, there are differences between the earliest surviving manuscripts of Acts.  In the case of Acts, however, the differences between the surviving manuscripts are more substantial than most. Arguably the two earliest versions of manuscripts are the [[Western text-type]] (as represented by the [[Codex Bezae]]) and the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (as represented by the [[Codex Vaticanus]] and the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] which was not seen in Europe until 1859).  The version of Acts preserved in the Western manuscripts contains about 6.2-8.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicklas |first=Tobias |date= Jan 1, 2003 |title= The Book of Acts as Church History |location= New York |publisher= Die Deutsche Bibliothek|pages= 32–33 |isbn=978-3-11-017717-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; more content than the Alexandrian version of Acts (depending on the definition of a variant).&lt;ref name=Hornik2017/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

Modern scholars consider that the shorter Alexandrian text is closer to the original, and the longer Western text is the result of later insertion of additional material into the text.&lt;ref name=Hornik2017/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

A third class of manuscripts, known as the [[Byzantine text-type]], is often considered to have developed after the Western and Alexandrian types. While differing from both of the other types, the Byzantine type has more similarity to the Alexandrian than to the Western type. The extant manuscripts of this type date from the 5th century or later; however, papyrus fragments show that this text-type may date as early as the Alexandrian or Western text-types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Colwell |first1=Ernest C. |title=Studies in methodology in textual criticism of the New Testament |date=1969 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004015555 |series=New Testament Tools, Studies and Documents, Volume: 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–48}} The Byzantine text-type served as the basis for the 16th century [[Textus Receptus]], produced by [[Erasmus]], the first Greek-language printed edition of the New Testament.  The Textus Receptus, in turn, served as the basis for the New Testament in the English-language [[King James Bible]].  Today, the Byzantine text-type is the subject of renewed interest as the possible original form of the text from which the Western and Alexandrian text-types were derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Maurice A |last2=Pierpont |first2=William G. |title=The New Testament in the original Greek : Byzantine textform|date= 2005 |publisher=Chilton Book Pub |isbn=0-7598-0077-4 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

==Historicity==
The debate on the historicity of Acts became most vehement between 1895 and 1915.&lt;ref&gt;"In the period approximately 1895–1915 there was a far reaching, multi-facted, high-level debate over the historicity of Acts.", Hemer &amp; Gempf, "The Book of Acts in the Setting of Hellenistic History", p.3 (1990). Mohr Siebeck.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]] viewed it as unreliable, and mostly an effort to reconcile gentile and Jewish forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name=Hornik2017/&gt;{{rp|10}}  [[Adolf von Harnack]] in particular was known for being very critical of the accuracy of Acts, though his allegations of its inaccuracies have been described as "exaggerated hypercriticism" by some.&lt;ref&gt;"It is difficult to acquit Harnack here of an exaggerated hypercriticism. He constructed a lengthy list of inaccuracies (Harnack, ''Acts'' pp. 203–31), but most of the entries are bizarrely trivial:", Hemer &amp; Gempf, "The Book of Acts in the Setting of Hellenistic History", p. 7 (1990). Mohr Siebeck.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes towards the historicity of Acts have ranged widely across scholarship in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;"British scholarship has been relatively positive about Acts' historicity, from Lightfoot and Ramsay to W.L. Knox and Bruce. German scholarship has, for the most part, evaluated negatively the historical worth of Acts, from Baur and his school to Dibelius, Conzelmann, and Haenchen. North American scholars show a range of opinion. Mattill and Gasque align with the British approach to Acts. Cadbury and Lake take a moderate line and to some degree sidestep the question of accurate historicity.", Setzer, "Jewish responses to early Christians: history and polemics, 30–150 C.E.", p. 94 (1994). Fortress Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017 consensus had emerged among scholars that the letters of Paul are more reliable for information about Paul than Acts and that, according to Heidi J. Hornik and Mikeal C. Parsons, "Acts must be carefully sifted and mined for historical information."&lt;ref name=Hornik2017/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Passages consistent with the historical background===
Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society, specifically with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-9CKE1F_uK8C&amp;q=synchronization#v=snippet&amp;q=synchronization&amp;f=false Talbert, "Reading Luke-Acts in its Mediterranean Milieu", pp. 198–200 (2003). Brill.]&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* Inscriptions confirm that the city authorities in Thessalonica in the 1st century were called [[politarch]]s ({{bibleverse||Acts|17:6–8|KJV|}})
* According to inscriptions, grammateus is the correct title for the chief magistrate in [[Ephesus]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|19:35|KJV|}})
* [[Antonius Felix|Felix]] and [[Porcius Festus|Festus]] are correctly called [[Procurator (Roman)|procurators]] of [[Iudaea Province|Judea]]
* The passing remark of the expulsion of the Jews from [[Rome]] by [[Claudius]] is independently attested by [[Suetonius]] in [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|''Claudius'' 25]] from ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' ({{bibleverse||Acts|18:2|KJV|}})
* Acts correctly refers to [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] as [[centurion]] and to [[Claudius Lysias]] as a [[Military tribune|tribune]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|21:31|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Acts|23:36|KJV|}})
* The title [[proconsul]] (anthypathos) is correctly used for the governors of the two [[senatorial province]]s named in Acts ({{bibleverse||Acts|13:7–8|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Acts|18:12|KJV|}})
* Inscriptions speak about the prohibition against the Gentiles in the inner areas of the Temple (as in {{bibleverse||Acts|21:27–36|KJV|}}); see also [[Court of the Gentiles]]
* The function of town assemblies in the operation of a city's business is described accurately in {{bibleverse||Acts|19:29–41|KJV|}}
* Roman soldiers were permanently stationed in the tower of [[Antonia Fortress|Antonia]] with the responsibility of watching for and suppressing any disturbances at the festivals of the Jews; to reach the affected area they would have to come down a flight of steps into temple precincts, as noted by {{bibleverse||Acts|21:31–37|KJV|}}

Talbert concludes that the historical inaccuracies within Acts "are few and insignificant compared to the overwhelming congruence of Acts and its time [until AD 64] and place [Palestine and the wider Roman Empire]".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Talbert cautions nevertheless that "an exact description of the milieu does not prove the historicity of the event narrated".&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, "Reading Luke-Acts in its Mediterranean Milieu", p. 201 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst treating its description of the history of the early church skeptically, critical scholars such as [[Gerd Lüdemann]], Alexander Wedderburn, [[Hans Conzelmann]], and [[Martin Hengel]] still view Acts as containing valuable historically accurate accounts of the earliest Christians.

Lüdemann acknowledges the historicity of Christ’s post-resurrection appearances,&lt;ref&gt;‘"There were in fact appearances of the heavenly Jesus in Jerusalem (after those in Galilee)" (ibid., 29–30)”’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 164 (2004); he attributes the appearances to hallucination.&lt;/ref&gt; the names of the early disciples,&lt;ref&gt;‘"The names of the disciples of Jesus are for the most part certainly historical[”].’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 164 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; women disciples,&lt;ref&gt;‘[“]The existence of women disciples as members of the earliest Jerusalem community is also a historical fact" (ibid., 31).’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 164 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and Judas Iscariot.&lt;ref&gt;‘"The disciple Iscariot is without doubt a historical person... [who] made a decisive contribution to delivering Jesus into the hands of the Jewish authorities" (ibid., 35–36).’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 165 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Wedderburn says the disciples indisputably believed Christ was truly raised.&lt;ref&gt;‘Whatever one believes about the resurrection of Jesus,5 it is undeniable that his followers came to believe that he had been raised by God from the dead, that the one who had apparently died an ignominious death, forsaken and even accursed by his God, had subsequently been vindicated by that same God., ’ Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 17 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Conzelmann dismisses an alleged contradiction between {{bibleverse||Acts|13:31|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Acts|1:3|KJV|}}.&lt;ref&gt;‘According to this verse Jesus seems to appear only to the apostles (for Luke, the Twelve), while the parallel in 13:31* says he appeared to all who went with him on the journey from Galilee to Jerusalem. The contradiction is not a serious one, however, nor is there any real difference between the forty days mentioned in this text and the ἡμέρας πλείους, “many days,” of 13:31*.’, Conzelmann, Limber (trans.), Epp, &amp; Matthews (eds.), ‘Acts of the Apostles: A commentary on the Acts of the Apostles’, Hermeneia, p. 5 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Hengel believes Acts was written early&lt;ref&gt;'That makes it all the more striking that Acts says nothing of Paul the letter-writer. In my view this presupposes a relatively early date for Acts, when there was still a vivid memory of Paul the missionary, but the letter-writer was not known in the same way.', Hengel &amp; Schwemer, 'Paul Between Damascus and Antioch: the unknown years', p. 3 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; by Luke as a partial eyewitness,&lt;ref&gt;'Contrary to a widespread anti-Lukan scholasticism which is often relatively ignorant of ancient historiography, I regard Acts as a work that was composed soon after the Third Gospel by Luke 'the beloved physician' (Col. 4:14), who accompanied Paul on his travels from the journey with the collection to Jerusalem onwards. In other words, as at least in part an eye-witness account for the late period of the apostle, about which we no longer have any information from the letters, it is a first-hand source.', Hengel &amp; Schwemer, 'Paul Between Damascus and Antioch: the unknown years', p. 7 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; praising Luke’s knowledge of Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;‘So Luke-Acts looks back on the destruction of Jerusalem, which is still relatively recent, and moreover is admirably well informed about Jewish circumstances in Palestine, in this respect comparable only to its contemporary Josephus. As Matthew and John attest, that was no longer the case around 15–25 years later; one need only compare the historical errors of the former Platonic philosopher Justin from Neapolis in Samaria, who was born around 100 CE.’, Hengel &amp; Schwemer, 'Paul Between Damascus and Antioch: the unknown years', pp. 7–8 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and of Jewish customs in Acts 1:12.&lt;ref&gt;‘The term 'a sabbath day's journey', which appears only here in the New Testament, presupposes an amazingly intimate knowledge — for a Greek — of Jewish customs.’, Hengel, ‘Between Jesus and Paul: studies in the earliest history of Christianity’, p. 107 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; 
With regard to {{bibleverse||Acts|1:15–26|KJV|}}, Lüdemann is skeptical with regard to the appointment of Matthias, but not with regard to his historical existence.&lt;ref&gt;‘"One is... inclined to challenge the historicity of the election of Matthias... This does not mean, though, that the Jerusalem Christians Matthias and Joseph were not historical figures" (ibid., 37).’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 166 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Wedderburn rejects the theory that denies the historicity of the disciples,&lt;ref&gt;‘Yet is such a theory not an act of desperation?21 Is it not in every way simpler to accept that the Twelve existed during Jesus’ lifetime and that Judas was one of them?’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 22 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘The presence of some names in the list is, in view of their relative obscurity, most easily explained by their having indeed been members of this group.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 22 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Conzelmann considers the upper room meeting a historical event Luke knew from tradition,&lt;ref&gt;‘A local tradition about the meeting place can still be detected. The upper room is the place for prayer and conversation (20:8*; cf. Dan 6:11*), and for seclusion (Mart. Pol. 7.1). The list of names agrees with Luke 6:13–16*.’, Conzelmann, Limber (trans.), Epp, &amp; Matthews (eds.), ‘Acts of the Apostles: A commentary on the Acts of the Apostles’, Hermeneia, pp. 8–9 (1987); he nevertheless believes the waiting for the spirit is a fiction by Luke.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hengel considers ‘the Field of Blood’ to be an authentic historical name.&lt;ref&gt;'The Aramaic designation Akeldamakc for 'field of blood' has been correctly handed down in Acts 1:19; this is a place name which is also known by Matthew 27:8', Hengel, ‘The Geography of Palestine in Acts’, in Bauckham (ed.), ‘The Book of Acts in its Palestinian Setting’, p. 47 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Acts 2, Lüdemann considers the Pentecost gathering as very possible,&lt;ref&gt;‘Although doubting that the specification "Pentecost" belongs to the tradition, Lüdemann supposes, on the basis of references to glossolalia in Paul's letters and the ecstatic prophecy of Philip's daughters (Acts 21:9), that "we may certainly regard a happening of the kind described by the tradition behind vv.1–4 as very possible."’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 166 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and the apostolic instruction to be historically credible.&lt;ref&gt;‘"The instruction by the apostles is also to be accepted as historical, since in the early period of the Jerusalem community the apostles had a leading role. So Paul can speak of those who were apostles before him (in Jerusalem!, Gal. 1.17)" (40.)’, Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 166 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Wedderburn acknowledges the possibility of a ‘mass ecstatic experience’,&lt;ref&gt;‘It is also possible that at some point of time, though not necessarily on this day, some mass ecstatic experience took place.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 26 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and notes it is difficult to explain why early Christians later adopted this Jewish festival if there had not been an original Pentecost event as described in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;‘At any rate, as Weiser and Jervell point out,39 it needs to be explained why early Christians adopted Pentecost as one of their festivals, assuming that the Acts account was not reason enough.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 27 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds the description of the early community in Acts 2 to be reliable.&lt;ref&gt;‘Many features of them are too intrinsically probable to be lightly dismissed as the invention of the author. It is, for instance, highly probable that the earliest community was taught by the apostles (2:42)—at least by them among others.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 30 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Again, if communal meals had played an important part in Jesus’ ministry and had indeed served then as a demonstration of the inclusive nature of God’s kingly rule, then it is only to be expected that such meals would continue to form a prominent part of the life of his followers (Acts 2:42, 46), even if they and their symbolic and theological importance were a theme particularly dear to ‘Luke’s’ heart.47 It is equally probable that such meals took place, indeed had to take place, in private houses or in a private house (2:46) and that this community was therefore dependent, as the Pauline churches would be at a later stage, upon the generosity of at least one member or sympathizer who had a house in Jerusalem which could be placed at the disposal of the group. At the same time it might seem unnecessary to deny another feature of the account in Acts, namely that the first followers of Jesus also attended the worship of the Temple (2:46; 3:1; 5:21, 25, 42), even if they also used the opportunity of their visits to the shrine to spread their message among their fellow-worshippers. For without question they would have felt themselves to be still part of Israel.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 30 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lüdemann views Acts 3:1–31 as historical.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite what is in other respects the negative result of the historical analysis of the tradition in Acts 3–4:31, the question remains whether Luke's general knowledge of this period of the earliest community is of historical value. We should probably answer this in the affirmative, because his description of the conflict between the earliest community and the priestly nobility rests on correct historical assumptions. For the missionary activity of the earliest community in Jerusalem not long after the crucifixion of Jesus may have alarmed Sadducean circles... so that they might at least have prompted considerations about action against the Jesus community.", Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, pp. 168–169 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Wedderburn notes what he sees as features of an idealized description,&lt;ref&gt;‘The presence of such idealizing features does not mean, however, that these accounts are worthless or offer no information about the earliest Christian community in Jerusalem.46 Many features of them are too intrinsically probable to be lightly dismissed as the invention of the author.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 30 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; but nevertheless cautions against dismissing the record as unhistorical.&lt;ref&gt;‘At the same time it might seem unnecessary to deny another feature of the account in Acts, namely that the first followers of Jesus also attended the worship of the Temple (2:46; 3:1; 5:21, 25, 42), even if they also used the opportunity of their visits to the shrine to spread their message among their fellow-worshippers. For without question they would have felt themselves to be still part of Israel.48 The earliest community was entirely a Jewish one; even if Acts 2:5 reflects an earlier tradition which spoke of an ethnically mixed audience at Pentecost,49 it is clear that for the author of Acts only Jewish hearers come in question at this stage and on this point he was in all probability correct.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 30 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Hengel likewise insists that Luke described genuine historical events, even if he has idealized them.&lt;ref&gt;‘There is a historical occasion behind the description of the story of Pentecost in Acts and Peter's preaching, even if Luke has depicted them with relative freedom.’, Hengel &amp; Schwemer, 'Paul Between Damascus and Antioch: the unknown years', p. 28 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Luke's ideal, stained-glass depiction in Acts 2–5 thus has a very real background, in which events followed one another rapidly and certainly were much more turbulent than Acts portrays them.’, Hengel &amp; Schwemer, 'Paul Between Damascus and Antioch: the unknown years', p. 29 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedderburn maintains the historicity of communal ownership among the early followers of Christ (Acts 4:32–37).&lt;ref&gt;‘Is there any truth, however, in Acts’ repeated references to a sharing of goods or is this simply an idealizing feature invented by the author? For a start it is not clear whether he envisages property being sold and the proceeds distributed to the needy (so in 2:45; 4:34–5, 37) or whether the property is retained but the use of it is shared with other members of the community (cf. 2:44, ‘all things in common’). Yet even this uncertainty is most readily intelligible if at least one of these variants is traditional; if anything is to be attributed to the author’s idealizing tendency it is the motif of ‘all things in common’, but, as we saw, the mention in 12:12 of the house of Mary, John Mark’s mother, points to a concrete example of something not sold, but held in common. If Barnabas possessed a field (4:37), on the other hand, then this is not likely to have been so immediately useful to the Jerusalem community, particularly if it was in his native Cyprus; yet it has been suggested that it was near Jerusalem (and may first have been sold when Barnabas was despatched to, or left for, Antioch—Acts 11:22).55 Some would certainly regard the whole picture of this sharing, in whatever form, as the product of the author’s imagination, but it is to be noted, not only that what he imagines is not wholly clear, but also that there are contemporary parallels which suggest that such a sharing is by no means unthinkable.’, Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, pp. 31–33 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Conzelmann, though sceptical, believes Luke took his account of Acts 6:1–15 from a written record;&lt;ref&gt;‘Behind this account lies a piece of tradition which Luke must have had in written form; note the manner in which the “Hellenists” and “Hebrews” are introduced.’, Conzelmann, Limber (trans.), Epp, &amp; Matthews (eds.), ‘Acts of the Apostles: A commentary on the Acts of the Apostles’, Hermeneia, p. 44 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; more positively, Wedderburn defends the historicity of the account against scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;‘A quarrel arose because the widows of the ‘Hellenists’ were neglected in the daily distribution of aid. This is depicted as an internal squabble which had to be settled within the Christian community and that implies that the earliest Christian community already had its own poor-relief system. Some have doubted that and therefore regard this account as anachronistic.10 Yet it is to be noted that it hangs together with the account of the pooling of resources mentioned earlier in Acts: the church had the means to offer aid and, indeed, if it did not use what was offered to it in some such way, it is difficult to see how it would otherwise have used such funds.’,Wedderburn, ‘A History of the First Christians’, p. 44 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Lüdemann considers the account to have a historical basis.&lt;ref&gt;‘The tradition of the presence in Jerusalem of the groups named in v. 9 has a good deal to be said for it historically...', Lüdemann quoted by Matthews, ‘Acts and the History of the Earliest Jerusalem Church’, in Cameron &amp; Miller (eds.), ‘Redescribing Christian origins’, p. 171 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passages of disputed historical accuracy===

====Acts 2:41 and 4:4 – Peter's addresses====
{{bibleverse||Acts|4:4|KJV|}} speaks of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] addressing an audience, resulting in the number of Christian converts rising  to 5,000 people.  A Professor of the New Testament [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert M. Grant]] says "Luke evidently regarded himself as a historian, but many questions can be raised in regard to the reliability of his history […] His ‘statistics’ are impossible; Peter could not have addressed three thousand hearers [e.g. in {{bibleverse||Acts|2:41|KJV|}}] without a microphone, and since the population of Jerusalem was about 25–30,000, Christians cannot have numbered five thousand [e.g. Acts 4:4]."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert M., "A Historical Introduction to the New Testament", p. 145 (Harper and Row, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acts 5:33–39: Theudas====
{{main|Theudas#The Theudas problem}}
{{bibleverse||Acts|5:33–39|KJV}} gives an account of speech by the 1st century Pharisee [[Gamaliel]] (d. ~50ad), in which he refers to two first century movements. One of these was led by [[Theudas]].&lt;ref&gt;Acts, 5:36&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards another was led by [[Judas the Galilean]].&lt;ref&gt;Acts 5:37&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus placed Judas at the [[Census of Quirinius]] of the year 6 and Theudas under the procurator [[Cuspius Fadus|Fadus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=188&amp;letter=T&amp;search=theudas Jewish Encyclopedia: Theudas]: "Bibliography: Josephus, Ant. xx. 5, § 1; Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. II. ii.; Schmidt, in Herzog-Plitt, Real-Encyc. xv. 553–557; Klein, in Schenkel, Bibel-Lexikon, v. 510–513; Schürer, Gesch. i. 566, and note 6."&lt;/ref&gt; in 44–46. Assuming Acts refers to the same Theudas as Josephus, two problems emerge. First, the order of Judas and Theudas is reversed in Acts 5. Second, Theudas's movement may come after the time when Gamaliel is speaking. It is possible that Theudas in Josephus is not the same one as in Acts, or  that it is Josephus who has his dates confused.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. M. Wedderburn, ''A History of the First Christians'', Continuum, 2004, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The late 2nd-century writer [[Origen]] referred to a Theudas active before the birth of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Contra Celsum 1.57&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible that this simply draws on the account in ''Acts''.

====Acts 10:1: Roman troops in Caesarea====
{{bibleverse||Acts|10:1|KJV|}} speaks of a Roman Centurion called [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] belonging to the "Italian regiment" and stationed in [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]. Robert Grant claims that during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa]], 41–44, no Roman troops were stationed in his territory.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert M., A Historical Introduction to the New Testament, p. 145 (Harper and Row, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; Wedderburn likewise finds the narrative "historically suspect",&lt;ref&gt;"The reference to the presence in Caesarea of a centurion of the 'Italian' cohort is, however, historically suspect. If a cohors Italica civium Romanorum is meant, i.e. a cohort of Roman auxiliaries consisting chiefly of Roman citizens from Italy, then such a unit may have been in Syria shortly before 69 (cf. Hemer, Book, 164), but was one to be found in Caesarea in the time just before Herod Agrippa I's death (cf. Haenchen, Acts, 346 n. 2 and 360); Schurer, HIstory 1, 366 n. 54)?", Wedderburn, "A History of the First Christians", p. 217 (2004). Continuum Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; and in view of the lack of inscriptional and literary evidence corroborating Acts, historian de Blois suggests that the unit either did not exist or was a later unit which the author of Acts projected to an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;"As for the Italian cohort, Speidel claims that it is a ''cohors civium Romanorum''. Speidel actually identifies a ''cohors II Italica c.R.'' that was in Syria as early as AD 63, though it moved to Noricum before the Jewish war. As he argues, this unit could be the one called the speire tes kaloumenes Italike in the New Testament's Acts of the Apostles. The unit is not mentioned by Josephus nor is there epigraphical evidence for it at Caesarea nor anywhere in Judea. It is possible that the unit did not exist or was a later Syrian unit displaced to a different place and earlier time.", de Blois et al (eds.), "The Impact of the Roman Army (200 B.C. – A.D. 476): Economic, Social, Political, Religious and Cultural Aspects: Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Roman Empire, 200 B.C. – A.D. 476), Capri, Italy, March 29 – April 2, 2005", p. 412 (2005). Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting that the 'Italian regiment' is generally identified as ''cohors II Italica civium Romanorum'', a unit whose presence in [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judea]] is attested no earlier than AD 69,&lt;ref&gt;"There is inscriptional evidence for the presence in Syria in A.D. 69 of the auxiliary ''cohors II Italica civium Romanorum'' (Dessau, ILS 9168); but we have no direct evidence of the identity of the military units in Judaea between A.D. 6 and 41. from A.D. 41 to 44, when Agrippa I reigned over Judaea (see on 12:1), one important corps consisted of troops of Caesarea and Sebaste, Kaisareis kai Sebasthnoi (Jos. Ant. 19.356, 361, 364f.), who did not take kindly to the command of a Jewish king.", Bruce, "The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary", p. 252 (1990). Eerdmans.&lt;/ref&gt; historian E Mary Smallwood observes that the events described from Acts 9:32 to chapter 11 may not be in chronological order with the rest of the chapter but actually take place after Agrippa's death in chapter 12, and that the "Italian regiment" may have been introduced to Caesarea as early as AD 44.&lt;ref&gt;"''Acts'' x, 1, speirh Italikh, generally identified with ''cohors II Italica c. R.,'' which was probably in Syria by 69 – Gabba, ''Iscr. Bibbia'' 25-6 (=ILS 9168; ''CIL'' XI, 6117); c.f. P.-W., s.v. ''cohors'', 304. Jackson and Lake, ''Beginnings'' V, 467-9, argue that the events of Acts ix, 32-xi are misplaced and belong after Agrippa I's death (ch. xii). If so, the ''cohors Italica'' may have come in with the reconstitution of the province in 44 (below, p. 256).", Smallwood, "The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: a study in political relations" p.147 (2001). Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Wedderburn notes this suggestion of chronological re-arrangement, along with the suggestion that Cornelius lived in Caesarea away from his unit.&lt;ref&gt;"Others date the incident either before Herod's reign (so Bruce, History, 261, following Acts' sequence) or more likely after it, unless one supposes that this officer had been seconded to Caesarea without the rest of his unit (cf. also Hengel, 'Geography', 203-4 n. 111).", Wedderburn, "A History of the First Christians", p. 217 (2004). Continuum Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as Bond,&lt;ref&gt;"One of these infantry cohorts may well have been the ''cohors II Italica civium romanorum voluntariorum'' referred to in Acts 10; see Hengel, Between, p. 203, n. 111.", Bond, "Pontius Pilate in History and Interpretation", p. 13 (1998). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Speidel,&lt;ref&gt;"Certainly after Titus' Jewish war the Flavian emperors revamped the Judaean army, and at the same time ''cohors II Italica'' seems to have been transferred north into Syria, as were ''ala'' and ''cohors I'' Sebastenorum of the same provincial army, yet for the time of the procurators there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of Acts 10.", Speidel, "Roman Army Studies', volume 2, p. 228 (1992). JC Bieben.&lt;/ref&gt; and Saddington,&lt;ref&gt;"The ''Coh. Italica'' and, possibly also, the ''Coh. Augusta'' were prestigious regiments. Their operation in Judaea cannot be placed before AD 40 on the evidence available, but it is of course possible that they had been sent there before that, even under the first prefect after the fall of Archelaus.", Saddington, "Military and Administrative Personnel in the NT", in "Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt", pp. 2417–2418 (1996).

====Acts 15: The Council of Jerusalem====
{{main|Council of Jerusalem#Historicity}}
The description of the '[[Council of Jerusalem|Apostolic Council]]' in {{bibleverse||Acts|15|KJV|}}, generally considered the same event described in {{bibleverse||Galatians|2|KJV|}},&lt;ref&gt;"In spite of the presence of discrepancies between these two accounts, most scholars agree that they do in fact refer to the same event.", Paget, "Jewish Christianity", in Horbury, et al., "The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Early Roman Period", volume 3, p. 744 (2008). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered by some scholars to be contradictory to the Galatians account.&lt;ref&gt;"Paul's account of the Jerusalem Council in Galatians 2 and the account of it recorded in Acts have been considered by some scholars as being in open contradiction.", Paget, "Jewish Christianity", in Horbury, et al., "The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Early Roman Period", volume 3, p. 744 (2008). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of Luke's account has been challenged,&lt;ref&gt;"There is a very strong case against the historicity of Luke's account of the Apostolic Council", Esler, "Community and Gospel in Luke-Acts: The Social and Political Motivations of Lucan Theology", p. 97 (1989). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The historicity of Luke's account in Acts 15 has been questioned on a number of grounds.",  Paget, "Jewish Christianity", in Horbury, et al., "The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Early Roman Period", volume 3, p. 744 (2008). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"However, numerous scholars have challenged the historicity of the Jerusalem Council as related by Acts, Paul's presence there in the manner that Luke described, the issue of idol-food being thrust on Paul's Gentile mission, and the historical reliability of Acts in general.", Fotopolous, "Food Offered to Idols in Roman Corinth: a socio-rhetorical reconsideration", pp. 181–182 (2003). Mohr Siebeck.&lt;/ref&gt; and was rejected completely by some scholars in the mid to late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Sahlin rejects the historicity of Acts completely (Der Messias und das Gottesvolk [1945]). Haenchen’s view is that the Apostolic Council “is an imaginary construction answering to no historical reality” (The Acts of the Apostles [Engtr 1971], p. 463). Dibelius’ view (Studies in the Acts of the Apostles [Engtr 1956], pp. 93–101) is that Luke’s treatment was literary-theological and can make no claim to historical worth.", Mounce, "Apostolic Council", in Bromiley (ed.) "The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia", volume 1, p. 200 (rev. ed. 2001). Wm. B. Eerdmans.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent scholarship inclines towards treating the Jerusalem Council and its rulings as a historical event,&lt;ref&gt;"There is an increasing trend among scholars toward considering the Jerusalem Council as  historical event. An overwhelming majority identifies the reference to the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 with Paul's account in Gal. 2.1–10, and this accord is not just limited to the historicity of the gathering alone but extends also to the authenticity of the arguments deriving from the Jerusalem church itself.", Philip, "The Origins of Pauline Pneumatology: the Eschatological Bestowal of the Spirit",  Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament 2, Reihe, p. 205 (2005). Mohr Siebeck.&lt;/ref&gt; though this is sometimes expressed with caution.&lt;ref&gt;"The present writer accepts its basic historicity, i.e. that there was an event at Jerusalem concerning the matter of the entry of the Gentiles into the Christian community, but would be circumspect about going much further than that. For a robust defence of its historicity, see Bauckham, "James", and the relevant literature cited there.", Paget, "Jewish Christianity", in Horbury, et al., "The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Early Roman Period", volume 3, p. 744 (2008). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acts 15:16–18: James' speech====
In {{bibleverse||Acts|15:16–18|KJV|}}, James, the leader of the Christian Jews in Jerusalem, gives a speech where he quotes scriptures from the Greek [[Septuagint]] ({{bibleverse||Amos|9:11–12|KJV|}}). Some believe this is incongruous with the portrait of James as a Jewish leader who would presumably speak Aramaic, not Greek. For instance, [[Richard Pervo]] notes: "The scriptural citation strongly differs from the [[Masoretic Text|MT]] which has nothing to do with the inclusion of gentiles. This is the vital element in the citation and rules out the possibility that the historical James (who would not have cited the [[Septuagint|LXX]]) utilized the passage."&lt;ref&gt;Pervo, Richard I., ''Acts – a commentary'', Fortress Press, Minneapolis, 2009, p. 375-376&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible explanation is that the Septuagint translation better made James's point about the inclusion of Gentiles as the people of God.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A., ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'', Cook Communications Ministries, Colorado Springs Colorado, 2004, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. John Barnett stated that "Many of the Jews in Jesus' day used the Septuagint as their Bible".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, John, ''What Bible did Jesus use?'', http://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/tips/11638841.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Aramaic was a major language of the Ancient Near East, by Jesus's day Greek had been the [[lingua franca]] of the area for 300 years.

====Acts 21:38: The sicarii and the Egyptian====
In {{bibleverse||Acts|21:38|KJV|}}, a Roman asks Paul if he was '[[Egyptian (prophet)|the Egyptian]]' who led a band of '[[sicarii]]' (literally: 'dagger-men') into the desert. In both The Jewish Wars&lt;ref&gt;Jewish War 2.259–263&lt;/ref&gt; and Antiquities of the Jews,&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Antiquities 20.169–171&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus talks about Jewish nationalist rebels called sicarii directly prior to talking about The Egyptian leading some followers to the [[Mount of Olives]]. Richard Pervo believes that this demonstrates that Luke used Josephus as a source and mistakenly thought that the sicarii were followers of The Egyptian.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, Josephus and Luke-Acts, Josephus and the New Testament (Hendrickson Publishers: Peabody, Massachusetts, 1992), pp. 185–229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pervo, Richard, ''Dating Acts: between the evangelists and the apologists'' (Polebridge Press, 2006), p. 161-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Two early sources that mention the [[origins of Christianity]] are the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' by the Roman-Jewish historian [[Josephus]], and the [[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'' of Eusebius]]. Josephus and Luke-Acts are thought to be approximately contemporaneous, around AD 90, and Eusebius wrote some two and a quarter centuries later.

'''Johann Augustus Eberhard''' (August 31, 1739 – January 6, 1809) was a German [[Theology|theologian]] and "popular [[Philosophy|philosopher]]".

==Life and career==
Eberhard was born at [[Halberstadt]] in the [[Principality of Halberstadt]], where his father was a school teacher and the singing master at the church of St. Martin's.  He studied theology at the [[University of Halle]], and became tutor to the eldest son of Baron von der Horst, to whose family he was attached for several years.  In 1763 he was appointed co-rector of the school of St. Martin's, and second preacher in the hospital church of the Holy Ghost, but he soon resigned these offices and followed his patron to Berlin.  There he met [[C. F. Nicolai]] and [[Moses Mendelssohn]], with whom he formed a close friendship, and who were instrumental in his forming his own views.  In 1768 he became chaplain to the [[workhouse]] at Berlin and the neighbouring fishing village of [[Stralow]].  Here he wrote his ''Neue Apologie des Socrates'' (1772), a work occasioned by an attack on the fifteenth chapter of [[Jean-François Marmontel]]'s ''[[Belisarius]]'' by [[Peter Hofstede]], a [[Rotterdam]] clergyman.

In 1774 he was appointed to the living of [[Charlottenburg]].  A second volume of his ''Apologie'' appeared in 1778.  In this he tried to meet some objections to the former part, and continued his inquiries into the doctrines of the Christian religion, [[religious toleration]], and the proper rules for interpreting the Scriptures.  In 1778 he accepted the professorship of philosophy at Halle, where his students included [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and the Serbian writer [[Dositej Obradović]].  In 1786 he was admitted as a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]]; in 1805 the King of Prussia conferred upon him the honorary title of privy-councillor.  In 1808 he obtained the degree of Doctor in Divinity, which was awarded for his theological writings.  He died in Berlin in 1809.

He was a master of the learned languages, spoke and wrote French fluently, and understood English, Italian and Dutch.

==Theological and philosophical work==

===Theology===
Eberhard argued in books such as ''Neue Apologie des Socrates'' that [[salvation]] did not depend upon [[revelation]], that it was possible for a {{linktext|heathen}} to go to [[heaven]], and that the notion of eternal punishment contradicted its supposed aim of morally improving the sinner.

===Philosophy===
Eberhard argued in support of [[John Locke]]'s position that all knowledge comes through the senses, but developed this into a full-blooded [[phenomenalism]].  In [[aesthetics]] he held a position that he called "subjective finalism", a label later adopted by [[Immanuel Kant]]: rather than being an objective property of objects, beauty is the relationship between the object and the representative power of the observer.  For him, then, art should aim to awake and stimulate the pleasurable passions. According to Eberhard, aesthetic activity first appears in children's play.

In his position as editor of the ''Philosophisches Magazin'' (1788–1792) and the ''Philosophisches Archiv'' (1792–1795), Eberhard published many articles (most of which he wrote himself) critical of Kant.  He argued that Kant's work was wholly derivative, simply adopting the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and a variety of [[dogmatism]].  Kant responded to Eberhard's criticism in his ''Ueber eine Entdeckung, nach der alle neue Kritik der reinen Vernunft durch eine ältere entbehrlich gemacht werden soll'' (Königsberg, 1790).

===Works===
*''Neue Apologie des Socrates'' (two volumes, 1776-1778)
*''Allgemeine Theorie des Denkens und Empfindens'' (Berlin, 1776), won the [[Royal Society of Berlin]] prize for that year
*''Von dem Begriff der Philosophie und ihren Theilen'' (Berlin, 1778) — a short essay, in which he announced the plan of his lectures on being appointed to the professorship at Halle
*''Lobschrift auf Herrn Johann Thunmann Prof. der Weitweisheit und Beredsamkeit auf der Universität zu Halle'' (Halle, 1779)
*''Vorbereitung zur natürlichen Theologie'' (Halle, 1781) (translated as ''Preparation for Natural Theology'' (Bloomsbury, 2016)

*''Neue vermischte Schriften'' (Halle, 1786)
*''Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie'' (Halle, 1788), second edition with a continuation and chronological tables (1796)
*''Versuch einer allgemeinen-deutschen Synonymik'' (Halle and Leipzig, 1795–1802, six volumes, fourth edition 1852–1853) — an abridgment was published by the author in one large volume (Halle, 1802)
*''Handbuch der Aesthetik'' (Halle, 1803–1805, second edition 1807–1820).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">'''Just another Perl hacker''', or '''JAPH''', typically refers to a [[Perl]] program which prints "Just another Perl hacker," (the comma is [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical but is occasionally omitted).  Short JAPH programs are often used as [[signature block|signatures]] in online [[Internet forum|forums]], or as [[T-shirt]] designs.  The phrase or acronym is also occasionally used (without [[Computer programming|code]]) for a signature.

JAPH programs are classically done using extremely [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] methods, in the spirit of the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest|Obfuscated C Contest]].  More recently, as the phenomenon has become so well known, the phrase is sometimes used in ordinary examples (without obfuscation).

The idea of using tiny Perl programs which print a signature ''as a signature'' was originated by [[Randal L. Schwartz]], in his postings to the [[newsgroup]] comp.lang.perl.&lt;ref&gt;Randal L. Schwartz in [[Usenet]] message M1HFPVH2JQ.FSF@HALFDOME.HOLDIT.COM explaining the origin of JAPH. Available through  [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/ecc405feeefc120c Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the JAPHs below are his.

==Examples==

JAPH program without obfuscation:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
print "Just another Perl hacker,";
&lt;/source&gt;

Embedding JAPH in opaque code:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_='987;s/^(\d+)/$1-1/e;$1?eval:print"Just another Perl hacker,"';eval;
&lt;/source&gt;

Decoding JAPH from a transposed [[string literal]]:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_="krJhruaesrltre c a cnP,ohet";$_.=$1,print$2while s/(..)(.)//;
&lt;/source&gt;

Printing out JAPH as separate processes:
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
for $i (0..4) { if (!fork) {
      $i == 0 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "J" } } or
      $i == 1 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "A" } } or
      $i == 2 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "P" } } or
      $i == 3 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "H" } } ;
      sleep $i; last; } } kill INT =&gt; $$;
&lt;/source&gt;

Appearing as if it does something completely unrelated to printing JAPH:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_ = "wftedskaebjgdpjgidbsmnjgc";
tr/a-z/oh, turtleneck Phrase Jar!/; print;
&lt;/source&gt;

Forking processes to print out one letter each in the correct order:&lt;ref&gt;[http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/ Plover.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
@P=split//,".URRUU\c8R";@d=split//,"\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ";sub p{
@p{"r$p","u$p"}=(P,P);pipe"r$p","u$p";++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord
($p{$_})&amp;6];$p{$_}=/ ^$P/ix?$P:close$_}keys%p}p;p;p;p;p;map{$p{$_}=~/^[P.]/&amp;&amp;
close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&amp;&amp;&lt;$_&gt;}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
&lt;/source&gt;

Using only Perl [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] (no [[punctuation]]):&lt;ref&gt;Originally posted at [http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=290607 perlmonks.org] by user blokhead&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;

each return local x y or print qq
s s and eval q s undef or oct xor
time xor ref print chr int ord lc
foreach qw y hex alarm chdir kill
exec return y s gt sin sort split
&lt;/source&gt;

Using only [[punctuation]], no [[alphanumeric]] characters (written by [https://metacpan.org/author/ROODE Eric Roode]; only works on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems):

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
`$=`;$_=\%!;($_)=/(.)/;$==++$|;($.,$/,$,,$\,$",$;,$^,$#,$~,$*,$:,@%)=(
$!=~/(.)(.).(.)(.)(.)(.)..(.)(.)(.)..(.)......(.)/,$"),$=++;$.++;$.++;

;$,++;$^|=$";`$_$\$,$/$:$;$~$*$%[$?]$.$~$*${#}$%[$?]$;$\$"$^$~$*.&gt;&amp;$=` 
&lt;/source&gt;

A much shorter one, using only punctuation, based on the [https://metacpan.org/module/Acme::EyeDrops EyeDrops] module:
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
''=~('(?{'.('-)@.)@_*([]@!@/)(@)@-@),@(@@+@)'

&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Leonid pitamic.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Leonid Pitamic]]
'''Leonid Pitamic''' (15 December 1885 – 30 June 1971)&lt;ref name="Umrli"&gt;[http://www.sazu.si/o-sazu/clani/umrli.html Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti: Umrli člani SAZU]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[lawyer]], [[Philosophy of law|philosopher of law]], [[diplomat]], and [[academic]].

== Life ==

He was born in the [[Carniola]]n town of [[Postojna]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], today in [[Slovenia]]. After finishing the classical lyceum in [[Gorizia]] and the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]], he enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]], where he studied law. After graduation in 1908, he worked in the local branches of the state administration in [[Carniola]], and later in the ministerial offices in Vienna. In 1915, he obtained [[habilitation]] in Austrian [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], and in 1917 in philosophy of law. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he became a member of the administrative commission of the National Government of the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]].

In 1919, he served as a legal expert in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Yugoslav]] delegation at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]]. The same year, he was named professor at the newly formed [[University of Ljubljana]]. In September 1920, he was named as Secretary for Internal Affairs in the Regional Government for Slovenia. In December of the same year, he became the last president of the regional government before its dissolution. In the 1920s, he worked as the Yugoslav deputy delegate at the [[League of Nations]], and between 1929 and 1935 as the ambassador of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] to the [[United States]].

Between 1926 and 1927, he served as [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the University of Ljubljana. After his return from the United States in 1935, he resumed teaching at the universities of Ljubljana and [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]]. In the academic year 1940/41 was elected dean of the Faculty of Law and remained there as a professor until June 1952, when he finally retired.&lt;ref name="Pavčnik"&gt;Pavčnik, Marijan. 1996. ''Leonid Pitamic'' (= ''Zbirka Pravna obzorja'' 6). Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, pp. 481–484. {{ISBN|961-231-007-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, he became a member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and in 1938 of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana]] (later renamed the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts). In 1948 the Communist regime expelled him from the academy. His academy membership was reinstated after his death in 1971 and it was unofficially reinstated after 1988 and officially in 1996.&lt;ref name="Pavčnik"/&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

He died in [[Ljubljana]] and was buried in [[Žale]] cemetery.

== Work ==
Pitamic published several treatises on philosophy of law. He was the follower of the theories of [[legal positivism]] established by [[Hans Kelsen]]. His most important work is the volume ''Država'' (The State), published in 1927 and translated into English in 1933 under the title ''A Treatise on the State''.

'''Leszek Kołakowski''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|s|k|i}}; {{IPA-pl|ˈlɛʂɛk kɔwaˈkɔfskʲi|lang}}; 23 October 1927 – 17 July 2009) was a Polish [[philosopher]] and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]].

He is best known for his critical analyses of [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought, especially his three-volume history, ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' (1976). In his later work, Kolakowski increasingly focused on religious questions. In his 1986 [[Jefferson Lecture]], he asserted that "We learn history not in order to know how to behave or how to succeed, but to know who we are."&lt;ref name="Idolatry 1"&gt;Leszek Kołakowski, "The Idolatry of Politics,"  reprinted in ''Modernity on Endless Trial'' (University of Chicago Press, 1990, paperback edition 1997), {{ISBN|0-226-45045-7}}, {{ISBN|0-226-45046-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-45046-9}}, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his [[Criticism of Marxism|criticism of Marxism and Communism]], Kołakowski was effectively exiled from Poland in 1968. He spent most of the remainder of his career at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. Despite this exile, Kołakowski was a major inspiration for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] that flourished in Poland in the 1980s and helped bring about the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], leading to his being described as the "awakener of human hopes".&lt;ref name=Steinhauer2015&gt;Jason Steinhauer (2015). "'The Awakener of Human Hopes': Leszek Kolakowski", John W. Kluge Center at Library of Congress, September 18, 2015; accessed 01 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kołakowski was born in [[Radom]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. He did not enjoy formal schooling during the [[German occupation of Poland in World War II|German occupation of Poland]] (1939–1945) in [[World War II]], but did read books and took occasional private lessons, passing his school-leaving examinations as an external student in the [[Polish Underground State|underground]] [[Education in Poland during World War II|school system]]. After the war he studied philosophy at [[Łódź University]]. By the late 1940s it was obvious that he was one of the most brilliant Polish minds of his generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGrath |first= Alister|date=2010 |title=Mere Theology |url= |location=London |publisher=SPCK |page=144 |isbn=978-0281062096}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1953 earned a doctorate from [[Warsaw University]] with a thesis on [[Baruch Spinoza]] in which he viewed Spinoza from a Marxist point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leszek-kolakowski-polish-born-philosopher-and-writer-who-produced-seminal-critical-analyses-on-1763959.html|title=Leszek Kolakowski: Polish-born philosopher and writer who produced|date=29 July 2009|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a professor and chairman of Warsaw University's department of the history of philosophy from 1959 to 1968.

In his youth Kołakowski became a [[communist]]. In the period 1947 to 1966 he was a member of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]. His intellectual promise earned him a trip to Moscow in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/5873129/Leszek-Kolakowski.html|title=Leszek Kolakowski|date=20 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he saw [[communism]] in practice and found it repulsive. He broke with [[Stalinism]], becoming a "[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] Marxist" advocating a [[Humanism|humanist]] interpretation of [[Marx]]. One year after the 1956 [[Polish October]], Kołakowski published a four-part critique of Soviet-Marxist dogmas, including [[historical determinism]], in the Polish periodical ''[[Nowa Kultura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862761,00.html Foreign News: VOICE OF DISSENT], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 14 October 1957&lt;/ref&gt; His public lecture at Warsaw University on the tenth anniversary of Polish October led to his expulsion from the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].  In the course of the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] he lost his job at Warsaw University and was prevented from obtaining any other academic post.&lt;ref&gt;Clive James (2007) ''[[Cultural Amnesia (book)|Cultural Amnesia]]'', p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

He came to the conclusion that the totalitarian cruelty of [[Stalinism]] was not an aberration, but instead a logical end-product of [[Marxism]], whose genealogy he examined in his monumental ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'', his major work, published in 1976–1978.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Jones (17 July 2009) [https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE56G67Q20090717 "Polish philosopher and author Kołakowski dead at 81"]. ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leszek Kołakowski Anefo.jpg|thumb|right|Leszek Kołakowski]]

Kolakowski became increasingly fascinated by the contribution which theological assumptions make to [[Western culture|Western]], and, in particular, [[Modern era|modern]] thought. For example, he begins his ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' with an analysis of the contribution that various forms of mediaeval Platonism made, centuries later, to the [[Hegelian]] view of history. In this work he criticized the laws of [[dialectical materialism#Philosophical criticisms|dialectical materialism]] for being fundamentally flawed— finding some of them being "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means", yet others being just "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Main Currents of Marxism|last = Kołakowski|first = Leszek|publisher = W. W. Norton and Company|year = 2005|isbn = 9780393329438|location = New York|pages = 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kołakowski defended the role which [[Freedom of will|freedom]] plays in the human quest for the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]].

His ''Law of the Infinite Cornucopia'' asserts a doctrine of [[status quaestionis]] - that for any given doctrine one wants to believe, there is never a shortage of arguments by which one can support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religion|last = Kołakowski|first = Leszek|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1982|asin = B01JXSH3HM|location = New York}}, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although human fallibility implies that we ought to treat claims to infallibility with scepticism, our pursuit of the higher (such as truth and goodness) is ennobling.

In 1968 Kołakowski became a visiting professor in the department of philosophy at [[McGill University]] in Montreal and in 1969 he moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1970 he became a senior research fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He remained mostly at Oxford, although he spent part of 1974 at [[Yale University]], and from 1981 to 1994 was a part-time professor at the [[Committee on Social Thought]] and in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]].

Although the Polish Communist authorities officially banned his works in Poland, underground copies of them influenced the opinions of the Polish intellectual opposition.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}  His 1971 essay ''Theses on Hope and Hopelessness'' (full title : ''In Stalin's Countries: Theses on Hope and Despair''),&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Kołakowski (1971): Hope and Hopelessness. In: Survey, vol. 17, no. 3 (80)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://storage.osaarchivum.org/low/23/52/2352ec23-187b-40d7-972c-b2806a30a2e2_l.pdf Kołakowski : In Stalin's Countries: Theses on Hope and Despair (1971)]. osaarchivum.org&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested that self-organized social groups could gradually expand the spheres of civil society in a totalitarian state, helped to inspire the dissident movements of the 1970s that led to [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and, eventually, to the collapse of Communist rule in Europe in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}  In the 1980s, Kołakowski supported [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] by giving interviews, writing and fund-raising.&lt;ref name=Steinhauer2015/&gt;

In Poland, Kołakowski is not only revered as a [[philosopher]] and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]], but also as an icon for opponents of communism. [[Adam Michnik]] has called Kołakowski "one of the most prominent creators of contemporary Polish culture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Michnik]] (18 July 1985) [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/5402 "Letter from the Gdansk Prison,"] ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies (5 October 1986) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5DC143DF936A35753C1A960948260 "True to Himself and His Homeland,"] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kołakowski died on 17 July 2009, aged 81, in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1010315/Leszek-Kolakowski Leszek Kolakowski]. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In his obituary, philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] said Kolakowski was a "thinker for our time" and that regarding Kolakowski's debates with intellectual opponents, "even if ... nothing remained of the subversive orthodoxies, nobody felt damaged in their ego or defeated in their life's project, by arguments which from any other source would have inspired the greatest indignation."&lt;ref&gt;

'''Linux.Wifatch''' is an open-source piece of [[malware]] which has been noted for not having been used for malicious actions, instead attempting to secure devices from other malware.&lt;ref name="symantec1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/there-internet-things-vigilante-out-there |title=Is there an Internet-of-Things vigilante out there? |last=Ballano, Mario |date=1 Oct 2015 |publisher=[[Symantec]] |access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linux.Wifatch operates in a manner similar to a [[Antivirus software|computer security system]] and updates definitions through its [[Peer-to-peer|Peer to Peer]] network and deletes remnants of malware which remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hacked.com/linux-wifatch-vigilante-hacker-infects-routers-malware-fight-bad-malware/ | title=Linux.Wifatch: Vigilante Hacker Infects Routers with Malware to Fight Bad Malware | publisher=hacked.com | date=October 2, 2015 | accessdate=14 November 2016 | author=Das, Samburaj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linux.Wifatch has been active since at least November 2014.&lt;ref name=securityweek1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.securityweek.com/developers-mysterious-wifatch-malware-come-forward |title=Developers of Mysterious Wifatch Malware Come Forward | publisher=securityweek.com | date=October 7, 2015 | accessdate=15 November 2016 | author=Kovacs, Eduard}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its authors the idea for Linux.Wifatch came after reading the [[Carna botnet|Carna paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gitlab.com/rav7teif/linux.wifatch | title=linux.wifatch | publisher=The White Team | date=October 5, 2015 | accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Linux.Wifatch was later released on [[GitLab]] by its authors under the [[GNU General Public License]] on October 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/creators-of-the-benevolent-linux-wifatch-malware-reveal-themselves-493938.shtml | title=Creators of the Benevolent Linux.Wifatch Malware Reveal Themselves | publisher=[[Softpedia]] | date=Oct 7, 2015 | accessdate=14 November 2016 | author=Cimpanu, Catalin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linux.Wifatch Architecture Pie Chart.svg|right|thumb|alt=A pie chart showing the architectures affected by Linux.Wifatch.||Linux.Wifatch affects multiple [[Computer architecture|architectures]]. [[ARM architecture|ARM]] accounts for 83%, [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] accounts for 10%, and [[SuperH|SH4]] accounts for 7%.&lt;ref name=symantec1/&gt;]]

==Operation==
Linux.Wifatch's primary mode of infection is to log into devices using weak or default [[telnet]] credentials.&lt;ref name=symantec1/&gt;&lt;ref name=securityweek1/&gt; Once infected, Linux.Wifatch removes other malware and disables telnet access, replacing it with the message "Telnet has been closed to avoid further infection of this device. Please disable telnet, change telnet passwords, and/or update the firmware."&lt;ref name=symantec1/&gt;

'''Ljubomir Maraković''' ([[Topusko]], 1887 – [[Zagreb]], 1959) was a [[Croatia]]n literary critic and historian, and one of the leaders of the [[Croatian Catholic movement]].

He was the first editor of the literary magazine ''Luč'' and for a long time the editor of the periodical ''Hrvatska prosvjeta''. He achieved the highest university education from literature in [[Vienna]] and later he wrote critics, essays, and works from the literature theory and history, more than thousand in 40 years of his public cultural work. He collaborated on the ''[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]'' from 1941-45. His engagement was forbidden from [[Yugoslavia]]n [[communists]] after 1945 due to his collaboration with the NDH. In his most important review, ''New Life'' (1910), he explains the idea of literary work as a result of synthesis of the national and social interests with the aesthetic categories.

'''Marin Cureau de la Chambre''' (1594 – 29 December 1669) was a French physician and [[philosopher]] born in [[Saint-Jean-d'Assé]], a village near [[Le Mans]].
[[File:Cureau de La Chambre, Marin – La lumiere, 1662 – BEIC 833840.jpg|thumb|''La lumiere'', 1662]]

Details of his youth and where he attended school are unknown. He was initially a physician in [[Le Mans]], and around 1630 moved to [[Paris]], where he became a friend and physician to [[Pierre Séguier]] (1588–1672). Afterwards, he was a ''médecin ordinaire'' to [[Louis XIV]]. Reportedly the monarch was impressed by Cureau de la Chambre's ability to judge human character based on physical appearance.

Marin Cureau de la Chambre is largely known for his work in [[physiognomy]]. Between 1640 and 1662 he published a five-volume study on mans' character and "passions" called ''Caractères des passions''. He wrote articles on many other topics, including [[palmistry]], [[digestion]], "reasoning" in animals, [[occultism|occult practices]] and [[optics]]. On the latter subject he investigated the nature of light and color, [[refraction]]s, and the possibility of [[primary color|primary]] and [[secondary color]]s. He was the author of books on [[philosophy]], and published a translation of [[Aristotle's physics|Aristotle's ''Physica'']].

In 1634 he became an early member of the [[Académie française]], and in 1666 was an original member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He was the father of [[clergyman]] [[Pierre Cureau de La Chambre|Pierre Cureau de la Chambre]] (1640–1693). He died in Paris on December 29, 1669.

In 1991 [[astronomer]] [[Eric Walter Elst]] named the [[asteroid]] [[7126 Cureau]] after Marin Cureau de la Chambre.

'''Maurice Halbwachs''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔˈʁis ˈalbvaks|lang}}; 11 March 1877 – 16 March 1945) was a French philosopher and [[sociologist]] known for developing the concept of [[collective memory]].

==Early life and education==
[[Image:Envoi Dumézil à Halbwachs.JPG|thumb|350 px|Book signed by [[Georges Dumézil]] and offered to Maurice Halbwachs in the [[Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS]], Maurice Halbwachs Collection.]]
Born in [[Reims]], [[France]], Halbwachs attended the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]]. There he studied philosophy with [[Henri Bergson]], who had a big influence on his thought. He [[agrégation|aggregated]] in Philosophy in 1901. He taught at various ''lycées'' before traveling to [[Germany]] in 1904, where he studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and worked on cataloging [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s papers. He was nominated to co-edit an edition of Leibniz's work which never came to fruition.

He returned to France in 1905 and met [[Émile Durkheim]], who sparked his interest in sociology. He soon joined the editorial board of ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]'', where he worked with [[François Simiand]] editing the [[Economics]] and [[Statistics]] sections. In 1909 he returned to Germany to study [[Marxism]] and economics in [[Berlin]].

He also had a son, Pierre Halbwachs, who influenced Deleuze in the 1940s.

From Deleuze ABCedaire : 
"Deleuze says that it was there in Deauville, without his parents and his younger brother, where he was completely nil in his studies, until something happened, such that Deleuze ceased being an idiot. Until Deauville, and the year in the lycee there that he spent during the "funny war," he had been null in class, but at Deauville, he met a young teacher, Pierre Halbwachs (son of a famous sociologist), with fragile health, only one eye, so deferred from military duty. For Deleuze, this encounter was an awakening, and he became something of a disciple to this young "maître". Halbwachs would take him out to the beach in winter, on the dunes, and introduced him, for example, to Gide's _Les Nourritures terrestres_, to Anatole France, Baudelaire, other works by Gide, and Deleuze was completely transformed. But since they spent so much time together, people began to talk, and the lady in whose pension Deleuze and his brother were staying warned Deleuze about Halbwachs, then wrote to his parents about it. The brothers were to return to Paris, but then the Germans invaded, and so they took off on their bicycles to meet their parents in Rochefort... and en route, they ran into Halbwachs with his father! Later in life, Deleuze met Halbwachs, without the same admiration, but at age 14, Deleuze feels he was completely right."

==Teaching==
Throughout [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], Halbwachs worked at the War Ministry. Shortly after the end of the war, he became professor of [[sociology]] and [[pedagogy]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He remained in this position for over a decade, taking leave for a year as a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]], when he was called to the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1935. There he taught sociology and worked closely with [[Marcel Mauss]] and served as the editor of ''Annales de Sociologie'', the successor journal to ''L'Année Sociologique''. In 1944 he received one of France's highest honors, a chair at the [[Collège de France]] in [[Social Psychology]].

==Death==
A longtime [[socialist]], Halbwachs was detained by the [[Gestapo]] after protesting the arrest of his [[Jews|Jewish]] father-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novick|first=Peter|title=The Holocaust in American Life|year=1999|publisher=Mariner Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0618082322|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deported to [[Buchenwald]], where he died of [[dysentery]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Semprun: Schreiben oder Leben (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1995), pp. 28 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of his books were offered by his widow to the library of the ''Centre d'études sociologiques'' and are now held at the [[Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS]].

==Main ideas==
Halbwachs' most important contribution to the field of sociology came in his book ''La Mémoire collective'', 1950 ("The Collective Memory"), in which he advanced the thesis that a society can have a [[collective memory]] and that this memory is dependent upon the "cadre" or framework within which a group is situated in a society. Thus, there is not only an individual memory, but also a group memory that exists outside of and lives beyond the individual. Consequently, an individual's understanding of the past is strongly linked to this group consciousness.

Halbwachs also wrote an important book on suicide, ''Les Causes du suicide'', 1930 ("The Causes of Suicide"). In this book he followed the footsteps of his mentor [[Émile Durkheim]], expanding and elaborating upon the former's theories on suicide.

[[Image:Milan Vidmar 1930s.jpg|right|thumb|Milan Vidmar]]
'''Milan Vidmar''' (22 June 1885 – 9 October 1962) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[electrical engineer]], chess Grandmaster, [[Chess theory|chess theorist]], chess arbiter, philosopher, and writer. He was among the top dozen chess players in the world from 1910 to 1930. He was a specialist in [[Electric power|power]] [[transformer]]s and [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[electric current]].

==Early life, familty, and education==
He was born in a middle-class family in [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now in [[Slovenia]]). He began to study [[mechanical engineering]] in 1902, and he graduated in 1907 at the [[University of Vienna]]. He got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctor's degree]] in 1911 from the Technical faculty in Vienna. The study of [[electrical engineering]] at the Technical faculty did not begin until 1904, so Vidmar had to take special examinations in the field basics. He was a professor at the [[University of Ljubljana]], a member of the [[Slovene Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the founder of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Between 1928 and 1929 he was the 10th Chancellor of the University of Ljubljana. In 1948 he established the Institute of Electrotechnics that now bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Elektroinštitut Milan Vidmar | url=https://www.eimv.si/eng/ | accessdate=April 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess career==
Vidmar was also a top-class chess player, probably one of the best dozen players in the world from 1910 to 1930, all the while remaining an amateur. He was awarded the [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title in 1950.

His successes include high places at some of the top chess tournaments of his time, e.g. sixth at [[Carlsbad 1907 chess tournament|Carlsbad 1907]], third at [[Prague 1908 chess tournament|Prague 1908]], first at Gothenburg 1909 (the 7th [[Nordic Chess Championship]]), second at [[San Sebastian chess tournament|San Sebastián 1911]] with [[Akiba Rubinstein]] behind [[José Raúl Capablanca]], first at [[Budapest]] 1912, second at [[Mannheim 1914 chess tournament|Mannheim 1914]], first at [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] in 1918, second at [[Košice]] 1928, third at London 1922, shared first with [[Alexander Alekhine]] at [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings 1925/26]], third at [[Semmering, Austria|Semmering]] 1926, fourth at [[New York 1927 chess tournament|New York 1927]], fourth at London 1927, shared fifth at [[Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament|Carlsbad 1929]], tied for 4–7th at [[Bled 1931 chess tournament|Bled 1931]], tied for 3–6th at [[Stuttgart]] 1939, second behind [[Max Euwe]] at Budapest 1940, first at [[Basel]] 1952.

Vidmar represented Yugoslavia in the Chess Olympiads of [[Prague]] 1931 (board one, 8.5/16) and [[Stockholm]] 1935 (board one, 8.5/14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OlimpBase :: Men's Chess Olympiads :: Milan sr Vidmar | url=http://www.olimpbase.org/players/5t7ljfxg.html | accessdate = April 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Vidmar became an [[arbiter (chess)|arbiter]], earning the title of [[International Arbiter]] from FIDE, and was chief referee for the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 World Chess Championship]] in [[The Hague]]/Moscow.

'''Niels Henrik David Bohr''' ({{IPA-da|nels ˈboɐ̯ˀ|lang}}; 7 October 1885&amp;nbsp;– 18 November 1962) was a Danish [[physicist]] who made foundational contributions to understanding [[atomic structure]] and [[old quantum theory|quantum theory]], for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1922. Bohr was also a [[philosopher]] and a promoter of scientific research.

Bohr developed the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]], in which he proposed that energy levels of [[electron]]s are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the [[atomic nucleus]] but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a [[Wave–particle duality|wave or a stream of particles]]. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.

Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], now known as the [[Niels Bohr Institute]], which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including [[Hans Kramers]], [[Oskar Klein]], [[George de Hevesy]], and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. He predicted the existence of a new [[zirconium]]-like element, which was named [[hafnium]], after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element [[bohrium]] was named after him.

During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from [[Nazism]]. After [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Denmark was occupied by the Germans]], he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the [[German nuclear weapon project]]. In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the [[Manhattan Project]]. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of [[CERN]] and the [[Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy|Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission]] and became the first chairman of the [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in 1957.

== Early years ==
Bohr was born in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, on 7 October 1885, the second of three children of [[Christian Bohr]],&lt;ref name=cphpolice3308989&gt;{{cite book |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Politiets Registerblade |trans-title= Register cards of the Police |location= Copenhagen |publisher= Københavns Stadsarkiv |url= http://www.politietsregisterblade.dk/en/component/sfup/?controller=politregisterblade&amp;task=viewRegisterblad&amp;id=3308989 |at= Station Dødeblade (indeholder afdøde i perioden).

Bohr was a passionate footballer as well, and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen-based [[Akademisk Boldklub]] (Academic Football Club), with Bohr as [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].&lt;ref&gt;There is no truth in the oft-repeated claim that Bohr emulated his brother, Harald, by playing for the Danish national team. {{cite news |last=Dart |first=James |date=27 July 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jul/27/theknowledge.panathinaikos |title=Bohr's footballing career |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Niels Bohr Date Unverified LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bohr as a young man|alt=Head and shoulders of young man in a suit and tie]]
Bohr was educated at Gammelholm Latin School, starting when he was seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/www/niels/bohr/skole/ |title=Niels Bohr's school years |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |accessdate=14 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at [[Copenhagen University]]. His major was physics, which he studied under Professor [[Christian Christiansen]], the university's only professor of physics at that time. He also studied astronomy and mathematics under Professor [[Thorvald Thiele]], and philosophy under Professor [[Harald Høffding]], a friend of his father.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=98–99}}&lt;ref name="university"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/www/niels/bohr/universitetet/ |title=Life as a Student |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |accessdate=14 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a gold medal competition was sponsored by the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] to investigate a method for measuring the [[surface tension]] of liquids that had been proposed by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to [[glass blowing|make his own glassware]], creating test tubes with the required [[ellipse|elliptical]] cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the [[viscosity]] of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize.

Harald became the first of the two Bohr brothers to earn a [[master's degree]], which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (dr. phil.) thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by [[Paul Drude]] and elaborated by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the [[Hall effect]], and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Niels-Bohr|title=Niels Bohr {{!}} Danish physicist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=107–109}} Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist [[Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen]] would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the [[Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem]].{{sfn|Kragh|2012|pp=43–45}}

In 1910, Bohr met Margrethe Nørlund, the sister of the mathematician [[Niels Erik Nørlund]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=112}} Bohr resigned his membership in the [[Church of Denmark]] on 16 April 1912, and he and Margrethe  were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall in [[Slagelse]] on 1 August. Years later, his brother Harald similarly left the church before getting married.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=133–134}} Bohr and Margrethe had six sons.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=226, 249}} The oldest, Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934,{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|p=204}} and another, Harald, died from childhood meningitis.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=226, 249}} [[Aage Bohr]] became a successful physicist, and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, like his father. {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Bohr|da|lang-text=Hans Bohr|en-text=Hans}} became a physician; {{Interlanguage link multi|Erik Bohr|da|lang-text=Erik Bohr|en-text=Erik}}, a chemical engineer; and [[Ernest Bohr|Ernest]], a lawyer.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Niels Bohr&amp;nbsp;– Biography|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/bohr-bio.html|publisher=[[Nobelprize.org]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his uncle Harald, Ernest Bohr became an Olympic athlete, playing [[field hockey]] for Denmark at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London.&lt;ref name="hockey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/bo/ernest-bohr-1.html |title=Ernest Bohr Biography and Olympic Results – Olympics |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bohr model ===
{{Main|Bohr model}}
In September 1911, Bohr, supported by a fellowship from the [[Carlsberg Foundation]], travelled to England. At the time, it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of atoms and molecules was being done.{{sfn|Kragh|2012|p=122}} He met [[J. J. Thomson]] of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He attended lectures on [[electromagnetism]] given by [[James Jeans]] and [[Joseph Larmor]], and did some research on [[cathode ray]]s, but failed to impress Thomson.{{sfn|Kennedy|1985|p=6}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=117–121}} He had more success with younger physicists like the Australian [[William Lawrence Bragg]],{{sfn|Kragh|2012|p=46}} and New Zealand's [[Ernest Rutherford]], whose 1911 [[Rutherford model]] of the [[atom]] had challenged Thomson's 1904 [[plum pudding model]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=121–125}} Bohr received an invitation from Rutherford to conduct post-doctoral work at [[Victoria University of Manchester]],{{sfn|Kennedy|1985|p=7}} where Bohr met [[George de Hevesy]] and [[Charles Galton Darwin]] (whom Bohr referred to as "the grandson of the [[Charles Darwin|real Darwin]]").{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=125–129}}

Bohr returned to Denmark in July 1912 for his wedding, and travelled around England and Scotland on his honeymoon. On his return, he became a ''[[privatdocent]]'' at the University of Copenhagen, giving lectures on [[thermodynamics]]. [[Martin Knudsen]] put Bohr's name forward for a ''[[docent]]'', which was approved in July 1913, and Bohr then began teaching medical students.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=134–135}} His three papers, which later became famous as "the trilogy",{{sfn|Kennedy|1985|p=7}} were published in ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' in July, September and November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Niels |last=Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part I | journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=1–24 | doi= 10.1080/14786441308634955| url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/bohr13/eng.pdf | issue=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohr 1913 476"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Niels |last=Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part II Systems Containing Only a Single Nucleus | journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=476–502 | url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/bohr13b/eng.pdf | doi=10.1080/14786441308634993 | issue=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Niels |last=Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part III Systems containing several nuclei| journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=857–875|issue=155|doi=10.1080/14786441308635031}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=149}} He adapted Rutherford's nuclear structure to [[Max Planck]]'s quantum theory and so created his [[Bohr model]] of the atom.&lt;ref name="Bohr 1913 476" /&gt;

Planetary models of atoms were not new, but Bohr's treatment was.{{sfn|Kragh|2012|p=22}} Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin on the role of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point,&lt;ref name="Darwin1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles Galton|title=A theory of the absorption and scattering of the alpha rays|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=23|issue=138|year=1912|pages=901–920|issn=1941-5982|doi=10.1080/14786440608637291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arabatzis2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arabatzis|first=Theodore |title=Representing Electrons: A Biographical Approach to Theoretical Entities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdKZYot85OcC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02420-2|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in [[orbit]]s around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms.{{sfn|Kragh|1985|pp=50–67}} He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a [[quantum]] of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the [[old quantum theory]].{{sfn|Heilbron|1985|pp=39–47}}

In 1885, [[Johann Balmer]] had come up with his [[Balmer series]] to describe the visible [[spectral line]]s of a [[hydrogen]] atom:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_\mathrm{H}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) \quad \text{for} \ n=3,4,5,...&lt;/math&gt;
where λ is the wavelength of the absorbed or emitted light and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Rydberg constant]].{{sfn|Heilbron|1985|p=43}} Balmer's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked. In the first paper of his trilogy, Bohr was able to derive it from his model:
:&lt;math&gt; R_Z = { 2\pi^2 m_e Z^2 e^4 \over h^3 } &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron's mass, ''e'' is its charge, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''Z'' is the atom's [[atomic number]] (1 for hydrogen).{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=146–149}}

The model's first hurdle was the [[Pickering series]], lines which did not fit Balmer's formula. When challenged on this by [[Alfred Fowler]], Bohr replied that they were caused by [[ionization|ionised]] [[helium]], helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=146–149}} Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and [[Hendrik Lorentz]], did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, [[David Hilbert]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Max Born]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] saw it as a breakthrough.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=152–155}}{{sfn|Kragh|2012|pp=109–111}} The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments.{{sfn|Kragh|2012|pp=90–91}} Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.{{sfn|Kragh|2012|p=39}}

Bohr did not enjoy teaching medical students. He decided to return to Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in [[South Tyrol|Tyrol]] with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the [[University of Göttingen]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King [[Christian X]], who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=164–167}}

=== Institute of Physics ===
In April 1917, Bohr began a campaign to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics. He gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation, and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors, many of them Jewish. Legislation establishing the Institute was passed in November 1918. Now known as the [[Niels Bohr Institute]], it opened on 3 March 1921, with Bohr as its director. His family moved into an apartment on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/www/institute/History/history/ | title=History of the institute: The establishment of an institute | publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |last=Aaserud |first=Finn |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405160424/http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/about/history/ |archivedate=5 April 2008 |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=169–171}} Bohr's institute served as a focal point for researchers into [[quantum mechanics]] and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s, when most of the world's best known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company. Early arrivals included [[Hans Kramers]] from the Netherlands, [[Oskar Klein]] from Sweden, George de Hevesy from Hungary, [[Wojciech Rubinowicz]] from Poland and [[Svein Rosseland]] from Norway. Bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague.{{sfn|Kennedy|1985|pp=9, 12, 13, 15}}{{sfn|Hund|1985|pp=71–73}}  Klein and Rosseland produced the Institute's first publication even before it opened.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=169–171}}

[[File:Niels Bohr Institute 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Niels Bohr Institute|alt=A block-shaped beige building with a sloped, red tiled roof]]
The Bohr model worked well for hydrogen, but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed [[heuristic]]s to describe them. The [[rare-earth element]]s posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s discovery of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which put Bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of [[zirconium]]. He was immediately challenged by the French chemist [[Georges Urbain]], who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called "celtium". At the Institute in  Copenhagen, [[Dirk Coster]] and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named [[hafnium]] (''Hafnia'' being the Latin name for Copenhagen) turned out to be more common than gold.{{sfn|Kragh|1985|pp=61–64}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=202–210}}

In 1922, Bohr was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them".{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=215}} The award thus recognised both the Trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the [[correspondence principle]], which he had formulated. This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces [[classical physics]] in the limit of large [[quantum number]]s.{{sfn|Bohr|1985|pp=91–97}}

The discovery of [[Compton scattering]] by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of [[photon]]s, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and [[John C. Slater]], an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the [[Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory]] (BKS). It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohr |first=N. |first2=H.

Modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using "virtual oscillators" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, [[Werner Heisenberg]] and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They led to the development of [[matrix mechanics]], the first form of modern [[quantum mechanics]]. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory.{{sfn|Jammer|1989|p=188}} The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by [[Walther Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=237}} In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that "there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=238}}

=== Quantum mechanics ===
The introduction of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] by [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] in November 1925 was a milestone. The next month, Bohr travelled to [[Leiden]] to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Hendrick Lorentz receiving his doctorate. When his train stopped in [[Hamburg]], he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and [[Otto Stern]], who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. When he arrived in Leiden, [[Paul Ehrenfest]] and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using [[Theory of relativity|relativity]]. Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. Thus, when he met Werner Heisenberg and [[Pascual Jordan]] in [[Göttingen]] on the way back, he had become, in his own words, "a prophet of the electron magnet gospel".{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=243}}

Heisenberg first came to Copenhagen in 1924, then returned to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. When he showed his results to Max Born in Göttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. This work attracted the attention of the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]],{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=275–279}} who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed "so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics".{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=295–299}}

When Kramers left the Institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at the [[Utrecht University]], Bohr arranged for Heisenberg to return and take Kramers's place as a ''[[lektor]]'' at the University of Copenhagen.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=263}} Heisenberg worked in Copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr from 1926 to 1927.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=272–275}}

Bohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the [[de Broglie hypothesis]] that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=301}} He conceived the philosophical principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1985|pp=112–113}} He felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1985|p=101}}

In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg developed his [[uncertainty principle]],{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=304–309}} which Bohr embraced. In a paper he presented at the [[Volta Conference]] at [[Como]] in September 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=304–309}} Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had [[Bohr–Einstein debates|good-natured arguments]] over such issues throughout their lives.{{sfn|Dialogue|1985|pp=121–140}}

In 1914, [[Carl Jacobsen]], the heir to [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg breweries]], bequeathed his mansion to be used for life by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence ({{lang-da|Æresbolig|links=no}}). Harald Høffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in July 1931, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy. He and his family moved there in 1932.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=332–333}} He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=464–465}}

By 1929, the phenomenon of [[beta decay]] prompted Bohr to again suggest that the [[law of conservation of energy]] be abandoned, but [[Enrico Fermi]]'s hypothetical [[neutrino]] and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the [[neutron]] provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the [[compound nucleus]] in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=337–340, 368–370}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transmutations of Atomic Nuclei |last=Bohr |first=Niels |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=20 August 1937 |volume=86 |issue=2225 |pages=161–165 |doi=10.1126/science.86.2225.161 |bibcode = 1937Sci....86..161B |pmid=17751630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by [[Otto Hahn]] in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by [[Lise Meitner]]) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939.{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|pp=211–216}} When Bohr told [[George Placzek]] that this resolved all the mysteries of [[transuranic elements]], Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek, [[Léon Rosenfeld]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] that "I have understood everything."{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=456}} Based on his [[liquid drop model]] of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the [[uranium-235]] isotope and not the more abundant [[uranium-238]] that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, [[John R. Dunning]] demonstrated that Bohr was correct.{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|pp=211–216}} In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohr |first=Niels |last2=Wheeler |first2=John Archibald |authorlink2=John Archibald Wheeler |title=The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=426–450 |date=September 1939 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.426|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7579_Bohr%20liquid%20drop.pdf|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..426B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Bohr read the 19th-century Danish [[Christian existentialist]] philosopher, [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. [[Richard Rhodes]] argued in ''[[The Making of the Atomic Bomb]]'' that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through Høffding.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=60}} In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'' as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, "It is the only thing I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better&amp;nbsp;... I even think it is one of the most delightful things I have ever read." Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard's philosophy]].{{sfn|Faye|1991|p=37}} Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Stewart|2010|p=416}}&lt;ref name="Aaserud-Heilbron-2013-a"&gt;{{harvnb|Aaserud|Heilbron|2013|pp=159–160}}: "A statement about religion in the loose notes on Kierkegaard may throw light on the notion of wildness that appears in many of Bohr's letters. 'I, who do not feel in any way united with, and even less, bound to a God, and therefore am also much poorer [than Kierkegaard], would say that the good [is] the overall lofty goal, as only by being good [can one] judge according to worth and right.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aaserud-Heilbron-2013-b"&gt;{{harvnb|Aaserud|Heilbron|2013|p=110}}: "Bohr's sort of humor, use of parables and stories, tolerance, dependence on family, feelings of indebtedness, obligation, and guilt, and his sense of responsibility for science, community, and, ultimately, humankind in general, are common traits of the Jewish intellectual. So too is a well-fortified atheism. Bohr ended with no religious belief and a dislike of all religions that claimed to base their teachings on revelations."&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some dispute over the extent to which Kierkegaard influenced Bohr's philosophy and science. [[David Favrholdt]] argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value,{{sfn|Favrholdt|1992|pp=42–63}} while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.{{sfn|Richardson|Wildman|1996|p=289}}{{sfn|Faye|1991|p=37}}

== Nazism and Second World War ==
The rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were Jewish or because they were political  opponents of the Nazi regime. In 1933, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] created a fund to help support refugee academics, and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, [[Max Mason]], in May 1933 during a visit to the United States. Bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the Institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. Those that he helped included [[Guido Beck]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[James Franck]], [[George de Hevesy]], [[Otto Frisch]], [[Hilde Levi]], [[Lise Meitner]], George Placzek, [[Eugene Rabinowitch]], [[Stefan Rozental]], Erich Ernst Schneider, [[Edward Teller]], [[Arthur R. von Hippel|Arthur von Hippel]] and [[Victor Weisskopf]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=382–386}}

In April 1940, early in the Second World War, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Occupation of Denmark|invaded and occupied Denmark]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=476}} To prevent the Germans from discovering [[Max von Laue]]'s and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in [[aqua regia]]. In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=480–481}}

=== Meeting with Heisenberg ===
[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|right|Werner Heisenberg (left) with Bohr at the Copenhagen Conference in 1934|alt=A young man in a white shirt and tie and an older man in suit and tie sit at a table, on which there is a tea pot, plates, cups and saucers and beer bottles.]]
Bohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an [[atomic bomb]], referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235.{{sfn|Gowing|1985|pp=267–268}} In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the [[German nuclear energy project]], visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.
According to Heisenberg, he began to address nuclear energy, morality and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions.{{sfn|Heisenberg|1984|p=77}} [[Ivan Supek]], one of Heisenberg's students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], who had proposed trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Portal Jutarnji.hr |date=19 March 2006 |url=http://jutarnji.hr/clanak/art-2006,3,19,supek_intervju,17440.jl?artpg=1 |title=Moj život s nobelovcima 20. stoljeća |trans-title=My Life with the 20th century Nobel Prizewinners |work=[[Jutarnji list]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=13 August 2007 |quote={{lang|hr |Istinu sam saznao od Margrethe, Bohrove supruge.&amp;nbsp;...

In 1957, Heisenberg wrote to [[Robert Jungk]], who was then working on the book ''[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists]]''. Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world's scientists on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/MP_Misc/Bohr_Heisenberg/bohr_2.htm |title=Letter From Werner Heisenberg to Author Robert Jungk |accessdate=21 December 2006 |last=Heisenberg |first=Werner |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg |publisher=The Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association, Inc. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017232033/http://childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/MP_Misc/Bohr_Heisenberg/bohr_2.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bohr saw Jungk's depiction in the Danish translation of the book, he drafted (but never sent) a letter to Heisenberg, stating that he never understood the purpose of Heisenberg's visit, was shocked by Heisenberg's opinion that Germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbarchive.dk/collections/bohr-heisenberg/ |title=Release of documents relating to 1941 Bohr-Heisenberg meeting |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170217070953/http://www.nbarchive.dk/collections/bohr-heisenberg/ |archivedate =2017-02-17|last=Aaserud |first=Finn |date=6 February 2002 |publisher=Niels Bohr Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manhattan Project ===
In September 1943, word reached Bohr and his brother Harald that the Nazis considered their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September.{{sfn|Rozental|1967|p=168}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=483–484}} The next day, Bohr persuaded King [[Gustaf V of Sweden]] to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass [[rescue of the Danish Jews]] by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=483–484}}{{sfn|Hilberg|1961|p=596}}{{sfn|Kieler|2007|pp=91–93}}{{sfn|Stadtler|Morrison|Martin|1995|p=136}} Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=479}}

[[File:Portrait of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, James Franck and Rabi.jpg|thumb|left|Bohr with [[James Franck]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] (LR)]]
When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, [[Lord Cherwell]] sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] operated by the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC).{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=280–281}}{{sfn|Powers|1993|p=237}} The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's [[bomb bay]].{{sfn|Thirsk|2006|p=374}} During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea.{{sfn|Rife|1999|p=242}}{{sfn|Medawar|Pyke|2001|p=65}}{{sfn|Jones|1978|pp=474–475}} Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=280–282}}

Bohr was warmly received by [[James Chadwick]] and Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], but for security reasons Bohr was kept out of sight. He was given an apartment at [[St James's Palace]] and an office with the British [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=280–282}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=491}} Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a  Tube Alloys consultant, with Aage as his assistant.{{sfn|Cockroft|1963|p=46}} On 8 December 1943, Bohr arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he met with the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]] He visited Einstein and Pauli at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and went to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in [[New Mexico]], where the nuclear weapons were being designed.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=498–499}} For security reasons, he went under the name of "Nicholas Baker" in the United States, while Aage became "James Baker".{{sfn|Gowing|1985|p=269}} In May 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper [[De frie Danske]] reported that they had learned that 'the famous son of Denmark Professor Niels Bohr' in October the previous year had fled his country via Sweden to London and from there travelled to [[Moscow]] from where he could be assumed to support the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Professor Bohr ankommet til Moskva |trans-title= Professor Bohr arrived in Moscow |url= http://www.illegalpresse.dk/papers#/paper?paper=72&amp;page=826 |newspaper= [[De frie Danske]] |date= May 1944 |page= 7 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohr did not remain at Los Alamos, but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years. [[Robert Oppenheimer]] credited Bohr with acting "as a scientific father figure to the younger men", most notably [[Richard Feynman]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=497}} Bohr is quoted as saying, "They didn't need my help in making the atom bomb."{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=496}} Oppenheimer gave Bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on [[modulated neutron initiator]]s. "This device remained a stubborn puzzle," Oppenheimer noted, "but in early February 1945 Niels Bohr clarified what had to be done."{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=497}}

Bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, he received a letter from [[Peter Kapitza]], written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the [[Soviet Union]]. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting.{{sfn|Gowing|1985|p=270}} Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that "we did not speak the same language".{{sfn|Gowing|1985|p=271}}  Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: "It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes."{{sfn|Aaserud|2006|p=708}}

Oppenheimer suggested that Bohr visit President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to convince him that the Manhattan Project should be shared with the Soviets in the hope of speeding up its results. Bohr's friend, Supreme Court Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]], informed President Roosevelt about Bohr's opinions, and a meeting between them took place on 26 August 1944. Roosevelt suggested that Bohr return to the United Kingdom to try to win British approval.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=528–538}}{{sfn|Aaserud|2006|pp=707–708}} When Churchill and Roosevelt met at Hyde Park on 19 September 1944, they rejected the idea of informing the world about the project, and the aide-mémoire of their conversation contained a rider that "enquiries should be made regarding the activities of Professor Bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information, particularly to the Russians".{{sfn|U.S. Government|1972|pp=492–493}}

In June 1950, Bohr addressed an "Open Letter" to the [[United Nations]] calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy.{{sfn|Aaserud|2006|pp=708–709}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohr |first=Niels |date=9 June 1950 |url=http://www.fredsakademiet.dk/library/dkpeace/dkpeace15.htm |title=To the United Nations (open letter) |journal=Impact of Science on Society |volume=I |issue=2 |page=68 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite journal |last=Bohr |first=Niels |date=July 1950 |pages=213–219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4g0AAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=%22atomic+energy+project%22+1944#v=onepage&amp;q=%22atomic%20energy%20project%22%201944&amp;f=false |title=For An Open World |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=6 |issue=7 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=513–518}} In the 1950s, after the [[RDS-1|Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon test]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] was created along the lines of Bohr's suggestion.{{sfn|Gowing|1985|p=276}} In 1957 he received the first ever [[Atoms for Peace Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/research/collections/collections-mc/pdf/mc10.pdf |title=Guide to Atoms for Peace Awards Records |first=Elizabeth |last=Craig-McCormack |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the war now ended, Bohr returned to Copenhagen on 25 August 1945, and was re-elected President of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences on 21 September.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=504}} At a memorial meeting of the Academy on 17 October 1947 for King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]], who had died in April, the new king, [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]], announced that he was conferring the [[Order of the Elephant]] on Bohr. This award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state, but the king said that it honoured not just Bohr personally, but Danish science.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=166, 466–467}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985|p=224}} Bohr designed his own [[coat of arms]] which featured a [[taijitu]] (symbol of yin and yang) and a motto in {{lang-la|contraria sunt complementa|links=no}}, "opposites are complementary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Bohr crest | publisher=University of Copenhagen | date=17 October 1947 | url=http://www.nbi.dk/hehi/logo/bohr_crest.png | accessdate=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wheeler|1985|p=224}}

The Second World War demonstrated that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a [[brain drain]] to the United States, twelve European countries banded together to create [[CERN]], a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake [[Big Science]] projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. [[Pierre Auger]], who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and [[Geneva]] was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=519–522}} Victor Weisskopf, who later became the [[List of Directors General of CERN|Director General of CERN]], summed up Bohr's role, saying that "there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of [[CERN]]. The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it."{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=521}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisskopf|first1=Victor|title=Tribute to Niels Bohr|journal=CERN Courier|date=July 1963|volume=2|issue=11|page=89|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1728615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Scandinavian countries formed the [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman. He was also involved with the founding of the [[Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy|Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission]], and served as its first chairman from February 1956.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=523–525}}

Bohr died of heart failure at his home in [[Carlsberg (district)|Carlsberg]] on 18 November 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Niels Bohr|journal=CERN Courier|date=November 1962|volume=2|issue=11|page=10|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1728506}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]] in the [[Nørrebro]] section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=529}} On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.dk/nbi-history.html |title=History of the Niels Bohr Institute from 1921 to 1965 |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |accessdate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinhard|first1=Stock|title=Niels Bohr and the 20th century|journal=CERN Courier|date=October 1998|volume=38|issue=7|page=19|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1732841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nietzsche and Asian Thought''''' is an [[anthology]] of essays by a variety of contributors on the relationship of the thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to [[Asian philosophy]]; specifically, [[Indian philosophy|Indian]], [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] and [[Japanese philosophy|Japanese]] philosophy. The book was edited by American philosopher [[Graham Parkes]] and was released in 1991 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. The work was written for a Western audience of Nietzsche scholars and comparative philosophers, but features contributions from non-Western thinkers.

The work is split into four sections—Others, India, China and Japan—and each section contains between three and four essays, for a total of 14 articles by 13 different authors. The work was well received by academic reviewers upon its release, and praised as a "must-read" for both Nietzsche scholars and comparative philosophers. In 2004, a special edition of ''[[The Journal of Nietzsche Studies]]'' was published, aiming to build upon the scholarship in ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought''.

==Concept and contributors==
[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|left|Nietzsche, aged around 30, in the 1870s]]
The essays contained in ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' were collected to illustrate both the influence that [[Asian philosophy|Asian]] (specifically, [[Indian philosophy|Indian]]) philosophy had on Nietzsche, and the influence that Nietzsche's thought subsequently had on Asian schools (in particular, [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] and [[Japanese philosophy]]).{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=4}} Despite the fact that published scholarship on Nietzsche had increased in the years preceding the appearance of the book, very little had been written on the relationship between Nietzsche's philosophy and Asian philosophy.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=3}} Further, only a very small portion of works written in Western languages on Nietzsche had addressed the response his works had provoked in Asia, especially Japan, after his death. ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' was "intended as an initial contribution towards redressing [the] imbalance",{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=6}} and all but two of the essays in the anthology were written specifically for it.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Parkes wrote that the genre of the anthology is an appropriate one in which to write about Nietzsche, claiming that he is "above all a writer in many voices, and one problem with books written about his work is that they have been mainly 'monological,' with the author speaking in only one voice."{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=9}} He argues that justice is more likely to be done to Nietzsche's work when a multiplicity of perspectives is possible, and that ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' takes this idea further, with the inclusion of thinkers from East Asia as well as Europe.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=9}} However, the work does not seek to recast Nietzsche as some kind of [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] thinker, but instead serves to "complicate" our understanding of Nietzsche.{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=141}} One "significant absence" from the work is the work of [[Nishitani Keiji]], a Japanese philosopher who lists Nietzsche as a major influence. Originally, ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' had been intended to contain a translation of an essay by Nishitani, first published in the 1930s, comparing Nietzsche's [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] to [[Meister Eckhart]], but considerations of time and space prevented this.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=13}}

The work is targeted primarily at a Western audience and is written in English, with a number of essays translated from other languages.{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=142}} However, despite Parkes's efforts to make the anthology accessible, it can be difficult and dense in places, with heavy use of foreign terminology and enough names to "daunt the uninitiated".{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=143}} The inclusion of Asian perspectives enables Western scholars of Nietzsche to see new aspects of his thought, and the work is written to be of interest primarily to scholars of Nietzsche, but also those of [[comparative philosophy]] generally.{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=143-4}}

==Content==
The work contains 14 essays, split into four sections, covering Nietzsche's relationship to Asia and "others" (three essays, including Parke's introductory essay), Nietzsche and India (four essays), Nietzsche and China (three essays), and Nietzsche and Japan (four essays).

===Others===
[[File:Dogen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dōgen]], c. 1250. [[Joan Stambaugh]] compares the experiences of Zarathustra to the mystical experiences of Dōgen.]]
;"The orientation of the Nietzschean text"
"The orientation of the Nietzschean text" is an essay by Parkes that serves as an introduction to ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought''.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|pp=3-19}} In addition to introducing the work and summarising the other essays,{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|pp=8-13}} Parkes discusses the extent of Nietzschean scholarship in Asia both following Nietzsche's collapse,{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|pp=3-6}} and at the time of ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s publication.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|pp=8-13}} He also considers the implications of Nietzsche's use of a travel metaphor in ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', concluding that responses from foreign interpreters may serve to "open us to hitherto concealed aspects of the corpus."{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|pp=6-8}}

;"The other Nietzsche"
"The other Nietzsche" was written by [[Joan Stambaugh]].{{sfn|Stambaugh|1996|pp=20-30}} The essay addresses a specific aspect of Nietzsche, which Stambaugh calls the "other" Nietzsche; specifically, the idea of "Nietzsche the poet mystic".{{sfn|Stambaugh|1996|p=20}} However, apart from an indirect reference to [[Dōgen]], the essay itself does not explicitly compare Nietzsche and Asian thought; instead, it selects "some strains of Nietzsche's thought that are most consonant with an Eastern temper of experience", allowing readers to reach their own conclusions.{{sfn|Stambaugh|1996|p=30}} Instead, Stambaugh closely considers four sections of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''; "Before Sunrise" (part 3, section 4), "On the Great Longing" (part 3, section 14), "At Noon" (part 4, section 10) and "The Drunken Song" (part 4, section 19).{{sfn|Stambaugh|1996|pp=20-30}} The experiences of Zarathustra in these passages can be compared to the [[mystical experience]]s of Dōgen and Meister Eckhart.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=9}}

;"Questioning one's 'own' from the perspective of the foreign"
"Questioning one's "own" from the perspective of the foreign" is a [[hermeneutic]] essay by Eberhard Scheiffele, translated by Graham Parkes.{{sfnm|Parkes|1996a|1p=9|Scheiffele|1996|2pp=31-47}} Scheiffele argues that the concept of the "foreign" is essential to Nietzsche's [[perspectivism]], and that Nietzsche uses foreign perspectives to render odd that which is his own.{{sfn|Scheiffele|1996|pp=32-3}} He then goes on to develop four levels at which Nietzsche uses the foreign to criticise his own, the strongest of which is that European culture can be shown to be strange when seen from the perspective of "foreign" Asian cultures.{{sfn|Scheiffele|1996|p=41}} However, for Scheiffele, although Nietzsche ranks the foreign as higher, he is concerned primarily with the criticism of his own from the perspective of the foreign.{{sfn|Scheiffele|1996|p=42}} Nietzsche's heavy use of optical metaphors encourages the reader to deliberately and consciously step outside of their own tradition, allowing them to view it from multiple angles that would otherwise have been impossible. This allows them to develop the most potent form of "seeing"; that is, a "simultaneous seeing" in which an individual is simultaneously able to see their tradition from both within the tradition and from outside it.{{sfn|Scheiffele|1996|pp=43-4}}

===India===
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|right|Michel Hulin argues that Nietzsche sees Buddhism, with its historical founder ''(pictured)'' and missionary character, as comparable to Christianity, while seeing [[Brahmin|Brahmanism]] as of a different nature.{{sfn|Hulin|1996|71}}]]
;"Nietzsche's early encounters with Asian thought"
"Nietzsche's early encounters with Asian thought" is an essay by Johann Figl, translated by Graham Parkes.{{sfn|Figl|1996|pp=51-63}} Based on studies of both Nietzsche's published and unpublished notes, Figl recounts Nietzsche's encounters with Asian thought while at [[Pforta]], and during his first year of study at the [[University of Bonn]].{{sfn|Figl|1996|pp=51-63}} Figl concludes that Nietzsche was exposed to a considerable amount of Indian thought, despite the fact that his published notes from this period make little mention of it.{{sfn|Figl|1996|pp=60}}

;"Nietzsche and the suffering of the Indian ascetic"
"Nietzsche and the suffering of the Indian ascetic" is an essay by Michel Hulin, translated by Graham Parkes.{{sfn|Hulin|1996|pp=64-75}} Hulin examines Nietzsche's relationship with the idea of Indian [[asceticism]] and his apparently contradictory views of the practice.{{sfn|Hulin|1996|p=64}} Despite certain strong interpretations, Hulin argues, Nietzsche is wrong about many aspects of India,{{sfn|Hulin|1996|pp=65-7}} but appears to value [[Hindu asceticism]], and respect the [[Brahmins]], for a number of reasons.{{sfn|Hulin|1996|p=67-70}} Hulin argues that Nietzsche has a very particular view of [[Buddhism]] that is filled with errors, seeing it as an individualist reaction to Brahmanism, and that he compares this "Buddhism" to Christianity.{{sfn|Hulin|1996|pp=70-3}} The essay closes with a consideration of Nietzsche's praise for Buddhism's rejection of the metaphysical, but his condemnation for its weakening of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]].{{sfn|Hulin|1996|pp=73-4}}

;"Nietzsche's trans-European eye"
"Nietzsche's trans-European eye" is an essay by Mervyn Sprung.{{sfn|Sprung|1996|pp=76-90}} Challenging the traditional assumption that Nietzsche was well acquainted with Indian thought,{{sfn|Sprung|1996|pp=76-7}} Sprung argues that while there is some evidence of it in Nietzsche's work,{{sfn|Sprung|1996|p=77}} Nietzsche in fact had very little interest in Indian philosophy in its own right.{{sfn|Sprung|1996|p=86}} Sprung claims that the most compelling evidence for this is the fact that he apparently never wrote to his friend [[Paul Deussen]] asking about Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Sprung|1996|pp=84-5}} In this regard, Sprung may be seen as supporting Scheiffele's thesis with regards to the importance of the foreign in Nietzsche's work.{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=10}}

;"Deconstruction and breakthrough in Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna"
"Deconstruction and breakthrough in Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna" is an essay by Glen T. Martin.{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=91-111}} Martin compares the philosophy of Nietzsche to the philosophy of [[Nāgārjuna]], aiming to illuminate the relationship between their respective attempts to develop "spiritual break-throughs",{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=91-2}} by considering each thinker in turn. First he looks at Nietzsche's distinct rejection of traditional values,{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=92-5}} and, subsequently, considers Nietzsche's answer to the problem.{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=95-8}} Second, Martin looks to Nāgārjuna, tracing his line of thought to the "emptiness" and "ultimate truth",{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=98-102}} and then to his conception of "liberation".{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=102-4}} Martin then compares Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna's thought directly, with reference to Nishitani,{{sfn|Martin|1996|pp=105-109}} and concludes that Nietzsche's articulation of [[nihilism]] means that the "emptiness" spoken of by Nāgārjuna is something that can now be seen by a great many people.{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=109}}

===China===
[[File:Zhuangzi-Butterfly-Dream.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] dreams of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreams of being Zhuangzi. By comparison, Nietzsche's Zarathustra faces a nightmare of torment.{{sfn|Guying|1996|pp=118}}]]
;"Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; plays of perspectives"
"Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche: plays of perspectives" is an essay by Chen Guying, translated by James D. Sellmann, comparing the respective philosophies of Nietzsche and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]].{{sfn|Guying|1996|pp=115-29}} Guying discusses a number of aspects in his essay, considering the philosophers' conceptions of emotions, dreams, escapism, physicality,{{sfn|Guying|1996|pp=116-21}} spiritual freedom and [[moral relativism|relativism]],{{sfn|Guying|1996|pp=123-6}} as well as the world in which they lived and their engagement with it.{{sfn|Guying|1996|pp=115-6, 119-21}} He concludes the essay by listing nine similarities between the two, as well as five major differences, closing the essay with four criticisms.{{sfn|Guying|1996|pp=127-9}} The piece is a modification of an excerpt from Guying's ''Beiju Zhexuejia Nicai'' (''The Tragic Philosopher Nietzsche''), and is, according to Parkes,{{sfn|Parkes|1996c|p=ix}} "exemplary of modern Chinese scholarship on Nietzsche".{{sfn|Parkes|1996a|p=11}}

;"Nietzsche's 'will to power' and Chinese 'virtuality' (''de'')&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; a comparative study"
""Nietzsche's 'will to power' and Chinese 'virtuality' (''de'')" is a comparative essay by [[Roger T. Ames]], considering the relationship between Nietzsche's [[will to power]] and the notion of ''[[de (Chinese)|de]]'' in Chinese philosophy.{{sfn|Ames|1996a|pp=130-50}} Ames attempts to reconstruct the disparate notions of ''de'' into a single "classical Chinese notion" by drawing out the [[cosmological]] and [[aesthetic]] principles underlying the [[ethical]] notion of ''de'' in [[Confucianism]], and the ethical and social implications of the primarily cosmological ''de'' in [[Daoism]].{{sfn|Ames|1996a|pp=132-40}} He interprets Nietzsche's will to power as "an alternative to mechanistic physics", an undogmatic cosmology; the term "cosmology" must be redefined if applied to Nietzsche.{{sfn|Ames|1996a|pp=141-2}} For Ames, Nietzsche's notion of "power" is the separating factor between Nietzsche's "aesthetic perspectivism" from an "anything-goes [[relativism]]".{{sfn|Ames|1996a|pp=143-5}} Having outlined his understanding of the two notions, Ames goes on to compare ''de'' with the will to power, concluding that there is "some common ground in the notion of overcoming ego-self", but that there remain significant differences; for instance, while ''de'' celebrates "enjoyment", Nietzsche's [[Übermensch]] strives for personal joy.{{sfn|Ames|1996a|pp=146-8}}

;"The highest Chinadom&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Nietzsche and the Chinese mind, 1907-1989"
"Nietzsche and the Chinese mind" is an essay by David A. Kelly.{{sfn|Kelly|1996a|pp=151-74}} After explaining that a [[nihilism]] similar to that found in Nietzsche's Europe can be found in China,{{sfn|Kelly|1996a|pp=151-2}} Kelly outlines the influence Nietzsche's thought had upon [[Lu Xun]], one of the first Chinese thinkers to consider Nietzsche,{{sfn|Kelly|1996a|pp=153-5}} and [[Li Shicen]], whom he describes as the "most explicit of Chinese 'Nietzscheans'".{{sfn|Kelly|1996a|pp=155-9}} Kelly then recounts the view of Nietzsche, and history of Nietzsche scholarship, in China as a whole throughout the twentieth century, concluding that at different times and by different groups, Nietzsche was both admired and despised.{{sfn|Kelly|1996a|pp=159-63}}

===Japan===
;"The early reception of Nietzsche's philosophy in Japan"
"The early reception of Nietzsche's philosophy in Japan" is an essay by Graham Parkes.

;"Nietzsche's conception of nature from an east-Asian point of view"
"Nietzsche's conception of nature from an east-Asian point of view" is an essay by Ōkōchi Ryōgi.

;"The problem of the body in Nietzsche and Dōgen"
"The problem of the body in Nietzsche and Dōgen" is an essay by Arifuku Kōgaku.

;"The eloquent silence of Zarathustra"
"The eloquent silence of Zarathustra" is an essay by Sonoda Muneto.

==Reception==
Alexander Reynolds, whose review of ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' appeared in the ''[[Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]'', considers the task of a philosophical dialogue between East and West to be one of great importance, but felt that the work offered little to contribute to this goal.{{sfn|Reynolds|1993|pp=176-7}} For him, Sprung's piece reveals the lack of interest Nietzsche truly had in Asia, while Nietzsche's reception in Asia can only really be spoken of in Japan, which can be accounted for by Japan's westernization more so than anything else.{{sfn|Reynolds|1993|p=176}} Reynolds also sees philosophical and philological problems with attempts to offer comparisons between Nietzsche and certain Asian figures.{{sfn|Reynolds|1993|pp=176-7}} He concludes that, if Nietzsche was to play any part in the covergence of eastern and western philosophy, "it will not be by grace of our elaborating desperately and incredibly on his sporadic Orientalist velleities".{{sfn|Reynolds|1993|pp=177}}

Kathleen Marie Higgins sees ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' as filling a gap in Nietzsche scholarship.{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=141}} She praises the plurality of contributors, despite the fact that the work was prepared primarily for a Western audience, and is also complimentary of the way in which "the volume's comparative essays attempt to do justice to the dissimilarities of both context and concept in cases where Nietzsche's ideas appear prima facie to resemble those of particular Eastern thinkers", thus rendering "more striking the real similarities between Nietzsche's thought and Asian ideas."{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=143}} She criticises the absence of an essay on Nietzsche's reception in India, but conceded that it was perhaps not comparable to his reception in China or Japan.{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=144}} She concludes by saying that "As a work in comparative philosophy, Nietzsche and Asian Thought is exemplary. Its comparative approach is incisive yet accessible. I consider it a 'must read' for English-speaking Nietzsche scholars and comparativists alike."{{sfn|Higgins|1993|p=144}}

==Legacy==
''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' represents a significant contribution to the scholarship on Nietzsche's relationship with Asian philosophy,{{sfn|Amadae|2004|p=240}} and subsequent works that failed to take account of its scholarship have received criticism on that score.{{sfn|Parkes|2000|p=260}} However, since the time of its publication, some of the scholarship has been superseded; for instance, in 2004, Thomas H. Brobjer published a more extensive account of Nietzsche's reading than that offered by Figl,{{sfn|Groff|2004a|p=?}}{{sfn|Brobjer|2004|pp=3-35}} and, based on that evidence, argues that Sprung had underestimated the amount of Indian philosophy that Nietzsche had read.{{sfn|Brobjer|2004|p=?}} Other writers have challenged the conclusions entirely; S. M. Amadae, though acknowledging that ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' features "state of the art" scholarship reaching conclusions typical of work in the area, feels that the work shows that "the extent to which [Nietzsche] developed his thought in dialogue with the East is almost wholly unacknowledged."{{sfn|Amadae|2004|p=240}} Instead, Amadae argues that Indian philosophy (and, specifically, Theravada Buddhism) were "biographically and intellectually relevant" to Nietzsche's philosophy.{{sfn|Amadae|2004|p=239}}

Writing in 2008, [[Purushottama Bilimoria]] argues that the approach taken in ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' is one of three taken to the relationship between Nietzschean and Asian philosophy. For Bilimoria, the school represented by ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'' "indicates that Nietzsche did not pay serious attention to Asian thought", but that Nietzsche's thinking "had an impact on Asian thinking up to modern times."{{sfn|Bilimoria|2008|p=362}} By comparison, other approaches come from ''Nietzsche and Buddhism: Prolegomenon to Comparative Study'' (1981) by Freny Mistry and ''Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities'' (1997) by Robert G. Morrison. For Bilimoria, Mistry's account "underscores the positive influence that Asian thought had on Nietzsche’s philosophy, especially in light of the new direction he sought to give to Western intellectual culture", while Morrison "argues that Nietzsche looked at Buddhism to find an anchor for his thesis of the ‘physiological origins’ of religion that would supersede the prevailing ‘transcendental ones’."{{sfn|Bilimoria|2008|p=362}}

A special issue of the ''[[Journal of Nietzsche Studies]]'' was published in 2004, aiming to build upon ''Nietzsche and Asian Thought'', which editor Peter S. Groff called "pioneering", as well as subsequent scholarship on the relationship between the thought of Nietzsche and Asian philosophy.{{sfn|Groff|2004a|p=1}} The journal contained six articles on the subject. The first three, "Nietzsche's reading about eastern philosophy", by Thomas H. Brobjer,{{sfn|Brobjer|2004|pp=3-35}} "Nietzsche's Hinduism, Nietzsche's India: another look", by David Smith,{{sfn|Smith|2004|pp=37-56}} and "The 'exotic' Nietzsche—East and West", by Hans-Georg Moeller,{{sfn|Moeller|2004|pp=57-69}} relate to Nietzsche's knowledge of Asian philosophy, and interpretations of Nietzsche in Asia.{{sfn|Groff|2004a|p=1}} The remaining three, "Wandering beyond the bounds: nomadism, health, and self-undermining", by Steve Coutinho and Geir Sigurdsson,{{sfn|Coutinho|Sigurdsson|2004|pp=70-88}} "Zen after Zarathustra: the problem of the will in the confrontation between Nietzsche and Buddhism" by Bret W. Davis,{{sfn|Davis|2004|pp=89-138}} and "Al-Kindī and Nietzsche on the Stoic art of banishing sorrow" by Peter S. Groff,{{sfn|Groff|2004b|pp=139-73}} are dialogues between Nietzsche and Asian figures.{{sfn|Groff|2004a|p=1}}

'''Nikolay Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky'''{{efn|{{lang-rus|Никола́й Гаври́лович Черныше́вский|p=nʲɪkɐˈlaj ɡɐˈvrʲiləvʲit͡ɕ t͡ɕɪrnɨˈʂɛfskʲɪj}}}} (12 July 1828&amp;nbsp;– 17 October 1889) was a Russian revolutionary democrat, [[materialist]] philosopher, critic, and [[Socialism|socialist]] (seen by some as a [[utopian socialist]]). He was the leader of the revolutionary democratic movement of the 1860s, and had an influence on [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Emma Goldman]], and [[Serbia]]n political writer and socialist [[Svetozar Marković]].

==Biography==
The son of a priest, Chernyshevsky was born in [[Saratov]] in 1828, and stayed there till 1846. He graduated at the local [[seminary]]  where he learned English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek and Old Slavonic. It was there he gained a love of literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; At St Petersburg university he often struggled to warm his room. He kept a diary of trivia like the number of tears he shed over a dead friend. It was here that he became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

He was inspired by the works of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. After graduating from [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] in 1850, he taught literature at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Saratov. From 1853 to 1862, he lived in [[Saint Petersburg]], and became the chief editor of ''[[Sovremennik]]'' (“The Contemporary”), in which he published his main literary reviews and his essays on philosophy.

In 1862, he was arrested and confined in the [[Fortress of St. Peter and Paul]], where he wrote his famous novel [[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|''What Is to Be Done?'']] The novel was an inspiration to many later Russian revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the novel's hero [[Rakhmetov]], who was wholly dedicated to the revolution, [[ascetic]] in his habits and ruthlessly disciplined, to the point of sleeping on a bed of nails and eating only raw steak in order to build strength for the Revolution. Among those who have referenced the novel include Lenin, who wrote a work of [[What Is to Be Done?|political theory of the same name]].

In 1862, Chernyshevsky was sentenced to ''civil execution'' ([[mock execution]]), followed by [[Katorga|penal servitude]] (1864–72), and by exile to [[Vilyuisk]],  [[Siberia]] (1872–83). He died at the age of 61.

==Ideas and influence==
Chernyshevsky was a founder of ''[[Narodism]]'', Russian [[populism]], and agitated for the revolutionary overthrow of the autocracy and the creation of a socialist society based on the old peasant commune.

Chernyshevsky’s ideas were heavily influenced by [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Vissarion Belinsky]], and [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]]. He saw [[class struggle]] as the means of society’s forward movement and advocated for the interests of the working people. In his view, the masses were the chief maker of history. He is reputed to have used the phrase “the worse the better”, to indicate that the worse the social conditions became for the poor, the more inclined they would be to launch a revolution.

There are those arguing, in the words of Professor Joseph Frank, that “Chernyshevsky’s novel ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'', far more than Marx’s ''[[Das Kapital]]'', supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Koba the Dread|last= Amis|first= Martin|authorlink=Martin Amis|year= 2002|publisher= Miramax |isbn=0-7868-6876-7|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] was enraged by what he saw as the simplicity of the political and psychological ideas expressed in the book,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Missner Basrstow Dostoevsky Versus Chernyshevsky in College Literature V, 1. Winter 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' largely as a reaction against it.

==Life==
Odo was born at [[Châteauroux]] around the year 1190.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

He preached murderous crusade in 1226.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Bériou, ''La prédication de croisade de Philippe le Chancelier et d'Eudes de Châteauroux en 1226'', in La prédication en pays d'Oc (XIIe-début XVe siècle), Toulouse, Privat, 1997, p. 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; He was chancellor of the [[University of Paris]] 1238-1244,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles H. Haskins]], ''The University of Paris in the Sermons of the Thirteenth Century'', The American Historical Review, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Oct., 1904), pp. 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps also [[Cistercian]] abbot of [[Ourscamp]], and then abbot of [[Grandselve]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abbayedegrandselve.free.fr/abbes.php3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Odo of Ourscamp]] is a different figure, of the twelfth century. However, several sources deny, doubt or ignore that he was a monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1244.htm#Chateauroux|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of May 28, 1244|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was involved in the aftermath of the [[Paris disputation of 1240]], and subsequent condemnation of the ''[[Talmud]]''.  After the disputation a tribunal was appointed to pass judgment upon the Talmud, among its members being Eudes de Chateauroux, Chancellor of the University of Paris; [[Guillaume d'Auvergne]], Bishop of Paris; and the Inquisitor [[Henri de Cologne]]. After the same rabbis had been heard a second time, the Talmud was condemned to be burned. Two years after (in the middle of 1242) twenty-four cartloads of Hebrew books were burned at Paris. [...] A little later, while at Lyons, the pope listened to the complaints of the Jews, and in 1247 he asked Eudes de Chateauroux to examine the Talmud from the Jewish standpoint, and to ascertain whether it might not be tolerated as harmless to the Christian faith, and whether the copies which had been confiscated might not be returned to their owners. The rabbis had represented to him that without the aid of the Talmud they could not understand the Bible or the rest of their statutes. Eudes informed the pope that the change of attitude involved in such a decision would be wrongly interpreted, and on 15 May 1248 the Talmud was condemned for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=288&amp;letter=F|title=FRANCE - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A long list of supposed "errors and blasphemies" contained the Talmud was compiled by Eudes de Chateauroux.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revistamirabilia.com/Numeros/Num5/art5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was made [[cardinal-bishop of Frascati]] (1244).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1244.htm|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of May 28, 1244|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is given also as [[bishop of Toulouse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliotheq.net/richard-de-bury/histoire-de-st.-louis-roi-de-france/page-45.html|title=Bibliotheq.net - Bibliothèque française d'Internet - Richard de Bury - Histoire de St. Louis, Roi de France - Page 45|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bishop of Maguelonne]] and legate, and was sent to preach murderous crusade in France by [[Pope Innocent IV]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Runciman]], ''A History of the Crusades'' III p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied [[Louis IX of France]] on the [[Seventh Crusade]], and is mentioned by [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], returning in 1254, via [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/7224/Rick/chrono13.htm |title=WebCite query result |publisher= |accessdate=29 September 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmsWWBQj |archivedate=October 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals]] from December 1254 and [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]] in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1244.htm|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of May 28, 1244|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ole Fogh Kirkeby.jpg|thumb|Ole Fogh Kirkeby]]

'''Ole Fogh Kirkeby''' (born 1947) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] and a professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]] in the Philosophy of Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Novo Nordisk undergraver sin egen troværdighed |url=http://www.information.dk/191329 |work=[[Dagbladet Information]] |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Education ==
He is a Doctor of Philosophy from [[Aarhus University]], graduated with honours, 1994, with the dissertation "Event and Body-mind. A phenomenological-hermeneutic Analysis". He has an MA (mag.art.) in the History of Ideas from Aarhus University.

== Career ==
As a professional philosopher, Kirkeby focused on the [[Event (philosophy)|event]] as the centre of being. In order to describe the event, he conceived it as a way in which the [[body-mind]] (his neologism) absorbed the event by being absorbed by it. The media in which this takes place is language. Thus Kirkeby combined the theory of [[language game]]s, and the phenomenological tradition, with its emphasis on self-reflective being ([[Heidegger]]), and the theory of bodily incorporation developed by [[Merleau-Ponty]], interpreted through the Stoic vocabulary of the event, into an epistemological theory of the way in which we are “evented”.

In his philosophical trilogy about the event, with the volumes ”Eventum Tantum – The Ethos of the Event (“Eventum Tantum - Begivenhedens ethos,” København: Samfundslitteratur, 2005); Beauty Happens. The Aesthetics of the Event (“Skønheden sker. Begivenhedens æstetik. København: Samfundslitteratur 2007): and The Self happens. The Event of Consciousness (”Selvet sker. Bevidsthedens begivenhed”. Samfundslitteratur) 2008, he created a new framework for approaching the event.

Kirkeby developed a theory of the Good and Welfare, which will be published in the autumn 2011 by Gyldendal, [[Copenhagen]].{{update inline|date=March 2013}}

Kirkeby also worked intensively with [[business economics]], creating a new agenda for [[leadership]], exerting a great influence on managers in Denmark. He focused a radical-normative perspective on leadership, emphasizing leadership virtues, the duty of the leader to make values real, and the indispensable importance of the leader to know himself. He wrote several bestsellers inside this field, among others ''The Philosophy of Management. A Radical-Normative Perspective'' (”Ledelsesfilosofi. Et Radikalt Normativt Perspektiv”, København: Samfundslitteratur, 1997, tranl. To Swedish); ''The New Leadership'' (”Det Nye Lederskab”. København: Børsens Forlag, 2004); and ''The Leadership of the Event and the Force of Action'' (”Begivenhedsledelse og handlekraft”. Børsens Forlag. København 2006).

In English, these topics of business economics are published in the books ''Management Philosophy. A Radical-Normative Perspective'', Heidelberg and New York: Springer Verlag 2000; The Virtue of Leadership. Copenhagen: CBS Press 2007; and The New Protreptic. The Concept and the Art. Copenhagen: CBS Press 2009.

Kirkeby has been active as an author of [[fiction]] with the books ''Philosophical Stories'' (”Filosofiske Fortællinger”. København: Lindhardt &amp; Ringhof, 2004); More Philosophical Short Stories (Flere filosofiske fortællinger: Lindhardt og Ringhof, København 2008).

From 1996 to 2000, Kirkeby co-developed and was the head of the studyboard at the MSc study programmes in Economics &amp; Business Administration (cand.merc.) at the Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. In 2002, Kirkeby founded the Center for Art and Leadership at CBS, with particular emphasis on the way arts are able to inspire leadership. He still functions as its director. In 2003 he co-founded a Danish think tank on Public Governance together with The [[SAS Institute]], Denmark.

[[File:Raphael School of Athens Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|right|Heraclitus (figured by [[Michelangelo]]) sits apart from the other philosophers in [[Raphael Sanzio|Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'']]

'''''On Nature''''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] treatise written by [[Heraclitus]]. According to [[Diogenes Laërtius|Diogenes]], it was divided into three discourses; one on the universe, another on politics (and ethics), and one on theology.  [[Theophrastus]] says (in Diogenes) "...&amp;nbsp;some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Diogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book, inscribed on a single papyrus roll, as a dedication in the great temple of [[Artemis]], the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemisium]], at [[Ephesus]], one of the largest temples of the 6th century BCE and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances; furthermore, many subsequent philosophers in this period refer to the work. Says [[Charles Kahn|Kahn]]:&lt;ref name="kahn"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kahn | first=Charles | title=The Art and Thought of Heraclitus: Fragments with Translation and Commentary | location=London | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1979 | pages=1–23| isbn=0-521-28645-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Down to the time of [[Plutarch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out." Diogenes says: "the book acquired such fame that it produced partisans of his philosophy who were called Heracliteans."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other pre-Socratics, his writings only survive in [[:s:Fragments of Heraclitus|fragments]] quoted by other authors.

'''Paul Scriptoris''' (c. 1460 &amp;ndash; 21 October 1505) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] [[mathematician]], [[Scotism|Scotist]], and professor at the [[University of Tübingen]].  His surname is a [[Latin]] translation of the original [[German language|German]] name '''Schreiber''' ("writer"). Born in [[Weil der Stadt]], Scriptoris studied at [[Paris]] and joined the [[Franciscans|Franciscan order]].  He subsequently began teaching at Tübingen.  [[Konrad Pellikan]], who became Scriptoris’ most favored pupil, joined him at Tübingen in March 1496.  

Scriptoris was an extremely successful teacher in the [[natural sciences]], and awakened interest in this subject in many of his students.  His students included his fellow professors and members of other religious orders.

He lectured on the [[cosmography]] of [[Ptolemy]] and also taught and studied [[Euclid]].  He also wrote a commentary on a work by [[Duns Scotus]], which was published by Johann Ottmar on 24 March 1498. It carries the distinction of being the first book created with a [[printing press]] in the city of Tübingen.  

At Tübingen, Scriptoris opposed the appointment of the [[philosophical realism|Realist]] [[Johann Heynlin]] to the faculty.  

In 1499, Scriptoris was lecturing against [[transubstantiation]] of the bread into the body of Christ.  For this he was banished by the Franciscans and died in exile, at [[Kaysersberg]] in [[Alsace]].

{{Expand Czech|Pražský lingvistický kroužek|date=December 2009}}
The '''Prague school''' or '''Prague linguistic circle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-cs|Pražský lingvistický kroužek}}, {{lang-ru|Пражский лингвистический кружок}} ''Pražskij lingvističeskij kružok'', {{lang-fr|Cercle linguistique de Prague}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was an influential&lt;ref&gt;[[George Steiner]]. Linguistics and Poetics. In Extraterritorial. 1972. 137ff.&lt;/ref&gt; group of [[linguistics|linguist]]s, [[philology|philologist]]s and [[literary critic]]s in [[Prague]]. Its proponents developed methods of [[semiotic literary criticism|structuralist literary analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CTJCiLG9AeoC&amp;pg=PA179 "Semiotic poetics of the Prague School (Prague School)"]: entry in the ''Encyclopedia Or Contemporary Literary Theory: Approaches, Scholars, Terms'', University of Toronto Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and a theory of the standard language and of language cultivation during the years 1928&amp;ndash;1939. The linguistic circle was founded in the Café Derby in Prague, which is also where meetings took place during its first years.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Jakobson: ''My Futurist Years'', New York 1992, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prague School has had a significant continuing influence on [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. Following the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]], the circle was disbanded in 1952, but the Prague School continued as a major force in [[linguistic functionalism]] (distinct from the [[Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen school]] or English Firthian &amp;mdash; later [[Michael Halliday|Hallidean]] &amp;mdash; linguistics).  American scholar [[Dell Hymes]] cites his 1962 paper, "The Ethnography of Speaking," as the formal introduction of Prague functionalism to American linguistic anthropology.
&lt;ref name=hymes1982prague&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hymes|first=Dell|title=Prague Functionalism|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1982|volume=84|issue=2|pages=398–399|doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.2.02a00130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prague structuralists also had a significant influence on [[structuralist film theory]], especially through the introduction of the [[ostensive definition|ostensive]] sign.&lt;ref&gt;Acting and Performance in Moving Image Culture: Bodies, Screens, Renderings. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Prague linguistic circle included the Russian émigrés [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], and [[Sergei Karcevskiy]], as well as the famous Czech literary scholars [[René Wellek]] and [[Jan Mukařovský]]. The instigator of the circle, and its first president until his death in 1945, was the [[Czech people|Czech]] linguist [[Vilém Mathesius]].

In 1929 the Circle promulgated its theses in a paper submitted to the First Congress of [[Slavic studies|Slavists]]. "The programmatic 1929 Prague ''Theses'', surely one of the most imposing linguistic edifices of the 20th century, incapsulated [sic] the functionalist credo."{{sfn|Luelsdorf|1983|p=xvi}} In the late 20th century, English translations of the Circle's seminal works were published by the Czech linguist [[Josef Vachek]] in several collections.

Also in 1929, the group launched a journal, ''Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Prague''. World War II brought an end to it. The ''Travaux'' was briefly resurrected in 1966–1971. The inaugural issue was devoted to the political science concept of [[Postcolonialism|center and periphery]]. It was resurrected yet again in 1995. The group's Czech language work is published in ''[[Slovo a slovesnost]]'' (Word and Literature).

A '''push present''' is a [[gift|present]] a partner gives to the birthing mother to mark the occasion of her giving birth to their child. In practice the present may be given before or after the birth, or even in the delivery room. The giving of push presents has supposedly grown in the United States in recent years.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/fashion/06push.html?ex=1354683600&amp;en=5f57797f8bd491d0&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=A Bundle of Joy Isn't Enough?|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 6, 2007|author=[[Thomas Vinciguerra]]|accessdate=2004-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''push gift'' is any type of present loved ones give to a woman who has recently given birth to a child. There is no conclusive evidence that the present was invented by the jewelry industry to sell more goods,&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; and until recently it was passed on largely by word of mouth or peer pressure among both mothers and fathers.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,99962,00.html|date=October 14, 2003|title='Push Presents' Expected from Expectant Fathers|author= Catherine Donaldson-Evans|work=[[Fox News]].com|accessdate=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Linda Murray, the executive editor of [[BabyCenter]], "It's an expectation of moms these days that they deserve something for bearing the burden for nine months, getting sick, ruining their body. The guilt really gets piled on."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Other sources trace the development of the present to the increased assertiveness of women, allowing them to ask for a present more directly, or the increased involvement of the men in pregnancy, making them more informed of the pain and difficulty of pregnancy and labor.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Frequency==
A 2004 survey of over 30,000 respondents by BabyCenter found that 38% of new mothers received a push present, and 55% of pregnant mothers wanted one, though fewer thought it was actually expected. About 40% of both groups said the baby itself was already a present and did not wish an additional reward.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 

The popularity of push presents has been attributed in part to media coverage of celebrities receiving them. Examples include a 10 carat diamond ring given to celebrity stylist [[Rachel Zoe]] by her husband Rodger after the 2011 birth of their son, a [[Bentley]] given to [[reality TV]] star [[The Real Housewives of Orange County#Peggy Tanous|Peggy Tanous]] of ''[[The Real Housewives of Orange County]]'' by her husband Micah after the 2007 birth of their daughter, and a diamond and sapphire necklace given to singer [[Mariah Carey]] by her husband [[Nick Cannon]] after the 2011 birth of their twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metz|first=Lauren|title=Rachel Zoe Sparkles with 10 Carat Push Present|url=http://origin.www.bravotv.com/blogs/the-dish/rachel-zoe-sparkles-with-10-carat-push-present|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Bravo TV|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Zoe: I’m Happier Than I’ve Ever Been|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2011/05/05/rachel-zoe-im-happier-than-ive-ever-been/?xid=rss-topheadlines|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=People magazine Celebrity Babies|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrity Moms &amp; The Push Presents That Made Labor Bearable|url=http://uptownmagazine.com/2012/05/celebrity-moms-the-push-presents-that-made-labor-bearable-photos/2/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Uptown|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend has generated a backlash, as some couples dislike the implicit materialism of push presents, and would prefer increased help in chores or baby care, or save the money for the child's education.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

According to [[etiquette]] expert Pamela Holland, there are no set guidelines for push presents. "The standard is that there is no standard," she said. "It does make sense to have etiquette around wedding or baby shower gifts because you're inviting other people into it. But this is far too intimate to have a rule."&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; In general it is the woman who lets her man know about push presents, not the other way around,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; although there can be peer pressure from friends to buy one on either the man or the woman.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

Analysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012. A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year. Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an [[eternity ring]] with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475. Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2653">'''Radical interpretation''' is interpretation of a speaker, including attributing beliefs and desires to them and meanings to their words, from scratch—that is, without relying on translators, dictionaries, or specific prior knowledge of their mental states.  The term was introduced by American philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1973) and is meant to suggest important similarity to [[W. V. O. Quine]]'s term [[radical translation]], which occurs in his work on the [[indeterminacy of translation]]. Radical translation
is translation of a speaker's language, without prior knowledge, by observing the speaker's use of the language in context.&lt;ref name="RI"&gt;Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation. Originally published in Dialectica, 27 (1973), 314-28. Reprinted in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (2n. ed. 125-39). New York: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more so than radical translation did for Quine, radical interpretation plays an important role in Davidson's work, but the exact nature of this role is up for debate.  Some see Davidson as using radical interpretation directly in his arguments against conceptual relativism and the possibility of massive error--of most of our beliefs being false.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;Lepore, Ernest and Kirk Ludwig. ''Donald Davidson: Meaning, Truth, Language and Reality''. Oxford. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Davidson seems to explicitly reject this reading in "Radical Interpretation Interpreted".&lt;ref name="RII"&gt;Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation Interpreted. Philosophical Perspectives, 8 (1994), 121-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a more narrow and technical version of radical interpretation used by Davidson:&lt;ref name="RII"/&gt; given the speaker's attitudes of holding particular sentences true in particular circumstances, the speaker's hold-true attitudes, the radical interpreter is to infer a theory of meaning, a truth theory meeting a modified version of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[Convention T]], for the speaker's [[idiolect]].  [[Ernest Lepore]] and [[Kirk Ludwig]] characterize this as inference from sentences of the form:

:Ceteris paribus, S holds true s at t if and only if p.
to corresponding [[T-sentences]] of the form

:s is true (S, t) if and only if q
where s is a sentence in the idiolect of the speaker S, t is a time, and p and q are filled in with sentences in the [[metalanguage]].&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;

'''Robert Hooke''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|h|ʊ|k}}; {{OldStyleDate|28 July|1635|18 July}}&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1703) was an English [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], architect and [[polymath]].

His adult life comprised three distinct periods: as a scientific inquirer lacking money; achieving great wealth and standing through his reputation for hard work and scrupulous honesty following the [[Great Fire of London|great fire of 1666]], and eventually becoming ill and party to jealous intellectual disputes (the last may have contributed to his relative historical obscurity).

At one time he was simultaneously the curator of experiments of the [[Royal Society]], a member of its council, [[Gresham Professor of Geometry]], and Surveyor to the City of London after the [[Great Fire of London]] (in which capacity he appears to have performed more than half of all the surveys after the fire). He was also an important architect of his time – though few of his buildings now survive and some of those are generally misattributed – and was instrumental in devising a set of planning controls for London whose influence remains today. [[Allan Chapman (historian)|Allan Chapman]] has characterised him as "England's [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chapman, Alan|url=http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm |title=England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain|volume= 67|pages= 239–275 |year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306084446/http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm|archivedate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke studied at [[Wadham College, Oxford]] during the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] where he became one of a tightly knit group of ardent [[Royalist]]s led by [[John Wilkins]].  Here he was employed as an assistant to [[Thomas Willis]] and to [[Robert Boyle]], for whom he built the vacuum pumps used in Boyle's [[gas law]] experiments.  He built some of the earliest [[Gregorian telescope]]s and observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. In 1665 he inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration with his book, ''[[Micrographia]]''. Based on his microscopic observations of fossils, Hooke was an early proponent of biological [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Drake, Ellen Tan | chapter = Hooke's Ideas of the Terraqueous Globe and a Theory of Evolution | editor = Michael Cooper | editor2 = Michael Hunter | title = Robert Hooke: Tercentennial Studies | publisher = Ashgate | year = 2006 | location = Burlington, Vermont | pages = 135–149 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5365-3 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=P0-XfTTcwwQC&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Restless Genius: Robert Hooke and His Earthly Thoughts | year = 1996 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-506695-1 | author = Drake, Ellen Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He investigated the phenomenon of [[refraction]], deducing the [[wave theory of light]], and was the first to suggest that matter expands when heated and that air is made of small particles separated by relatively large distances.  He performed pioneering work in the field of surveying and map-making and was involved in the work that led to the first modern plan-form map, though his plan for London on a grid system was rejected in favour of rebuilding along the existing routes.  He also came near to an experimental proof that [[gravity]] follows an [[inverse square law]], and hypothesised that such a relation governs the motions of the planets, an idea which was independently developed by [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 15th Edition, vol.6 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Hooke's scientific work was conducted in his capacity as curator of experiments of the [[Royal Society]], a post he held from 1662, or as part of the household of Robert Boyle.

Much of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography that he commenced in 1696 but never completed. Richard Waller mentions it in his introduction to ''The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.'', printed in 1705. In the chapter ''Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits'', Hooke argues that [[John Dee]] made use of [[Johannes Trithemius|Trithemian]] [[steganography]], to conceal his communication with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6xVTAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke|page=203|author=Robert Hooke|year=1705|publisher=Richard Waller, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Waller, along with [[John Ward (academic)|John Ward]]'s ''Lives of the Gresham Professors'' (with a list of his major works)&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

===Early life===
[[File:Memorial portrait of Robert Hooke at Alum Bay, IoW for Carisbrooke Museum.JPG|thumb|Memorial portrait of Robert Hooke at [[Alum Bay]], [[Isle of Wight]], his birthplace, by Rita Greer (2012).]]
Robert Hooke was born in 1635 in [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles. Robert was the last of four children, two boys and two girls, and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Their father John was a Church of England priest, the curate of [[All Saints' Church, Freshwater|Freshwater's Church of All Saints]],&lt;ref name=Jardine23&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jardine | first = Lisa | title = The Curious Life of Robert Hooke: The Man who Measured London | publisher = Harper Collins Publishers | year = 2003 | location = New York | page = 23 | isbn = 978-0-00-714944-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his two brothers (Robert's uncles) were also ministers. Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church. John Hooke also was in charge of a local school, and so was able to teach Robert, at least partly at home perhaps due to the boy's frail health. He was a Royalist and almost certainly a member of a group who went to pay their respects to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] when he escaped to the Isle of Wight. Robert, too, grew up to be a staunch monarchist.

As a youth, Robert Hooke was fascinated by observation, mechanical works, and drawing, interests that he would pursue in various ways throughout his life. He dismantled a brass clock and built a wooden replica that, by all accounts, worked "well enough", and he learned to draw, making his own materials from coal, chalk and ruddle ([[iron ore]]).

On his father's death in 1648, Robert was left a sum of forty pounds&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/ric.martin/vectis/hookeweb/sggg.htm|title=The Tragedy of Robert Hooke's Brother|last=Martin|first=Rob|year=2000|accessdate=9 March 2010|quote=Robert is given forty pounds, a chest and all the books|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418154423/http://freespace.virgin.net/ric.martin/vectis/hookeweb/sggg.htm|archivedate=18 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JOCEFR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hooke.html|title=Hooke biography|author1=O'Connor, J J|author2=Robertson, E F|lastauthoramp=yes|date=August 2002|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=9 March 2010|quote=He was left £40 by his father, together with all his father's books (the often quoted figure of £100 is a much repeated error)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716214513/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hooke.html|archivedate=16 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that enabled him to buy an apprenticeship; with his poor health throughout his life but evident mechanical facility his father had it in mind that he might become a [[watchmaker]] or [[limner]] (a decorator of [[illuminated manuscript]]s), though Hooke was also interested in painting. Hooke was an apt student, so although he went to London to take up an apprenticeship, and studied briefly with [[Samuel Cowper]] and [[Peter Lely]], he was soon able to enter [[Westminster School]] in London, under Dr. [[Richard Busby]]. Hooke quickly mastered Latin and Greek,&lt;ref name="JOCEFR"/&gt; made some study of Hebrew, and mastered [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].&lt;ref name="JOCEFR"/&gt; Here, too, he embarked on his lifelong study of [[mechanics]].

It appears that Hooke was one of a group of students whom Busby educated in parallel to the main work of the school.  Contemporary accounts say he was "not much seen" in the school, and this appears to be true of others in a similar position.  Busby, an ardent and outspoken Royalist (he had the school observe a fast-day on the anniversary of the King's beheading), was by all accounts trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific inquiry that had begun to flourish in Carolean England but which was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of the Protectorate.  To Busby and his select students the Anglican Church was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work, those who were able were destined by God to explore and study His creation, and the priesthood functioned as teachers to explain it to those who were less able.  This was exemplified in the person of [[George Hooper]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], whom Busby described as "the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the completest bishop that ever was educated at Westminster School".

===Oxford===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]]]]
In 1653, Hooke (who had also undertaken a course of twenty lessons on the [[pipe organ|organ]]) secured a chorister's place at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Jardine23 /&gt; He was employed as a "chemical assistant" to Dr [[Thomas Willis]], for whom Hooke developed a great admiration.  There he met the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, and gained employment as his assistant from about 1655 to 1662, constructing, operating, and demonstrating Boyle's "machina Boyleana" or air pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Shapin, Steven |author2=Schaffer, Simon | title = Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle and the Experimental Life | location = Princeton | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1985 | chapter-url = http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/ShapinSchaffer/ShapinSchaffer_Seeing.html | chapter = 2 | isbn = 978-0-691-08393-3 | accessdate = 11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1662 or 1663 that was awarded a [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/robert-hooke/#gsc.tab=0 Robert Hooke]'' {{ISBN|978-0-756-53317-5}} p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659 Hooke described some elements of a method of heavier-than-air flight to Wilkins, but concluded that human muscles were insufficient to the task.

Hooke himself characterised his Oxford days as the foundation of his lifelong passion for science, and the friends he made there were of paramount importance to him throughout his career, particularly [[Christopher Wren]].  Wadham was then under the guidance of [[John Wilkins]], who had a profound impact on Hooke and those around him.  Wilkins was also a Royalist, and acutely conscious of the turmoil and uncertainty of the times.  There was a sense of urgency in preserving the scientific work which they perceived as being threatened by the Protectorate.  Wilkins' "philosophical meetings" in his study were clearly important, though few records survive except for the experiments Boyle conducted in 1658 and published in 1660.  This group went on to form the nucleus of the [[Royal Society]].  Hooke developed an air pump for Boyle's experiments based on the pump of [[Ralph Greatorex]], which was considered, in Hooke's words, "too gross to perform any great matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Fulton, John F. | title = The Honourable Robert Boyle, F.R.S. (1627–1692) | journal = Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London | year = 1960 | volume = 15| pages = 119–135 (123) | doi = 10.1098/rsnr.1960.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Hooke had a particularly keen eye, and was an adept mathematician, neither of which applied to Boyle.  It has been suggested that Hooke probably made the observations and may well have developed the mathematics of [[Boyle's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Gunther, Robert | title = Early Science in Oxford | volume = 7 | publisher = privately printed | date= 1923–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, it is clear that Hooke was a valued assistant to Boyle and the two retained a mutual high regard.

A chance surviving copy of Willis' pioneering ''De anima brutorum'', a gift from the author, was chosen by Hooke from Wilkins' library on his death as a memento at [[John Tillotson]]'s invitation.  This book is now in the [[Wellcome Library]].  The book and its inscription in Hooke's hand are a testament to the lasting influence of Wilkins and his circle on the young Hooke.

===Royal Society===
The [[Royal Society]] was founded in 1660, and in April 1661 the society debated a short tract on the rising of water in slender glass pipes, in which Hooke reported that the height water rose was related to the bore of the pipe (due to what is now termed [[capillary action]]).  His explanation of this phenomenon was subsequently published in ''Micrography Observ.'' issue 6, in which he also explored the nature of "the fluidity of gravity". On 5 November 1661, Sir [[Robert Moray]] proposed that a Curator be appointed to furnish the society with Experiments, and this was unanimously passed with Hooke being named.  His appointment was made on 12 November, with thanks recorded to Dr. Boyle for releasing him to the Society's employment.

In 1664, Sir John Cutler settled an annual gratuity of fifty pounds on the Society for the founding of a ''Mechanick Lecture'', and the Fellows appointed Hooke to this task.  On 27 June 1664 he was confirmed to the office, and on 11 January 1665 was named ''Curator by Office'' for life with an additional salary of £30 to Cutler's annuity.{{efn|Sir John Cutler and Hooke were at odds in the following years over monies due to Hooke. Following Cutler's death, Hooke enlisted the aid of friends of the Cutler family, including Master of [[The Haberdashers Company]] Sir [[Richard Levett]], for whom Hooke was involved in a building commission, to help recover the funds owed by Cutler.&lt;ref name=Jardine23 /&gt;}}

Hooke's role at the Royal Society was to demonstrate experiments from his own methods or at the suggestion of members.  Among his earliest demonstrations were discussions of the nature of air, the implosion of glass bubbles which had been sealed with comprehensive hot air, and demonstrating that the ''Pabulum vitae'' and ''flammae'' were one and the same. He also demonstrated that a dog could be kept alive with its thorax opened, provided air was pumped in and out of its lungs, and noting the difference between [[venous]] and [[arterial]] blood.  There were also experiments on the subject of gravity, the falling of objects, the weighing of bodies and measuring of [[barometric pressure]] at different heights, and [[pendulum]]s up to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}.

Instruments were devised to measure a [[second of arc]] in the movement of the sun or other stars, to measure the strength of [[gunpowder]], and in particular an engine to cut teeth for watches, much finer than could be managed by hand, an invention which was, by Hooke's death, in constant use.&lt;ref name=Waller&gt;{{Cite book|last = Waller | first = Richard | title = The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.|publisher=Sam.

In 1663 and 1664, Hooke produced his microscopy observations, subsequently collated in ''[[Micrographia]]'' in 1665.

On 20 March 1664, Hooke succeeded Arthur Dacres as [[Gresham Professor of Geometry]].  Hooke received the degree of "Doctor of Physic" in December 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = De Milt, Clara | title = Robert Hooke, Chemist | journal = Journal of Chemical Education |date=November 1939 | volume = 16 | pages = 503–510| doi = 10.1021/ed016p503|bibcode = 1939JChEd..16..503D| issue = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooke and Newcomen===
There is a widely reported story that Dr Hooke corresponded with [[Thomas Newcomen]] in connection with Newcomen's invention of the steam engine. This story was discussed by Rhys Jenkins, a past President of the Newcomen Society, in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;“The Heat Engine Idea in the Seventeenth Century” Rhys Jenkins, Paper read to the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, 21 October 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins traced the origin of the story to an article "Steam Engines" by Dr. [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] (1739–1805) in the third edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica”, which says ''There are to be found among Hooke's papers, in the possession of the Royal Society, some notes of observations, for the use of Newcomen, his countryman, on [[Denis Papin|Papin]]'s boasted method of transmitting to a great distance the action of an mill by means of pipes'', and that Hooke had dissuaded Newcomen from erecting a machine on this principle. Jenkins points out a number of errors in Robison's article, and questions whether the correspondent might in fact have been Newton, whom Hooke is known to have corresponded with, the name being misread as Newcomen. A search by Mr. H W Dickinson of Hooke's papers held by the Royal Society, which had been bound together in the middle of the 18th century, i.e. before Robison's time, and carefully preserved since, revealed no trace of any correspondence between Hooke and Newcomen. Jenkins concluded ''... this story must be omitted from the history of the steam engine, at any rate until documentary evidence is forthcoming.''

In the intervening years since 1936 no such evidence has been found, but the story persists. For instance, in a book published in 2011 it is said that ''in a letter dated 1703 Hooke did suggest that Newcomen use condensing steam to drive the piston.''&lt;ref&gt;

==Personality and disputes==
Hooke was irascible, at least in later life, proud, and prone to take umbrage with intellectual competitors, though he was by all accounts also a staunch friend and ally and was loyal always to the circle of ardent [[Royalist]]s with whom he had his early training at [[Wadham College]], particularly [[Christopher Wren]].  His reputation suffered after his death and this is popularly attributed to a dispute with [[Isaac Newton]] over credit for his work on gravitation, the planets and to a lesser degree light. His dispute with [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] about whether Oldenburg had leaked or passed on details of Hooke's watch escapement to others is another well-known example.

Newton, as President of the Royal Society, did much to obscure Hooke, including, it is said, destroying (or failing to preserve) the only known portrait of the man.  It did not help that the first biography of Wren, ''Parentalia'', was written by Wren's son, and tended to exaggerate Wren's work over all others.  Hooke's reputation was revived during the twentieth century through studies of [[Robert Gunther]] and Margaret 'Espinasse. After a long period of relative obscurity he has now been recognised as one of the most important scientists of his age.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the 2003 Hooke meeting at the University of Oxford: {{cite web| title = Robert Hooke Day at Christ Church, Oxford | url = http://hooke.chem.ox.ac.uk/ | accessdate = 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke was apt to use [[ciphers]] and guard his ideas.  As curator of Experiments to the Royal Society he was responsible for demonstrating many ideas sent in to the Society, and there is evidence that he would subsequently assume some credit for these ideas. Hooke also was immensely busy and thus unable&amp;nbsp;– or in some cases unwilling, pending a way of profiting from the enterprise via letters patent&amp;nbsp;– to develop all of his own ideas. This was a time of immense scientific progress, and numerous ideas were developed in several places simultaneously.

None of this should distract from Hooke's inventiveness, his remarkable experimental facility, and his capacity for hard work. His ideas about gravitation, and his claim of priority for the inverse square law, are outlined below.  He was granted a large number of patents for inventions and refinements in the fields of elasticity, optics, and barometry. The Royal Society's Hooke papers (recently discovered after disappearing when Newton took over) will open up a modern reassessment.

[[File:Louse diagram, Micrographia, Robert Hooke, 1667.jpg|thumb|upright|Diagram of a [[louse]] from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'']]
Much has been written about the unpleasant side of Hooke's personality, starting with comments by his first biographer, Richard Waller, that Hooke was "in person, but despicable" and "melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous."&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt; Waller's comments influenced other writers for well over two centuries, so that a picture of Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon dominates many older books and articles.  For example, Arthur Berry said that Hooke "claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Berry | first = Arthur | title = A Short History of Astronomy | publisher = John Murray | location = London | year = 1898 | page = 221}}- See also the reprint published by Dover in 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan wrote that Hooke was "positively unscrupulous" and possessing an "uneasy apprehensive vanity" in dealings with Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sullivan | first = J. W. N. | title = Isaac Newton 1642–1727 | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York  | year = 1938 | pages = 35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel used the phrase "cantankerous, envious, vengeful" in his description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Manuel | first = Frank E. | title = A Portrait of Isaac Newton | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1968 | page = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; More described Hooke having both a "cynical temperament" and a "caustic tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = More | first = Louis Trenchard | title = Isaac Newton  | publisher = Charles Schribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 1934 | pages = 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrade was more sympathetic, but still used the adjectives "difficult", "suspicious", and "irritable" in describing Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrarde | first = E. N. De C. | title = Isaac Newton  | publisher = Chanticleer Press | location = New York  | year = 1950 | pages = 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of Hooke's diary in 1935&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book| first = Robert | last = Hooke | editor-last = Robinson | editor-first = H. W. | editor2-last = Adams | editor2-first = W. | title = The Diary of Robert Hooke, M.A., M.D., F.R.S., 1672–1680 | year = 1935 | place = London | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed other sides of the man that 'Espinasse, in particular, has detailed carefully.  She writes that "the picture which is usually painted of Hooke as a morose and envious recluse is completely false."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = 'Espinasse | first = Margaret | title = Robert Hooke | publisher = William Heinemann Ltd. | year = 1956 | location = London | page = 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke interacted with noted craftsmen such as [[Thomas Tompion]], the clockmaker, and Christopher Cocks (Cox), an instrument maker.  Hooke often met [[Christopher Wren]], with whom he shared many interests, and had a lasting friendship with [[John Aubrey]].  Hooke's diaries also make frequent reference to meetings at coffeehouses and taverns, and to dinners with Robert Boyle.  He took tea on many occasions with his lab assistant, Harry Hunt.  Within his family, Hooke took both a niece and a cousin into his home, teaching them mathematics.

Robert Hooke spent his life largely on the Isle of Wight, at Oxford, and in London.  He never married, but his diary records that he had sexual relations with his niece, Grace, and several of his housekeepers. He at one point records that one of these housekeepers gave birth to a girl, but doesn't note the paternity of the child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On 3 March 1703, Hooke died in London, and a chest containing £8,000 in money and gold was found in his room at Gresham College. Although he had talked of leaving a generous bequest to the Royal Society which would have given his name to a library, laboratory and lectures, no will was found and the money passed to an illiterate cousin, Elizabeth Stephens.{{sfn|Inwood|2002|pp=1,2}}  He was buried at [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], but the precise location of his grave is unknown.

==Science==
[[File:HookeFlea01.jpg|thumb|Hooke's drawing of a [[flea]]]]

===Mechanics===
In 1660, Hooke discovered [[Hooke's law|the law]] of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] with extension in an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] spring.  He first described this discovery in the anagram "ceiiinosssttuv", whose solution he published in 1678&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''De Potentia Restitutiva, or of Spring. Explaining the Power of Springing Bodies'', London, 1678.&lt;/ref&gt; as "Ut tensio, sic vis" meaning "As the extension, so the force."  Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the [[balance spring]] or hairspring, which for the first time enabled a portable timepiece&amp;nbsp;– a watch&amp;nbsp;– to keep time with reasonable accuracy.  A bitter dispute between Hooke and [[Christiaan Huygens]] on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see ''External links'' below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.qmul.ac.uk/cell/Hooke/hooke_folio.php?id=80&amp;option=both |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718125416/http://webapps.qmul.ac.uk/cell/Hooke/hooke_folio.php?id=80&amp;option=both |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=Hooke Folio Online |publisher=Webapps.qmul.ac.uk |accessdate=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RobertHookeMicrographia1665.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cell structure of [[Cork (material)|cork]] by Hooke]]
It is interesting{{to whom|date=July 2018}} from a twentieth-century vantage point that Hooke first announced his law of elasticity as an [[anagram]].  This was a method sometimes used by scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens, [[Galileo]], and others, to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Hooke became Curator of Experiments in 1662 to the newly founded Royal Society, and took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings.  This was a position he held for over 40 years.  While this position kept him in the thick of science in Britain and beyond, it also led to some heated arguments with other scientists, such as Huygens (see above) and particularly with [[Isaac Newton]] and the Royal Society's [[Henry Oldenburg]].  In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of [[Geometry]] at [[Gresham College]] in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = 'Espinasse | first = Margaret | title = Robert Hooke | publisher = William Heinemann Ltd. | year = 1956 | location = London | page = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the [[Cymatics|nodal patterns]] associated with the [[normal mode|modes of vibration]] of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;[http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514140121/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html |date=14 May 2011 }}, [http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/about/index.html Institute for Learning Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111135833/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/about/index.html |date=11 November 2007 }}, [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Scientists'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 101, {{ISBN|7810802259}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In acoustics, in 1681 he showed the Royal Society that musical tones could be generated from spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Robert Hooke|author=Clive Greated|access-date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitation===
While many of his contemporaries believed in the [[aether theories|aether]] as a medium for transmitting attraction or repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in ''[[Micrographia]]'' (1665). Hooke's 1666 [[Royal Society]] lecture on gravity added two further principles: that all bodies move in straight lines till deflected by some force and that the attractive force is stronger for closer bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Birch, ''The History of the Royal Society of London'', … (London, England:  1756), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 68–73]; see especially pages 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dugald Stewart]] quoted Hooke's own words on his system of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Dugald (1877) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OAwRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304 ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind''], T. &amp; T. Clark, Vol. 2, Ch. 2, Section 4.2 (pp. 304 ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"I will explain," says Hooke, in a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, "a system of the world very different from any yet received. It is founded on the following positions. 1. That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but that they also mutually attract each other within their spheres of action. 2. That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, an ellipse, or some other curve. 3. That this attraction is so much the greater as the bodies are nearer. As to the proportion in which those forces diminish by an increase of distance, I own I have not discovered it...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to "all celestial bodies" and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines.

Hooke published his ideas about the "System of the World" again in somewhat developed form in 1674, as an addition to "An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations".&lt;ref name=attempt&gt;Hooke's 1674 statement in "An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations", is available in [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView/ECHOzogiLib?mode=imagepath&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/XXTBUC3U/pageimg online facsimile here].&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body.

Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions.  Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.  On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: "Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: "This I only hint at present", "having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it" (i.e. "prosecuting this Inquiry").&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt;

In November 1679, Hooke initiated a remarkable exchange of letters with Newton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iliffe, Rob |title=Newton:A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8KyKP1T-sYC&amp;pg=PT140|year= 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157902-8|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which the full text is now published).&lt;ref name=167986letters&gt;Turnbull, H W (ed.) (1960), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Vol. 2 (1676–1687), Cambridge University Press, giving the Hooke-Newton correspondence (of November 1679 to January 1679/80) at pp. 297–314, and the 1686 correspondence over Hooke's priority claim at pp. 431–448.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke's ostensible purpose was to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H W (ed.) (1960), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Vol. 2 (1676–1687), Cambridge University Press, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others; and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning "compounding the celestial motions of the planetts of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body", and "my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items.   Newton's reply offered "a fansy of my own" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.  The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.{{efn|Several commentators{{who|date=November 2018}} have followed Hooke in calling Newton's spiral path mistaken, or even a 'blunder', but there are also the facts: (a) that Hooke left out of account Newton's specific statement that the motion resulted from dropping "a heavy body suspended in the Air" (i.e. a resisting medium), see Newton to Hooke, 28 November 1679, document #236 at p. 301, 'Correspondence' vol. 2 cited above, and compare Hooke's report to the Royal Society on 11 December 1679 where Hooke reported the matter "supposing no resistance", see D Gjertsen, 'Newton Handbook' (1986), at p. 259; and (b) that Hooke's reply of 9 December 1679 to Newton considered the cases of motion both with and without air resistance: The resistance-free path was what Hooke called an 'elliptueid'; but a line in Hooke's diagram showing the path for his case of air resistance was, though elongated, also another inward-spiralling path ending at the Earth's centre: Hooke wrote "where the Medium ... has a power of impeding and destroying its motion the curve in which it would move would be some what like the Line AIKLMNOP &amp;c and ... would terminate in the center C". Hooke's path including air resistance was therefore to this extent like Newton's (see 'Correspondence' vol.2, cited above, at pp. 304–306, document #237, with accompanying figure). The diagrams are also online: see Wilson, p. 241, showing Newton's 1679 diagram with spiral,&lt;ref&gt;R. Taton, C. Wilson, Michael Hoskin (eds), ''Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton'',Cambridge University Press 2003, ISBN:0521542057, 9780521542050, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA241 page 241]&lt;/ref&gt; and extract of his letter; also Wilson, p. 242 showing Hooke's 1679 diagram including two paths, closed curve and spiral.&lt;ref&gt;R. Taton, C. Wilson, Michael Hoskin (eds), ''Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton'',Cambridge University Press 2003, ISBN:0521542057, 9780521542050, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA242 page 242]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton pointed out in his later correspondence over the priority claim that the descent in a spiral "is true in a resisting medium such as our air is", see 'Correspondence', vol. 2 cited above, at p. 433, document #286.}} A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1679|80 to Newton, communicated his "supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance."&lt;ref&gt;See p. 309 in 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol. 2 cited above, at document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1686, when the first book of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed that he had given Newton the "notion" of "the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center".  At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that "the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby" was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that "by the late 1660s," the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Gal, Ofer (2002) ''Meanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the 'Compounding of the Celestiall Motions of the Planetts'', Springer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKYlXxIemoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9 p. 9], {{ISBN|1402007329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whiteside, D T |title=The pre-history of the 'Principia' from 1664 to 1686|jstor=531520|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1991.0002 |journal= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 45|year=1991|pages =11–61 (13–20)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt; Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid "at great distances from the center".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the 'Principia', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system.  Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the 'Principia', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it."&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

One of the contrasts between the two men was that Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications as well as optical experimentation, while Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range, that it is not surprising to find that he left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped.  This in turn makes it understandable how in 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, [[Alexis Clairaut]], mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation.  "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory", Clairaut wrote; "The example of Hooke" serves "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, "An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'" (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in "Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton" (1759), at Introduction (section IX), p. 6: "Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton", [and] "L'exemple de Hook" [serves] "à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horology===
Hooke made tremendously important contributions to the science of timekeeping, being intimately involved in the advances of his time; the introduction of the pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, the balance spring to improve the timekeeping of watches, and the proposal that a precise timekeeper could be used to find the longitude at sea.

====Anchor escapement====
[[File:Anchor Escapement.png|thumb|upright|[[Anchor escapement]]]]

In 1655, according to his autobiographical notes, Hooke began to acquaint himself with astronomy, through the good offices of John Ward.  Hooke applied himself to the improvement of the [[pendulum]] and in 1657 or 1658, he began to improve on pendulum mechanisms, studying the work of [[Giovanni Riccioli]], and going on to study both gravitation and the mechanics of timekeeping.

Henry Sully, writing in Paris in 1717, described the [[anchor escapement]] as ''an admirable invention of which Dr. Hooke, formerly professor of geometry in Gresham College at London, was the inventor.''&lt;ref&gt;Sully, H and Le Roy, J (1737) ''Regle artificielle des tems'', G. Dupuis, Paris, ch. 1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Derham]] also attributes it to Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, William (1734) ''The artificial clock maker'', James, John and Paul Knapton. at the Crown, in Ludgate Street., p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Watch balance spring====
[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|right|thumb|upright|[[Christiaan Huygens]]]]

Hooke recorded that he conceived of a way to determine [[longitude]] (then a critical problem for navigation), and with the help of Boyle and others he attempted to patent it.  In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising, fitted with a [[coil spring]] attached to the arbour of the balance.  Hooke's ultimate failure to secure sufficiently lucrative terms for the exploitation of this idea resulted in its being shelved, and evidently caused him to become more jealous of his inventions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Hooke developed the [[balance spring]] independently of and at least 5 years before [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sample, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/09/science.research "Eureka! Lost manuscript found in cupboard"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who published his own work in ''Journal de Scavans'' in February 1675.

===Microscopy===
[[File:Hooke Microscope-03000276-FIG-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Hooke's microscope]]
In 1665 Hooke published ''[[Micrographia]]'', a book describing observations made with [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s, as well as some original work in [[biology]].  Hooke coined the term ''[[cell (biology)|cell]]'' for describing biological organisms, the term being suggested by the resemblance of plant cells to cells of a honeycomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooke|first1=Robert|title=Micrographia: Or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon|date=1665|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486495644|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Micrographia+honeycomb#v=onepage&amp;q=Micrographia%20honeycomb&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hand-crafted, leather and gold-tooled microscope he used to make the observations for ''Micrographia'', originally constructed by Christopher White in London, is on display at the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]] in [[Washington, DC]].

''Micrographia'' also contains Hooke's, or perhaps Boyle and Hooke's, ideas on combustion.  Hooke's experiments led him to conclude that combustion involves a substance that is mixed with air, a statement with which modern scientists would agree, but that was not understood widely, if at all, in the seventeenth century.  Hooke went on to conclude that respiration also involves a specific component of the air.&lt;ref&gt;See particularly Observation 16 of ''Micrographia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Partington even goes so far as to claim that if "Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion it is probable that he would have discovered [[oxygen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Partington, J. P. | title = A Short History of Chemistry | year = 1951 | edition = 2nd| publisher = Macmillan and Company | location = London | pages = 78–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palaeontology===
[[File:Moon Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|upright|Drawings of the [[Moon]] and the [[Pleiades]] from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'']]
One of the observations in ''Micrographia'' was of [[petrified wood|fossil wood]], the microscopic structure of which he compared to ordinary wood. This led him to conclude that fossilised objects like petrified wood and fossil shells, such as [[Ammonites]], were the remains of living things that had been soaked in petrifying water laden with minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudwick|first=Martin J.S.|authorlink=Martin J. S. Rudwick|title=The Meaning of Fossils|year=1976|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke believed that such fossils provided reliable clues to the past history of life on earth, and, despite the objections of contemporary naturalists like [[John Ray]] who found the concept of [[extinction]] theologically unacceptable, that in some cases they might represent species that had become extinct through some geological disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J. Bowler|title=The Earth Encompassed|year=1992|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] wrote the following in his [[q:Charles Lyell#Principles of geology (1832) Vol.1|''Principles of Geology'']] (1832).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke M.D.,'... appeared in 1705, containing 'A Discourse of Earthquakes'... His treatise... is the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature. 'However trivial a thing,' he says, 'a rotten shell may appear to some, yet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity than coins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited or made by art and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and inscriptions, as all the learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often been actually practised,' &amp;c.; 'and though it must be granted that it is very difficult to read them and to raise a chronology out of them, and to state the intervals of the time wherein such or such catastrophes and mutations have happened, yet it is not impossible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Astronomy===
[[File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Hooke noted the shadows (a and b) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of [[Saturn]].]]

One of the more-challenging problems tackled by Hooke was the measurement of the distance to a star (other than the Sun).  The star chosen was [[Gamma Draconis]] and the method to be used was [[parallax]] determination.  After several months of observing, in 1669, Hooke believed that the desired result had been achieved.  It is now known that Hooke's equipment was far too imprecise to allow the measurement to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hirshfeld, Alan W. | title = Parallax, The Race to Measure the Cosmos|isbn=978-0716737117 | year = 2001| publisher = W. H. Freeman | location = New York | pages = 144–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma Draconis was the same star [[James Bradley]] used in 1725 in discovering the [[aberration of light]].

Hooke's activities in astronomy extended beyond the study of stellar distance.  His ''Micrographia'' contains illustrations of the [[Pleiades]] star cluster as well as of [[lunar craters]].  He performed experiments to study how such craters might have formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Ashbrook, Joseph |isbn=978-0521106047| title = The Astronomical Scrapbook | year = 1984 | place = Cambridge, Massachusetts | publisher = Sky Publishing Corporation | pages = 240–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke also was an early observer of the [[rings of Saturn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Alexander, A. F. O'D. | title = The Planet Saturn | year = 1962 | place = Londin | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited | pages = 108–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered one of the first observed [[double-star]] systems, [[Gamma Arietis]], in 1664.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Aitken, Robert G. | title = The Binary Stars | year = 1935 | place = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
A lesser-known contribution, however one of the first of its kind, was Hooke's scientific model of human [[memory]].  Hooke in a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society proposed a mechanistic model of human memory, which would bear little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models before it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Singer, B. R. |year=1979|title=Robert Hooke on memory: Association and time perception (I)|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 31|pages= 115–131|jstor=531553|pmid=11609928|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1976.0003|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting&amp;nbsp;–  some with surprising modern accuracy.&lt;ref name="Hintzman, D. L. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hintzman, D. L. |year=2003|title=Robert Hooke's model of memory|journal= Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|pmid=12747488|volume= 10|pages= 3–14|doi=10.3758/BF03196465|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work, overlooked for nearly 200 years, shared a variety of similarities with [[Richard Semon]]'s work of 1919/1923, both assuming memories were physical and located in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Semon, R. (1923). Mnemic psychology (B. Duffy, Trans.). London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. (Original work published 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L. (2001). ''Forgotten ideas, neglected pioneers: Richard Semon and the story of memory''. Philadelphia: Psychology Press/Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|184169052X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schacter, D. L.|author2=Eich, J. E.|author3=Tulving, E.|last-author-amp=yes |year=1978|title= Richard Semon's theory of memory|journal= Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior|volume=17|pages= 721–743|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(78)90443-7|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model's more interesting points are that it (1) allows for attention and other top-down influences on encoding; (2) it uses resonance to implement parallel, cue-dependent retrieval; (3) it explains memory for recency; (4) it offers a single-system account of repetition and priming, and (5) the power law of forgetting can be derived from the model's assumption in a straightforward way.&lt;ref name="Hintzman, D. L. 2003"/&gt; This lecture would be published posthumously in 1705 as the memory model was unusually placed in a series of works on the nature of light.  It has been speculated that this work saw little review as the printing was done in small batches in a post-Newtonian age of science and was most likely deemed out of date by the time it was published.  Further interfering with its success was contemporary memory psychologists' rejection of immaterial souls, which Hooke invoked to some degree in regards to the processes of attention, encoding and retrieval.

==Architecture==
[[File:MK WillenChurch01.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Willen|Church of St Mary Magdalene]] at Willen, [[Milton Keynes]]]]
[[File:Jan Baptist van Helmont portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait thought for a time to be Hooke, but almost certainly [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].]]

Hooke was Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant to [[Christopher Wren]], in which capacity he helped Wren rebuild London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in 1666, and also worked on the design of London's [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|Monument to the fire]], the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House in Bloomsbury]], and the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] (which became known as 'Bedlam').  Other buildings designed by Hooke include The [[Royal College of Physicians]] (1679), [[Ragley Hall]] in Warwickshire, [[Ramsbury Manor]] in Wiltshire&lt;ref&gt;Inwood, Stephen (28 February 2011). The Man Who Knew Too Much (Kindle Location 8290). Macmillan Publishers UK. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and the parish church of [[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Willen|St Mary Magdalene]] at [[Willen]] in Milton Keynes, [[History of Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]].  Hooke's collaboration with [[Christopher Wren]] also included [[St Paul's Cathedral]], whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke. Hooke also participated in the design of the [[Pepys Library]], which held the manuscripts of [[Samuel Pepys]]' diaries, the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Magdalene Described|first=R.|last=Hyam|publisher=Crampton &amp; Sons Ltd.|location=Sawston, Cambridgeshire, U.K.|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke and Wren both being keen astronomers, the Monument was designed to serve a scientific function as a [[telescope]] for observing [[Transit (astronomy)|transits]], though Hooke's characteristically precise measurements after completion showed that the movement of the column in the wind made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed in the construction of the [[spiral staircase]], which has no central column, and in the observation chamber which remains in place below ground level.

In the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London's streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries, a pattern subsequently used in the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|renovation of Paris]], Liverpool, and many American cities.  This proposal was thwarted by arguments over property rights, as property owners were surreptitiously shifting their boundaries.  Hooke was in demand to settle many of these disputes, due to his competence as a surveyor and his tact as an arbitrator.

For an extensive study of Hooke's architectural work, see the book by Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cooper | first = Michael | title = A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire | publisher = Sutton Publishing Ltd. | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-7509-2959-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Likenesses==
No authenticated portrait of Robert Hooke exists. This situation has sometimes been attributed to the heated conflicts between Hooke and Newton, although Hooke's biographer Allan Chapman rejects as a myth the claims that Newton or his acolytes deliberately destroyed Hooke's portrait. German antiquarian and scholar [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]] visited the Royal Society in 1710 and his account of his visit specifically mentions him being shown the portraits of 'Boyle and Hoock' (which were said to be good likenesses), but while Boyle's portrait survives, Hooke's has evidently been lost.&lt;ref name="rod.beavon.clara.net"&gt;[http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm Allan Chapman, "England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England", lecture from 'Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain', 67, 239–275 (1996), also given at Westminster School as the 1997 Sir Henry Tizard Memorial Lecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030235901/http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hooke's time, the Royal Society met at Gresham College, but within a few months of Hooke's death Newton became the Society's president and plans were laid for a new meeting place.  When the move to new quarters finally was made a few years later, in 1710, Hooke's Royal Society portrait went missing, and has yet to be found.

Two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance have survived. The first was recorded by his close friend [[John Aubrey]], who described Hooke in middle age and at the height of his creative powers:

{{quote|He is but of midling stature, something crooked, pale faced, and his face but little below, but his head is lardge, his eie full and popping, and not quick; a grey eie. He haz a delicate head of haire, browne, and of an excellent moist curle. He is and ever was temperate and moderate in dyet, etc.}}

The second is a rather unflattering description of Hooke as an old man, written by Richard Waller:

{{quote|As to his Person he was but despicable, being very crooked, tho' I have heard from himself, and others, that he was strait till about 16 Years of Age when he first grew awry, by frequent practising, with a Turn-Lath ... He was always very pale and lean, and laterly nothing but Skin and Bone, with a Meagre Aspect, his Eyes grey and full, with a sharp ingenious Look whilst younger; his nose but thin, of a moderate height and length; his Mouth meanly wide, and upper lip thin; his Chin sharp, and Forehead large; his Head of a middle size. He wore his own Hair of a dark Brown colour, very long and hanging neglected over his Face uncut and lank...&lt;ref name="rod.beavon.clara.net"/&gt;}}

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a portrait, supposedly of Hooke, on 3 July 1939.  However, when the source was traced by [[Ashley Montagu]], it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke.  Moreover, Montagu found that two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance agreed with one another, but that neither matched the ''Time'''s portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Montagu, M. F. Ashley | title = A Spurious Portrait of Robert Hooke (1635–1703) | journal = Isis | volume = 33 | year = 1941 | pages = 15–17 | doi = 10.1086/358521}} See also 3 July 1939 issue of ''Time'' (p. 39).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, historian [[Lisa Jardine]] claimed that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jardine | first = Lisa | title = The Curious Life of Robert Hooke | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2003 | pages = 15–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this claim was disproved by William Jensen of the [[University of Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.uc.edu/source/volfour/oesper2.html |title=Source- The UC Libraries Newsletter |publisher=Libraries.uc.edu |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait identified by Jardine depicts the Flemish scholar [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].

Other possible likenesses of Hooke include the following:
* A seal used by Hooke displays an unusual profile portrait of a man's head, which some have argued portrays Hooke.
* The engraved frontispiece to the 1728 edition of [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers' ''Cyclopedia'']] shows a drawing of a bust of Robert Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.she-philosopher.com/players/RHsplash.html |title=Robert Hooke |publisher=she-philosopher.com |date=17 August 2007 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the drawing is based on an actual work of art is unknown.

The Rita Greer Robert Hooke project aimed to produce credible images of him, both painted and drawn, that fitted his contemporary descriptions by John Aubrey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Aubrey | first = John | title = Brief Lives | publisher = Boydell Press; New edition |year=2009|isbn= }}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Waller.&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt; Greer's images of Hooke, his life and work have been used for TV programmes in UK and US, in books, magazines and for PR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Burgan | first = Michael | title = Robert Hooke Natural Philosopher and Scientific Explorer | publisher = Compass Point Books|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota | year = 2008 | pages = Cover,  21, 26, 45, 65, 77, 88, 96, 98–99, 101| isbn = 978-0756533151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fekany Lee | first = Kimberly | title = Cell Scientists:  from Leeuwenhoek to Fuchs | publisher = Compass Point Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-7565-3964-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chapman | first = Allan | title = England's Leonardo Robert Hooke and the Seventeenth-Century Scientific Revolution | publisher = Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = Portrait of Robert Hooke inside dust jacket and last page of plates | isbn = 978-0-7503-0987-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Gresham College memorial portrait of Robert Hooke | journal = Dome, the Magazine of the Friends of St. Paul's Cathedral | issue = 46 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Chapman | first = Allan | title = Robert Hooke: the forgotten genius of physics | journal = Interactions | issue = April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Rita's portraits of Hooke sought after across UK | journal = Petersfield Post | issue = 21 May | year = 2008 | page  = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Unveiling of memorial portrait of Robert Hooke as astronomer and inventor | journal = Openhouse.

'''Takis Fotopoulos''' ({{lang-el|Τάκης Φωτόπουλος}} born October 14, 1940) is a political philosopher and economist who founded the [[inclusive democracy|Inclusive Democracy]] movement, aiming at a synthesis of classical democracy with [[libertarian socialism]]&lt;ref name="book review"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jean-Claude |last1=Richard |url=http://www.monde-libertaire.fr/n1311-13-19mars-2003/10801-vers-une-democratie-generale-takis-fotopoulos-dp16 |title=''Vers une démocratie générale'', Takis Fotopoulos |journal=[[Le Monde Libertaire]] |volume=1311 |date=13–19 March 2003 |language=French |type=Book review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the radical currents in the [[new social movements]]. He was an academic, and has written many books and over 900 articles,. He is the editor of ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''  (which succeeded ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'') and is the author of ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' (1997) in which the foundations of the Inclusive Democracy project were set.&lt;ref name=BioContinuum&gt;[http://www.bloomsbury.com/author/takis-fotopoulos/ Takis Fotopoulos bio] at [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Bloomsburry Publishing/Continuum]]'s website.&lt;/ref&gt; His latest book is ''The New World Order in Action: Volume 1: Globalization, the Brexit Revolution and the "Left"- Towards a Democratic Community of Sovereign Nations'' (December 2016). Fotopoulos is Greek and lives in London.&lt;ref name=BioEIPCP&gt;[http://www.eipcp.net/bio/fotopoulos Takis Fotopoulos bio] at eipcp's (European Institute for Progressive Cultural Policies) website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Fotopoulos was born on the Greek island of [[Chios]] and his family moved to Athens soon afterwards. After graduating from the [[University of Athens]] with degrees in Economics and Political Science and in Law, he moved to London in 1966 for postgraduate study at the [[London School of Economics]] on a Varvaressos scholarship from Athens University. He was a student [[syndicalist]] and activist in Athens&lt;ref&gt;He was elected as a member of the Administrative Council of the Law students Union in 1958-59, following the first victory of a Left alliance in which he participated against EKOF, an extreme right wing student association controlled by the 'deep' Greek state , which a few years later, in 1963, was responsible for the murder of Left parliamentarian Grigoris Lambrakis and 4 years later of the military coup which led to the military dictatorship (1967-74).&lt;/ref&gt; and then a political activist in London, taking an active part in the [[1968 student protests]] in London, and in organisations of the revolutionary Greek Left during the struggle against the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. During this period, he was a member of the Greek group called [[Revolutionary Socialist Groups]] in London, which published the newspaper ''Μαμή'' ("Midwife", from the Marxian dictum, "violence is the midwife of revolution") for which he wrote several articles.&lt;ref&gt;As testified by the Left composer Lakis Karalis in an interview in the Athens newspaper Eleftherotypia (06/09/2008) and in an Arts web site [http://www.provoleas.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=758&amp;Itemid=69 Προβολέας] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208050755/http://www.provoleas.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=758&amp;Itemid=69 |date=2015-12-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fotopoulos married Sia Mamareli (a former lawyer) in 1966; the couple have a son, Costas (born in 1974), who is a Composer and Pianist.

==Academia and afterwards==
Fotopoulos was a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]] from 1969 to 1989, until he began editing the journal ''Society &amp; Nature'', later ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' and subsequently the online ''International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.&lt;ref name=BioContinuum /&gt;&lt;ref name=BioEIPCP /&gt; He was also a columnist of ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{gr icon}} [http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.search&amp;t=0&amp;q=&amp;cat=&amp;typ=&amp;author=%CE%A6%CF%89%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82+%CE%A4%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%82&amp;s=p Archive of Takis Fotopoulos' articles at the website of Eleftherotypia]&lt;/ref&gt; the second-biggest newspaper in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Helena |last1=Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/greek-election-blog-2012/2012/jun/12/greek-journalists-unpaid-newspaper-edition |title=Greek journalists return to work unpaid for what may be paper's last edition |journal=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusive Democracy==
{{Libertarian socialism|People}}
{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}
Fotopoulos developed the political project of [[Inclusive Democracy]] (ID) in 1997 (an exposition can be found in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy''). The first issue of ''Society &amp; Nature'' declared that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;our ambition is to initiate an urgently needed dialogue on the crucial question of developing a new liberatory social project, at a moment in [[History]] when the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] has abandoned this traditional role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynature.org/vol9/editorial_3.htm Editorial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It specified that the new project should be seen as the outcome of a synthesis of the democratic, libertarian socialist and [[Green anarchism|radical Green]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/our_aims.htm Our Aims] @ Society and Nature/Democracy and Nature's website&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a dialogue has followed in the pages of the journal, in which supporters of the [[autonomy]] project like [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] supporters including its founder [[Murray Bookchin]], and Green activists and academics like [[Steven Best]] have taken part.

The starting point for Fotopoulos' work is that the world faces a multi-dimensional crisis (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political) which is caused by the concentration of power in elites, as a result of the market economy, representative democracy and related forms of hierarchical structure. An inclusive democracy, which involves the equal distribution of power at all levels, is seen not as a utopia (in the negative sense of the word) or a "vision" but as perhaps the only way out of the present crisis, with trends towards its creation manifesting themselves today in many parts of the world. Fotopoulos is in favor of [[market abolitionism]], although he would not identify himself as a market abolitionist as such because he considers market abolition as one aspect of an inclusive democracy which refers only to the [[economic democracy]] component of it. He proposes a model of economic democracy for a stateless, marketless and moneyless economy but he considers that the economic democracy component is equally significant to the other components of ID, i.e. political or [[direct democracy]], economic democracy, ecological democracy and democracy in the social realm. Fotopoulos' work has been critically assessed by important activists, theorists and scholars.&lt;ref name="book review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Camil, review of Hacia Una Democracia Inclusiva (in Spanish), La Jornada, Friday, 8 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 34 (1), Winter 2002, p. 97-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Levin, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, [[Anarchist Studies]], Vol. 5,  No. 2, October 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Griffin, Dodgy Logic and the Olympians, Total Liberty, 1999-2000, p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Herod, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, [http://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf Getting Free: Creating an Association of Democratic Autonomous Neighborhoods], [[Lucy Parsons Center]] (first printing edition), May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bharathidasan_(cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|Tamil poet [[Bharathidasan]]'s image from a book cover]]
'''Thani Tamil Iyakkam''' ({{lang-ta|தனித் தமிழ் இயக்கம்}}) ('''Pure''' or '''Independent Tamil Movement''') is a [[Linguistic purism|linguistic-purity]] movement in [[Tamil literature]] which attempts to avoid [[loanword]]s from [[Sanskrit]]. The movement began in the writings of [[Maraimalai Adigal]], [[Paventhar Bharathidasan]], [[Devaneya Pavanar]], and [[Perunchithiranar (Tamil nationalist)|Pavalareru Perunchitthiranaar]], and was propagated in the ''Thenmozhi'' literary magazine founded by Pavalareru Perunchithiranar. [[Parithimar Kalaignar|V G Suryanarayana Sastri]] (popularly known as Parithimar Kalaignar), a [[Professor]], was a 20th-century figure in the movement; in 1902 he demanded classical-language status for [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which it received in 2004.

== Movement==
[[File:Parithimaar kalaignar.jpg|thumb|150px|''Thani Tamiļ Iyakkam's'' [[Parithimar Kalaignar]]. He (translated) changed his name from the Sanskrit 'Suryanarayana Sastri' to Tamil 'Parithimaar kalaignar'. ]]
[[File:Perunchithiranar-poet-TamilNadu (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Perunchithiranar (Tamil nationalist)|Perunchithiranar]], Father of Tamilnation]]
The modern revival of the Tamil Purist Movement (also known as the Pure Tamil Movement) is attributed to Maraimalai Adigal, who publicly pledged to defend pure Tamil in 1916. Advocates of purism popularised Tamil literature and crusaded for it, organising rallies in villages and towns and making Tamil purism a political issue. The logical extension of this effort was to purge Tamil of the Sanskrit influence (including its negative social perceptions, which were thought to keep the Tamils in a state of economic, cultural, and political servitude) seen as making Tamil susceptible to northern political domination. Anti-Sanskrit and anti-Hindi Tamil Nadu policies alienated the Brahmins, who were seen as supporting both languages.

Tamil was favoured by [[language policy]] after [[Independence Day (India)|Indian independence]] and had been used in high schools since 1938 (and in universities from 1960). In 1956, the [[Indian National Congress]] government passed a law making Tamil the official language of [[Tamil Nadu]], and in 1959 set up the Tamil Development and Research Council to produce Tamil textbooks in the natural and human sciences, accounting, mathematics, and other subjects. A series of children's encyclopaedias, commentaries on [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] poetry, and a history of the Tamil people were published in 1962-63. However, these measures seemed insufficient to the proponents of "Pure Tamil", as expressed by [[Mohan Kumaramangalam]] in 1965 at the peak of the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi agitation]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In practice, the ordinary man finds that the Tamil language is nowhere in the picture ... In Madras city like any other metro, English dominates our life to an extraordinary extent ... I think it will be no exaggeration to say that a person who earns very high can live for years in Madras without learning a word of Tamil, except for some servant inconvenience!{{cite quote|date=December 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the Congress government had turned down a number of demands, such as the use of "pure" rather than "[[Sanskritisation|Sanskritised]] Tamil" in schoolbooks and resisting the name change from Madras to [[Tamil Nadu]] until 1969, it seemed unconcerned about [[Tamil nationalism|separatism]]. This bred resentment among Tamil purists, as expressed by [[Devaneya Pavanar]] in 1967: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;None of the Congress Ministers of Tamil Nadu was either a Tamil scholar or a Tamil lover. The Congress leaders of Tamil Nadu as betrayers of Tamil, cannot represent the State any more. Blind cannot lead the blind, much less the keen sighted. Moreover every political meeting, they will say "Jai Hind!". This Means, they are meant to rule only in broader (not specific) India.{{cite quote|date=December 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the elections that year, Congress was replaced by the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) government under [[C N Annadurai]].

The Tamil purism movement successfully lobbied for Tamil to be declared a "classical language" (&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;uya'''rth'''ani'''ch'''e'''m'''ai) of India in 2006, a status also accorded to Sanskrit in the Indian constitution. This gave rise to the Centre for the Study of Tamil as a Classical Language in Chennai, but it took another year to obtain official Tamil translations in Tamil Nadu courts.

'''''The Lazy Man’s Guide To Enlightenment''''' is a 1971 philosophical essay by American author [[Thaddeus Golas]]. Originally started as a letter for friends, the book itself began as a [[mimeograph]]ed pamphlet which Golas handed out on the streets of [[San Francisco]] in 1971. It was first published as a book in 1971 by Joe E. Casey, but was then taken over by the [[Palo Alto, California]] based Seed Center in 1972. The book was an underground bestseller, and in 1979, was published by [[Bantam Books]]. In 1995, [[Gibbs Smith]], Publisher, of Utah, issued a hardcover edition, which included photographs and an introduction by Golas. In 2010, Seed Center Books issued an audio recording of the text read by the author, and an international edition of the book returning it to its original look and format, with three new chapters and revisions, penned by the author late in life.&lt;ref&gt;The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment, A Young Person's Guide Edition, Revised and Updated&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Thaddeus Golas]], inspired by the popularity of subatomic physics and his passion for Eastern Mysticism, began formulating his personal metaphysical paradigm in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;The Lazy Man's Life, autobiography of [[Thaddeus Golas]]&lt;/ref&gt; While living in San Francisco in 1969, he decided to publish his first short-run pamphlet "Pleasure and Pain", that would put him in touch with others who shared his interest in [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Seed Center Books, publisher of the book&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate result was that Golas was invited by an enthusiastic [[Stephen Gaskin]] to join his famous "Monday Night Class" meetings. [[Thaddeus Golas]] had gathered his ideas in the form of dense manuscripts, over a twenty-year period, but by 1970, he resolved to use his background as a copy editor for women's magazines to pitch his language on a level that casual readers could easily understand. The writing of his final manuscript of The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment was swift, and took place over a few chaotic and sleepless weeks during which he experienced great pain in his right arm. He would write tirelessly in bursts of prose which included the first sentence of the published text, "I am a lazy man". Golas later indicated that he never considered another title for this book, besides The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;The Lazy Man's Life, autobiography of [[Thaddeus Golas]]&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly distributed photocopies of his text hoping to receive feedback, and offering for others to "do with it what they will," but his decision to self-publish resulted from the advice and encouragements of such authors as [[Alan Watts]] and [[Ram Dass]].&lt;ref&gt;The Lazy Man's Life, autobiography of [[Thaddeus Golas]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was originally intended as a "trip-guide" for [[LSD]] enthusiasts; it could be used to guide them psychologically and steer them away from "bummers". Thaddeus Golas later said he was stunned to see that "a general audience got off on it."
While waiting for delivery of the first edition, Thaddeus Golas created a list of two hundred bookstores, including stores he had visited as a  book salesman for [[Harper and Row]] in the early 1960s; he wrote every store manager, informing them that the book would be available from the distributor [[Bookpeople (distributor)|Bookpeople]]. He also visited bookstores in San Francisco, leaving them with consignment copies. These copies would eventually sell-out in a matter of days. The second printing, at 10,000 copies, sold out in two months. The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment became a rare publishing sensation in the Bay Area.

In philosophy, a '''theory of everything''' or '''ToE''' is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation or description of [[nature]] or [[reality]].&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a&gt;Rescher, Nicholas (2006a).

[http://www.jetpress.org/volume10/prolegomena.html "Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy"].  ''Journal of Evolution and Technology'' Vol. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a [[theory of everything]] is ongoing, philosophers have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications.&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rescher2006b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2002/&gt;  Among the questions to be addressed by a philosophical theory of everything are: "Why is reality understandable?" "Why are the laws of nature as they are?"  "Why is there anything at all?"&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt;

== Comprehensive philosophical systems==

The [[Metaphysics#Styles and methods of metaphysics|"system building"]] style of [[metaphysics]] attempts to answer ''all'' the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] could  be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building ''scope'' of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist ''method'' of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reason. Examples from the early modern period include [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[monadology]], [[Descartes]]'s [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], and [[Spinoza]]'s [[monism]]. [[Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s [[process philosophy]] were later systems. At present, work is underway on the structural-systematic philosophy (SSP), to which the following books are devoted: Lorenz B. Puntel, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K80u90ZKKecC&amp;dq= Structure and Being]'' (2008; translation of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SN0bg1EdmUC&amp;dq= Struktur und Sein]'', 2006) and ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut32xhgQAgYC&amp;dq= Being and God]'' (2011; translation of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8x00AQAAIAAJ&amp;q= Sein und Gott]'', 2010) and Alan White, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wpDFAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Toward a Philosophical Theory of Everything]'' (2014). The SSP makes no claims to finality; it aims to be the best systematic philosophy currently available.

Other philosophers do not believe philosophy should aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a ToE, for instance [[Stephen Hawking]] wrote in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' that even if we had a ToE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, "What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?"&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Mariano Artigas, ''The Mind of the Universe'', Templeton Foundation Press, 2001, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicholas Rescher==

=== Properties and impasse of self-substantiation ===
In "The Price of an Ultimate Theory",&lt;ref name=Rescher2006b/&gt; originally published in 2000, [[Nicholas Rescher]] specifies what he sees as the principal properties of a Theory of Everything and describes an apparent impasse on the road to such a theory.

=== Properties ===

==== Principle of sufficient reason ====

First, he takes as a presupposition the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which in his formulation states that every fact ''t'' has an explanation ''t''':
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t \, \exists t' \, (t'\ E\ t)&lt;/math&gt;

where E predicates explanation, so that ''t&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' E ''t'' denotes "''t''' explains ''t''".

==== Comprehensiveness ====

Next, he asserts that the most direct and natural construction of a Theory of Everything ''T*'' would confer upon it two crucial features: comprehensiveness and finality.  Comprehensiveness says that wherever there is a fact ''t'', ''T*'' affords its explanation:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t \, (T^*\ E\ t)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Finality ====

Finality says that as an "ultimate theory", ''T*'' has no deeper explanation:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t \, ((t\ E\ T^*) \to (t = T^*))&lt;/math&gt;
so that the only conceivable explanation of ''T*'' is ''T*'' itself.

==== Noncircularity ====

Rescher notes that it is obviously problematic to deploy a theory for its own explanation; at the heart of the traditional conception of explanatory adequacy, he says, is a principle of noncircularity stating that no fact can explain itself:
:&lt;math&gt;\nexists t \, (t\ E\ t)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Impasse ====

The impasse is then that the two critical aspects of a Theory of Everything, comprehensiveness and finality, conflict with the fundamental principle of noncircularity.  A comprehensive theory which explains everything must explain itself, and a final theory which has no deeper explanation must, by the principle of sufficient reason, have ''some'' explanation; consequently it too must be self-explanatory.  Rescher concludes that any Theorist of Everything committed to comprehensiveness and finality is bound to regard noncircularity as "something that has to be jettisoned".  But how, he asks, can a theory adequately substantiate itself?

=== Ways forward ===

Rescher's proposal in "The Price of an Ultimate Theory" is to dualize the concept of explanation so that a fact can be explained either ''derivationally'', by the premises which lead to it, or ''systemically'', by the consequences which follow from it.  With derivational explanation, a fact ''t'' is explained when it is subsumed by some prior, more fundamental fact ''t'''.  With systemic explanation, ''t'' is explained when it is a "best fit" for its consequences, where fitness is measured by uniformity, simplicity, connectedness, and other criteria conducive to systemic integration.  Rescher concludes that while a theory of everything cannot be explained derivationally (since no deeper explanation can subsume it), it can be explained systemically by its capacity to integrate its consequences.

In his 1996 book ''The Conscious Mind'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory|author=Chalmers, David J.|year=1996|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Chalmers]] argues that a theory of everything must explain [[consciousness]], that consciousness does not logically [[supervene]] on the physical, and that therefore a fundamental theory in physics would not be a theory of everything.  A truly final theory, he argues, needs not just physical properties and laws, but [[phenomenal]] or protophenomenal properties and [[Psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] laws explaining the relationship between physical processes and conscious experience.  He concludes that "[o]nce we have a fundamental theory of consciousness to accompany a fundamental theory in physics, we may truly have a theory of everything."  Developing such a theory will not be straightforward, he says, but "it ought to be possible in principle."

In "Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy",&lt;ref name=Walker2002/&gt; a 2002 essay in the ''[[Journal of Evolution and Technology]]'', [[Mark Alan Walker]] discusses modern responses to the question of how to reconcile "the apparent finitude of humans" with what he calls "the traditional telos of philosophy&amp;mdash;the attempt to unite thought and Being, to arrive at absolute knowledge, at a final theory of everything."  He contrasts two ways of closing this "gap between the ambitions of philosophy, and the abilities of human philosophers": a "deflationary" approach in which philosophy is "scaled down into something more human" and the attempt to achieve a theory of everything is abandoned, and an "inflationary", [[transhumanist]] approach in which philosophers are "scaled up" by advanced technology into "super-intelligent beings" better able to pursue such a theory.

=== Criticism ===

In "Holistic Explanation and the Idea of a Grand Unified Theory",&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt; originally presented as a lecture in 1998, Rescher identifies two negative reactions to the idea of a unified, overarching theory: reductionism and rejectionism.  Reductionism holds that large-scale philosophical issues can be meaningfully addressed only when divided into lesser components, while rejectionism holds that questions about such issues are illegitimate and unanswerable.  Against reductionism, Rescher argues that explaining individual parts does not explain the coordinating structure of the whole, so that a collectivized approach is required.  Against rejectionism, he argues that the question of the "reason" – the "why" – behind existence is pressing, important, and not obviously meaningless.

[[File:Adam Bernaert - "Vanitas" Still Life - Walters 37682.jpg|thumb|300px|This painting represents the Dutch "[[Vanitas]]" (Latin for vanity) by [[Adam Bernaert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Walters Art Museum |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/369  |title= Vanitas" Still Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Walters Art Museum]].]]
'''Vanity''' is the excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others. Prior to the 14th century it did not have such [[narcissism|narcissistic]] undertones, and merely meant ''futility''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English dictionary]]'', on ''vanity''&lt;/ref&gt; The related term '''vainglory'''&lt;!-- which redirects here --&gt; is now often seen as an archaic synonym for ''vanity'', but originally meant ''boasting in vain'', i.e. unjustified [[boasting]];&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English dictionary'', on ''vainglory''&lt;/ref&gt; although ''glory'' is now seen as having a predominantly positive meaning,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} the [[Latin]] term from which it derives, ''gloria'', roughly means ''boasting'', and was often used as a negative criticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English dictionary'', on ''glory''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion and philosophy==

[[File:Thomas Couture - Daydreams - Walters 3744.jpg|thumb|In this painting ''Daydreams'' by [[Thomas Couture]], the vice of vanity is shown through a boy blowing bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Walters Art Museum |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/12349
 |title= Daydreams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]

In many religions, vanity, in its modern sense, is considered a form of self-[[idolatry]] in which one likens oneself to the greatness of God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby becomes separated and perhaps in time divorced from the Divine grace of [[God]]. In Christian teachings, ''vanity'' is an example of [[pride]], one of the [[seven deadly sins]].  Also, in the [[Bahai Faith]], [[Baha'u'llah]] uses the term 'vain imaginings'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FVain+Imaginings|website=Bahai Quotes.com|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Philosophically, vanity may be a broader form of [[egotism]] and [[pride]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote that "vanity is the fear of appearing original: it is thus a lack of pride, but not necessarily a lack of originality."&lt;ref name=bartleby&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/66/51/41651.html Bartleby.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301050157/http://www.bartleby.com/66/51/41651.html |date=2006-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of [[Mason Cooley]]'s [[aphorism]]s is "Vanity well fed is benevolent. Vanity hungry is spiteful."&lt;ref name=bartleby/&gt;

==Symbolism==
In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a [[peacock]], and in [[Bible|Biblical]] terms, by the [[Whore of Babylon]]. During the [[Renaissance]], vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a [[demon]] or a [[putto]]. Symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and the figure of death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Some depictions of vanity include scrolls that read ''Omnia Vanitas'' ("All is Vanity"), a quotation from the Latin translation of the Book of [[Ecclesiastes]].&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term [[vanitas]] (Latin, "emptiness") originally meant not obsession by one's appearance, but the ultimate fruitlessness of humankind's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.

"The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her," writes [[Edwin Mullins]], "while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her."&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Mullins, ''The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women'' (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, Inc., 1985), pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining [[Venus (god)|Venus]].

In his table of the [[Seven deadly sins]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]] depicts a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil; behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to [[Nicolas Tournier]], which hangs in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], is ''An Allegory of Justice and Vanity'': a young woman holds a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]], symbolizing [[justice]]; she does not look at the mirror or the [[human skull|skull]] on the table before her. [[Johannes Vermeer]]'s painting ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, because the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.

''All is Vanity'', by [[Charles Allan Gilbert]] (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An [[optical illusion]], the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror. In the film ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'', [[Satan]] ([[Al Pacino]]) claims that "vanity is his favourite sin".

Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.

'''''What Engineers Know and How they Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History''''' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) ({{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}) is a historical reflection on [[engineering]] practice in US [[aeronautics]] from 1908 to 1953 written by an accomplished practitioner and instructor. This period represents the dawn of aviation which was fraught with uncertainties and numerous paths to many [[possible worlds]].  The book captures two main conclusions from this period.  The first order conclusion of this book is about "what engineers know." Five case studies from the history of aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its ''own'' scientific discoveries. Thus, engineering should be understood as a knowledge-generating activity that includes [[applied science]] but is not limited to applied science. The second order conclusion of this book pertains to "how engineers know" by using the same case studies to reveal patterns in the nature of all engineering. These patterns form an “[[epistemology]]” of engineering that may point the way to an “engineering method” as something distinct from [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="vincenti"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincenti|first= Walter G.|title=What Engineers Know and How They Know It : Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History, Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology [New.

The book is filled with numerous additional observations and stories told by a practitioner and instructor. This may be why [[Michael A. Jackson|Dr. Michael A.

== Author ==

Walter G. Vincenti (commonly pronounced "''vin-sen-tee''" in the US or "''vin-chen-tee''" in Italian) (1917–present) is a Professor Emeritus of Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=sts, accessed 24 Jan 2011, 2043.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987 he was inducted into the [[National Academy of Engineering]], “for pioneering contributions to supersonic aircraft aerodynamics and to fundamental understanding of the physical [[gas dynamics]] of [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] flow.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.members.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/5B3300986C7CFF4C8625755200622ED3?opendocument, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2230.&lt;/ref&gt;  His important textbook from the first part of his career is, ''Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics'' (1ed ed 1965, 2nd ed 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G., and Charles H. Kruger. Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics. Huntington, N.Y.: Krieger, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vincenti in effect had two whole careers: one as a cutting-edge aeronautical engineer and another as a leading historian of technology.  This gave him a dual vantage point to think about how technological innovation works.  Further, he broadened the relevance of engineering to society by co-founding a Stanford discipline called Values, Technology and Society in 1971—now called Science, Technology and Society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. Post interview 1997, http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/3/1997_3_20.shtml, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2240.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 90 he published his most recent work with [[William M. Newman]], "On an Engineering Use of Engineering History" which appears in ''[[Technology and Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Vincenti and William Newman.  "On an Engineering Use of Engineering History," Technology and Culture.  Volume 48, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 245–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

''What Engineers Know'' was first published in 1990 when Mr. Vincenti was 73 years old after full careers in [[aerospace engineering]], the history of technology, and instructing.  The five case studies used for evidence in this book come from the first half of the 20th century, 1908-1953.  During this period the author worked at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) from 1940 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/3/1997_3_20.shtml, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2245.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the five case studies used as evidence in this book were first published independently in ''[[Technology and Culture]]'' between 1979 and 1986.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|10}}  During this era, other authors were beginning to refute the view of engineering as only applied science.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, Wiebe E., Thomas Parke Hughes, and T. J. Pinch. The Social Construction of Technological Systems : New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then in 1990, Vincenti's five case studies indirectly supported this newer discourse about engineering as a knowledge-generating discipline.

== Scope==

The profession of "engineering" encompasses a wide scope of practice.  Thus, the author narrows the scope of his five case studies in three ways.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|6–9}} First, viewed end-to-end, the engineering process contains three phases including [[design]], construction/production and operation.  These cases come largely from the design phase of engineering.  One exception is the fifth case study on flush-riveted joints which involved an intimate interplay between design and production.  Second, design can be categorized as normal or radical.  These case studies pertain to normal design.  Third,  normal design itself is multi-leveled.  These levels proceed from project definition down to overall design, major component design, subdivision of component design, and highly specific problems (like planform, airfoil and high-lift devices).  These five case studies come mostly from these lower levels.  Thus when combined, the scope of these case studies is design, normal design and highly specific problems at the lowest level, "to help redress the neglect of this large and essential area."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

== Case Study Summary (What Engineers Know)==

The five case studies are organized by chapter.  Chapter 2 regards '''[[airfoil]] design''' generally.  The early work of Davis illustrates how useful engineering has been done by people who have no formal training in engineering.  The [[Davis wing]] was instrumental even though Davis did not have the theoretical basis to know how or why.  Chapter 3 is about how engineers design in accord with '''flying qualities''' satisfactory to pilots.  This case study illustrates there can be a key relationship between human behavior and engineering requirements that can greatly affect the outcomes.  As such, "artifactual design is a social activity."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|11, 237}}  Chapter 4 instructs the importance of '''[[control volume|control-volume]] analysis''' situations in mechanical design.  Control volume analysis was missing in physics textbooks at the time.  Thus, engineers had a scientific requirement that was not addressed adequately by any [[natural science]].  Importantly, such case studies are examples of why there is such a thing as "engineering science".  Chapter 5 regards the dynamic problem of''' [[propeller]] design and selection'''.  The propeller case study illustrates how engineers develop methods to account for the absence of required scientific theory.  In this case "[[variation of parameter|parameter variation]]" was used to map-out and survey a subject where no comprehensive scientific theory (in physics) existed.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|160–161}}  Finally, chapter 6 describes the problem of designing '''flush-riveted joints''' for aircraft.  This case study conveys how requirements of production can have a reverse influence on design thus driving iterations between production and design.  This case study also illustrates how there are aspects of engineering that cannot adequately be described as science such as the "feel" rivet mechanics developed for how much pressure to apply when completing the aircraft's aluminum stressed-skin structure (see "tacit knowledge" discussion below).

==An Epistemology of Engineering (How Engineers Know)==

Throughout the book, Walter Vincenti makes [[epistemology]] observations pertaining to engineering.  The following are six of several observations made throughout the book.&lt;ref&gt;Note: there are many other epistemological observations made throughout the book including a high density of them in Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations do not constitute an "engineering method" per se but offer a [[conjecture]] that they may point the way for further research.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|160–161}}  He wrote, "in the final paragraph of chapter 5, I also raised the question of whether it might be profitable to look for "engineering method" analogous to but distinguishable from scientific method that has been a fruitful concern for the history of science.  Could it be that the variation-selection process outlined here is that method, with its distinctive features lying in the criterion of selection and the vicarious methods used to shortcut direct trial?"&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

=== Seven Interactive Elements of Engineering Learning ===
First, there is a pattern to the iterative engineering discovery process seen in the development of flying-quality specifications.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|102}}  This process is referred to as "Seven Interactive Elements of Engineering Learning" and includes:

# '''Familiarization with''' vehicle and recognition of '''problem'''.
# '''Identification of''' basic variables and derivation of analytical concepts and '''criteria'''.
# '''Development of''' instruments/piloting techniques for in-flight '''measurements'''.
# '''Growth''' and refinement '''of''' pilot '''opinion''' regarding desirable flying qualities.
# Combine results from 2-4 into a deliberate '''scheme for''' flying-quality '''research'''.
# '''Measurement of''' relevant flight '''characteristics''' for a cross section of aircraft.
# '''Assessment of results''' and data on flight characteristics in light of pilot opinion to arrive at general specifications.

The boldface from the original text isolates the steps in a subject-neutral manner.

=== Six Categories of Engineering Knowledge ===
Second, there is a pattern in the very categories of knowledge in engineering.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|208}}
These six categories of engineering knowledge are:
# Fundamental design concepts
# Criteria and specifications 
# Theoretical tools
# Quantitative data
# Practical considerations
# Design instrumentalities

=== Seven Knowledge-Generating Activities===
Third, Walter Vincenti sees a pattern in knowledge/science generating activities of engineering.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|229}}
These seven Knowledge-Generating Activities include:
# Transfer from science
# Invention
# Theoretical engineering research
# Experimental engineering research
# Design practice
# Production
# Direct Trial

=== Relationship Between Categories and Activities ===
Fourth, by placing six categories of knowledge and the seven knowledge-generating activities on an x-y table, these knowledge generating activities cut across the categories of knowledge in a partially predictable way.  The resulting table serves as an approximation for what engineering tasks may be likely to produce new engineering knowledge.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|235, Table 7-1}}  The resulting diagram "is intended for discussion more than a set of hard and fast divisions."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|225}}

=== Engineering Knowledge Classification ===
Fifth, he re-classifies engineering knowledge itself.  Knowledge generated by engineering may normally be categorized by phases such as design, production or operations.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|195}}  Another way to think about engineering knowledge categories is [[descriptive knowledge]], prescriptive knowledge and [[tacit knowledge]].&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|198}}  He adds Gilbert Ryle's terms "knowing that" and "knowing how"&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|13}} to illustrate the aim of each knowledge category.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|198}}  "Knowing what or that" to do in engineering is a mixture of descriptive and prescriptive knowledge.  "Knowing how" to do it is a mixture of prescriptive and tacit knowledge.  Thus, these case studies show the need for all three kinds of knowledge in engineering.

=== Variation-Selection Model of Technological Innovation ===
Finally, he posits a variation-selection model for knowledge growth.  At all levels of design hierarchy, growth of knowledge acts to increase the complexity and power of the variation-selection process by modifying both the mechanism for variation and expanding the processes of selection vicariously.  Variation and selection each add two realistic principles for the advancement of technology: ''blindness'' to variation and ''unsureness'' of selection.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|249}}

Vincenti concludes that our blindness to the vast potential in variations of design does not imply a random or unpremeditated search.  A blind person in an unfamiliar alleyway uses a cane to provide information to explore the constraints in an intentional way without having any idea where the alleyway leads.  Likewise, engineers proceed in design “blindly” in the sense that “the outcome is not completely foreseeable” thus the “best” potential variations are in some degree invisible.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|243}}  As a result, finding high functioning designs is not the norm.  He notes, “from the outside or in retrospect, the entire process tends to seem more ordered and intentional—less blind—than it usually is.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

However, Vincenti uses the differences between the Wright brothers and the French to show there is a range in how we manage blindness to variations.  The Wright brothers designed a flying machine before the French even though they started experimenting at roughly the same time.  The French 1) appealed to what little was known about the Wrights/Langley, 2) mental imaginings of what might succeed, and 3) guidance from growing flight experience.  But “since [#1 and #3] were meager, however, the level of blindness, at least at first, was well nigh total.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|244}}

What was the difference in the process between the Wrights and the French?

The French trial and error process had less theoretical analysis (or new engineering knowledge).  Since, “the French were not inclined toward theoretical analysis, variations could be selected for retention and refinement only by trails in flight.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|244 [emphasis added]}}  For the Wrights, advancement of basic principles in theory via analysis lent to precise shortcuts to direct trials making the French process appear more exploratory in retrospect.  Thus, the process of selection is aided by 1) theoretical analysis and 2) experiments (in, say, wind tunnels) in place of direct trial of actual (“overt”) versions in the environment.   The growth in knowledge increases the power of vicarious trials in place of actual/direct trials.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|247}}

====Uncertainty In the Variation-Selection Process (blindness in variation and unsureness in selection)====

In the long term, “the entire variation-selection process—variation and selection together—is filled with uncertainty.”  The level of uncertainty is affected by two things.  First, “uncertainty comes from the degree of blindness in the variations.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|248}}  Uncertainty in the whole process decreases as technology matures—he notes that aircraft designers of today operate with more “sure-footedness” than the French of the early 1900s or even his era working at NACA.   Yet, there is a paradox in decreasing blindness.  While blindness decreases over time, advances simultaneously become more difficult to come by and more sophisticated… which in turn increases blindness!  Thus the temptation to see a net decrease in blindesss “stems from an illusion.”  The variation-selection process can create as much blindness as it reduces; just ask “talented engineers who struggle to advance a mature technology like present-day aeronautics…”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|249}}

The second factor on uncertainty in the whole variation-selection model is “unsureness” in the process of selection.  Both vicarious and overt trials suffer from unsureness which adds complication to the variation selection model.  But unlike blindness in variation, unsureness in selection decreases with the precision in both kinds of trials.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|249}}

Blindness and unsureness characterize the difficult or arduous nature of technology evolution in the variation-selection model.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|248–249}}  The author then reviews the five case studies retrospectively to demonstrate how variation-selection and blindness-unsureness were at work in each case.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|250–252}}  In total, "the cumulative growth of engineering knowledge as the result of individual variation-selection processes acts to change the nature of how those processes are carried out."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|245}}

'''''Xing Zi Ming Chu''''' ({{zh|c=性自命出|p=xìng zì mìng chū}}), translated as '''''Human Nature Is Brought Forth by Decree'''''{{sfn|Meyer|2012|p=131}} or '''''The Inborn-Nature Comes from the Mandate''''',{{sfn|Shaughnessy|2006|p=12}} is a [[Warring States period]] (ca. 5th century – 221 BCE) text from the [[Chu (state)|Kingdom of Chu]], excavated in 1993 from the [[Guodian Chu Slips|Guodian tomb]], near [[Jingmen]] in [[Hubei]], [[China]]. It is one of the earliest Chinese texts to discuss human nature, although it was lost until its re-discovery.

==Background==
''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' is part of the [[Guodian Chu Slips]], a corpus of manuscripts written on [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo slips]] from the Guodian tomb excavated in 1993,{{sfn|Liu|2008|p=61}} which can be dated to approximately 300 BCE, when the tomb was sealed.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|p=5}} This manuscript is one of the longer ones from Guodian, containing about 1,550 characters, written on sixty-seven slips which are {{convert|32.5|cm}} long. Nine of the slips have been damaged, leading to a loss of 29 characters.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|pp=131, 135}}

The author of ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' is contested. According to some scholars it was written by [[Zi Si]] (483–402 BCE), a grandson of [[Confucius]], based on the similarities in thought between this text and others which he or his disciples are traditionally held to have written, such as ''Zi Yi'' ({{zh|c=緇衣|p=zī yī}}).{{sfn|Ding|2000|pp=28, 33, 35}} However, while acknowledging the likelihood that ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' and the other Guodian texts circulated during Zi Si's lifetime, other scholars do not find this evidence persuasive, leaving the question of authorship open.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|pp=131–133}}{{sfn|Shaughnessy|2006|pp=11–13}}

This bamboo manuscript has a counterpart silk manuscript, named ''Xing Qing Lun'', ({{zh|c=性情論|p=xìng qíng lùn}}) or ''Discourse on Human Nature and Unshaped Feelings'',{{sfn|Meyer|2012|p=135}} one of the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|Mawangdui silk texts]]. Their relationship is a matter of debate. The first halves of each are very similar, and they also feature similar punctuation. Despite that, their second halves diverge, and certain characters do not exactly match. These differences have been interpreted to mean that ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' is either a version of ''Xing Qing Lun'',{{sfn|Shaughnessy|2006|p=12}} or that they share a common textual lineage, but are unlikely to have been copied from one another.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|p=169}}

==Summary==
''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' discusses human nature in the context of [[Tao|the Way]] and an ethics which would be later viewed as "Confucian," relating it to [[Yi (Confucianism)|rightness]], [[Ren (Confucianism)|benevolence]], [[Xin (concept)|the mind]], and [[Qing (concept)|unshaped feelings]].{{refn|group=nb|The term "Confucianism" is problematic because it generalizes intellectual developments centred on core canonical texts throughout Chinese history. The Warring States period preceded the formation of a canon during the [[Han dynasty]] and its attribution to Confucius. Moreover, Warring States texts are composite in nature, with thinkers from different "schools" using the same ethical terms. It is therefore inaccurate to consider Warring States texts "Confucian."{{sfn|Nylan|2001|pp=3, 5}}{{sfn|Rosemont|2015}}}}  It first discusses the origin of human nature in [[Tian|Heaven]] and humanity. It continues by discussing what causes human nature to manifest, and how it does so. Next, it discusses the education of human nature through "odes," "documents," "rites," and "music," which themselves are said to be refined forms of natural human behaviour. Finally, the text becomes instructive, giving advice for particular situations.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|pp=154–169}}

==Analysis==
''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' strongly states that human nature derives from Heaven. This means that human nature is not a blank slate, and merely one of the many things that are born from Heaven's "decree."{{sfn|Li|Huang|2010|pp=38–39}} In its analysis, unshaped feelings derive from human nature; in turn the Way derives from unshaped feelings. The Way in ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' transcends the phenomenological world, but is yet an innate part of human nature. Therefore humanity is predisposed to cultivation of human nature so as to transform its initial state.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|p=146}} To begin with, human nature is characterized as responding to phenomena in the world emotionally. These responses become "proper" through ritual, ''i.e.'' the "odes," "documents," "rites," and "music," which had been categorized and organized by "sages."{{sfn|Puett|2010|pp=57–59}} However, there is no evidence in ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' that these references to tradition refer to specific texts, which is often assumed in the context of early Chinese thought. Rather, the text refers to them as traditions to be performed.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|p=170}}{{refn|group=nb|In ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' these four kinds of tradition are written as "詩 (shī)、書 (shū)、禮 (lǐ)、樂 (yuè)," which literally translates as "odes," "documents," "rites," and "music." Due to the ambiguity of [[classical Chinese]] and the conventions of classical Chinese scholarship, references to these traditions are often understood as referring to one of the [[Chinese classics]]: "odes" as ''[[Classic of Poetry|The Classic of Odes]]'', "documents" as ''[[The Book of Documents]]'', "rites" as ''[[The Book of Rites]]'' and "music" the lost ''[[Classic of Music]]'' (whose existence as a written text is controversial). However, recent scholarship disputes the existence of written canons during the Warring States period, pointing to evidence in texts and manuscripts of oral transmission. This means one should not automatically infer from references in texts such as ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' to these traditions that a text is referring specifically to one of the Chinese classics.{{sfn|Kern|2005|pp=180–181}}}} Thus humanity is drawn into a web of relations between Heaven, human nature, and moral cultivation, which reflects contemporary philosophical concerns with "working within and transforming a discontinuous world."{{sfn|Puett|2010|p=63}}

Scholars note that the concept of human nature set out in ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' bears similarities with other Warring States texts. As mentioned, it draws on a similar philosophical vocabulary to texts later classed as "Confucian," some of which also discuss human nature, such as ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]''). In particular, its discussion of the relationship between unshaped feelings, ritual, and music has been compared to a similar discussion in a chapter of the ''[[Book of Rites]]''.{{sfn|Ding|2000|p=30}} However, ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' and similar texts from the Guodian tomb had disappeared from transmission at some point between the late Warring States period and the Western Han period for unclear reasons.{{sfn|Meyer|2012|pp=251–254}} As such, the relationship of ''Xing Zi Ming Chu'' to other Warring States texts remains speculative.

'''"Seongho" Yi Ik''' (1681–1763) was a [[Korea]]n [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar, early [[Silhak]] philosopher and social critic.  He was born to a [[yangban]] family of the [[Yeoju]] [[Yi (Korean name)|Yi]] clan. His one disciple of [[Yi Seo-woo]], was Misu [[Heo Mok]] and Baikho [[Yun-hyu]]'s school disciples. second cousin of [[Yu Hyeong-won]]. Like most in his position, he studied for the ''[[gwageo]]'' in order to gain a position of rank; but failed in his first attempt in 1705.  Shortly thereafter, his elder brother [[Yi Jam]] was beaten to death as part of the [[Sukjong of Joseon#Hui-bin Jang Ok-jeong (1659–1701)|Lady Jang incident]], and Yi lost interest in government service.

Yi Ik followed in [[Yu Hyeong-won]] line of thought extending in this work [[Seongho Saseol]], which covers subjects as government, economy, and the family, and makes detailed proposals for reordering each aspect of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] society.  His most famous work was ''Record of Concern for the Underprivileged'' which lays down the cardinal principles of reform ideas.  As Yi attracted many disciples, [[Silhak]] gradually emerged as [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty's dominant school of thought.

He was born in [[Ansan]] in 1681. In 1967 a monument to him, "Tomb of Yi Ik" was erect there, next to a museum celebrating his life and works.

[[File:Mohamedeagle.jpg|thumb|Zoomorphic text]]
The word ''zoomorphism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ζωον (''zōon''), meaning "[[animal]]", and μορφη (''morphē''), meaning "shape" or "form". It can mean:
* Art that [[anthropomorphism|imagines humans as non-human animals]]&lt;ref&gt;Hope B. Werness, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in Art'',
Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004, px. {{ISBN|0-8264-1525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art that portrays one species of animal like another species of animal
* Art that creates patterns using animal imagery, or [[animal style]]
* Deities depicted in animal form, such as exist in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]&lt;ref&gt;Simson R Najovits, ''Egypt, Trunk of the Tree: A Modern Survey of
an Ancient Land'', Algora Publishing, 2004, p 279. {{ISBN|0-87586-201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Therianthropy]]: the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into animal form&lt;ref&gt;Gerina Dunwich, ''Wicca A to Z: A Modern Witch's Encyclopedia'', Kensington Pub Corp, 1998, p 155. {{ISBN|0-8065-1930-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attributing animal form or other animal characteristics to anything other than an animal; similar to but broader than [[anthropomorphism]]
* The tendency of viewing human behaviour in terms of the behaviour of animals, contrary to [[anthropomorphism]], which views animal or non-animal behaviour in human terms

==Examples==

===Zoomorphic representation in religion===
*The appearance of the [[Holy Spirit]] like a [[dove]] in the [[New Testament]] (The Gospel According to Luke 3: 22), "and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove..."  
*[[Mark the Evangelist]] as a [[lion]] in later Christian [[iconography]]. 
* The [[netjer|Egyptian gods]] were often depicted as zoomorphic or as [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]]
* The names of the two most prominent Hebrew Bible female prophets - Deborah and Huldah - were in the Babylonian Talmud interpreted in zoomorphic terms as "wasp" and "weasel."&lt;ref&gt;Blaženka Scheuer;  Animal Names for Hebrew Bible Female Prophets, ''Literature and Theology'', Volume 31, Issue 4, 1 December 2017, Pages 455–471, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/litthe/frx032&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoomorphic language for things, ideas===
*A literary phrase such as "The roar of the ocean".
