The '''avondvierdaagse''' (four-evenings walk) is an annual [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[walking]] event where the participants walk for four days.

==History ==
In 1909, the term 'vierdaagse' was introduced for the first time in the Netherlands. The Dutch Association for Physical Education (NBLO) organised walking marches in those days. During the [[Second World War]], these 'walking marches' were prohibited by the [[German occupation of the Netherlands|occupation forces]].

Since there was a demand for a walking event in the [['t Gooi]] area, walks developed under the term 'wandelvierdaagse'. These walks were first held in 1940, and soon caught on in other places in the Netherlands. When occupation forces found out about this new form of walking, they banned the events as assemblies against the occupiers.

After the Second World War, the avondvierdaagse was re-established by various municipalities and local associations. Within a few years, many avondvierdaagsen were being held again. Currently, almost all cities in the Netherlands have such events, and some of these have grown into major events such as the [[International Four Days Marches Nijmegen]] (Nijmeegse Vierdaagse).

Today, overall coordination of these walks is done by the Royal Walkers Union of the Netherlands ([http://www.kwbn.nl/ Koninklijke Wandelbond Nederland]), and the event has its own website at [http://www.avondvierdaagse.nl/ Avondvierdaagse.nl].

==Distances ==
Often, avondvierdaagsen are offered in 2 or 3 distances: typically 5 [[kilometre]]s, 10 kilometres, and 15 kilometres. The same distance is usually not walked all 4 days, but the total distance usually comes out to average days multiplied by advertised kilometres. In many places, on the last day all participants walk the same distance.

Large walking events (such as the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen) have much greater distances, e.g. 30, 40 or even 50 kilometres.

In human [[neuroanatomy]], '''brainstem auditory evoked potentials''' ('''BAEPs'''), also called '''brainstem auditory evoked responses''' ('''BAERs'''), are very small [[auditory evoked potential]]s in response to an auditory stimulus, which are recorded by [[electrodes]] placed on the scalp. They reflect neuronal activity in the [[auditory nerve]], [[cochlear nucleus]], [[superior olive]], and [[inferior colliculus]] of the [[brainstem]]. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an [[amplitude]] of approximately one microvolt.

Due to their small amplitude, 500 or more repetitions of the auditory stimulus are required in order to average out the random background electrical activity. Although it is possible to obtain a BAEP to a [[Pure tone audiometry|pure tone stimulus]] in the [[hearing range]], a more effective auditory stimulus contains a range of frequencies in the form of a short sharp click.

Long and Allen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Long|first=KJ|last2=Allen|first2=N|title=Abnormal brain-stem auditory evoked potentials following Ondine's curse|journal=Archives of Neurology|date=October 1984|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1109–10|pmid=6477223|doi=10.1001/archneur.1984.04050210111028}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to report the abnormal BAEPs in an alcoholic woman who recovered from [[acquired central hypoventilation syndrome]]. These investigators hypothesized that their patient's brainstem was poisoned, but not destroyed, by her chronic alcoholism.

[[File:President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.jpg|thumb|240px|In 2017 President [[Barack Obama]]'s relationship with his Vice President [[Joe Biden]] was described as a "''bromance''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4631033/barack-obama-joe-biden-bromance-history/|title=This Is Why the Obama-Biden Bromance Is Surprising|website=Time|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Close Relationships}}
A '''bromance''' is a close but non-sexual relationship between two or more men.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;  It is an exceptionally tight [[affectional orientation|affectional]], [[Homosociality|homosocial]] [[male bonding]] relationship exceeding that of usual friendship,&lt;ref name ="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt; and is distinguished by a particularly high level of emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt; The emergence of the concept since the beginning of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century has been seen as reflecting a change in societal perception and interest in the theme,&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt; with an increasing openness of western society in the twenty-first century to reconsider gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Bromance'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Bro (subculture)|bro]]'' (or ''brother'') and ''romance''. [[Dave Carnie]] is credited with coining the term as editor of the skateboard magazine ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]'' in the 1990s to refer specifically to the sort of relationships that develop between skaters who spent a great deal of time together.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; The term did not attain broad currency until approximately 2005&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt; when the theme became more prominent in the motion picture industry.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;

==Historical==
{{Main|Romantic friendship}}
Numerous examples exist of intense [[homosocial]] friendships throughout history; such relationships were common between men and also between women. The term ''[[romantic friendship]]'' is a modern historical construct with a different [[homoerotic]] [[connotation]] and [[social context|social construction]]; it is discussed within [[Romantic friendship|its own article]].

==Characteristics==
''Bromance'' has been examined from viewpoints such as [[historiography]], [[discourse analysis]], [[social research]], and [[queer theory]] in book-length reviews.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt; The emergence of ''bromance'' as a topic over the past decade has been seen as reflecting how society has collectively changed its perception and interest in the theme.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt;

Several characteristics of bromance have been cited:
* Bromance conveys a male [[homosocial]] relationship that goes much further than traditional homosocial practices.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt; The increased closeness goes beyond being mere friends, to a deep bond that has been characterized as capturing the conceptual edge of "is [[gay]] / is not gay".&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;
* Its emergence as a distinctive conceptual genre and theme in the movie and television industry is seen as reflective of a "broader acceptance of non-[[heteronormative]] cultural expressions as well as the prospect of a same-sex intimacy that transcends matters of sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;
* Contemporary cultural circumstances, including the struggle for and attainment of [[gay marriage]] equality, and specific elements of the depiction of bromance in movies and television separate it from [[buddy film]]s, as well as historic [[romantic friendships]], which reflect a different [[social construction]].&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deresiewicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;

According to Chen, society has taken a collective interest in reexamination of some of the traditional constraints on male friendship, and in potentially reshaping the constructs of gender, sexuality, and intimacy.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Bromance provides "a case study of gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints in twenty-first century America as they operate in law and beyond. Those constraints in turn speak to the privilege and subordination imbued in this type of relationship, with implications for other types as well."&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; This is distinct from the connotations of ''[[romantic friendship]]'', a term of 20th&amp;nbsp;century historical scholarship that retrospectively described close [[homosocial]] relationships, which had become less common after potential physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety in the second half of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Faderman"/&gt;

On the one hand, social interest in the theme has been seen as driving the film industry, which has then fed back to society at large, exploring peoples' mindsets and addressing acceptance of "other types of relationships" between people.&lt;ref name="AlbertiQR"/&gt; On the other hand, some have seen the emphasis on [[platonic love]] as a rejection of [[homoeroticism]], or as a deliberate confounding of ''homosocial'' and ''homoerotic'' relationships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/01/our-romance-with-the-bromance/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bromance'' has also been seen as a reflection of greater "discursive expressivity".&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt; The experiences of friendship and masculinity, perhaps due to more open parenting styles from the 1970s, reflect a trend toward more openness emotionally, with increased expressivity.&lt;ref name="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacey"/&gt; According to sociologist Peter Nardi, "men are less afraid of being perceived as gay. It has become more acceptable for them to show some emotion."&lt;ref name="Bindley"/&gt; Men are marrying later, if at all, which impacts [[male bonding]].&lt;ref name="Bindley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Badoo"/&gt; According to the 2010 US Census, the average age of a man's first marriage is 28, up from 23 in 1960; men with more education are waiting until their 30s before getting married.

==Celebrity==
A number of celebrity relationships have been popularly characterised as "''bromances''". Although ''bromance'' is a new term, this treatment of celebrity relationships is not new: The composer [[Franz Schubert]] had a very close friendship with poet [[Franz von Schober]], whose texts Schubert set to music. They were nicknamed "''Schobert''" in early 19th&amp;nbsp;century Vienna.

===Film celebrities===
[[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] as the 1946-1956 ‘rock star’ comedy team [[Martin and Lewis]] set a new standard for a complex, multifaceted enactment of a ‘special’ male friendship.” Coming post-war, “the comedy of Martin and Lewis teased with a sly alternative to the model of heterosexual affirmation traditionally peddled by Hollywood, as their intense and unstable relationship showcased a panoply of emotional and erotic intensities between men. The cultural resonance of Martin and Lewis's comedy derived from the way it set in motion a more complex ‘queering of gender.’” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=The Handsome Man and His Monkey|first=Frank|last=Krutnik|publisher=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=Spring 1995}}Vol.23 Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; They starred in 16 films together as an inseparable unit, as well as on [[Golden Age of Television|early live television]] and in [[nightclubs]]. They had an immeasurable effect on millions of [[baby boomers]] and future comedians, (including George Clooney, whose aunt [[Rosemary Clooney]] was a guest on their show).

[[Ben Affleck]] and [[Matt Damon]] were described as "''perhaps '''the''' pioneering bromance in showbiz history''",&lt;ref name="Yaskua"/&gt; which led to a hit [[off-Broadway]] play called ''Matt and Ben''.&lt;ref name="Casablanca"/&gt; The relationship between [[Zachary Quinto]] and [[Chris Pine]], stars of the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, has been described similarly, in common with their on-screen characters' relationship.&lt;ref name="Burr"/&gt;

The close friendship between [[George Clooney]] and [[Brad Pitt]] was once suggested to be "''George's longest-lasting affair''"&lt;ref name="Synnot"&gt;{{cite news | last = Synnot| first = Siobhan| title = I'm a loser in love, admits Hollywood star George Clooney| work = The Daily Record| date = 2008-10-18|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/2008/10/17/i-m-a-loser-in-love-admits-hollywood-star-george-clooney-86908-20811800/| accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Clooney's bromantic tendencies served as the basis for an episode of the animated series ''[[American Dad!]]'' entitled "[[Tears of a Clooney]]", in which lead character [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] becomes bromantically involved with Clooney as part of an elaborate revenge plot.

=== Athletes ===
Professional [[Association football|footballers]] [[Eric Dier]] and [[Dele Alli]], who play together for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[England national football team|England]], have a close relationship that has been described as a ''bromance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Anthony|title=Tottenham stars Dele Alli and Eric Dier have hit it off both on and off the pitch - they are the Premier League's blossoming bromance|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3528764/Tottenham-stars-Dele-Alli-Eric-Dier-Premier-League-s-blossoming-bromance.html|website=Mail Online|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bristow|first1=Thomas|title=Dele Alli and Eric Dier's bromance reaches record new heights while playing the water bottle challenge|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/dele-alli-eric-diers-bromance-8989068|website=Mirror|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Olympics|2016 Olympic]] 100m finals, the friendship between Jamaican [[Usain Bolt]] and Canadian [[Andre De Grasse]] emerged, characterized and celebrated on social media as a bromance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4456975/2016-rio-olympics-usain-bolt-de-grasse-smile/|title=Usain Bolt’s Happy Face Blows Up Twitter Again|last=Calvo|first=Amanda|website=Time|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between band members===
The tight relationship both on- and off-stage between [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the late [[E Street Band]] saxophonist [[Clarence Clemons]] has often been described&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Billboard.com|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470403/clarence-clemons-mourned-by-e-street-nation|title=Clarence Clemons Mourned by E Street Nation|date=2011-06-19|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Nytimes.com|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/bromance-with-the-big-man/|title=Bromance With the Big Man|author=Timothy Egan|date=2011-06-23|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Salon.com|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/06/29/bruce_springsteen_clarence_clemons/|title=How big was the Big Man?|author=Joan Walsh|date=2011-06-29|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the most fitting examples of ''bromance'' in Western modern music. This relationship is most notably depicted in Springsteen's song "[[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out]]", from ''[[Born to Run]]'' &amp;ndash; in which Springsteen and Clemons appear respectively under their pseudonyms Bad Scooter and Big Man. It was also described in Clemons' autobiography ''Big Man: Real Life &amp; Tall Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267058/clarence-clemons-tells-springsteen-tales-in-big-man-book&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese and [[K-pop|Korean music industry]] actively encourages bromance among male celebrities (particularly members of [[boy band]]s) as part of the [[fan service]] to please the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seoulbeats.com/2011/09/of-bromance-and-homoeroticism-2/|title=Of Bromance and Homoeroticism |date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2012-03-19|publisher=SeoulBeats}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellokpop.com/2011/10/28/otps-the-real-deal/|title=OTPs – The Real Deal? |date=2011-10-28|publisher=HelloKPop|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay-straight celebrity relationships===
While the term has generally been applied to straight relationships, mixed gay-straight relationships without sexual intimacy have also been dubbed "''bromances''". Examples of well-known gay-straight bromances include [[George Michael]] and Andrew Ridgley from the band [[Wham!]], [[Ronnie Kroell]] and Ben DiChiara from the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] reality series ''[[Make Me a Supermodel (U.S. TV series)|Make Me a Supermodel]]'', in which the pair was nicknamed "Bronnie",&lt;ref name="Aterovis"/&gt; the relationship on ''[[Survivor: Gabon]]'' between Charlie Herschel and Marcus Lehman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Cultural references==
===Film===
[[Buddy film]]s have to a degree been rebranded as ''bromance'' films, although critics draw a distinction between the two, noting that a buddy film tends to be more explicitly violent and less open about its latent homosexual content.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbone"/&gt; The intersection between buddy films and what would come to be called the bromance film was noted comedically at least as early as 1978, when ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' ran a parody ad for the football-themed buddy film ''[[Semi-Tough]]'', renamed "Semi-Sweet" and featuring an illustration of stars [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] holding hands.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt;

Prominent examples of ''[[bromantic comedy]]'' include Judd Apatow's ''[[The 40 Year Old Virgin]]'' (2005) and [[Knocked Up (film)|''Knocked Up'']] (2007), which targeted non-sexual homosocial behavior and masculinity in inventive ways,&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"&gt;Setoodeh, Ramin. "Isn't It Bromantic?" Newsweek 8 June 2009: 73. Academic OneFile. Web. 24 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]]'s ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' (2005),&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt; ''[[Zoolander]]'',&lt;ref&gt;White, Susan. (2010). "I Felt Like, 'This Guy's Really Hurting Me.' And It Hurt." in ''Funny Men in Pain from Zoolander to Anchorman. Popping Culture''. 6th&amp;nbsp;ed. Pearson Custom Pub. p.&amp;nbsp;125-33.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Funny People]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="Harbidge"/&gt; [[John Hamburg]]'s ''[[I Love You Man]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="AlbertiQR"/&gt; Todd Phillips' ''[[The Hangover]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="Harbidge"/&gt; and Gordon's ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="Harbidge"/&gt;

Although [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels predate what could technically be called the "''bromance era''", the portrayal of the lifelong close relationships between [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] in the novels have been characterized as bromance, as well as the depictions in the films based on them.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

The theme remains popular, with different genres looking at the concept in various ways, such as the documentary ''Best of Enemies'' &amp;ndash; about the 1960s feud between intellectuals [[Gore Vidal]] and [[William F. Buckley]].&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

===Television===
Bromance on television has also become more commonplace. It appeared early-on in the partnership of two CIA/KGB spies in the 1960s' ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/the-man-from-uncle-celebrates-the-spy-phenomenon-from-the-1960s/article25957384/|title=The Man from U.N.C.L.E. celebrates the spy phenomenon from the 1960s|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1970s' buddy-cop show ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch]]'', which producer Aaron Spelling called ''TV’s first heterosexual love affair.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afternoonspecial.com/pop-culture/secrets-about-starsky-and-hutch/5/|title=25 Secrets About Starsky And Hutch You Didn't Know {{!}} AfternoonSpecial|date=2016-09-07|newspaper=AfternoonSpecial|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics also point to the 1970s' ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|Odd Couple]]'',&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt; about which executive producer [[Garry Marshall]] has said, "The network was concerned that we were being too gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/156746_the_odd_couple_matthew_perry_reveals_secrets_behind_cbs_modern_remake/|title='The Odd Couple': Matthew Perry Reveals Secrets Behind CBS' Modern Remake!|newspaper=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, ''[[TV Guide]]'' placed [[Gregory House]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]) and [[James Wilson (House)|James Wilson]] ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]) on the cover, under the headline "Isn't It Bromantic?".&lt;ref&gt;That characterizaton of the House-Wilson relationship, was finally acknowledged by the characters (and their writers) on s08e19, "The C Word", and they did it by weaving the term into a typical dialogue, in a non typical situation:

After a long and difficult weekend, during which House treated Wilson through his extreme and dangerous chemo treatment of choice, Wilson awakens and starts recollecting what they went through: "Wilson: I... I seem to recall, I said some things to you...
House: You talked a lot. I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins. Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches? My leg is killing me." ''note: Thus, indirectly addmiting he sacrificed his own stash of pain killeres in order to treat Wilson''. A minute later, House supports Wilson on his way to the bathroom, and they both groan, each out of his own pain: "Wilson: I thought you said you had plenty of Vicodin?
House: Everybody lies... Wilson: So, the way I felt... You feel that, what, Most of the time? Really does suck being you, doesn't it? House: At least I don't have cancer."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brody Jenner]], featured on MTV's reality show ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' and the subject of bromance discussions for his relationships with castmates [[Justin Bobby]] and [[Spencer Pratt]], debuted his own series on the network, called ''[[Bromance (TV series)|Bromance]]'', on December 29, 2008. The six-episode series features Jenner selecting from amongst competitors to become part of Jenner's "entourage".&lt;ref name="Yagedaran" /&gt;

In ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', J.D. is a sensitive doctor "completely in touch with his feelings. He's not afraid of showing his best pal Turk how much he loves him."&lt;ref name="Burbach"&gt;[http://friendship.about.com/od/Types_of_Friendships/p/What-Is-Bromance.htm Burbach C]&lt;/ref&gt; In one episode, they sing, "Guy love. That’s all it is."&lt;ref name="Burbach" /&gt; The J.D. and Turk relationship truly embodies one of the best bromances ever. They always stand by each other's side and often one thinks they are more in love with each other than their significant other. ''[[The Good Guys (2010 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'' "promotes male bonding while self-consciously acknowledging its homoerotic overtones."&lt;ref&gt;Lavigne, Carlen (April 1, 2013). "Two men and a moustache: Masculinity, nostalgia and bromance in The Good Guys". ''The Journal of Popular Television,'' ''1''&amp;nbsp;(1): 69–81. Intellect Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Independent'' analyzed the BBC's ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' as a ''bromance'', and looked at bromance thematically.&lt;ref name="Strudwick" /&gt; The relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as a bromance has been visited elsewhere also.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelling" /&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not list any more fictional/celebrity bromances here, unless citing sources which provide a significant analysis of the concept/theme of bromance.

===Other===
The cultural concept that ''bromance'' connotes particular closeness has been taken up thematically. The concept has been visited in biology,&lt;ref name="Zielinski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavelle"/&gt; as well as an experimental acrobatic video dance piece, ''Bromance'', which explores “... the intimacy of physical interaction between guys; of their ‘bromance’.”&lt;ref name="Instinct"/&gt;

The relationship between [[George W. Bush]] and former press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] as told in McClellan's book ''[[What Happened (McClellan book)|What Happened]]'' was called by one reviewer "''the tale of one long, failed bromance''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kelly | first = David | title = One Long, Failed Bromance | work = Paper Cuts | date = 2008-06-02 |publisher = New York Times |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/one-long-failed-bromance/ | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the song "Bromance" by comedian, [[List of YouTubers|YouTube personality]], and actor [[Ryan Higa]] (also known by his [[YouTube]] username "nigahiga"), went [[viral video|viral]].&lt;ref&gt;DeAngelis, Michael.

The former premiers [[Dalton McGuinty]] of [[Ontario]] (2003&amp;ndash;2013) and [[Jean Charest]] of [[Quebec]] (2003&amp;ndash;2012) were described as a "''burgeoning bromance''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Florida |first=Richard |title=Ahead of the Curve |work=The Montreal Gazette |date=2008-10-17 |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/challenge/story.html?id=4066da18-0970-4a9b-94b4-e7dfb70cfd1e |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818203514/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/challenge/story.html?id=4066da18-0970-4a9b-94b4-e7dfb70cfd1e |archivedate=2010-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Campbell  | first = Murray | title = McGuinty and Charest: a fine bromance | work = The Globe and Mail | date = 2008-10-03|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-and-charest-a-fine-bromance/article716268/| accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Harper]] of [[Canada]] (2006&amp;ndash;2015) and [[Tony Abbott]] of [[Australia]] (2013&amp;ndash;2015), and their respective countries, were characterized as a "''conservative bromance''".&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan20131219"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan20140610"/&gt; The term has been used to describe [[Narendra Modi]] from [[India]] and [[Barack Obama]] from the [[United States]] during the January 2015 visit,&lt;ref name="Parsons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt; and [[Vladimir Putin]] from the [[Russian Federation]] with [[Gerhard Schröder]] from [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Newcomb"/&gt;

In early 2017, a number of [[internet meme]]s surfaced which alluded to Obama's relationship with Vice President [[Joe Biden]] as a "''bromance''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/15/incredible-obama-biden-bromance-memes-back/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbonless copy paper''' ('''CCP'''), '''non-carbon copy paper''', or '''NCR paper''' (No Carbon Required, taken from the initials of its creator, [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]]) is a type of [[coated paper]] designed to transfer information written on the front onto sheets beneath. It was developed by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appletonideas.com/pdf/Lowell_Schleicher_Dies.pdf |title=Carbonless Paper Pioneer Lowell Schleicher Dies |publisher=Appletonideas.com |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112210954/http://www.appletonideas.com/pdf/Lowell_Schleicher_Dies.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to [[carbon paper]] and is sometimes misidentified as such.

Instead of inserting a special sheet in between the original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has [[micro-encapsulation|micro-encapsulated]] dye or ink on the back side of the top sheet, and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the top sheet. Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.

== Operation ==
Carbonless copy paper consists of sheets of paper that are [[coated paper|coated]] with [[micro-encapsulation|micro-encapsulated]] dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a Coated Back or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB).

When the sheets are written on with pressure (e.g., ball-point pen) or impact (e.g., typewriter, [[Dot matrix printer|dot-matrix printer]]), the pressure causes the micro-capsules to break and release their dye. Since the capsules are so small, the resulting print is very accurate.

Carbonless copy paper was also available in a self-contained version that had both the ink and the clay on the same side of the paper.

== Uses ==
Carbonless copy paper was first produced by the [[NCR Corporation]], applying for a patent on June 30, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|2730457|Pressure responsive record materials|Inventors: Green, Barrett K.; Schleicher, Lowell. Applicant: The National Cash Register Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use [[carbon paper]], which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g., white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as [[continuous stationery]] for printers designed to use it.

== Dyes and chemicals ==
The first dye used commercially in this application was [[crystal violet lactone]], which is widely used today. Other dyes and supporting chemicals used are PTSMH (''p''-toluene sulfinate of Michler's hydrol), TMA ([[trimellitic anhydride]]), phenol-formaldehyde resins, [[azo dye]]s, DIPN ([[diisopropyl naphthalene]]s), [[formaldehyde isocyanate]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]-based [[solvent]]s, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, [[polyoxypropylene diamine]], [[epoxy resin]]s, aliphatic [[isocyanate]]s, [[Bisphenol A]], [[diethylene triamine]], and others. The dyes in carbonless copy papers may cause [[contact dermatitis]] in sensitive persons.

== Health and environmental concerns ==
Until the 1970s, when the use of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) was banned due to health and environmental concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in carbonless copy paper.&lt;ref name="devoogt1984"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=de Voogt P |author2=Klamer J C |author3=Brinkman U A Th |title=Identification and quantification of polychlorinated biphenyls in paper and paper board using fused silica capillary gas chromatography |journal=Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |volume=32 |issue=1 |date=December 1984 |pages=45–52 | doi=10.1007/BF01607463 |pmid=6421348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karatsune1972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuratsune M, Masuda Y|title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Non-carbon Copy Paper |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=1 |pages=61–62 |date=April 1972 |pmid=17539088 |doi=10.2307/3428153 |pmc=1474878 |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 1 |jstor=3428153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NPL Site Narrative for Fox River NRDA/PCB Releases |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar1515.htm |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, and it is difficult to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water.&lt;ref name="karatsune1972" /&gt; In Japan, carbonless copy paper is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.&lt;ref name="envjapan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Invitation of proposals concerning to PCB contaminated solid wastes treatment technologies |publisher=''Hyogo Prefectural Environment Create Center Public Corporation'' |date=January 27, 2003 |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/recycle/ill_dum/pcb/index.html | accessdate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to certain types of carbonless copy paper or its components has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with carbonless copy paper produced after 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Carbonless copy paper and workplace safety: a review |vauthors=Graves CG, Matanoski GM, Tardiff RG |journal=[[Regul Toxicol Pharmacol]] |year=2000 |volume=32 |number=1 |pages=99–117 |pmid=11029273| doi=10.1006/rtph.2000.1408}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ccp/ |title=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – Carbonless Copy Paper |accessdate=October 13, 2007 |publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 study, the University of Florida found that a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of carbonless copy paper were used had significant levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The study also found that there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless copy paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meisenheimer|first1=Karen|title=Scientists Test Carbonless Copy Paper For Sickening Side Effects|url=http://news.ufl.edu/archive/1997/05/scientists-test-carbonless-copy-paper-for-sickening-side-effects.html|website=University of Florida News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, which was published in ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless copy paper with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaakkola |first=Maritta S. |author2=Jouni J.K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31712">'''Catholic sisters and nuns in the United States''' have played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century.  In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. the numbers grew exponentially from about 900 in the year 1840, to a maximum of nearly 200,000 in 1965, falling to 56,000 in 2010.  The network of Catholic institutions provided high status, but low-paying lifetime careers as nuns in parochial schools, hospitals, and orphanages. They were part of an international Catholic network, with considerable movement back and forth from Britain, France, Germany and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Sioban Nelson, ''Read Say Little, Do Much: Nurses, Nuns, and Hospitals in the Nineteenth Century'' (2001) [https://www.questia.com/library/120086535/say-little-do-much-nurses-nuns-and-hospitals online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some American Catholics came to the defense of American sisters when the Vatican initiated an investigation into what it viewed as unorthodox leanings among the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. The controversial investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a "vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church's schools, hospitals and charities" was ultimately closed in 2015 in meeting with Pope Francis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/us/catholic-church-ends-takeover-of-leadership-conference-of-women-religious.html Vatican Ends Battle With U.S. Catholic Nuns’ Group] NYT, April 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The first women religious in what would become the United States, were fourteen French [[History of the Ursulines in New Orleans|Ursuline nuns]] who arrived in New Orleans in July 1727,&lt;ref&gt;Blondeau, Caherine. ''Étude normande: La vie littéraire à Rouen au 18ème siècle'': "Le Mississipy est en cet endroit plus large que n'est la rivière de Seine à Roüen", à propos de la ''Relation du voyage des dames religieuses Ursulines de Roüen à la Nouvelle Orléans'', p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; and opened [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans)|Ursuline Academy]], which continues in operation and is the oldest continuously operating school for girls in the United States.&lt;ref name=Robenstine&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robenstine |first=Clark |title=French Colonial Policy and the Education of Women and Minorities: Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth Century |journal=[[History of Education Society|History of Education Quarterly]] |date=Summer 1992 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=193–211 |jstor=368985 |issn=0018-2680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sisters of Saint Anne]] are a [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious institute]], founded in 1850 in [[Vaudreuil-Dorion|Vaudreuil]], [[Quebec]], Canada, by the [[beatification|Blessed]] [[Marie Anne Blondin]], S.S.A. The Sisters arrived in the United States in September 1867 at the request of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo|Bishop of Buffalo]], opening a school in [[Oswego, New York]].&lt;ref name=SSAH /&gt; Between 1840 and 1930 approximately 900,000 Quebec residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bélanger, Damien-Claude | title=French Canadian Emigration to the United States, 1840-1930 | date=23 August 2000 | work=Québec History, Claude Bélanger, Marianopolis College | url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/leaving.htm | accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them [[Quebec diaspora|French Canadian]] left for the United States. Textile manufacturing centers and other industrial towns such as [[Lewiston, Maine]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] attracted significant French-Canadian populations. The Sisters went on to expand throughout northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]], staffing many schools of French-speaking parishes.&lt;ref name=SSAH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssacong.org/eng/heritage/index.html|work=Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Anne|title=A Glance at our Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American communities==
* The [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]] were founded as the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph in 1809 in Emmitsburg, Maryland by [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]], who had hoped to establish a community of Daughters of Charity founded in France by St. [[Vincent de Paul]] in 1633. Unable to do so because of the political situation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], she adopted the Rules of the Daughters of Charity. The institute established other communities elsewhere, many of which subsequently became independent. In 1850 the community at Emmitsburg affiliated with the Mother House of the Daughters of Charity in Paris and at that time adopted the blue habit and the white collar and cornette.&lt;ref name=emmitsburg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/stories/sisters_of_charity.htm |title=A Short History of the Sisters of Charity, Emmitsburg Area Historical society |publisher=Emmitsburg.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community in Emmitsburg became the first American [[ecclesiastical province|province]] of the Daughters of Charity.
**In 1817, Mother Seton sent three Sisters to New York at the invitation of Bishop Connolly to open a home for dependent children. In 1846 the New York congregation incorporated as a separate order, the [[Sisters of Charity of New York]]. The Sisters in New York retained the rule, customs, and spiritual exercises established by Mother Seton, and her black habit, cape and cap.&lt;ref name=emmitsburg /&gt; In 1869 they established [[The New York Foundling]], an orphanage for abandoned children,&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;[http://scny.org/sisters-of-charity-timeline/ Sisters of Charity of New York Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1880 opened St. Ann's Hospital to provide medical treatment for unmarried mothers.&lt;ref name=nyf&gt;[https://www.nyfoundling.org/about/history/ "History", New York Foundling]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 the New York [[Children's Aid Society]] began sending orphans and neglected children to live outside the city. The majority were sent to the West and Midwest. In 1875, the Sisters initiated a similar program working in conjunction with priests throughout the Midwest and South in an effort to place these children in Catholic families. The Foundling Hospital sent infants and toddlers to prearranged Roman Catholic homes from 1875 to 1919.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/horizon/nov98/orphan.htm Warren, Andrea. "The Orphan Train", ''The Washington Post'', 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1910s 1,000 children a year were placed with new families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v046/46.1.creagh.html Creagh, Dianne. "The Baby Trains: Catholic Foster Care and Western Migration, 1873-1929," ''Journal of Social History'' (2012) 46#1 pp 197-218]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dominican Sisters of Peace]] trace their heritage to the original Dominican foundation in America, the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Sienna, founded in 1822 in Springfield, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;''Dominicans at Home in a Young Nation: 1786-1865'', &gt;(McGreal, Mary Nona, ed.) Strasbourg, France: Editions du Signe, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 seven Dominican congregations merged to form the new Dominican Sisters of Peace. The seven were: the Dominican Sisters of St. Catharine, KY; Dominican Sisters of Akron, Ohio; Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs, Columbus, Ohio; Dominican Sisters of Great Bend, Kansas; Dominican Sisters of Oxford, Michigan; Dominican Sisters of St. Mary’s, New Orleans and the Eucharistic Missionaries of St. Dominic, New Orleans, Louisiana. In 2012. In 2012 the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine de’ Ricci also joined.  
* The [[Sisters of the Divine Compassion]] are a Roman Catholic religious institute founded in New York City in 1886 by Mother Mary Veronica – formerly Mary Dannat Starr and [[Thomas Scott Preston|Msgr. Thomas Preston]].

==Civil War==
* When the Civil War broke out [[Eliza Maria Gillespie|Mother Mary of St. Angela, C.S.C.]] organized a corps of the [[Sisters of the Holy Cross]] to care for the sick and wounded soldiers. She established hospitals, both temporary and permanent, and, when Generals failed to secure needed aid for the sick and wounded, she made trips to Washington on their behalf.
* In May 1861 [[Mary Cecilia Bailly|Mother Mary Cecilia Bailly, S.P.]], Superior General of the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]], sent Sisters to staff military hospitals in Indianapolis and Vincennes, Indiana. They also tended patients at the Confederate prison located in Indianapolis, which held at one time 7,000 prisoners. At the end of the war the Hospital was returned to the city, and the Sisters opened St John's Infirmary for those soldiers with no place to go, but not yet strong enough to travel. The Sisters of Providence are now honored by a monument in Washington, D.C., dedicated to the [[Nuns of the Battlefield|Nuns of the Battlefield of the Civil War]].&lt;ref name="mug"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/LestWeForgetTheSistersOfProvidenceOfSaintMary-of-the-woodsInCivil | title=Lest We Forget: The Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in Civil War Service | publisher=Providence Press | author=Mug, Mary Theodosia | year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 1861 [[Mary O'Connell|Sister Anthony O'Connell, S.C.]] was one of six [[Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati]] who went to Camp Dennison to provide nursing assistance. Sisters also served at Cumberland, Virginia, treating the wounded of both armies. More than one-third of the community, which by then had more than one hundred members, served. Sister Anthony developed the Battlefield Triage. Her method was "the first recognizably modern triage techniques in war zones, saved countless lives through faster hospital treatment and won her praise from President Lincoln". Her medical skills allowed her to intervene to save soldiers' limbs from amputation.&lt;ref name=asuvcw&gt;[http://asuvcwcincinnati.com/page5.php "Namesake", The Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, Sister Anthony O'Connell Auxiliary] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130902170930/http://asuvcwcincinnati.com/page5.php |date=2013-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For her service at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] Sister Anthony became known as the "Angel of the Battlefield". Her portrait hangs in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. 
* In 1862 the Sisters of Charity of New York began nursing Civil War wounded in St. Joseph’s Military Hospital, at [[McGowan's Pass]], the former site of Mt. St. Vincent in Central Park. The hospital closed in 1865.
* [[Mary Frances Schervier|Mary Frances Schervier, S.P.S.F.]] of the [[Poor Sisters of St. Francis]] based in Aachen, Germany, visited the congregations communities in the United States in 1863, and helped her Sisters nurse wounded soldiers. [[Hoboken University Medical Center|St. Mary Hospital]] in Hoboken, New Jersey was founded for this work.
* The Congregation of the [[Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word]], Houston is a [[religious institute]] of women begun in 1866 in [[Galveston, Texas]], as Texas was suffering from the ravages of the Civil War, coupled with the tragedy of a rapidly spreading cholera epidemic.
** A second Community was started in San Antonio, in 1869, and is now the largest group of religious women in Texas.  They founded San Antonio's first public hospital, known today as [[Christus Santa Rosa Health System|Christus Santa Rosa Hospital]].  They began educational work in 1874 and founded the [[University of the Incarnate Word]] in 1881.

Other communities who assisted the sick and wounded include: the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]], [[Carmelites]], [[Dominican Order]], [[Ursulines]], [[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy]], Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, [[Sisters of Charity of Nazareth]], and the [[Congregation of Divine Providence]].&lt;ref name="HMDB"&gt;{{cite web | author=Craig Swain | year=2008 | title=Nuns of the Battlefield | work=Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia — The American Northeast (Mid-Atlantic) | publisher=The Historical Marker Database | url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=10176 | accessdate= 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The majority of these women followed an active apostolate; the number of contemplative communities being relatively small. About sixty percent were primarily involved with teaching, while the rest were engaged in nursing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x70YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=Order+of+the+Incarnate+Word+and+Blessed+Sacrament&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=msPmZoK4sG&amp;sig=OuCRF3Fm5TLlsXnUkKK8Rp1eNpw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBjgKahUKEwi_jqbj8rDHAhXFkA0KHUfnC9w#v=onepage&amp;q=Order%20of%20the%20Incarnate%20Word%20and%20Blessed%20Sacrament&amp;f=false ''The Catholic Church in the United States of America'', Catholic Editing Company, New York, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==
The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840,  50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930.  Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers.&lt;ref&gt;James M.  O'Toole, ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2008) p 104&lt;/ref&gt;  Young women entered after elementary school, and spent one year at a novitiate training program before entering full-time roles.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Their total number peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Most simply left their orders.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. McGuinness, ''Called to Serve'' (2013), ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another estimate gives 5000 in 1860, 22,000 in 1880, 90,000 in 1920 and 180,000 in 1950, with a peak in 1965 at 200,000. George C. Stewart, ''Marvels of Charity: History of American Sisters and Nuns'' (1994)  p 565&lt;/ref&gt;  There were very few replacements.  In the early 1960s, 7000 young women a year joined the orders; by 1990 there were only 1000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Wittberg,  '' The Rise and Fall of Catholic Religious Orders: A Social Movement Perspective'' (1994) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Know Nothing attacks===
in the period before the American Civil War, it was common for anti-Catholic Protestants to sponsor semi-pornographic lectures by ex-Catholic nuns. Ugly rumors spread to the effect that convents  and nunneries were organized for the sexual pleasure of the male priests, with the corpses of dead babies buried underneath. The [[Know-Nothing]] movement of the 1850s was especially focused on these allegations. Winning control of the Massachusetts state legislature in 1854, the Know Nothings set up a legislative investigation to try and substantiate the rumors. The press had a field day following the story, especially when it was discovered that the key reformer was using committee funds to pay for a prostitute in Boston. The legislature shut down its committee, ejected the reformer, and saw its investigation became a laughing stock.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'' (1992), pp 115, 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John R. Mulkern, "Scandal Behind the Convent Walls: The Know-Nothing Nunnery Committee of 1855." ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 11 (1983): 22-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary J. Oates, "'Lowell': An Account of Convent Life in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1852-1890." ''New England Quarterly'' (1988) pp. 101-118 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/365222 in JSTOR] reveals the actual behavior of the Catholic nuns.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howard Lord, et al., ''History of the Archdiocese of Boston in the Various Stages of Development, 1604 to 1943'' (1944) pp. 686-99 for more details&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parochial schools===
{{Main article|Catholic schools in the United States}}
By the middle of the 19th century, the Catholics in larger cities started building their own parochial school system.  The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith.  Protestants reacted by [[Blaine Amendments|strong opposition to any public funding]] of parochial schools. The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Jay P.  Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 262-74&lt;/ref&gt;  They created the world's largest network of religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Review," ''Journal of American History'' (2014) 100#4:1221&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern.  The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent.  Around 1911, led by [[The Catholic University of America]], Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Dolan notes that in the early 20th century a majority young nuns who became teachers had not attended high school. They taught for a half-century or more and long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior conditions compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 286-91&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid growth of the Catholic population continued, and after 1945 it started to pour into the suburbs.  At the peak in 1960, 13,000 schools served over 5 million students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dominic J. Brewer|author2=Patrick J. McEwan|title=Economics of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aYDhG--OkgC&amp;pg=PA319|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|pages=319–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s there was a growing lack of teaching sisters. The solution was to hire much more expensive lay teachers, who grew from 4% of the elementary teachers in the Chicago archdiocese in 1950 to 38% by 1965.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Sanders, ''Education of an Urban Minority: Catholics in Chicago, 1833-1965'' (1977) pp. 203-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious role versus professional role==
The tension between the sisters' religious commitment and their professional role emerged in the 19th century and grew more serious over time. In the 19th century the women generally saw the religious role as paramount, with their service to God expressed through their nursing or teaching or other activities.  The bishops put little emphasis on advanced training or education. In hospitals, the sisters were prohibited from working in obstetric units, or venereal disease care. By the 20th century, however, the demands for professionalism in nursing grew stronger; many Catholic hospitals opened nursing schools, and the students did much of the routine nursing care for patients. In 1948 the Conference of Catholic Schools of Nursing was formed to promote college education for the nursing sisters. Before the 1940s the Catholic educators held that sisters who had not graduated from high school could learn to teach from their elders and by experience, while the public schools were requiring much stronger  credentials.  The goal was to quickly open as many schools as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, (1984) p 62&lt;/ref&gt; The 90,000 teaching sisters were served by 150 collegiate centers designed to provide them a bachelor's degree before they taught.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne K. McNamara, ''Sisters in Arms: Catholic Nuns through Two Millennia'' (1996) pp. 626-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and race==

Bishop [[Jean-Marie Odin]] (1800–1870), rebuilt the Catholic Church in antebellum Texas. Odin vigorously recruited priests and religious workers from the Eastern states, Quebec, England, and France. He reached the Hispanic, Irish, German and Polish children by bringing in the Ursuline teaching order of sisters and the Missionary Oblate priests of Mary Immaculate.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Foley, "Builder of the Faith in Nineteenth-Century Texas: A Deeper Look at Bishop Jean-Marie Odin," ''Catholic Southwest'' (2008) 19#1 pp. 52-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In German districts, the Catholic parochial schools were taught entirely in German until World War I, despite the protests of Yankees and Irish Catholics who tried to Anglicize those schools through the [[Bennett Law]] of 1890 in Wisconsin.

The Americanization of new immigrants was a major role for the teaching sisters especially with the arrival of the Italians, Poles and others from Eastern and Southern Europe in the late 19th century, and the arrival of Hispanics after 1960. The [[Felician Sisters]] originated in Poland and came to the United States in 1874, which became its main base. The sisters provided social mobility for young Polish women. Although the congregation was involved in the care of orphans, the aged, and the sick, teaching remained its primary concern.&lt;ref&gt;Thaddeus C.  Radzialowski, "Reflections on the History of the Felicians in America," ''Polish American Studies'' (1975) 21#1 pp  19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Toledo, Ohio, in the early 20th century Polish nuns  were used to assist the assimilation of Polish children. The sisters deemphasized the children's Polish heritage and taught in English, making frequent reference to Polish words .&lt;ref&gt;Sarah E.  Miller, "'Send Sisters, Send Polish Sisters,'" ''Ohio History'' (2007) 114#1 pp. 46-56&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chicago, some of the black children arriving from Louisiana were already Catholic, and were taught by Catholic sisters.   The primarily Irish American Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, the mostly German-American Franciscan Sisters, and the Polish-American Sisters of the Holy Family lived in the all-black segregated neighborhoods, where they learned about the pervasiveness of racism in America.&lt;ref&gt;Suellen Hoy, "Ministering Hope to Chicago,," ''Chicago History'' (2002) 31#2 pp 4-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
In April 1956 the Holy See's [[Congregation of the Affairs of Religious]] requested that [[religious sisters]] in the U.S. form a national conference. In November of that year, the committee of sisters in the U.S. called a meeting in Chicago of general and provincial superiors of pontifical communities consider the formation of a national conference. They voted unanimously  to establish the Conference of Major Superiors of Women (CMSW) to "promote the spiritual welfare" of the country's women religious, "insure increasing effectiveness of their apostolate," and "foster closer fraternal cooperation with all religious of the United States, the hierarchy, the clergy, and Catholic associations."&lt;ref name="lcwr-history"&gt;{{cite web|location=Silver Spring, MD|publisher=Leadership Conference of Women Religious|website=lcwr.org|title=LCWR history|url=https://lcwr.org/about/history|accessdate=2015-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418073124/https://lcwr.org/about/history|archivedate=2015-04-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed in 1971 to the ''Leadership Conference of Women Religious''. The conference includes over 1500 members, encompassing approximately 80 percent of the 57,000 women religious in the United States as of 2015. The conference describes its charter as assisting its members "collaboratively carry out their service of leadership to further the mission of the Gospel in today's world." The [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonically]]-approved organization collaborates in the Catholic church and in society to "influence systemic change, studying significant trends and issues within the church and society, utilizing our corporate voice in solidarity with people who experience any form of violence or oppression, and creating and offering resource materials on religious leadership skills." The conference serves as a resource both to its members and to public seeking resources on leadership for religious life.&lt;ref name="lcwr-history"/&gt;

'''Central venous pressure''' ('''CVP''') is the [[blood pressure]] in the [[venae cavae]], near the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]]. CVP reflects the amount of [[venous return curve|blood returning to the heart]] and the ability of the heart to pump the blood back into the [[artery|arterial]] system. CVP is often a good approximation of [[right atrial pressure]] (RAP),&lt;ref name="urlCentral Venous Catheter Physiology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/anesthesiology-elective/cardiac/cvcphys.cfm|title=Central Venous Catheter Physiology|format=|work=|accessdate=2009-02-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821165806/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/anesthesiology-elective/cardiac/cvcphys.cfm|archivedate=2008-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two terms are not identical, as a pressure differential can sometimes exist between the venae cavae and the right atrium. CVP and RAP can differ when arterial tone is altered. This can be graphically depicted as changes in the slope of the [[venous return]] plotted against [[right atrial pressure]] (where central venous pressure increases, but right atrial pressure stays the same; VR = CVP − RAP).

CVP has been, and often still is, used as a surrogate for [[preload (cardiology)|preload]], and changes in CVP in response to infusions of [[intravenous fluid]] have been used to predict volume-responsiveness (i.e. whether more fluid will improve [[cardiac output]]). However, there is increasing evidence that CVP, whether as an absolute value or in terms of changes in response to fluid, does not correlate with [[ventricular volume]] (i.e. [[preload (cardiology)|preload]]) or volume-responsiveness, and so should not be used to guide [[intravenous fluid]] therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar A, Anel R, Bunnell E, Habet K, Zanotti S, Marshall S |title=Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure fail to predict ventricular filling volume, cardiac performance, or the response to volume infusion in normal subjects |journal=Crit Care Med |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages= |year=2004 |pmid= |doi= 10.1097/01.ccm.0000114996.68110.c9|url=http://www.gwicu.com/Assets/Articles/PCPW%20CVP%20Ventric%20filling%20Kumar%20CCM%202004.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marik P, Baram M, Vahid B |title=Does Central Venous Pressure Predict Fluid Responsiveness? |journal=Chest |volume=134 |issue=1 |page= 1351|date=July 2008 |pmid= |doi= 10.1378/chest.08-1846|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/22074/zcb00708000172.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, CVP monitoring is a useful tool to guide [[hemodynamics|hemodynamic therapy]].  
The cardiopulmonary [[baroreflex]] responds to an increase in CVP by decreasing [[vascular resistance|systemic vascular resistance]] while increasing [[heart rate]] and ventricular [[myocardial contractility|contractility]] in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sala-Mercado JA, Moslehpour M, Hammond RL, Ichinose M, Chen X, Evan S, O'Leary DS, Mukkamala R |title=Stimulation of the Cardiopulmonary Baroreflex Enhances Ventricular Contractility in Awake Dogs: A Mathematical Analysis Study |journal=American Journal of Physiology.

==Measurement==
{{Non-systemic blood pressures}}
Normal CVP in patients can be measured from two points of reference:

*[[Human sternum|Sternum]]: 0–14 [[centimetre of water|cm&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]
*[[Midaxillary line]]: 8–15&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

CVP can be measured by connecting the patient's [[central venous catheter]] to a special [[Infusion pump|infusion]] set which is connected to a small diameter water column. If the water column is calibrated properly the height of the column indicates the CVP.

In most [[intensive care unit]]s, facilities are available to measure CVP continuously.

Normal values vary between 4 and 12 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

==Factors affecting CVP==
&lt;!-- Alphabetical order please --&gt;
Factors that increase CVP include:
*[[Cardiac tamponade]]
*Decreased [[cardiac output]]
*forced [[exhalation]]
*[[Heart failure]]
*[[Hypervolemia]]
*[[Mechanical ventilation]] and the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
*[[Pleural effusion]]
*[[Pulmonary Embolism]]
*[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
*[[Tension pneumothorax]]

Factors that decrease CVP include:
*Deep [[Breath|inhalation]]
*[[Distributive shock]]
*[[Hypovolemia]]

'''Child's Play''' is a [[charitable organization]] that donates toys and games to children's hospitals worldwide. It was founded in 2003 by [[Mike Krahulik]] and [[Jerry Holkins]], authors of the popular [[Video game webcomic|video games-related]] [[webcomic]] ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]''. The charity is seen as a way to refute mainstream media's perception of gamers as violent and antisocial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2003/11/25/childs-play | title=Child's Play | date=November 24, 2003 | publisher=[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]] | first=Mike | last=Krahulik | accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, Child's Play had processed $40,292,852 in donations since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childsplaycharity.org/|publisher=Child's Play|title=Official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logistics ==
With the help of hospital staff, Child's Play sets up gift wishlists on [[Amazon.com]], full of video games, books, toys and movies. These wishlists send items directly to the facilities as in-kind donations. Instead of buying items off the wishlists users can donate money through [[PayPal]] or check. This money is used to make annual wholesale purchases to provide technology like iPads and Xbox systems as well as games and movies.

The charity also has a space for corporate sponsors who have donated. The sponsors also earn a corporate sponsorship level (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and get linked back on Childsplaycharity.org. These sponsors include several video game marathons such as the [[Mario Marathon]] and [[Desert Bus for Hope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://desertbus.org/2011/11/18/sponsor-showcase-penny-arcade/ |title=Sponsor Showcase: Penny Arcade &amp; Child's Play |first=Kathleen |last=De Vere |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2012 |publisher=[[LoadingReadyRun]] }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/708746/desert-bus-for-hope-ready-for-fourth-ride/ |title=Desert Bus For Hope Ready For Fourth Ride |first=Stephen |last=Johnson |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] |date=19 November 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as YouTube series such as [[Far Lands or Bust]] by Kurtjmac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-journey-to-the-end-of-the-world-of-minecraft|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|title=A Journey to the End of the World (of Minecraft)|last=Parkin|first=Simon|date=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Krahulik Holkins, Comicon 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mike Krahulik]] and [[Jerry Holkins]] founded Child's Play in 2003.]]

Child's Play was announced on November 24, 2003 by the authors of Penny Arcade as a challenge to their readership, and as a response to the often negative portrayal of video gamers in the media, most notably a [[The Herald (Everett)|HeraldNet]] article by Bill France entitled "Violent video games are training children to kill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldnet.com/life/violent-video-games-are-training-children-to-kill/ | title=Violent video games are training children to kill | date=November 18, 2003 | first=Bill | last=France | publisher=[[The Herald (Everett)|HeraldNet]] | accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (France later made an apology in the same column, praising the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20040113/LIVING/401130739 | title=Video gamers go out of their way for ill children | date=January 14, 2004 | first=Bill | last=France | publisher=HeraldNet | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It received positive press on many popular [[weblog]]s, including [[Slashdot]] and received direct endorsement from [[Wil Wheaton]]. In less than one month of publicity and operation, the charity raised over $250,000 in cash and toys for the [[Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/giving-to-charity-this-year-is-childs-play---successful-video-game-charity-launches-2004-effort-74438572.html | title=Giving to Charity This Year Is 'Child's Play' - Successful Video Game Charity Launches 2004 Effort | date=October 20, 2004 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the charity was expanded and partnered with children's hospitals in Seattle; [[Oakland, California]]; [[San Diego|San Diego, California]]; [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/10/18#1098099601 | title=Child's Play 2004 | date=October 18, 2004 | publisher=[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]] | first=Jerry | last=Holkins | accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 5, 2005, when the final numbers for 2004 were tabulated, the charity had raised over $310,000 ($60,000 more than the previous year), and gained forty corporate sponsors in the process. Among these sponsors were [[Nintendo]], [[Midway Games]], [[Cerulean Studios]], and [[THQ]].

In 2005, the charity was again expanded to partner with an additional seven children's hospitals across the United States, as well as children's hospitals in [[Toronto]] and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada. It is also partnered with [[Alder Hey Children's Hospital]] in [[Liverpool|Liverpool, England]]. At the time when they stopped accepting donations, the community had raised $605,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/11/07#1131425040 | title=Child's Play 2005 | date=November 7, 2005 | publisher=[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]] | first=Mike | last=Krahulik | accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an auction to appear in a Penny Arcade comic strip at the 2005 Child's Play Charity Dinner. The winning bid of $20,000 was placed by Christian Boggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2005/12/14/charity-dinner1 | title=Charity Dinner! | date=December 14, 2005 | publisher=[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]] | first=Mike | last=Krahulik | accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/02/06 | title=In The House Of Boggs | date=February 6, 2006 | publisher=[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]] | first=Jerry | last=Holkins | accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Boggs also placed the winning bid on an original pencil sketch of the [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]] 2005 program cover on eBay. 100% of the profits went to the American Red Cross.

In 2006, the charity was further expanded, adding four hospitals in the United States, two in [[Australia]], and one in [[Egypt]]. In addition to this, on December 13, 2006 there was a charity dinner and auction, where items participants were able to bid on included a gaming day for four in the Penny Arcade office, an appearance in a Penny Arcade strip, a tour of Bungie and recording session for the voice of a character in [[Halo 3]], and a two-year subscription to [[World of Warcraft]] and the Burning Crusade special edition signed by all the developers. The year 2006 also became the first time that the 1 million dollar mark was reached.

In 2007, the charity added a hospital each in [[Hawaii]] and [[New Zealand]].

During the 2008 [[Penny Arcade Expo]], Harmonix announced that three songs from the Expo will be made available for download for the ''[[Rock Band]]'' video game. The proceeds of these three songs will go to the charity.&lt;ref name="pax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockband.com/news/pr/416447 |title=PAX Pack DLC |publisher=[[Harmonix]] |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915181220/http://www.rockband.com/news/pr/416447 |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 2009, Mike Krahulik announced that after one week, the Child's Play 2009 total had already reached $455,863.80.&lt;ref name="cp2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2009/11/13/childs-play-2009-update|title=Penny Arcade Child’s Play 2009 Update|publisher=[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]|date=2009-11-13|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Epic Games]] held a vote-by-purchase event between July 29 and September 6 to determine the fate of a character, Clayton Carmine, in their upcoming game ''[[Gears of War 3]]''. Gamers voted by purchasing Xbox avatar T-shirts through Xbox live, or real life T-shirts at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with all purchases counting towards the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brudvig|first=Erik|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/110/1107530p1.html |title=Epic Puts Gears 3 Story In Your Hands |publisher=Xbox360.ign.com |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting campaign raised over [[United States dollar|$]]150,000, all of which was donated to Child's Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander|title=Gears of War 3's 'Fate of Carmine' campaign raises $150K for Child's Play|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/06/gears-of-war-3s-fate-of-carmine-campaign-raises-150k-for-chi/|work=Joystiq|accessdate=6 September 2010|date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Mike Krahulik announced the first annual Child's Play Invitational Golf Tournament to be held at the Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena, California on June 5, 2011.  All proceeds from the event go to the partner hospitals &amp; facilities in the Child's Play network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.penny-arcade.com/products/the-2011-childs-play-invitational-golf-tournament|publisher=[[Penny Arcade]]|title=The 2011 Child's Play Invitational Golf Tournament|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707035035/http://store.penny-arcade.com/products/the-2011-childs-play-invitational-golf-tournament|archive-date=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golf Tournament was subsequently held at Angeles National Golf Course in Sunland, CA on June 8, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childsplaycharity.org/news/the-2012-childs-play-invitational-golf-tournament|publisher=Child's Play|title=The 2012 Child’s Play Invitational Golf Tournament|last=Dillion|first=Jamie|date=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Inglewood Golf Club in Kenmore, WA on May 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childsplaycharity.org/news/post/third-annual-childs-play-invitational-2013|publisher=Child's Play|title=Third Annual Child’s Play Invitational 2013|last=Dillion|first=Jamie|date=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion announced the first ever expansion of Child's Play to benefit children in domestic violence facilities.&lt;ref name="childsplaycharity.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childsplaycharity.org/news/post/childs-play-is-expanding|publisher=Child's Play|title=Child's Play is expanding|last=Dillion|first=Jamie|date=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was announced as a pilot and is scheduled to expand to open applications in Spring 2014. The shelter program will provide a pre-built game cart with game system, television, and games and will serve emergency shelters, long term shelters, advocacy centers and more.&lt;ref name="childsplaycharity.org"/&gt;

In 2016, the charity raised over $160k at their Annual Dinner Auction, provided nearly 30 grants to libraries, shelters, schools, trauma centers, transitional housing, day programs and more to help them purchase games and systems. Also helped supply VR setups to hospitals for therapy and distraction along with iPads to special education classrooms and inpatient psychiatric units.&lt;ref&gt;http://childsplaycharity.org/news/post/as-we-wrap-up-2016-we-want-to-take-a-moment-to-reflect-on-the-last-year&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In November 2017, former Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion posted on her tumblr a list of problems she has with the way the charity is currently being run, mainly around the lack of transparency of how donations are being spent and a lack of annual totals being announced since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://calamityjamie.tumblr.com/post/167398605213/i-wont-be-at-desert-bus-this-year-i-would-very|title=calamity jamie — I won't be at Desert Bus this year.

'''Cod liver oil''' is a [[dietary supplement]] derived from liver of [[cod|cod fish]] ([[Gadidae]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iffo.net/system/files/CCFO%2024%20Report%20Final_EN_2.pdf#overlay-context=codex|title = REPORT OF THE TWENTY FORTH SESSION OF THE CODEX COMMITTEE ON FATS AND OILS|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-08|website = Report of the Twenty Forth Session of the CODEX Committee on Fats and Oils|publisher = JOINT FAO/WHO FOOD STANDARDS PROGRAMME CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151010062248/http://www.iffo.net/system/files/CCFO%2024%20Report%20Final_EN_2.pdf#overlay-context=codex|archivedate = 10 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most [[fish oil]]s, it contains the [[omega-3]] fatty acids, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA).  Cod liver oil also contains [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin D]]. Historically, it was given to children because vitamin D had been shown to prevent [[rickets]], a consequence of [[hypovitaminosis D|vitamin D deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajakumar | first1 = K. | year = | title = Vitamin D, Cod-Liver Oil, Sunlight, and Rickets: A Historical Perspective. 2003 | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 132–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==

[[File:Making and loading of cod liver oil.jpg|thumb|Making and loading of cod liver oil,  Conche, [[Newfoundland]], 1857.]]
Cod liver oil has traditionally come in many grades. Cod liver oil for human consumption is pale and straw colored, with a mild flavor. Ancient Scandinavian Vikings produced cod liver oil by laying birch tree branches over a kettle of water, and fresh livers were laid over the branches. The water was brought to a boil and as the steam rose, the oil from the liver dripped into the water and was skimmed off. There was also a method for producing fresh raw cod liver oil.&lt;ref name="evclo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra-Virgin Cod Liver Oil History|url=http://evclo.com/history/|accessdate=14 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034625/http://evclo.com/history/|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Industrial Revolution]], cod liver oil became popular for industrial purposes. Livers placed in barrels to rot, with the oil skimmed off over the season, was the main method for producing this oil. The resulting oil was brown and foul tasting. In the 1800s cod liver oil became popular as a medicine and both pale and brown oils were used. Brown oils were common because they were cheaper to produce. Some doctors believed in only using the fresh pale oil, while others believed the brown oil was better. However the brown oils tended to cause intestinal upset.&lt;ref name="evclo" /&gt;

The Möller Process was invented by Peter Möller in 1850. The livers are ground with water into a slurry, then this is gently simmered until the oil rises to the top. The oil is skimmed off and purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Class Processing|url=http://www.mollersomega3.com/c-82-World-class-processing.aspx|accessdate=14 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071744/http://www.mollersomega3.com/c-82-World-class-processing.aspx|archivedate=16 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods used in modern times include the Cold Flotation Process, Pressure Extraction, and Pressure Cooking. These all require further purification steps to get a pure oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fish Liver Oil Industry|url=http://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/Fishery%20Leaflets/leaflet233.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212922/http://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/Fishery%20Leaflets/leaflet233.pdf|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Therapeutic uses==
Though similar in fatty acid composition to other [[fish oil]]s, cod liver oil has higher concentrations of vitamins A and D. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], a [[tablespoon]] (13.6 grams or 14.8 mL) of cod liver oil contains 4,080 [[microgram|μg]] of [[retinol]] (vitamin A) and 34 μg ( ) of vitamin D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/|title=Welcome to the USDA Food Composition Database|author=|date=|website=ndb.nal.usda.gov|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115094406/http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/|archivedate=15 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dietary Reference Intake]] of vitamin A is 900 μg per day for adult men and 700 μg per day for women, while that for vitamin D is 15 μg per day. The [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) are 3000 μg/day and 100 μg/day, respectively. People consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin A and vitamin D this adds to their diet.&lt;ref name="lips2003"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hypervitaminosis A and fractures | author=Paul Lips | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=348 | pages=1927–1928 | date=8 May 2003 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/348/4/347 | accessdate=6 March 2008 | doi=10.1056/NEJMe020167 | pmid=12540650 | issue=4 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312232610/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/348/4/347 | archivedate=12 March 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Vitamin D — Solar Rays, the Milky Way, or Both? |author=Haddad J.G. |url=http://www.nejm.org/search?q=vitamin+d&amp;asug=Vitamin#qs=%3Fq%3D%2522too%2Bmuch%2Bvitamin%2Bd%2522%26date%3Dpast20Years |publisher=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=30 April 1992 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], cod liver oil was sometimes used as the liquid base for traditional [[red ochre]] paint, the coating of choice for use on outbuildings and work buildings associated with the cod fishery.

In [[Tübingen]], Germany, drinking a glass of cod liver oil is the punishment for the loser at the traditional [[:de:Stocherkahnrennen|Stocherkahnrennen]], a [[Punt (boat)|punting boat]] race by [[University of Tübingen]] groups.

'''Compassion focused therapy''' ('''CFT''') is a system of [[psychotherapy]] developed by [[Paul Gilbert (psychologist)|Paul Gilbert]] that integrates techniques from [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] with concepts from [[evolutionary psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[Buddhist psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]. "One of its key concerns is to use compassionate mind training to help people develop and work with experiences of inner warmth, safeness and soothing, via [[compassion]] and self-compassion."&lt;ref name="Gilbert2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2009|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central therapeutic technique of CFT is compassionate mind training, which teaches the skills and attributes of [[compassion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassionate mind training helps transform problematic patterns of cognition and emotion related to [[anxiety]], [[anger]], [[shame]], [[self-criticism]], [[depersonalization]], and [[hypomania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2009|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological evolution forms the theoretical backbone of CFT. Humans have evolved with at least three primal types of emotion regulation system: the threat (protection) system, the drive (resource-seeking) system, and the soothing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2009|p=200}}; {{harvnb|Gilbert|2010a|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; CFT emphasizes the links between cognitive patterns and these three emotion regulation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2010a|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of techniques such as compassionate mind training and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), psychotherapy clients can learn to manage each system more effectively and respond more appropriately to situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2010c}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an increasing number of empirical research papers that demonstrate the importance of compassion as a way of directing behavior to deal with threat and resolve conflict.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|MacBeth|Gumley|2012}}; {{harvnb|Van Dam|Sheppard|Forsyth|Earleywine|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion focused therapy is especially appropriate for people who have high levels of shame and self-criticism and who have difficulty in feeling warmth toward, and being kind to, themselves or others.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2009"/&gt; Such problems of shame and self-criticism are often rooted in a history of abuse, bullying, neglect, and/or lack of affection in the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaufman|1989}}; {{harvnb|Schore|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; CFT can help such people learn to feel more safeness and warmth in their interactions with others and themselves.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2009"/&gt;

Numerous methods are used in CFT to develop a person's compassion. For example, people undergoing CFT are taught to understand compassion from the third person, before transferring these thought processes to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|Irons|2013|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">{{Distinguish|The British Curry Awards}}
The '''Curry Awards''' is an award given to [[curry restaurants]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which have achieved "total excellence" in all departments by [[The Curry Club]] in association with its publication, The [[Good Curry Guide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.patchapman.co.uk/page/cobra-good-curry-guide# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410135959/http://www.patchapman.co.uk/page/cobra-good-curry-guide# |archive-date=2010-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Good Curry Guide Awards [[ceremony]] was established in May 1991 by [[Pat Chapman]] and was the first [[awards]] ceremony of any [[restaurant]] sector.

==History==
[[Pat Chapman]]’s first Good Curry Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aphrohead.com/Product.aspx?pid=11927505 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707151940/http://aphrohead.com/Product.aspx?pid=11927505 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1984. About 600 [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] restaurants were selected for entry (out of the 4,000 that existed then) and it carried little critical information. The next edition (1987) addressed this by having critical entries from [[correspondents]]. No one restaurant was rated higher than any other. In other words neither of these editions named the ‘Best in Class’; Chapman considered that since only the top percentage achieved entry, all entries were ‘Good Curry Guide Restaurants’. The publication attracted considerable media attention. However journalists and food writers from such publications as [[The Evening Standard]], [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[The Times]], and  [[BBC Good Food Magazine]] pressured Chapman to name the best.

Chapman asked his correspondents which restaurants could qualify into a TOP 30 category (which became TOP 100 in 1995), and which could be best regionally and best in UK. The results were duly published in the 1991 Guide and to launch it Chapman decided to hold an Awards Ceremony for the winners. Unlike today, it was a time when there were few such ceremonies.  Chapman modelled it on the [[Academy Award]], by commencing with a formal presention of a certificate to each winner in turn before a group of their peers and media, and following with a luncheon to emphasise the event’s social side.  On that first ceremony, there were eight winners, including Chutney Mary Indian restaurant [[London]], [[SW10]] as Best in UK, where the event was held.  
Media and public response to this was enormous.  So by the time the next GCG was due for publication, the TOP 30 was increased to the new TOP 100 category, and from that no less that 18 ‘Best in Category were to be awarded.
It was clear a bigger venue was needed, and one which was divorced from winning restaurants.  Chapman had been to an Asian wedding at a Heathrow Hotel where the catering was by Madhu’s.  Chapman suggested they did his catering and the [[Park Lane Hotel]] was chosen with a [[seating capacity]] of 330 seats.  It was the first time Madhu’s had catered for any event other than Asian weddings.  Chapman organised the entire event.  Of the 300 seats, 80 were taken by media.

==Present==
Between 18 and 20 Awards are given before an audience of restaurant personnel and their guests, sponsors, [[Mass media|media]], [[News media|press]] and others, totalling some 800. 
The luncheon is a major feature of the event. [[Catering]] for any event attended by others in the catering trade is a challenge; Chapman's Awards the more so.  Being an Indian Restaurant event, the restaurateurs are from all countries of the [[subcontinent]] so it is no mean task for the caterer to satisfy 800 of his [[international]] [[peer group|peers]], and one few caterers would attempt. 
 
The event is widely reported in the [[UK]] and in the [[subcontinent]], and it is [[televised]] by [[Sony Entertainment Television Asia]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.set-asia.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and is screened and repeated in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Mauritius]], the [[Middle East]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] to millions of viewers.

==The Achievement==
Of the 9,000 Indian restaurants in Britain, each of which are scrupulously examined, only seventy restaurants become shortlisted with four to each of the eighteen Award categories.  Of these only eighteen win the Awards.  That is one-in-500 or 0.2% (zero-point two) percentage of the total.

Defense wounds may be classified as active or passive. A victim of a knife attack, for example, would receive active defense wounds from grasping at the knife's blade, and passive defense wounds on the back of the hand if it was raised up to protect the face.&lt;ref name=miletich/&gt;&lt;ref name=tsokos/&gt;

      <comment>/* Dried blood spot testing for HIV infection */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6094">'''Dried blood spot testing''' (DBS) is a form of [[biosampling]] where blood samples are blotted and dried on filter paper. The dried samples can easily be shipped to an [[Analytical chemistry|analytical laboratory]] and analysed using various methods such as [[polymerase chain reaction|DNA amplification]] or [[HPLC]].

==History==
The concept that capillary blood, obtained from pricking the heel or finger and blotted onto filter paper, could be used to screen for metabolic diseases in large populations of neonates was introduced in Scotland by [[Robert Guthrie]] in 1963. Neonatal screening for [[phenylketonuria]] became nationwide in 1969-70. Since then, [[Guthrie test|Guthrie]] card samples have been collected routinely from infants in over 20 countries to screen for phenylketonuria and more recently for [[congenital hypothyroidism]], [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell disorders]] and HIV infection.  The limitations of sensitivity and specificity when screening such small volumes of blood restricted the use of dried blood spots for many years.  However, recent advances such as the production of [[monoclonal antibodies]], expression of synthetic proteins, and the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction have overcome many of these problems.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker SP, Cubitt WD |title=The use of the dried blood spot sample in epidemiological studies |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=52 |issue=9 |pages=633–9 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10655983 |pmc=501537 |url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10655983 |doi=10.1136/jcp.52.9.633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of blood testing is now available for use at home by consumers in the U.S.  Available blood tests include vitamin D, estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, TSH and lipids.  New York is the only state that prohibits home blood spot testing.

==Procedure==
Dried blood spot specimens are collected by applying a few drops of blood, drawn by lancet from the finger, heel or toe, onto specially manufactured absorbent filter paper. The blood is allowed to thoroughly saturate the paper and is air dried for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/driblood.htm |title=Information Sheet: Dried Blood |work=Guidelines for the Shipment of Dried Blood Spot Specimens |date=March 9, 1995 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Office of Health and Safety: Biosafety Branch }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specimens are stored in low gas-permeability plastic bags with [[desiccant]] added to reduce humidity, and may be kept at ambient temperature, even in tropical climates.

Once in the laboratory, technicians separate a small disc of saturated paper from the sheet using an automated or manual hole punch, dropping the disc into a flat bottomed microtitre plate.  The blood is eluted out in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% [[Polysorbate 80|Tween 80]] and 0.005% [[sodium azide]], overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. The resultant plate containing the eluates forms the "master" from which dilutions can be made for subsequent testing.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;

As an alternative to punching out a paper disc, recent automation solutions extract the sample by flushing an eluent through the filter without punching it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganz|first=N|author2=Singrasa, M |author3=Nicolas, L |author4=Gutierrez, M |author5=Dingemanse, J |author6=Döbelin, W |author7= Glinski, M |title=Development and validation of a fully automated online human dried blood spot analysis of bosentan and its metabolites using the Sample Card And Prep DBS System.|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|date=Feb 15, 2012|volume=885-886|pages=50–60|pmid=22227055|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023211007999|accessdate=11 November 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spark Holland|title=Flow Through Desorption (FTD)|url=http://www.sparkholland.com/technology/dbs-autosampler|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automation including the application of an internal standard prior extraction was developed by the Swiss company CAMAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DBS-MS 500|url=http://www.camag.com/en/dbs/what_is_dried_blood_spot_sampling.cfm|website=www.camag.com|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dried blood spot testing for HIV infection==
The technology holds promise for expanding diagnostic services to HIV-infected infants in resource-poor settings due to the samples' longer lifespan with reduced need for refrigeration and the less invasive nature of the test compared with other methods.  Unlike [[ELISA]] testing for HIV-antibodies in the blood, which may be transmitted to infants in pregnancy independently of the virus itself, dried blood spot testing can be used to detect genetic material of the actual virus, thereby avoiding the likelihood of a [[false positive]] result. 
Dried blood spot testing for HIV is not considered sensitive enough for diagnostic testing, but may be useful in estimating prevalence of HIV through surveillance. 
DBS specimens also pose less of a biohazard risk to handlers, and are easier to transport or store than liquid blood specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassol S, Salas T, Gill MJ |title=Stability of dried blood spot specimens for detection of human immunodeficiency virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=3039–42 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1452682 |pmc=270585 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1452682|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
The reason for stability of DNA, RNA or protein could be attributed to the fact that the biological material binds to the matrix of the filter paper and the process of drying excludes water which is an important factor necessary for protease or nuclease to act. Binding of the biological material also binds several inhibitors which may interfere with various nucleic acid amplification methods.

'''Family support''' is the support of families with a member with a [[disability]], which may include a child, an adult or even [[Financial gerontology|the parent in the family]]. In the United States, family support includes "unpaid" or "informal" support by neighbors, families and friends, "paid services" through specialist agencies providing an array of services termed "family support services", school or parent services for [[special needs]] such as [[respite care]], specialized child care or peer companions, or cash subsidies, tax deductions or other financial subsidies. '''Family support''' has been extended to different population groups in the US and worldwide. Family support services is currently a "community services and funding" stream in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the US which has had variable "application" based on disability group, administrating agency, and even, regulatory and [[legislative intent]].

==History==
The late 1970s and early 1980s are considered pivotal times for the development of respite and family support services, particularly through the demands and initiatives of parents of children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, S. &amp; Warren, R.

===Family models and services===
By the early 1980s, states such as [[New York (state)|New York]] had established family support programs and agencies, New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, and "model programs"&lt;ref name="Racino 1991"&gt;Racino, J. (1991). Organizations in community living: supporting people with disabilities. "The Journal of Mental Health Administration", 18(1), 51-59. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4655631601]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osburn, J., Caruso, G., &amp; Wolfensberger, W. (2011). The concept of 'best practice': A brief overview of its meanings, scope, uses, and shortcomings. "International Journal of Disability, Development and Education", 58(3), 213-222.&lt;/ref&gt; were identified nationally which served children and their families in the community (e.g., MacComb-Oakland, Michigan, Dane, LaCrosse, and Columbia counties, Wisconsin).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J., (1991). "Life in the community: Case studies supporting people with disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; New models of family support services were initiated, including professional models which involved both traditional respite for the families (i.e., opportunity for a break from the stress of caring for children with "special needs") and individual recreation opportunities in generic agencies/sites for the son or daughter (versus traditional in-home babysitting/child care).&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Racino, J. (1985a). Respite program models — Use of generic services and family subsidy. In: J. Racino, ''Respite services in New York State.'' (pp. 27-30). Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Maxwell School of International and Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional parents sought to have respite places available in group homes (e.g., friend of the home), to develop small group respite settings, to hold parent-to-parent support groups and meetings, to establish councils, and to have cash subsidies to meet the extra expenses of raising a "disabled child" (e.g., Exceptional Family Resources, [[Syracuse, New York in fiction|Syracuse, New York,]] 1985). By 1983, the State of New York had funded three major demonstration grants&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Racino, J. (1983). Respite grant awarded. ''Transitional Living Services News'', I(4), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Mario Cuomo|Governor Mario Cuomo]] and his wife Matilda held the first Family Support Conference in the Albany, New York.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Racino, J. (2000). ''Personnel preparation in disability and community life: Toward universal approaches to support.'' Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; New York State indeed by 1988 reported $16,536,000 in discrete family support initiatives&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Fujuira, G., Bachelder, L, &amp; Mitchell, D. (1990). New York State. "The state of the states in developmental disabilities". (p.336) Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; which did not include new agency family/cash subsidy demonstrations funded later in 1989-1990 in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1998). Innovations in family support: What are we learning? ''Journal of Child and Family Studies'', 7(4), 433-449.&lt;/ref&gt; or agency cash subsidies included as part of family support demonstration programs (e.g., recreation/respite in generic agencies).&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 461, Laws of New York, 1984 and New York State Mental Hygiene Law, Secs. 13.03, 13.04 in Bates, M. V. (1985, July). ''State family support/cash subsidies programs.'' Madison, WI: Wisconsin Council on Developmental Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt; In the public policy arena, respite was often explored in the context of child care for children with disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Lubeck, S. &amp; Garrett, P. (1988, Spring), "Child care 2000: Policy options for the future. "Social Policy", 31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P. (1999, June). "Child care for children with disabilities: Addressing the unique challenges." Battle Creek, Michigan: The Arc of Calhoun County.&lt;/ref&gt; and additional expenses of raising a child with a disability as especially critical in low income families.&lt;ref&gt;Lukemeyer, A., Meyers, M. &amp; Smeeding, T. (1997, July). Expensive children in poor families: Out-of-pocket expenditures for the care of disabled and chronically ill children and welfare reform. "Income Security Policy Paper No. 17."

In 1985, [[Syracuse University]]'s Center on [http://disabilitystudies.syr.edu/ Human Policy] was awarded a three-year Community Integration Project from the [[Federal Government]] (National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation) to work with states and communities in the US. The project, based on a national search conducted by the '''[http://www.wi-bpdd.org/ Wisconsin Developmental Disabilities Council]''', identified state cash subsidy programs in 21 states in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, M.V. (1985). ''Table of state family support/cash subsidy programs.'' Madison, Wisconsin: Wisconsin Developmental Disabilities Council.&lt;/ref&gt; The project, together with a new national Center on Community Integration, prepared information on family support for distribution, including a news bulletin on family support based on the project's research studies,&lt;ref&gt;Shoultz, B. (1987, September). ''Families for all children.''

==Basis in theories==
Family support is based in part on theories related to families, particularly [[family therapy|family systems theory]], ecological and support theories, [[community integration|community support theories]], life-span and life course theories, family psychosocial theories, family empowerment theory, and positivistic theories, such as the sociology of acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, R. &amp; Taylor, S.

These included: the Family Support Services of West Hawaii (including community and economic development activities), Family Support Services of Amarillo (including employee assistance and family therapy), Family Support Services of Southeastern Pennsylvania (e.g., child welfare and early intervention), City of Chicago Family and Support Services (e.g., domestic violence, senior services).(brief web review, 2011).

==Growth in the US==
By the 1990s, family support had gained in great popularity in the field of [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]], especially since 80-90% of children with disabilities continue to live with their families even today.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Fujuira, G. &amp; Braddock, D. 1999. Fiscal and demographic trends in mental retardation services: The emergence of the family. In: L. Rowitz (Ed.), ''Mental retardation in the year 2000.'' New York: Springer-Verlag. (Cited in: Stancliffe, R. &amp; Lakin, K.C. (2005). ''Costs and outcomes of community services for people with intellectual disabilities.'' Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the Human Services Research Institute determined that only 1.5% of the state budgets for developmental disabilities services was used to support these families as at 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, J., Covert, S., O'Connor, S., Agosta, J., &amp; Blaney, B. (1990). ''Family support services in the US: An end of decade status report.'' Cambridge, MA: Human Services Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, family support spending was reported to be $2,305,149,428 in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., &amp; Rizzolo, M. (2008). ''The state of the states in developmental disabilities.'' Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; yet, in FY 2006, it remained at only 5% of total intellectual and developmental disabilities spending of $43.84 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzolo, M., Hemp, R., Braddock, D., &amp; Schindler, A. (2009, April). Family support services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities: Recent national trends. "Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities", 47(2), 152-153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the costs of "family care" in intellectual and developmental disabilities have been studied, including direct financial costs met by families, indirect and opportunity costs, and indirect psychological costs.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D. &amp; Johnson, D. (2005). Costs of family care for individuals with developmental disabilities. In: R.J. Stancliffe &amp; K.C. Lakin, "Costs and outcomes of community services for people with intellectual disabilities". (pp.63-89). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In related fields, though, family support is still often considered to be "unpaid", "voluntary support" by family members, family-to-family training programs, [[self-help]] groups, often near forms of family interventions by professionals (e.g., behavioral training, clinical assessments, vocational training, family therapy, clinical community re-entry) in traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. &amp; Kay, T. (1991). "Head injury: A family matter". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and in adult mental health.&lt;ref&gt;LeGacy, S. (1978). "Training for parents of adults with mental illness: Series of sessions". Syracuse, NY: Transitional Living Services of Onondaga County, New York State, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; In children's mental health, family support and advocacy organizations are viewed to be increasing at the systems and policy levels, with the late 1980s formation of the Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health&lt;ref&gt;Koroloff, N., Friesen, B., Reilley, L., &amp; Rinkin, J. (1996). The role of family members in systems of care. In: B. Stroul (Ed.), "Children's mental health: Creating systems of care in a changing society". (pp. 409-426). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and the reformation of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a strong parent organization from the late 1970s (see, also Wikipedia). Family support services today are viewed as important for families with individuals with diverse disabilities (e.g., motor-neuron disease, AIDS, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, autism)with a greater emphasis on choice in support services (e.g., counseling, training and information, respite).&lt;ref&gt;e.g., O'Brien, M., Whitehead, B., Jack, B., &amp; Mitchell, D. (2012). The need for support services for family carers of people with motor neuron disease (MND): Views of current and former family caregivers: A qualitative study. "Disability and Rehabilitation", 34(3), 247-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a parent-professional field===
As family support would be considered a parent-professional field, the research studies documented diverse disabilities (e.g., [[epilepsy]], [[sickle cell anemia]], [[hearing/visual impairment]], [[spina bifida]], [[cancer]], [[learning disability]]), household incomes, level of assistance by daily living activities, behavioral and medical needs, insurance coverage, daily routines, impact of disability on the household, services for specialized needs, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Knoll, J. (1992). Being a family: The experience of raising a child with a disability or chronic illness. In: V.J. Bradley, J. Knoll, &amp; J.M. Agosta, ''Emerging issues in family support.'' (pp.9-56). Washington, DC: American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; The field then was challenged in the 1990s to broaden approaches to families, including gendered caring,&lt;ref&gt;Traustadottir, R.

Organizations in community living: Supporting people with disabilities. ''Journal of Mental Health Administration'', 18(1): 51-59.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, governmental policy today appears to continue to encourage adults with disabilities to live at home with parents or caregivers (2011); thus, family support funds are usually designated for families with children and adults living at home, including in families with aging parents. However, family supports are also integral to adoptive and foster families and may take the form of in-home aides or home assistance, provision of equipment, respite and home adaptations, and shared care options between birth and foster parents/families.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P. (1989, November). ''Family Supports in Montana: Region III: Special Training for Exceptional People (STEP)''.

===As a caregiving model===
In line with the parent-professional partnerships of the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Oregon Research Institute]] published a book on ''Support for caregiving families''.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;G. Singer &amp; L. Irvin (Eds.), ''Support for caregiving families: Enabling positive adaptation to disability.'' Baltimore, MD: Paul H.

London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In states like New York and Connecticut, this resulted in tension between "institutional" and "community parents" vying for limited public funds, and between providers of services for funding (e.g., state institutions and private, non-profit community sectors). However, as states began to close institutions, funding was often available primarily to relocate those individuals living in institutional care or those at risk of [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]] (e.g., home and community-based [[Medicaid]] waiver, HCBS).&lt;ref&gt;Research and Training Center on Community Integration.

==New and traditional population groups==
In the 2000s, "new population groups" in family support, as part of family support theories in the US and worldwide, included:
* multicultural and transnational families,
* families which include a member who is gay, lesbian, transsexual or bisexual,
* youth with disabilities,
* aging population in the US, 
* youth in mental health, 
* families with a member with a brain injury, and
* parents with intellectual and other disabilities, among others.

===Adolescent mothers and single parent families===
Traditional groups known to be at-risk of adolescent mothers were sometimes involved in social support and adolescent theories, as part of adolescent pregnancies and mothering research.&lt;ref&gt;Secco, M.L. &amp; Moffatt, M.E.K. (1994). A review of social support theories and instruments in adolescent mothering research. ''Journal of Adolescent Health'', 15: 517-527.&lt;/ref&gt; At-risk families in intellectual disabilities also may be single mothers and early recommendations were for additional support options such as boarding nearby to family, modifying apartment programs to allow children, and increasing family support services in private homes. Critical are personal and family values, empowerment of families and home visitors, parent-child activities, and cluster groups (e.g., neighborhood improvement, natural child birth groups, toddler play groups, team group support), among others (e.g., Cochran, et al., 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, M., Dean, C., Dill, M.F., &amp; Woolever, F. (1984). ''Empowering Families: Home Visiting and Building Clusters''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, Family Matters Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multicultural and transnational families===
In addition, the needs of multicultural families, based on changing US demographics, also resulted in greater attention to the major minority groups, including African-Americans, Asian Americans, native Indian Americans, and Hispanic/Latino Americans.&lt;ref&gt;McCallion, P. &amp; Grant-Griffin, L.

===Youth with disabilities===
Youth with disabilities became an emerging "age group"&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, E. (1975). Parent-teen panel. "Adolescents in Development, I and II". Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, College of Human Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1980s and 1990s as family approaches (often-parent-based) competed with approaches based more on the desires of youth with disabilities. For example, personal assistance approaches based on diverse lifestyles and hiring of aides by service users became a popular way of thinking about services.&lt;ref&gt;Litvak, S. &amp; Racino, J.

"Attending to America: Personal assistance for independent living". Berkeley, CA: World Institute on Disability, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Public Policy and Independent Living.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, major federal initiatives in transition planning in the US resulted in a variety of approaches to moving from child-centered to adult services, based in part, upon theories of adolescent development.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, R., Garell, D., Hodgman, C., Jorrissen, T., Okinow, N., Orr, D., and Slap, G.

===Aging population===
{{main|Population ageing}}
The changing demographics of aging in the US have been well documented in diverse fields&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, J. (2001). Age: 2000 (Census 2000 Brief). Washington, DC: US Census Bureau, C2KBR/01/12. In: Kutza, E. (2005). The intersection of economics and family status in late life: Implications for the future. In: Caputo, R., Challenges of Aging on US families. (pp. 9-26). Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with its public facing the need to revamp the nation's Social Security system.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, J., Bethell, T., Reno., V. &amp; Veghte, B. (2010, November). Strengthening the social security system in the long run. ''Social Security Brief'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter can no longer, as developed in the Depression Era, financially support the growing aging population which outstrips the younger generation paying into the system. For example, "between 2010 and 2030, the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 76%, while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to increase by 8%".&lt;ref&gt;Nuschler, D. (2010, September). ''Social security reform: Current issue and legislation.'' Washington, DC: Congressional Research Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The elder population also is living longer, expected to have a marked increase in the people living over the age of 80,&lt;ref&gt;US Bureau of the Census. (1998, December) International database [on-line]. Available https://www.census.gov/cgi/ipc/idbsum. In: Ansello, E.F. &amp; Janicki, M. (2000). The aging of nations: Impact on the community, the family, and the individual. (pp. 3-18). In: M. P. Janicki &amp; E.F. Ansello, ''Community supports for aging adults with lifelong disabilities.'' Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; involving an increase in "disabilities" such as dementia (e.g., Public Broadcasting, 2011), effecting social security disability benefits,&lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. (2012, March). Disability program reform principles. ''Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities Social Security Task Force''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the discovery of older adults with lifelong disabilities in "community-dwelling" two generation families.&lt;ref&gt;Ansello, E.F. &amp; Janicki, M.P.

===Youth, children and adults in mental health===
Instead of family support in the field of mental health, parent organizations have formed state and national chapters independent of their children (e.g., National Alliance for the Mentally Ill).&lt;ref&gt;Carling, P.J. (1995). "Return to the community: Building Support Services for People with Psychiatric Disabilities". NY, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, community agencies often have developed parent education programs (which remains as a government-funded program in the US), and family therapists and counselors (often in private practice) tend to work with the whole family. Personal assistance and independent living approaches tend to begin with the desires and wishes of the youth or adult, and less often, the children; these approaches in mental health still remain relatively uncommon though psychosocial approaches have some similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Psychiatric survivors, the international self help movement, and personal assistance services. "Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All". London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While housing and support and employment supports have been transferred across fields, greater reluctance exists in the field of mental health for "family support" (often starting with parental concerns) who often bill the parents as secondary service recipients.

In psychiatric rehabilitation, "families are a major resource impacting rehabilitation outcome" (families as allies) with 50-60% returning home from hospitals in US (Anthony, et al., 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;185). Extended families are viewed as critical worldwide, and many approaches are categorized as "family management" (e.g., information, treatments, family management), family interventions or "psychoeducational" (Ibid, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M. &amp; Gagne, C. (2002). "Psychiatric Rehabilitation". Boston, MA: Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; However, leading national research centers in the US examined state service systems and recommended prevention and family support for children in mental health and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, R. M. (1994). Restructuring of systems to emphasize prevention and family support. ''Journal of Clinical Child Psychology'', Volume 23 (Suppl.): 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Such "ecologically-grounded models" which are expected to improve or "mediate child and parent outcomes" have often been the first targeted in difficult economic times; the "full fledged family support movement" of community-based agencies was reported in 1992 as "struggling to operationalize a new set of services and a new way of doing business with families".&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, H.B. &amp; Greene, J. C. (1992, Feb &amp; May). An empowerment partnership for family support and education programs and evaluations. ''Family Science Review'', 5(1&amp;2): 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parents with intellectual disabilities===
By the 2000s, internationally, the support of parents who themselves have intellectual disabilities moved to new prominence with extensive, multi-decade research&lt;ref&gt;Llewllyn, G., Traustadottir, R., McConnell, D., Sigurjonsdottir, H.B. (2010). Parent with intellectual disabilities: Past, present and future. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, T., &amp; Booth, W. (1996). Supported parenting for people with learning difficulties: Lessons from Wisconsin. "Representing Children", 9,2, 99-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, T. &amp; Booth, W., (2000, February). Against the odds: Growing up with parents who have learning difficulties. "Mental Retardation", 38(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; after initial programs and studies in the US as early as the late 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, D. (1991). We began to listen: Training Towards Self Reliance, CA. In; S.Taylor, R. Bogdan &amp; J. Racino, "Life in the community: Case studies of organizations supporting people with disabilities". (pp. 129-138). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heighway, S.M., Kidd-Webster, S. &amp; Snodgrass, P. (1998, November/ December). Supporting parents with mental retardation.

(1998, April). "Parenting with a Disability", 6(1), 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Families with a member with a brain injury===
In 2015, partially as a result of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, veterans are returning home with head and brain injuries, and then return from hospital and rehabilitation to spouse and family. Common may be a referral to a support group for the spouse or caregiver who may experience "caregiver stress" and "burden of care",&lt;ref&gt;Chwalisz, K. (1992). Perceived stress and caregiver burden after brain injury: A theoretical integration. ''Rehabilitation Psychology'', 37(3): 189-203.&lt;/ref&gt; the result of inadequate community services in homes and for families. In addition, brain or head injuries can be caused by vehicular accidents, sports injuries, falls or accidents, war and terrorism, and related medical conditions (e.g., brain tumor, stroke). Family support in these fields often refers to support groups or direct support from the family and neighbors to the individual with the brain injury, or the rehabilitation or hospital program as the family support.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. &amp; Kay, T. (1991). ''Head Injury: A Family Matter''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US policy goals==
In the National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Lakin, K.C. &amp; Turnbull, A. (2005). ''National goals and research for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.'' Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and the American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; support of families and family life across the lifespan was considered one of the major goals of the extensive work group of leaders in that field (e.g., Ann Turnbull, Rud Turnbull, John Agosta, Elizabeth Erwin, Glenn Fujuira, George Singer, and Leslie Sodak, among others).&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A., Turnbull, R., Agosta, J., Erwin, E., Fujuira, G., Singer, G., &amp; Sodak, L. et al. (2005). Support of families and family life across the lifespan. In: K.C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull (Eds.), ''National goals and research for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.'' (pp. 217-256). Washington, DC: The Arc and the American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching goal was: To support the caregiving efforts and enhance the quality of life of all families so that families will remain the core unit of American society. The five subgoals include:
*Goal A: To ensure family-professional partnerships in research, policy-making, and the planning and delivery of supports and services so that families control their own destinies with due regard to the autonomy of adult family members with disabilities to control their own lives.
*Goal B: To ensure that families fully participate in communities of their choice through comprehensive, inclusive, neighborhood-based, and culturally responsive supports and services.
*Goal C: To ensure that services and supports for all families are available, accessible, appropriate, affordable and accountable.
*Goal D: To ensure that sufficient public and private funding will be available to implement these goals and that all families will participate in directing the use of public funds authorized and appropriated for their benefits.
*Goal E: To ensure that families and professionals have full access to state-of-the-art knowledge and best practices and that they will collaborate in using knowledge and practices. (p.&amp;nbsp;221).
Such efforts are critical as the US has often been criticized for having a lack of a coherent family policy for all its people (e.g., health care, housing, employment, leisure, community and economic development).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). The role of family case study research in family policy: Local agency delivery systems. In: J.

==International==
Family support is indeed an international initiative with 1994 the International Year of the Family as proclaimed by the [[United Nations]]. Helle Mittler, from Great Britain, reported on the TASK Force of the [[Family Movement#The Parent.2FFamily Arm of the Disability Movement|International League of Societies for Persons with Mental Handicap]] which highlighted Face to Face in the United Kingdom, Young [[Muslim]] Women's Association Comprehensive Programme in Jordan, Service Brokerage in Canada, Swasahaya Sumachaya, Mysore, and Karnataka Parents' Association in India, Market Place Support Group in Côte d'Ivoire, Africa, Brothers and Sisters Groups in Nicaragua and India, Fathers' group in the United Kingdom, and Parents and Professionals Learning Together in Bangladesh and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Mittler, H. (1994). International initiatives in support of families with a member with learning disabilities. (pp. 15-31). In: P. Mittler &amp; H. Mittler, ''Innovations in family support for people with learning disabilities.'' Lancashire, England: Lisieux Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the international community is on individual and family life quality,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Rillotta, F., Kirby, N., Shearer, J. &amp; Nettlebeck, T. (2012). 
Family quality of life of Australian families with a member with an intellectual or developmental disability.

}}

'''''Fasciola gigantica''''' is a parasitic [[flatworm]] of the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Trematoda]], which causes tropical [[fascioliasis]]. It is regarded as one of the most important single [[platyhelminth]] [[infections]] of [[ruminants]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. Estimates of [[infection]] rates are as high as 80-100% in some{{which|date=July 2016}} countries. The infection is commonly called fasciolosis.

The prevalence of ''F. gigantica'' often overlaps with that of ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'', and the two species are so closely related in terms of [[genetics]], behaviour, and [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures that it is notoriously difficult to distinguish them.&lt;ref name=ita&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Itagaki T, Ichinomiya M, Fukuda K, Fusyuku S, Carmona C |title= Hybridization experiments indicate incomplete reproductive isolating mechanism between ''Fasciola hepatica'' and ''Fasciola gigantica'' |url= |journal= Parasitology |volume=138 |issue= 10| pages=1278–1284 |year=2011 |pmid= 21767436 |doi= 10.1017/S0031182011000965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, sophisticated molecular techniques are required to correctly identify and diagnose the infection.&lt;ref name=rok&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rokni MB, Mirhendi H, Mizani A, Mohebali M, Sharbatkhori M, Kia EB, Abdoli H, Izadi S |title= Identification and differentiation of ''Fasciola hepatica'' and ''Fasciola gigantica'' using a simple PCR-restriction enzyme method| journal= [[Experimental Parasitology]] |volume=124 |issue= 2| pages=209–213 |year=2010 |pmid= 19769969|doi= 10.1016/j.exppara.2009.09.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
''Fasciola gigantica'' causes outbreaks in tropical areas of southern Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. The geographical distribution of ''F. gigantica'' overlaps with ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'' in many African and Asian countries and sometimes in the same country, although in such cases the ecological requirement of the flukes and their snail host are distinct. Infection is most prevalent in regions with intensive sheep and cattle production. In Egypt ''F. gigantica'' has existed in domestic animals since the times of the [[pharaoh]]s.&lt;ref name="Soliman 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soliman|first1=MF|title=Epidemiological review of human and animal fascioliasis in Egypt|journal=[[Journal of Infection in Developing Countries]]|date=1 June 2008|volume=2|issue=3|pages=182–9|doi=10.3855/jidc.260|pmid=19738348}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
The life cycle of ''Fasciola gigantica'' is as follows: eggs (transported with feces) → eggs hatch → [[miracidium]] → miracidium infect snail intermediate host → ([[parthenogenesis]] in 24 hours) [[Trematode lifecycle stages|sporocyst]] → [[Trematode lifecycle stages|redia]] → daughter redia → cercaria → (gets outside the snail) → [[metacercaria]] → infection of the host → adult stage produces eggs. 
&lt;!-- [[File:Life-cycle-of-fasciola-gigantica.png|center|thumb|600px|Life cycle]] --&gt;

===Intermediate hosts===
As with other trematodes, ''Fasciola'' develop in a [[mollusca]]n [[intermediate host]]. Species of the [[freshwater snail]]s from the family [[Lymnaeidae]] are well known for their role as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of ''Fasciola gigantica''; however, throughout the years an increasing number of other molluscan intermediate hosts of ''F. gigantica'' have been reported.&lt;ref name="Soliman 2008"/&gt; It has been reported that the Lymnaeid intermediate hosts of ''F. gigantica'' are distinguishable from those of ''F. hepatica'', both morphologically and as to habitat requirement. The species of ''Fasciola'' can become adapted to new intermediate hosts under certain conditions at least based on laboratory trials. The most important [[intermediate host]] for ''F. gigantica'' is ''[[Radix auricularia]]''. However, other species are also known to harbour the fluke including ''[[Lymnaea rufescens]]'' and ''[[Lymnaea acuminata]]'' in the [[Indian Subcontinent]]; ''[[Radix rubiginosa]]'' and ''[[Radix natalensis]]'' in [[Malaysia]] and in Africa respectively; and the synonymous ''[[Lymnaea cailliaudi]]'' in east Africa. Other snails also serve as natural or experimental intermediate such as ''[[Austropeplea ollula]]'', ''[[Austropeplea viridis]]'', ''[[Radix peregra]]'', ''[[Radix luteola]]'', ''[[Pseudosuccinea columella]]'' and ''[[Galba truncatula]]''.&lt;ref name="Correa 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Correa AC, Escobar JS, Durand P, Renaud F, David P, Jarne P, Pointier JP, Hurtrez-Boussès S |title= Bridging gaps in the molecular phylogeny of the Lymnaeidae (Gastropoda: Pulmonata), vectors of Fascioliasis|url= |journal= BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=10 |issue= | pages=381 |year=2010|pmid= 21143890 |pmc= 3013105|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dar YD, Rondelaud D, Dreyfuss G |title= Update of fasciolosis-transmitting snails in Egypt (review and comment)|url= |journal= Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology|volume=35 |issue= 2| pages=477–490 |year=2005 |pmid= 16083061|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian ''[[Lymnaea tomentosa]]'' (host of ''F. hepatica'') was shown to be receptive to miracidia of ''F. gigantica'' from East Africa, Malaysia and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Soliman 2008"/&gt;

===Definitive hosts===
''Fasciola gigantica'' is a causative agents (together with ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'') of fascioliasis in [[ruminants]] and in humans worldwide.&lt;ref name="Soliman 2008"/&gt;

The [[parasite]] infects cattle and buffalo and can also be seen regionally in goats, sheep, and donkeys.

==Infection and pathogenicity==
{{main|Fasciolosis}}
Infection with ''[[Fasciola]]'' spp. occurs when [[metacercariae]] are accidentally ingested on raw vegetation. The metacercariae exist in the [[small intestine]], and move through the intestinal wall and [[peritoneal cavity]] to the [[liver]] where adults mature in the [[biliary duct]]s of the liver. Eggs are passed through the bile ducts into the intestine where they are then passed in the feces.&lt;ref name="Soliman 2008"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Despite the importance to differentiate between the infection by either fasciolid species, due to their distinct epidemiological, pathological and control characteristics, there is, unfortunately, [[coprology|coprological]] (excretion-related) or [[immunological]] diagnosis are difficult. Especially in humans, specific detection by clinical, pathological, coprological or immunological methods are unreliable. Molecular assays are the only promising tools, such as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]-[[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]] assay,&lt;ref name=rok/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Rahimy HH, Mahgoub AM, El-Gebaly NS, Mousa WM, Antably AS |title= Molecular, biochemical, and morphometric characterization of ''Fasciola'' species potentially causing zoonotic disease in Egypt|url= |journal= Parasitology Research|volume=111 |issue= 3| pages=1103–111 |year=2012|pmid= 22638917|doi= 10.1007/s00436-012-2938-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the very rapid [[loop-mediated isothermal amplification]] (LAMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ai L, Li C, Elsheikha HM, Hong SJ, Chen JX, Chen SH, Li X, Cai XQ, Chen MX, Zhu XQ |title= Rapid identification and differentiation of ''Fasciola hepatica'' and ''Fasciola gigantica'' by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay|url= |journal= Veterinary Parasitology |volume=174 |issue= 3–4| pages=228–233 |year=2010|pmid= 20933335|doi= 10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

[[Triclabendazole]] is the drug of choice in fasciolosis as it is highly effective against both mature and immature flukes.

'''''Fasciola hepatica''''', also known as the ''' common liver fluke''' or '''sheep liver fluke''', is a [[parasitism|parasitic]] trematode (fluke or [[flatworm]], a type of [[helminth]]) of the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Trematoda]], [[phylum]] [[Platyhelminthes]]. It infects the livers of various [[mammal]]s, including humans. The disease caused by the [[fluke (flatworm)|fluke]] is called [[fasciolosis]] or fascioliasis, which is a type of [[helminthiasis]] and has been classified as a [[neglected tropical disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neglected Tropical Diseases|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/ntd/diseases/index.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fasciolosis]] is currently classified as a plant/food-borne [[trematode]] infection, often acquired through eating the parasite's [[Trematode life cycle stages|metacercariae]] encysted on plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mas-Coma | first1 = S | last2 = Bargues | first2 = MD | last3 = Valero | first3 = MA  | date = 2005 | title = Fascioliasis and other plant-borne trematode zoonoses | url = | journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 1255–1278 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpara.2005.07.010 | pmid=16150452}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''F. hepatica'', which is distributed worldwide, has been known as an important parasite of sheep and cattle for decades and causes significant economic losses in these livestock species, up to £23 million in the UK alone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/liver-fluke-control-in-cattle.aspx|title=NADIS - National Animal Disease Information Service -|website=www.nadis.org.uk|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its relatively large size and economic importance, it has been the subject of many scientific investigations and may be the best-known of any trematode species. ''F. hepatica's'' closest relative is ''[[Fasciola gigantica]]''. These two [[Fluke (flatworm)|flukes]] are sister species; they share many [[Morphology (biology)|morphological features]] and can mate with each other.&lt;ref name="Mas‐ComaValero2009"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mas‐Coma|first1=Santiago|last2=Valero|first2=María Adela|last3=Bargues|first3=María Dolores|title=Chapter 2 Fasciola, Lymnaeids and Human Fascioliasis, with a Global Overview on Disease Transmission, Epidemiology, Evolutionary Genetics, Molecular Epidemiology and Control|volume=69|year=2009|pages=41–146|issn=0065-308X|doi=10.1016/S0065-308X(09)69002-3|pmid=19622408|journal=Advances in Parasitology|isbn=9780123747952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle ==

[[File:Fasciola LifeCycle 2013.png|thumb|The lifecycle of ''Fasciola hepatica'']]

''Fasciola hepatica'' occurs in the liver of a [[definitive host]] and its lifecycle is indirect. Definitive hosts of the fluke are [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[African Buffalo|buffalo]]es. Wild [[ruminant]]s and other mammals, including humans, can act as definitive hosts as well.&lt;ref name="torgerson_claxton"&gt;{{cite book |last= Torgerson |first=P |author2= Claxton JR |chapter=Epidemiology and Control |editor=Dalton, JP |title=Fasciolosis |publisher=CABI Pub |location=Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=1999 |pages=113–149 |isbn=978-0-85199-260-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The life cycle of ''F. hepatica'' goes through the [[intermediate host]] and several environmental larval stages.&lt;ref name="andrews"&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrews |first=JS |chapter= Life cycle of Fasciola hepatica |editor=Dalton, JP |title=Fasciolosis |publisher=CABI Pub |location=Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=1999 |pages=1–30 |isbn=978-0-85199-260-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate hosts of ''F. hepatica'' are air-breathing freshwater snails from the family [[Lymnaeidae]]. Although several lymnaeid species susceptible to ''F. hepatica'' have been described, the parasite develops only in one or two major species on each continent. ''[[Galba truncatula]]'' is the main snail host in Europe, partly in Asia, Africa, and South America. ''[[Lymnaea viatrix|Lymnaea viator]]'', ''[[Lymnaea neotropica|L. neotropica]]'', ''[[Pseudosuccinea columella]]'', and ''[[Lymnaea cubensis|L. cubensis]]'' are most common intermediate hosts in Central and South America.&lt;ref name="Mas‐ComaValero2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torgerson_claxton" /&gt; Several other lymnaeid snails may be naturally or experimentally infected with ''F. hepatica'', but their role in transmission of the fluke is low.&lt;ref name="Mas‐ComaValero2009" /&gt; The list of lymnaeid snails that may serve as natural or experimental intermediate hosts of ''F. hepatica'' include:&lt;ref name="Correa 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Correa | first1 = C.

The [[metacercariae]] are released from the [[freshwater snail]] as [[cercariae]], and form cysts on various surfaces including [[Aquatic plant|aquatic vegetation]]. The [[mammal]]ian host then eats this vegetation and can become infected. Humans can often acquire these infections through eating freshwater [[plants]] such as [[watercress]]. Inside the [[duodenum]] of the [[mammal]]ian host, the [[metacercariae]] are released from within their cysts. From the [[duodenum]], they burrow through the lining of the [[intestine]] and into the [[peritoneal cavity]]. They then migrate through the [[intestine]]s and [[liver]], and into the [[bile ducts]]. Inside the [[bile ducts]], they develop into an adult [[Trematoda|fluke]].&lt;ref name="CDCfascioliasis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parasites – Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection)|url= https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/fasciola/biology.html |website=cdc.gov|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the time taken for ''F. hepatica'' to mature from [[metacercariae]] into an adult [[Trematoda|fluke]] is roughly 3 to 4 months. The adult [[Trematoda|flukes]] can then produce up to 25,000 eggs per [[Trematoda|fluke]] per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valero | first1 = MA | last2 = Panova | first2 = M | last3 = Comes | first3 = AM  | last4 = Fons | first4 = R | last5 = Mas-Coma | first5 = S  | date = 2002 | title = Patterns in size and shedding of Fasciola hepatica eggs by naturally and experimentally infected murid rodents | url = | journal = Journal of Parasitology | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 308–313 | doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2002)088[0308:PISASO]2.0.CO;2| hdl = 10550/16781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eggs are passed out via [[Feces|stools]] and into freshwater. Once in freshwater, the eggs become [[embryonated]], allowing them to hatch as [[miracidia]], which then find a suitable intermediate snail host of the [[Lymnaeidae]] family. Inside this snail, the [[miracidia]] develop into [[Trematode lifecycle stages|sporocysts]], then to [[Trematode life cycle stages|rediae]], then to [[cercariae]]. The [[cercariae]] are released from the snail to form [[metacercariae]] and the life cycle begins again.&lt;ref name="CDCfascioliasis"/&gt;

== Morphology and anatomy ==
''Fasciola hepatica'' is one of the largest [[fluke (flatworm)|fluke]]s of the world, reaching a length of 30&amp;nbsp;mm and a width of 13&amp;nbsp;mm (''[[Fasciola gigantica]]'', though, is even bigger and can reach up to 75&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/fasciola/biology.html|title=CDC - Fasciola - Biology|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is leaf-shaped, pointed at the back (posteriorly), and wide in the front (anteriorly). The [[Sucker (parasitic worm anatomy)|oral sucker]] is small but powerful and is located at the end of a cone-shape projection at the anterior end. The [[Acetabulum (morphology)|acetabulum]] is a larger sucker than the oral sucker and is located at the anterior end.&lt;ref name="CDCfascioliasis"/&gt;

===Tegument===
The outer surface of the [[fluke (flatworm)|fluke]] is called the [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]]. This is composed of [[scleroprotein]], and its primary function is to protect the [[fluke (flatworm)|fluke]] from the destructive [[Human digestive system|digestive system]] of the host.&lt;ref name="BilsMartin1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bils|first1=R.

Initially, these spines are single-pointed, then, just prior to the fluke entering the [[bile ducts]], they become multipointed. At the anterior end of the [[fluke (flatworm)|fluke]], the spines have between 10 and 15 points, whereas at the posterior end, they have up to 30 points.&lt;ref name="Bennett1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Clive E.|title=Scanning Electron Microscopy of ''Fasciola hepatica'' L. during Growth and Maturation in the Mouse|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=61|issue=5|year=1975|pages=892–8|issn=0022-3395|doi=10.2307/3279230|pmid=1185431|jstor=3279230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]] is a [[syncytium|syncytial epithelium]]. This means it is made from the fusion of many cells, each containing one [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], to produce a [[multinucleated cell]] membrane. In the case of ''F. hepatica'',  no [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] are in the outer cytoplasm between the basal and apical membranes. Thus, this region is referred to as anucleate. Instead, the nuclei are found in the cell bodies, also known as tegumental cells, these connect to the outer cytoplasm via thin [[cytoplasm|cytoplasmic strands]]. The tegumental cells contain the usual cytoplasmic organelles ([[mitochondria]], [[Golgi bodies]], and [[endoplasmic reticulum]]).&lt;ref name="Southgate2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Southgate|first1=V. R.|title=Observations on the epidermis of the miracidium and on the formation of the tegument of the sporocyst of Fasciola hepatica|journal=Parasitology|volume=61|issue=2|year=2009|pages=177–90|issn=0031-1820|doi=10.1017/S0031182000040993|pmid=5483910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tegument plays a key role in the fluke’s infection of the host. Studies have shown that certain parts of the tegument (in this case, the [[antigen]] named Teg) can actually suppress the [[Immune system|immune response]] of the [[mammal]]ian host. This means that the fluke is able to weaken the [[Immune system|immune response]], and increase its chances of a successful infection. A successful infection is needed for the fluke to have enough time to develop into an adult and continue its lifecycle.&lt;ref name="HamiltonDowling2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=C.

===Digestive system===
[[File:Image from page 174 of "Introduction to zoology; a guide to the study of animals, for the use of secondary schools;" (1900) (14598306110).jpg|thumb|Image showing the location of the mouth, labelled ''mo'', and the anterior sucker, as labelled ''sckr'']]

The alimentary canal of ''F. hepatica'' has a single mouth which leads into the [[Gastrovascular cavity|blind gut]]; it has no [[anus]]. The mouth is located within the anterior [[Sucker (zoology)|sucker]] on the [[ventral side]] of the fluke. This mouth leads to the [[pharynx]], which is then followed by a narrow [[oesophagus]]. The oesophagus, which is lined with a thin layer of [[epithelial cells]], then opens up into the [[large intestine]]. As  no anus is present, the intestine branches, with each branch ending blindly near the posterior end of the body.&lt;ref name="Kotpal2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotpal|first=RL|date=2012 |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Invertebrates |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JuuWlZ7Llb8C&amp;dq=fasciola+hepatica+digestive+system |location=New Delhi |publisher=Rastogi Publications |page=338 |isbn=978-81-7133-903-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flukes migrate into smaller [[capillaries]] and [[bile ducts]] when feeding within the host. They use their mouth [[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] to pull off and suck up food, [[bile]], [[lymph]], and tissue pieces from the walls of the bile ducts.&lt;ref name="Kotpal2012"/&gt; ''F. hepatica'' relies on [[extracellular digestion]] which occurs within the [[intestine]] of the host. The waste materials are [[defecation|egested]] through the mouth. The nonwaste matter is [[adsorption|adsorbed]] back in through the tegument and the general surface of the fluke. The tegument facilitates this adsorption by containing many small folds to increase the surface area.&lt;ref name="Kotpal2012"/&gt;

===Respiratory system===
[[File:Animal biology (1938) (17576890133).jpg|thumb|Diagram of the main organ systems of ''F. hepatica'' throughout the progressive life stages of the fluke (1938). ''A'' - egg; ''B'' - miracidium; ''C'' - sporocyst; ''D'' - rediae, ''E'' - immature cercaria, ''F'' - cercaria, ''G'' - encysted stage, ''H'' - adult fluke (nervous and reproductive systems omitted)]]
''F. hepatica'' has no [[respiratory organs]]: the adult flukes respire [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobically]] (without oxygen). [[Glycogen]] taken from within the host is broken down by [[glycolysis]] to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and [[fatty acids]]. This process provides the fluke with energy.&lt;ref name="Bhatnagar2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhatnagar|first1=MC|last2=Bansal|first2=G|date=2009 |title=Non-Chordata |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FPhfjyfr2OcC&amp;dq=fasciola+hepatica+respiratory+system|location=Delhi |publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|pages=153–154 |isbn=978-81-8283-036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the free-living [[miracidia]] stages of the parasite generally develop within oxygen-rich environments. The free-living stages of the parasite are thought to respire [[aerobic respiration|aerobically]], to gain the most energy from their environment.&lt;ref name="BoyunagaSchmitz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyunaga|first1=H.|last2=Schmitz|first2=M.G.J.|last3=Brouwers|first3=J.F.H.M.|last4=Van Hellemond|first4=J.J.|last5=Tielens|first5=A.G.M.|title=Fasciola hepatica miracidia are dependent on respiration and endogenous glycogen degradation for their energy generation|journal=Parasitology|volume=122|issue=2|year=2002|issn=0031-1820|doi=10.1017/S0031182001007211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excretory system===
''F. hepatica's'' [[excretory system]] contains a network of [[tubule]]s surrounding one main [[excretory system|excretory canal]]. This canal leads to the [[excretory system|excretory pore]] at the posterior end of the fluke. This main canal branches into four sections within the dorsal and ventral regions of the body. The role of ''F. hepatica's'' excretory system is [[excretion]] and [[osmoregulation]].&lt;ref name="Bhatnagar2008"/&gt; Each tubule within the [[excretory system]] is connected to a [[flame cell]], otherwise known as [[nephridium|protonephridia]]. These cells are modified [[parenchyme]] cells. In ''F. hepatica'', their role is to perform excretion, but more importantly, osmoregulatory functions. [[Flame cell]]s are therefore primarily used to remove excess water.&lt;ref name="Bhatnagar2008"/&gt;

===Nervous system and sensory organs===
The nerve system of ''F. hepatica'' consists of a pair of [[Ganglion|nerve ganglia]], each one is located on either side of the [[oesophagus]]. Around the oesophagus is a [[Nerve net|nerve ring]], which connects the two [[Ganglion|nerve ganglia]] together. The nerves stem from this ring, reaching  the posterior end of the body. At the posterior end, one pair of nerves becomes thicker than the others; these are known as the lateral nerve cords. From these lateral nerve cords, the other nerves branch. Sensory organs are absent from ''F. hepatica''.&lt;ref name="Puranik2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Puranik|first1=P|last2=Bhate|first2=A|date=2007 |title=Animal Forms And Functions: Invertebrata |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kdq6RyyVE0C&amp;dq=fasciola+hepatica+nervous+system|location=New Delhi |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=172–175 |isbn=978-81-7625-791-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MandalFB2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandal|first=P|last2=F.B.|date =2012 |title=Invertebrate Zoology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kwa6_L6vlpkC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=fasciola+hepatica+nervous+system#v=onepage&amp;q=fasciola%20hepatica%20nervous%20system&amp;f=false |location=Delhi |publisher=PHI Learning|isbn=978-81-203-4615-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive system===
''F. hepatica'' adult flukes are [[hermaphrodite]]; each contains both male and female [[reproductive organs]]. The male and female reproductive organs open up into the same chamber within the body, which is called the [[genital]] atrium. The genital atrium is an [[ectoderm]]al sac which opens up to the outside of the fluke via a [[Gonopore|genital pore]].&lt;ref name="Puranik2007"/&gt; The [[testes]] are formed of two branched tubules, these are located in the middle and posterior regions of the body. From the [[epithelium]] lining of the tubules, [[sperm]] is produced. The sperm then passes into the [[vas deferens]] and then into the [[seminal vesicle]]. From the [[seminal vesicle]] projects the [[ejaculatory duct]], and this opens into the genital atrium, and many [[prostate]] glands surround this opening.&lt;ref name="Puranik2007"/&gt; The right side of the anterior [[testis]] has a branched, tubular [[ovary]]. From here, a short [[oviduct]] passes to the [[vitelline duct]]. This duct connects, via a junction, the ovaries, the [[uterus]], and the yolk reservoir. From this junction, the uterus opens into the [[genital]] atrium; this opening is surrounded by [[Mehlis gland]]s. In some flukes, the terminal end of the uterus is strengthened with [[muscles]] and [[Spine (zoology)|spines]].&lt;ref name="Puranik2007"/&gt;

''F. hepatica'' reproduces both sexually, via the [[hermaphrodite]] adult flukes, and [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]]. The [[miracidia]] can reproduce asexually within the intermediate [[Lymnaea|snail]] host.&lt;ref name="Hurtrez-BoussèsMeunier2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurtrez-Boussès|first1=Sylvie|last2=Meunier|first2=Cécile|last3=Durand|first3=Patrick|last4=Renaud|first4=François|title=Dynamics of host–parasite interactions: the example of population biology of the liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica)|journal=Microbes and Infection|volume=3|issue=10|year=2001|pages=841–849|issn=1286-4579|doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01442-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Fasciola hepatica prevalence.jpg|left|thumb|Fasciola hepatica prevalence. The countries in red are those with high prevalence, those in orange have low-medium prevalence.&lt;ref name="Cywińska2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tolan2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McManusDalton2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mas-ComaMas-Coma2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mas-Coma|first1=S.|last2=Mas-Coma|first2=S.|title=Epidemiology of fascioliasis in human endemic areas|journal=Journal of Helminthology|volume=79|issue=3|year=2005|pages=207–216|issn=0022-149X|doi=10.1079/JOH2005296}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Currently, ''F. hepatica'' has one of the widest geographical spread of any parasitic and vector-borne disease. Originating in Europe, it has expanded to colonize over 50 countries, covering all continents except [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="Cywińska2005"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Cywińska A | title=Epidemiology of fascioliasis in human endemic areas | journal=Journal of Helminthology | volume=79 | issue=3 | year=2005 | pages=207–216 | doi=10.1079/JOH2005296}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[Fasciola gigantica|F. gigantica]]'' is generally considered more geographically restricted to the tropical regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Middle East]], with some overlap between the two species.&lt;ref name="Tolan2011"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Tolan RW | title=Fascioliasis due to Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica infection: an update on this 'neglected'neglected tropical disease | journal=Laboratory Medicine | volume=42 | issue=2 | year=2011 | pages=107–116 | doi=10.1309/LMLFBB8PW4SA0YJI }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate]] affects both ''F. hepatica'' and its [[intermediate host]], the snail. For example, the development of ''F. hepatica'' miracidia and larvae, and the reproduction of ''[[Galba truncatula]]'', require a temperature range of 10 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C. In addition, they both require high levels of moisture in the air, as both are at risk of [[desiccation]]. Due to this, the [[prevalence]], along with the intensity of infection, of ''F. hepatica'' is primarily dependent on rainfall levels and temperature.&lt;ref name="Cywińska2005"/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
''For more information on the epidemiology – see the disease page, [[fasciolosis]]''

Infection begins when cyst-covered aquatic vegetation is eaten or when water containing metacercariae is drunk. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''F. hepatica'' frequently causes disease in [[ruminants]], most commonly between March and December.&lt;ref name=gorgasmarch/&gt;

Humans become infected by eating [[watercress]] or by drinking 'Emoliente', a Peruvian drink that uses drops of watercress juice. Cattle and sheep are infected when they consume the infectious stage of the parasite from low-lying, marshy [[pasture]].&lt;ref name=gorgasmarch&gt;{{cite web|title=Gorgas Case 5  - 2015 Series|url=http://www.uab.edu/medicine/gorgas/cases-blog|website=The Gorgas Course in Clinical Tropical Medicine|publisher=University of Alabama|accessdate=10 March 2015|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human infections have been reported from more than 75 countries around the world. In Asia and Africa, people are infected both by ''F. hepatica'' and ''F. gigantica'' whereas human fasciolosis is caused only by ''F. hepatica'' in South and Central America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/foodborne_trematode_infections/fascioliasis/fascioliasis_epidemiology/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of ''F. hepatica'' can interfere with the detection of [[bovine tuberculosis]] in cattle. Cattle co-infected with ''F. hepatica'', compared to those infected with ''M. bovis'' alone, react weakly to the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahvla.defra.gov.uk/External_OV_Instructions/TB_Instructions/Skin_Test/index.htm single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an infection from ''F. hepatica'' can make it difficult to detect [[bovine tuberculosis]], this is, of course, a major problem in the farming industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claridge|first1=Jen|last2=Diggle|first2=Peter|last3=McCann|first3=Catherine M.|last4=Mulcahy|first4=Grace|last5=Flynn|first5=Rob|last6=McNair|first6=Jim|last7=Strain|first7=Sam|last8=Welsh|first8=Michael|last9=Baylis|first9=Matthew|last10=Williams|first10=Diana J.L.| title=Fasciola hepatica is associated with the failure to detect bovine tuberculosis in dairy cattle| journal=Nature Communications| date=2012|volume=3|pages=853| doi=10.1038/ncomms1840|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n5/full/ncomms1840.html|access-date=2015-09-15| pmid=22617293| pmc=3989536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fasciolosis ==
{{Main|Fasciolosis}}
[[Image:Fasciola hepatica2.jpg|thumb|250px|Slide showing ''Fasciola hepatica's'' internal organs]]
Both ''F. hepatica'' and ''F. gigantica'' can cause fasciolosis. Human symptoms vary depending on whether the disease is chronic or acute. During the acute phase, the immature worms begin penetrating the gut, causing symptoms of fever, nausea, swollen liver, skin rashes, and extreme abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodborne_trematode_infections/fascioliasis/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Fascioliasis|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronic phase occurs when the worms mature in the bile duct, and can cause symptoms of intermittent pain, jaundice, and anemia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In cattle and sheep, classic signs of fasciolosis include persistent diarrhea, chronic weight loss, anemia, and reduced milk production.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hccmpw.org.uk/medialibrary/pdf/1377.pdf|title=Fascioliasis (liver fluke) in cattle|last=Scott|first=Phil|date=|website=NADIS Health Bulletin|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some remain asymptomatic. ''F. hepatica'' can cause sudden death in both sheep and cattle, due to internal hemorrhaging and liver damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Fasciolosis]] is an important cause of both production and economic losses in the dairy and meat industries. Over the years, the prevalence has increased and it is likely to continue increasing in the future.&lt;ref name="HowellBaylis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=Alison|last2=Baylis|first2=Matthew|last3=Smith|first3=Rob|last4=Pinchbeck|first4=Gina|last5=Williams|first5=Diana|title=Epidemiology and impact of Fasciola hepatica exposure in high-yielding dairy herds|journal=Preventive Veterinary Medicine|volume=121|issue=1–2|year=2015|pages=41–48|issn=0167-5877|doi=10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.05.013|pmid=26093971|pmc=4528078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock are often treated with flukicides, chemicals toxic to flukes, including [[bromofenofos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary | author = Virginia P.

Ruckebusch, P.-L. Toutian, G.D. Koritz | publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media | date = 2012 | page = 762}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[triclabendazole]], and [[bithionol]]. [[Ivermectin]], which is widely used for many [[helminth]]ic parasites, has low effectivity against ''F. hepatica'', as does [[praziquantel]].&lt;ref name="SibilleCalléja2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sibille|first1=Pierre|last2=Calléja|first2=Cécile|last3=Carreras|first3=Florence|last4=Bigot|first4=Karine|last5=Galtier|first5=Pierre|last6=Boulard|first6=Chantal|title=Fasciola hepatica: Influence of Gender and Liver Biotransformations on Flukicide Treatment Efficacy of Rats Infested and Cured with Either Clorsulon/Ivermectin or Triclabendazole|journal=Experimental Parasitology|volume=94|issue=4|year=2000|pages=227–237|issn=0014-4894|doi=10.1006/expr.2000.4501|pmid=10831390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ortega|first1=YR| title=Foodborne Parasites |url=https://books.google.com/?id=92pNSYcQl8sC&amp;dq=bithional+for+fasciola+hepatica|location=Georgia, USA |publisher=Springer|page=186|isbn=978-0387-30068-9|date=2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, the type of control depends on the setting. One important method is through the strict control over the growth and sales of edible water plants such as [[watercress]]. This is particularly important in highly [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas. Some farms are [[Irrigation|irrigated]] with [[Pollution|polluted]] water, hence, [[vegetables]] farmed from such land should be thoroughly washed and cooked before being eaten.&lt;ref name="CDCfascioliasis" /&gt;

The best way to prevent [[fasciolosis]] is by reducing the lymnaeid snail population or separating livestock from areas with these snails.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These two methods are not always the most practical, so control by treating the herd before they are potentially infected is commonly practiced.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Egg of Fasciola hepatica 08G0041 lores.jpg|thumb|''F. hepatica'' egg in stool sample.]]
{{Main|Fasciolosis}}A diagnosis may be made by finding yellow-brown eggs in the stool. They are indistinguishable from the eggs of ''[[Fascioloides magna]]'', although the eggs of ''F. magna'' are very rarely passed in sheep, goats, or cattle. If a patient has eaten infected liver, and the eggs pass through the body and out via the faeces, a false positive result to the test can occur. Daily examination during a liver-free diet will unmask this false diagnosis.&lt;ref name="ValeroPerez-Crespo2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valero|first1=M.

An [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test]] is the diagnostic test of choice.

== Organizational overview ==
Five &amp; Alive was established by [[Kate Roberts (YouthAIDS)|Kate Roberts]] in 2007, as a subsidiary program of Population Services International, where she serves as Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Communications. The health program is a collaborative initiative of [[YouthAIDS]], an HIV/AIDS education and prevention program of PSI. YouthAIDS and Five &amp; Alive serve to increase awareness of health crises primarily facing the [[Africa]]n continent, the [[Global South]] and developing world, while providing practical support and programming to save the lives of poor and vulnerable children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/charity/1234-five-and-alive |title=Five &amp; Alive: Celebrity Supporters |publisher=Looktothestars.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five &amp; Alive is an awareness, marketing and fundraising campaign of PSI that focuses on the global health crisis facing children under the age of five and their families. The program provides the education, resources, products, and care necessary for children and their families to fight off entirely preventable death and disease. Using targeted subsidies and free distribution, PSI offers long-lasting [[mosquito net]]s and [[Malaria#Treatment|malaria treatment]], pneumonia [[antibiotics]] and [[antimalarial medication]], [[micronutrients]], [[rehydration salts]], and [[water purification tablets]], including WhuaAgar and PUR for individuals determined to be among those at the greatest risk for health crisis and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.org/five-alive |title=Five &amp; Alive |publisher=PSI |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501045742/http://www.psi.org/five-alive |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, malaria infects between 350–500 million lives, leading to over a million deaths, primarily in children located on the African continent. At the same time, pneumonia has globally been the leading cause of death in children under the age of five years.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All children, no matter where they are born, deserve a healthy start in life. Nearly 11 million children die before their fifth birthday and the majority of these deaths are preventable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ashley-judd.com/site/archive/april-2007/ |title=April 2007 |publisher=ashley-judd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518235837/http://ashley-judd.com/site/archive/april-2007/ |archivedate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key program areas ==
[[File:Mosquito Netting.jpg|thumb|220px|Mosquito net attached to the ceiling]]

=== Diarrheal disease treatment and prevention ===
Five &amp; Alive promotes safe drinking water through household [[water treatment]], a water-quality
intervention that employs proven, easy-to-use and inexpensive solutions appropriate for the developing world. Five &amp; Alive improves the lives of individuals around the world by ensuring that household water is clean and safe, regardless of its source. Five &amp; Alive's water-treatment products include a [[sodium hypochlorite]]-based safe water solution, [[Portable water purification|chlorine-based tablets]] and a [[flocculation|flocculent]]/[[disinfectant]] powder that enable families to purify water at the household level.&lt;ref name=diarrheal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/diarrheal-disease?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |title=Diarrheal Disease |publisher=PSI |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501150012/http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/diarrheal-disease?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of these products, along with effective communications, empowers individuals
to understand the burden that contaminated drinking water has on their health and allows them
to take solutions into their own hands. Using both commercial marketing channels and community
mobilization, Five &amp; Alive generates awareness about the value of disinfecting drinking water, hand washing and other key hygiene behaviors.&lt;ref name=diarrheal/&gt;

Five &amp; Alive complements its work in safe water with the promotion of [[oral rehydration salt]]s (ORS) and zinc supplements to save the lives of children who may die from [[diarrhea]]-related [[dehydration]]. These child deaths are easily preventable, yet the lack of widespread knowledge and improved practices continue to present many challenges. Five &amp; Alive's diarrheal disease treatment programs educate caregivers on the use of ORS and zinc and expand the availability of these life-saving products through commercial and other non-traditional channels. As identified by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the integration of dissolvable zinc tablets enhances the ability of mothers and caregivers to understand and easily treat future episodes of diarrhea, which can save the lives of their children.&lt;ref name=diarrheal/&gt;

=== Pneumonia treatment ===
[[Pneumonia]] is the second leading cause of death among children under five. Early diagnosis and
treatment with simple [[antibiotics]] can prevent a large proportion of these deaths. A severe form of [[acute respiratory infection]], pneumonia can be treated effectively using Five &amp; Alive's pre-packaged therapy kits that contain [[cotrimoxazole]] and are easy to administer. Combined with comprehensive communications, this treatment is currently provided through private sector clinics to treat pneumonia in children under five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/pneumonia?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |title=Pneumonia |publisher=PSI |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501150627/http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/pneumonia?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malnutrition treatment ===
Five &amp; Alive estimates that over 3.5 million deaths of mothers and children have occurred due to [[malnutrition]], or "undernutrition". They attribute the cause resulting from a variety of factors, including [[poverty]], [[chronic illness]], inadequate access to health services, insufficient [[macronutrient|macro]] and [[micronutrient]] intake, unsafe water, and lack of access to improved sanitation. For young children, ensuring access to health and nutritional sustenance during the first 1,000 days from conception to age two, can break the cycle of malnutrition. The treatment program offered by the organization is cost-effective, when appropriately tailored and applied during the first two years of life.&lt;ref name=nutrition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/undernutrition?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |title=Undernutrition |publisher=PSI |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=Yeenosaurus |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programming efforts launched by Five &amp; Alive are proven successful, based on best-practices and evidence-based nutritional interventions, which include ensuring access to [[iron]], [[folic acid]], and multivitamin tablets for women of reproductive age, the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, and large scale [[food fortification]]. Access to services are provided to women and children through community health workers, private sector providers as well as public health facilities.&lt;ref name=nutrition/&gt;

=== Neonatal care ===
The death of children within the first 28 days of life, accounts for 41 percent of child mortality rates worldwide. Close to 50 percent of newborn mortality occurs within the first 48 hours of life. Coupled with minimal progress in reducing newborn mortality, a targeted effort is being made in order to make progress towards greatly reducing the mortality rate of children by the year 2015. In order to accomplish this, Five &amp; Alive is focused on increasing demand and access to quality [[neonatal]] interventions. Provided services include ensuring access to [[immunization]] and [[vaccination]], and water and sanitation, all of which can be offered inexpensively, yet has consistently shown a high-[[return on investment]]. Additional services include improving access to a full range of basic education, primarily for young girls.&lt;ref name=neonatal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/neonatal?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |title=Neonatal |publisher=PSI |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501150322/http://www.psi.org/our-work/healthy-lives/neonatal?phpMyAdmin=D673WcPmz30VmXaIcHmZXgbNRE3 |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five &amp; Alive readily promotes an integrated set of interventions that includes early initiation of exclusive [[breastfeeding]], [[Kangaroo care|kangaroo mother care]], delayed bathing, and early detection of infection, all of which are delivered by community health workers during home visits. The organization is also working to increase access to four percent [[Chlorhexidine]] (CHX), which is a simple and inexpensive antiseptic shown to reduce newborn mortality by 23 percent. This product is proven effective, when applied within the first 24 hours of birth. Five &amp; Alive's health services includes clean delivery kits, [[antenatal]]-based services, private provider networks, and community-based distribution, all of which increasingly delivers consistent access to four percent CHX at scale.&lt;ref name=neonatal/&gt;

== Strategic partners ==

=== Corporate support ===
Five &amp; Alive works in collaboration with partners ranging from large corporations to celebrity ambassadors to other nonprofit organizations. A major partnership with ''[[Condé Nast Traveler|Condé Nast Traveler Magazine]]'' offers financial support through their Five &amp; Alive Fund, in addition to comprehensive print coverage in support of Five &amp; Alive's marketing campaigns, resulting in increased public awareness and funding.&lt;ref name=concierge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/articles/12920?all=yes |title=The Week of (Not) Living Dangerously from Condé Nast Traveler on |publisher=Concierge.com |date=1994-04-06 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/articles/11352 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309003247/http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/articles/11352 |archivedate=2009-03-09 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a founding partner of the ''Condé Nast Traveler'' Five &amp; Alive Fund, [[Crystal Cruises]] has raised over $180,000. Assistance has included the distribution of child survival packages in [[Uganda]]; and assistance in training community healthcare workers to provide free diagnoses and treatments to children in [[Cameroon]], resulting in an estimated 40 percent reduction in child mortality. The cruise line additionally provides opportunity for travelers to donate financially and purchase merchandise in their onboard retail shops, with all proceeds going to support Five &amp; Alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystalcruises.com/support.aspx?FC=2&amp;TPT=7 |title=Support |publisher=Crystal Cruises |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnerships with [[Blackberry Farm (Tennessee)|Blackberry Farm]] and [[The Inn at Little Washington]] have led to several fundraising events. Appetite for Life dinners at Blackberry Farm in 2009 and 2010 alone raised over $160,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.org/five-alive-news-media-and-events |title=Five &amp; Alive News, Media and Events |publisher=PSI |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013125712/http://psi.org/five-alive-news-media-and-events |archivedate=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; towards Five &amp; Alive's initiatives in Haiti, while events at the Inn at Little Washington raised over $650,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040100603.html |title=Charity Gala to Mark Inn's 30th Anniversary |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other corporate partners such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Malaria No More]], [[Care2]], and [[Fortune Brands#Spirits|Beam Global Spirits &amp; Wine]] have been vital in sustaining the program, ensuring the organization's timely response to global crises, free of restrictions on time and resource allocation required by more traditional donors.

'''Florid cutaneous papillomatosis''' (FCP), also known as '''Schwartz-Burgess syndrome''', is an obligate [[paraneoplastic syndrome]].

FCP begins as the sudden onset of numerous [[papillomas|cutaneous papillomas]] that are clinically indistinguishable from [[viral warts]]. The papillomas range from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter may spread to involve the entire body, including the face. Pruritus, which may sometimes precede the onset of FCP, is evident in the affected regions in about half of patients. Evaluation of a [[skin biopsy]] clearly distinguishes FCP from viral warts.

FCP is associated with underlying cancer of the [[breast cancer|breast]], [[bladder cancer|bladder]], [[ovarian cancer|ovary]], [[uterine cancer|uterus]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]], and [[lung cancer|lung]]. Other associated underlying malignancies include [[squamous cell carcinomas]] and [[lymphomas]] such as [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].

FCP is sometimes seen together with other signs of internal cancer, especially [[malignant acanthosis nigricans]], [[tripe palms]], [[Leser–Trélat sign]], and [[hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita]]. FCP tends to improve in association with surgical or chemotherapeutic therapy of the underlying internal cancer. A recurrence or exacerbation of FCP may be linked with tumor regrowth or metastatic spread.

==Signs and symptoms==
The characteristic eruption is of multiple warty papules and nodules beginning on acral skin, especially the hands and wrists, and disseminating onto the skin of the entire body. These [[skin lesion]]s develop on the trunk, extremities, and face.&lt;ref name="Mansouri"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mansouri, P.|title=Florid cutaneous papillomatosis, malignant acanthosis nigrica, palmoplantar keratoderma, and gastric adenocarcinoma |journal=Acta Medical Iranica |volume=37 |issue=1 |year=1999 |url=http://journals.tums.ac.ir/upload_files/pdf/4884.pdf |format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} Pruritus is also associated.

==Causes==
The etiology of florid cutaneous papillomatosis is unknown. It is likely directly induced by an underlying neoplasm secreting a growth factor. One candidate may be alpha-transforming growth factor, structurally related to epidermal growth factor, but antigenically distinct from it. The underlying cancer is most often [[gastric adenocarcinoma]]&lt;ref name="Mansouri"/&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0378-6323.16238 |author=Singhi, M.K.|title=Florid cutaneous papillomatosis with adenocarcinoma of stomach in a 35 year old male |journal=Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=195–6 |year=2005 |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/5515/1/dv05062.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=16394412|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Klieb | first1 = HB. | last2 = Avon | first2 = SL. | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = J. | last4 = Sade | first4 = S. | last5 = Enepekides | first5 = D. | title = Florid cutaneous and mucosal papillomatosis: mucocutaneous markers of an underlying gastric malignancy. | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 31 | issue = 13 | pages = e218-9 |date=May 2013 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.2151 | PMID = 23530104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also with [[breast cancer]], [[bladder cancer]], [[hepatobiliary cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]], [[uterine cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yoon Oo Noh, G.C.L. |author2=Mi Kyeong Kim |author3=Youn Soo Kim |author4=Tae Young Yoon |title=A Case of Florid Cutaneous Papillomatosis and Tripe Palm |journal=Korean J Dermatol |volume=7 |issue=40 |year=2002 |url=http://koreamed.org/SearchBasic.php?RID=291794&amp;DT=1&amp;QY=A+%5BALL%5D+Case+%5BALL%5D+Florid+%5BALL%5D+Cutaneous+%5BALL%5D+Papillomatosis+%5BALL%5D+Tripe+%5BALL%5D+Palm+%5BALL%5D}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[prostate cancer]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, [[lung cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1468-3083.2000.00051.x  |vauthors=Bottoni U, Dianzani C, Pranteda G, etal |title=Florid cutaneous and mucosal papillomatosis with acanthosis nigricans revealing a primary lung cancer |journal=J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=205–8 |date=May 2000 |pmid=11032067 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0926-9959&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Combination of Tripe Palms, Acanthosis Nigricans and Florid Cutaneous Papillomatosis in a Patient with Metastatic Cervical Cancer | year = 2004 | journal = Dermatol Sin | pages = 142–147 | volume = 22 | last1 = Tsai | first1 =  Yu-Ju | last2 =  Tsai | first2 =  Yi-Jeng | last3 =  Chuan | first3 =  Ming-Tuo | last4 =  Hu | first4 =  Shu-Ling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other associated underlying malignancies include [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s and [[lymphoma]]s.&lt;ref name="JanierBlanchet-Bardon1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janier|first1=M.|last2=Blanchet-Bardon|first2=C.|last3=Bonvalet|first3=D.|last4=Lenoble|first4=M.|last5=Boiget|first5=F.|last6=Civatte|first6=J.|title=Malignant Acanthosis nigricans Associated with Non-Hodgkin&amp;rsquo;s Lymphoma|journal=Dermatology|volume=176|issue=3|year=1988|pages=133–137|issn=1421-9832|doi=10.1159/000248689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Florid cutaneous papillomatosis, malignant acanthosis nigricans, and the sign of Leser-Trélat may be highlighted as part of a continuum, with each having a common or similar pathogenic pathway due to an underlying malignancy that produces a factor epidermal growth factor-like activity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
The sudden eruption of papulonodules usually indistinguishable from common viral warts should suggest this diagnosis. These papulonodules begin on the extremities, especially on the dorsa of the hands and the wrists and may disseminate to involve the entire body, including the face.&lt;ref name="LevineLevine2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman Levine|author2=Carol C.

Pruritus is often associated.

Florid cutaneous papillomatosis is linked with an underlying cancer. Malignant acanthosis nigricans may also become evident, many times with the sudden eruption of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the sign of Leser-Trélat.&lt;ref name="LebwohlHeymann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark G.

Histologic examination shows uniform and pronounced hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis without epidermal vacuolization, parakeratosis, or eosinophilic inclusions suggestive of viral warts.&lt;ref name="WeedonStrutton1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Weedon|author2=Geoffrey Strutton|title=Skin pathology|year=1997|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=978-0-443-05575-1|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden quality of the eruption of florid cutaneous papillomatosis and its anatomic distribution should facilitate distinction from widespread common warts and from epidermodysplasia verruciformis.

==Treatment==
Identifying and treatment the underlying malignancy constitutes an uptime approach. [[5-fluorouracil|Topical 5-fluorouracil]] may occasionally be help, as may [[retinoid|oral retinoid]]s, [[topical steroid]]s, [[vitamin A acid]], [[urea]], [[salicylic acid]], [[podophyllotoxin]], and [[liquid nitrogen|cryodestruction employing liquid]].

==Prognosis==
Improvement usually parallels that of the cancer, whether [[surgery|surgical]] or [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]]. Generalization of the associated visceral malignancy may worsen the eruption.

==Epidemiology==
Florid cutaneous papillomatosis is almost twice as common in men than in women, and is usually diagnosed in individuals aged 53–72 years (mean patient age, 58.5 years).&lt;ref name="Mansouri" /&gt;{{rp|66}}

== History ==
Florid cutaneous papillomatosis was discovered by [[Robert A. Schwartz]] and [[Gordon H. Burgess]].&lt;ref name="ChouYeh2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chou|first1=Che-Yi|last2=Yeh|first2=Shih-Wei|title=Multiple brownish warty papulonodules on left dorsal hand|journal=Dermatologica Sinica|volume=30|issue=2|year=2012|pages=81–82|issn=1027-8117|doi=10.1016/j.dsi.2011.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original description was published in the ''Archives of Dermatology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archderm.114.12.1803 |vauthors=Schwartz RA, Burgess GH |title=Florid cutaneous papillomatosis |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=114 |issue=12 |pages=1803–6 |date=December 1978 |pmid=153731 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=153731}}

'''Giusto Gervasutti''' (17 April 1909 – 16 September 1946), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mountain climber]], [[Alpini]] officer and [[skier]].

==Biography==
Gervasutti, also known as "Il Fortissimo" ("the hardest", "the roughest"), was born in [[Cervignano del Friuli]]. He started climbing at the age of 16 years. In 1931, he moved to [[Turin]] to study at the local [[University of Turin|university]].

Together with other well known climbers of the time he climbed the most difficult and sought-after faces in the Western Alps. His first notable success was the first repetition of Karl Brendelet's and Hermann Schaller's difficult climb on the south ridge route of the [[Aiguille Noire de Peuterey]] one year after them. Further he completed some first ascents of reliefs in the [[Dauphiné Alps]], for example the North West of the [[Pic d'Olan]] and the North West of the [[Ailefroide]]. During a visit in [[Chile]] in 1934, he climbed some five-thousanders. Also notable would be his ascent on the south west edge of the [[Picco Gugliermina]], which he mastered together with [[Gabriele Boccalatte]] in 1938. His masterpiece was the first ascent of the difficult east wall of the [[Grandes Jorasses]], together with [[Giuseppe Gagliardone]] in 1942, while he served as a military officer in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="alpinistidellambrusco"&gt;[http://www.alpinistidellambrusco.org/2012/02/storia-dellalpinismo-giusto-gervasutti.html Storia dell'alpinismo: Giusto Gervasutti] {{It icon}}, February 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/giusto-gervasutti-english-version/178949 Giusto Gervasutti “il fortissimo” (1909-1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervasutti was member of the [[Ski Club Torino]]. Due to an injury at the third [[Trofeo Mezzalama]] in 1935, he had to withdraw. [[Paula Wiesinger]], who was invited to view the race, took his military uniform, covered her face with sunglasses and his cap, and took part instead of him, but the cheat was discovered at a check point of the race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/paula-wiesinger/ ''Paula Wiesinger''] {{De icon}}, FemBio.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Gervasutti died in a mountaineering accident on the [[Mont Blanc du Tacul]], when he was accompanied by Gagliardone. They were on the way back, because they had to abort the ascent on the north east wall, when the double rope pinched. During the attempt to set it free, Gervasutti fell headlong into a gap.&lt;ref name="alpinistidellambrusco" /&gt; The spur was named after him.

}}The '''Indian Nursing Council''' is a national regulatory body for [[nursing|nurses]] and [[nurse education]] in [[India]]. It is an autonomous body under the [[Government of India]], [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare]], constituted by the Central Government under section 3(1) of the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947 of [[Indian parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiannursingcouncil.org/pdf/inc-act-1947_New.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1947 Indian Nursing Council Act has undergone minimal amendments. This resulted in several anomalies that have impacted the morale of Registered Nurses in India especially those practicing in the private sector. The last amendment of the act was in the year 2006. According to the original act the function of the council is to provide '''uniformity in nursing education'''.

* '''Recognition of nursing qualifications''' in India.&lt;sup&gt;(10.1)&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Granting any nursing qualification''': Grants a qualification in general nursing, midwifery, health visiting or public health nursing.&lt;sup&gt;(10.2)&lt;/sup&gt;
* The Council may enter into negotiations with any authority [in any territory of India to which this Act does not extend or foreign country] which by the law of such territory or country is entrusted with the maintenance of a register of nurses midwives or health visitors; for the settling of a scheme of reciprocity for the recognition of nursing qualifications.&lt;sup&gt;(10.3)&lt;/sup&gt;
* Indian Nursing Council has the Power to require information as to courses of study and training and examinations.&lt;sup&gt;(12)&lt;/sup&gt;
* Inspect any institution recognized as a training institution, and to attend examinations held for the purpose of granting any recognized qualification or recognized higher qualification in India.&lt;sup&gt;(13)&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Withdrawal of recognition'''&lt;sup&gt;(14)&lt;/sup&gt;: The council may withdraw the recognition an institution recognized by a State Council for the training of nurses, midwives or health visitors does not satisfy the requirements of the Council. 
* '''Power to make regulations'''&lt;sup&gt;(16)&lt;/sup&gt;. The Council may make regulations not inconsistent with the Indian Nursing Council Act generally to carry out the provisions of this Act, and in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers.

== State-Level Nursing Councils ==
There are many registered state-level nursing councils.&lt;ref name="councils"&gt;[http://www.indiannursingcouncil.org/pdf/snrc-State-Nursing-Registration-Council.pdf State-Wise Nursing Council] India Nursing Council, Retrieved on 29, October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They are granted autonomous rights by the nursing council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11405">The '''International Cancer Genome Consortium''' (ICGC) is a voluntary scientific organization that provides a forum for collaboration among the world's leading cancer and genomic researchers. The ICGC was launched in 2008 to coordinate large-scale [[Oncogenomics|cancer genome studies]] in tumours from 50 cancer types and/or subtypes that are of main importance across the globe.

Systematic studies of more than 25,000 cancer genomes at the [[Genomics|genomic]], [[Epigenomics|epigenomic]] and [[Transcriptomics|transcriptomic]] levels will reveal the repertoire of oncogenic mutations, uncover traces of the mutagenic influences, define clinically relevant subtypes for prognosis and therapeutic management, and enable the development of new cancer therapies.&lt;ref name = "Hudson_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hudson TJ, et al. | title = International network of cancer genome projects | journal = Nature | volume = 464 | pages = 993-8 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20393554| doi= 10.1038/nature08987 | pmc = 2902243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICGC incorporates data from [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] (TCGA) and the Sanger Cancer Genome Project.

==Goals==

The ICGC is one of the most ambitious biomedical research efforts since the [[Human Genome Project]]. The consortium will help to coordinate current and future large-scale projects to understand the genomic changes involved in cancers of global concern. The catalogues produced by ICGC members will be made rapidly and freely available to qualified researchers, which will enable scientists around the globe to use the new information to develop better ways of diagnosing, treating and preventing many types of cancer.

The aim of the ICGC is to provide a comprehensive description of the somatic (non-inherited) genomic abnormalities present in the broad range of human tumors. Given our current knowledge of the heterogeneity of tumor types and subtypes, the ICGC set a goal of coordinating approximately 50 projects, each of which will generate the genomic analyses on approximately 500 cancer samples of each class. It is well recognized, however, that cancer is highly heterogeneous and hundreds of types/subtypes can be defined.  Therefore, the stated goal of 50 ICGC projects is not intended to, and cannot, exhaustively cover the full spectrum of cancer types.

ICGC Funding and Research members proposing a project must agree to the ICGC’s policies, which include requirements for rapid data release, for rigorous quality standards and for protection of study participants.

The complete list of the ICGC Goals, Structure, Policies and Guidelines is available at http://icgc.org/

==Structure and funding==

ICGC is funded by participating nations, each of which focuses on one or more forms of cancer, with the goal of mapping the [[genome]]s of at least 50 types of cancer.&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2008/nhgri-29.htm |title=Scientists Form International Cancer Genome Consortium |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]
|date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium's secretariat is at the [[Ontario Institute for Cancer Research]] in [[Toronto]], Canada,&lt;ref name="secretariat"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://healthzone.ca/health/article/419499 |title=Toronto-based consortium to seek cancer's genetic origins |last=Ogilvie |first=Megan |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will also operate the data coordination center. The provincial [[Government of Ontario]] provided funding of $40 million, and each participating funding member is expected to contribute $20 million toward each project. In 2009 the [[German Cancer Aid]] supported one ICGC-project with 7.9 million Euro. This was the highest amount a private organization gave. The money is donated by German people.

ICGC membership is open to all entities that agree to follow its principles and guidelines. The ICGC has received commitments from funding organizations in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America for 47 project teams in 15 jurisdictions to study over 21,000 tumor genomes. Projects that are currently funded are examining tumors affecting the bladder, blood, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, oral cavity, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, skin, soft tissues, stomach, thyroid and uterus. Over time, additional nations and organizations are anticipated to join the ICGC. The genomic analyses of tumors conducted by ICGC members in Australia and Canada (pancreatic cancer), China (gastric cancer), France (liver cancer), Germany (brain cancer), Japan (liver cancer), Spain (blood cancer), the UK (blood, breast, lung and skin cancer) and the USA (blood, brain, breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovarian, rectal, stomach and uterine cancer) are now available through the Data Coordination Center housed on the ICGC website at http://www.icgc.org. Data sets are browseable and may be downloaded at https://dcc.icgc.org/.

== Future work ==

===ICGCmed===
Within the context of massive international sequencing efforts, and in anticipation of the new era of precision medicine, The [https://icgcmed.org/ International Cancer Genome Consortium for Medicine] (ICGCmed) will link the wealth of genomic data already amassed, as well as new genomic data being generated, to clinical and health information, including lifestyle, patient history, cancer diagnostic data, and response to and survival following to therapies, across the cancer spectrum. Using this large-scale integrated data, researchers, scientists, policymakers and clinicians will be able to work with patients, healthcare providers and others to develop preventative strategies, markers for early detection of disease, more specific criteria and methods for diagnoses and prognoses, and interventions based on matching the patient’s disease molecular subtype with the most effective combinations of therapies.

This will lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets, more precise disease definitions and improved strategies to prevent drug resistance.

== Biography ==
Born in Troy, New York, he graduated from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and, later, the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in 1947 and pursued a career in academic medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bringing science to medicine: an interview with Larry Weed, inventor of the problem-oriented medical record|journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association: JAMIA|date = 2014-12-01|issn = 1527-974X|pmc = 4215056|pmid = 24872343|pages = 964–968|volume = 21|issue = 6|doi = 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002776|first = Adam|last = Wright|first2 = Dean F.|last2 = Sittig|first3 = Julie|last3 = McGowan|first4 = Joan S.|last4 = Ash|first5 = Lawrence L.|last5 = Weed}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired as an  Emeritus Professor of the [[University of Vermont]].

== Career ==
Dividing his time between research, patient care and teaching, he developed a method which reorganized the structure of the medical record from being divided into the different sources for patient records (x-rays, prescriptions, physician notes) to one structured around a well-defined list of a patient’s medical problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He first published about the problem-oriented medical record in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medical Records, Patient Care, and Medical Education|journal = Irish Journal of Medical Science|date = 1964-06-01|issn = 1863-4362|pmid = 14160426|pages = 271–282|volume = 462|first = L. L.|last = Weed|doi=10.1007/BF02945791}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a 1968 article published by the [[The New England Journal of Medicine|''New England Journal of Medicine'']] introduced the concept to a broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medical records that guide and teach|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1968-03-14|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 5637758|pages = 593–600|volume = 278|issue = 11|doi = 10.1056/NEJM196803142781105|first = L.

L.|last = Weed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s he gave lectures at medical schools around the country,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMsPXSMTpFI Larry Weed's 1971 Grand Rounds at Emory University]" (video). Via YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; and published a book that described the problem-oriented medical record in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;Weed, Lawrence L. (1971). ''Medical Records, Medical Education, and Patient Care: The Problem-Oriented Medical Record as a Basic Tool''. Cleveland, Ohio: Press of Case Western Reserve University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 2,000 academic articles and numerous medical textbooks discuss Weed’s problem-oriented medical record, and it has become a central component of medical and nursing education.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Adam; Sittig, Dean F.; McGowan, Julie; Ash, Joan S. ; Weed, Lawrence L. (2015).

Also published online [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4215056/ via PubMed Central]. Retrieved 2017-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  His original idea for a patient problem list was adapted and put into law in the “meaningful use” requirements of the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act]], which promoted the adoption of [[electronic health record]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Casey (April&amp;nbsp;6, 2011).

He also helped develop a computerized medical information system based on the problem-oriented record, which used a touch screen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Automated Data Sources for Ambulatory Care Effectiveness Research|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DC9CTrk9AYwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3|publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|place=Rockville, MD|date = May 1993|first = Mary L.|last = Grady|page=3}} Also reprinted by Diane Publishing, 2004; {{ISBN|9780788122491}}.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in 1969, that system was one of the earliest versions of an electronic medical record.&lt;ref name="Lohr"/&gt; He launched a company PKC, which developed methods for clinical information management systems. In 2012, the firm was purchased by [[Sharecare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sharecare Announces the Acquisition of PKC Corporation|url = https://www.sharecare.com/static/sharecare-announces-the-acquisition-of-pkc-corporation|website = Sharecare|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Madeira Optics Museum''', also known as '''Museu de Óptica da Madeira''', is a specialized museum located in [[Funchal]], [[Madeira Island|Madeira]] that showcases a permanent collection of [[optics]]-related devices.

This museum features objects from all areas of optics, acquired all around the world, and have been collected from the 1960s until nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.madeiraopticsmuseum.com/pt/inicio/|title=A New Museum in Funchal, Madeira - The Madeira Optics Museum|website=Madeira Optics Museum|language=pt-PT|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Collectors ==
In the 1960s, the love for engineering and history led one person - Rui Aguilar - to start collecting optics related devices. Initially without a defined purpose of creating a museum, the collection kept growing progressively until nowadays. In 2014, the idea for the creation of the Madeira Optics Museum sparked from a conversation between Rui Aguilar and its son, Sergio Aguilar, who since then is working alongside its father in the creation and organization of the museum.
Currently, Rui and Sérgio Aguilar work together in the selection, acquisition cataloguing and preparation of every accession and on the organization of the physical area of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madeiraopticsmuseum.com/pt/coleccionadores/|title=Os Coleccionadores - Madeira Optics Museum|work=Madeira Optics Museum|access-date=2017-08-17|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Collection ==

About 2000 objects are on permanent display at the museum.

* Movie cameras

* Military equipment
* Topography equipment

== The Building ==
The building where the Madeira Optics Museum operates is dated from the end of the 19th century, and it's registered as a Class 1 protected building in terms of special architectural or historic interest.
As such, the building still maintains nearly all of the initial characteristics and facade.
Recently this building has been subject to minor interior and exterior restoration works with the supervision of Funchal's [http://www.cm-funchal.pt/ city hall] that targeted the requalification of the museum area and surroundings.

The first registered nurse-midwife in the world was Sister Louisa Jane Barrett, who received training in [[Kimberley, South Africa]] in 1891. There is almost no documentation as to who attended to births in South Africa prior to commencement of [[History of South Africa#Dutch colonisation .281652.E2.80.931815.29|Dutch colonisation in 1652]]. From 1652, midwives could function independently and were certified and licensed. Between 1948 and 1991, the [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation in South Africa influenced the way that nursing training was structured and organised.

===Restrictions===
In the 1960s, most women in South Africa delivered in hospitals as it was believed that this was the best place for birth. Additionally, hospitals in both the public and private sector did not support independent midwives by allowing them to use their facilities. Midwives then assumed the positions of 'obstetric nurses', where they would work in healthcare facilities under the guidance of obstetricians.

=== National Health System - 1994-present ===
In 1994, the National Health System implemented a primary healthcare approach to improve access to healthcare services by disadvantaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;N.Abrahams, R.Jewkes, Z.Mvo. Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health. Health Care–Seeking Practices of Pregnant Women and the Role of the Midwife in Cape Town, South Africa.Volume 46, Issue 4 July–August 2001, Pages 240–247.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the other [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations member states]], in 2000, South Africa committed to help achieve a set of world development goals for 2015 called the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. South Africa did not achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 5: Improve maternal health|Millennium Goals]] for maternal health.&lt;ref name="G Schoon 2012"&gt;M G Schoon, M W A Motlolometsi. The South African Medical Journal. Poor maternal outcomes: A factor of poor professional systems design. Vol 102, No 10 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Statistics SA. http://www.statssa.gov.za/MDG/MDG_Goal5_report_2015_.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years, different policies and programmes have been implemented to improve maternal care and child mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A new, integrated inter-professional training model is also being attempted by health practitioners to improve outcomes in maternal care.&lt;ref name="G.B Theron. Midwifery 1999, Pages 66-71"&gt;G.B Theron. Midwifery. Elsevier. Volume 15, Issue 2, June 1999, Pages 66-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G Schoon 2012"/&gt;

==Licensure==
In South Africa the midwifery profession is regulated under the Nursing Act, Act No 3 of 2005. The South African Nursing Council (SANC) is the regulatory body of midwifery in South Africa. Training includes aspects of midwifery, general nursing, community nursing and psychiatry, and can be achieved as either a four-year degree or a four-year diploma.&lt;ref name="sanc"&gt;http://www.sanc.co.za 5 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midwivessociety.co.za 5June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced Diploma in Midwifery===
The primary purpose of this qualification is to produce competent midwives who will provide scientific, comprehensive, safe and quality midwifery care to patients, families and communities within the legal and ethical framework. On successful completion of this qualification, the learner is eligible to register with the SANC as a midwife. All assessments are conducted in line with the assessment policy of the Regulations Relating to the Accreditation of Institutions as Nursing Education Institutions (NEI).This qualification allows international employability.&lt;ref name="sanc" /&gt;
 
===Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery===
The purpose of this qualification is to gain knowledge and expertise in midwifery as a speciality, including a systematic survey of thinking, practice and research methods in the field of midwifery. Aims include screening, preventing disease, injury, complications, screening, appropriate management and referral of patients to appropriate healthcare providers. All assessments should be aligned with the Assessment Policy of the Nursing/Midwifery Education Institution (NEI). The Postgraduate Diploma articulates with a Masters Degree in Nursing at NQF level 9. This qualification allows international employability.&lt;ref name="sanc" /&gt;
 
===Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing and Midwifery===
This qualification aims at training competent Professional Nurse and Midwife practitioners who will have the ability to act in a wide range of healthcare service environments. On successful completion of this qualification, the learner is eligible for registration with the relevant statutory body (currently the SANC) as a Professional Nurse and Midwife. Successful registration will license a nurse to practise as a Professional Nurse and Midwife. All assessments should be conducted in line with the assessment policy of the NEI. This qualification allows international employability.&lt;ref name="sanc" /&gt;

==Areas of Practice==
[[File:Ward at St Patrick's Hospital.jpg|thumb|Inside of [[maternity ward]] in St. Patrick's Hospital on the Eastern Cape.|264x264px]]
Primary maternity services are provided by midwives in the public sector as part of the South African [[Healthcare in South Africa|National Health Plan]]. Midwives in the public sector work interdependently with medical doctors in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings.&lt;ref name="N.Abrahams, R 2001, Pages 240"/&gt;

In the private sector, midwives may be employed by a hospital and work interdependently with an obstetrician where the midwife only provides care during delivery; or practise independently and only require assistance from an obstetrician for emergencies.&lt;ref name="N.Abrahams, R 2001, Pages 240"/&gt;

Midwives are not allowed to prescribe medications, such as [[Magnesium sulfate|magnesium sulphate]] and [[Oxytocin (medication)|oxytocin]] which are used to treat [[pre-eclampsia]] and [[Postpartum bleeding|postpartum haemorrhage]], respectively. Midwives are dependent on medical practitioners for these. However, due to the shortage of medical practitioners, some midwives may take the risk of practising outside their scope of practice by prescribing medications.&lt;ref name="freedomto"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reid|first=L.|date=2007|title=Midwifery, Freedom to Practise?: An International Exploration and Examination of Midwifery Practice|url=|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|pages=205–212|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present shortages==
Since 2007, there has been a shortage of midwives in South Africa.&lt;ref name="freedomto" /&gt; The shortage of midwives in the management of pregnant women in the private sector is perceived as one of the reasons for the high rate of deliveries conducted by [[caesarean section]]. The collaboration of midwives and obstetricians in the management of pregnant women would be beneficial to maternity care once critical impediments are addressed in order to achieve such a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;M.Wibbekink, S.James. Africa Journal of Nursing and Midwifery - Perceptions of private sector midwives and obstetricians regarding collaborative maternity care in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Africa Journal of Nursing and Midwifery, Volume 17, Issue 2, Jan 2015, p. 17 - 30.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reported improvements to the cognitive knowledge of midwives in the Eastern Cape who have completed the Maternal Care manual.&lt;ref name="G.B Theron. Midwifery 1999, Pages 66-71"/&gt;

Between 1996 and 2005, South Africa produced almost 42% fewer midwives and nursing graduates from national education institutions. There are few qualifying midwives and many young qualified midwives do not stay in practice. Another hindrance is the lack of recognition of post-basic qualifications. Additionally, unlike medical registrars, midwives have to pay for their own studies, need to be on leave to attend lectures and do not receive 'specialist' recognition for their additional skills set. These midwives usually leave the clinical workplace to become administrators, where they are more likely to earn a higher salary and be professionally promoted.&lt;ref name="freedomto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sanc.co.za"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Democratic Nursing Organization of SA. www.denosa.org.za 5 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Ababelithisi'' midwife tradition ==
[[File:FGM-C and childbirth (12345205954).jpg|thumb|A traditional midwife, or ''ababelithisi'', having a community discussion.]]
The [[traditional birth attendant]], often referred to as an ''ababelithisi'', has played an integral role in African medicine for centuries. There is still widespread use of traditional midwives due to spiritual beliefs and the inability to access formal healthcare services. The majority of midwives are located in rural areas and informal settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Troskie TR. Europe PMC.The importance of traditional midwives in the delivery of health care in the Republic of South Africa.01 Mar 1997, 20(1):15-20&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ababelithisi'' are usually elderly women who have been midwives for decades and are well esteemed in their communities for their obstetric and ritual expertise. They manage antenatal issues and assist pregnant women during deliveries. They are also responsible for the ritual bathing of the mother, disposal of the placentas, provision of healing medicines and traditional massage after delivery. In cases of difficult labour or complications, a [[traditional healer]] or ''inyanga'' may act as a consultant or assistant.

''Ababelithisi'' may provide advice on various aspects of [[postpartum]] care, such as, cord care, breastfeeding, marriage, [[contraception]] and [[fertility]]. The criteria for women aspiring to be traditional midwives include having two children of their own as well as training over a period of 15 to 20 years before they can assume this respected title. Their services are free; however, donations in the form of gifts are usually given.

=== Governmental recognition ===
In 1977, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) formally recognised the importance of collaborating with traditional healers (including traditional midwives). The WHO’s 2001 survey of the legal status of traditional and complementary/alternative medicine revealed that 61% of the 44 African nations surveyed had legal statutes regarding traditional medicine and not all national policies had been implemented. Increasing efforts have since been made to formally include traditional healers in primary healthcare, including around HIV/AIDS care and prevention. In South Africa, the “Traditional Health Practitioners Bill of 2003” was drafted. Certain sections of the Traditional Health Practitioners Act, Act No. 35 of 2004, came into operation on 13 January 2006. Efforts are ongoing to develop a pharmacopoeia of traditional medicines.&lt;ref&gt;I.Truter. SA Pharmaceutical Journal. September 2007. pg 56-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014–2023 was developed and launched in response to the [[World Health Assembly]]'s resolution on traditional medicine (WHA62.13). The strategy aims to support member states in implementing action plans and policies that will strengthen the role that traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy.&lt;ref&gt;WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014-2023.December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mithridatism''' is the practice of protecting oneself against a [[poison]] by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], the King of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

==Background==
[[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]]'s father, [[Mithridates V]], was assassinated by poisoning, said to be at his mother's orders.  After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother.&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome's deadliest enemy''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}}  Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother's orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father's death.  He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;{{rp|69}}

While in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons.&lt;ref name="The Foreign Policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus"&gt;{{cite book | last = McGing | first = B. C. | title = The Foreign Policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus | publisher = E. J. Brill | year= 1986 | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | pages = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mithridates' death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component, supervised by the ''Agari''; a group of [[Scythia]]n [[shaman]]s derived from Indian Aghoris who never left him.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, Adrienne. ''Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, and Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World.'' New York, Overlook Duckworth, 2003; p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Russian mystic [[Rasputin]]'s survival of a poisoning attempt was due to mithridatism, but this has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Modern Medicine, J. C. Segen, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian epics talk about this practice too. It has been said that, during the rule of the king [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called [[Vish Kanya|''vishakanyas'']] (visha = poison, kanya = maiden). It was believed that making love with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, hence they were employed to kill enemies.

The emperor [[Bindusara]] was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the ''Rajavalikatha'', a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. According to a legend mentioned in the [[Jain]] texts, Chandragupta's [[Guru]] and advisor [[Chanakya]] used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by the enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was 7 days away from delivery. The queen not immune to the poison collapsed and died within a few minutes. Chanakya entered the room the very time she collapsed, and in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out, by that time a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head due to which the child got a permanent blueish spot (a "bindu") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named "Bindusara".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
It is important to note that mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison (immunity generally is only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to) and, depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, ie, on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. In some cases, it is possible to build up tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. For some poisons, this involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that deal with these poisons (for example alcohol). Another mechanism involves conditioning the target tissues of the poisons. These methods do not work for all non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]], is either lethal or has little to no effect, and thus cannot be used in this way at all. Arsenic is a notable exception with some people actually having a genetic adaptation granting them higher resistance which can be replicated with mithridatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/genetic-immunity-to-arsenic|title=Humans can develop a genetic tolerance for arsenic|last=Steadman|first=Ian|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, simple toxins that work through chemical processes that bypass the immune system cannot be dealt with (good example would be the variants of cyanide).

There are only a few, if any, practical uses of mithridatism.  [[Venomous snake]] handler [[Bill Haast]] used this method.  [[Snake handler]]s from [[Burma]] are said to [[tattoo]] themselves with snake venom for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tattoos.iloveindia.com/purpose-of-tattooing/protection.html Tattoos For Protection].  ''iloveindia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Mithridatism has been used as a plot device in novels, films, video games, and television shows, including Nirja Guleri's ''[[Shiv Dutt in Chandrakanta (TV series)|Shiv Dutt in Chandrakanta]]'', [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', [[Holly Black]]'s "[[The Cruel Prince]]", [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s "[[Rappaccini's Daughter]]", [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]]'s ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', [[Dorothy Sayers]]'s ''[[Strong Poison]]'', [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'', [[William Goldman]]'s ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (and the [[The Princess Bride (film)|film of the same name]]), ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]'', a Japanese manga called ''Dokuhime'' (Poison Princess) by [[Mitsukazu Mihara|Mihara Mitsukazu]], [[Ekta Kapoor]]'s ''[[Jodha Akbar]]'', and [[List of Hunter × Hunter characters#Zoldyck Family|the Zoldyck family]] in ''[[Hunter X Hunter]].''

In [[Michael Curtis Ford]]'s novel ''The Last King'', on the life and conquests of Mithridates VI, the author clearly depicts Mithridates' efforts to use this technique to protect himself and ensure his safety.

==In poetry==
[[A.E. Housman]]'s "Terence, this is stupid stuff" (originally published in ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'') invokes mithridatism as a metaphor for the benefit that serious poetry brings to the reader. The final section is a poetic rendition of the Mithridates legend. (See the text on Wikisource [[s:Terence, This Is Stupid Stuff|by itself]] and [[s:A Shropshire Lad/LXII|collected with ''A Shropshire Lad'']].)

'''Kriss Donald''' (2 July 1988 – 15 March 2004) was a 15-year-old [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[White people|white]] male who was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[murder]]ed in [[Glasgow]] in 2004 by a gang of men of [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] origin,&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt; some of whom fled to [[Pakistan]] after the crime.&lt;ref name="Times Of India"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-17/rest-of-world/27813647_1_sikh-leaders-sikh-political-party-sikh-federation|work=The Times Of India|title=Sikhs blame British policy of 'Asian' tag|date=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PaxtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22kidnapped+because+he+was+White+and+was+tortured+to+death+over+five+hours%22&amp;dq=%22kidnapped+because+he+was+White+and+was+tortured+to+death+over+five+hours%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qeWYTsreM9C98gOCgo3CBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The Middle East, abstracts and index – Library Information and Research Service], google.com; accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/11/10/stories/2006111006241400.htm|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|title=Life for Pakistani men for killing white teenager|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daanish Zahid, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid and Mohammed Faisal Mustaq were later found guilty of [[racially motivated crime|racially motivated murder]] and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Times Of India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/justice_for_kriss_donald_held_hostage_by_the_law_1_539905|location=Edinburgh, UK|work=The Scotsman|first=Dan|last=Mcdougall|title=Justice for Kriss Donald held hostage by the law|date=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case, which featured the first-ever conviction for racially motivated murder in Scotland, is cited in two newspaper articles as an example of the lack of attention the media and society give to white sufferers of [[Racism|racist]] attacks compared to that given to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alibhai Brown|first=Yasmin|title=When the victim is white, does anyone care?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-153368757/when-the-victim-is-white-does-anyone-care|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=26 October 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Denise|title=Skin colour is irrelevant |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Skin+colour+is+irrelevant.-a0153544141|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=The Journal|date=31 October 2006|location=Newcastle, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested the crime demonstrates how society has been forced to redefine racism so as to no longer exclude white victims.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"/&gt;

==Kidnapping and murder==
On 15 March 2004, Donald was abducted from Kenmure Street by five men associated with a local [[British Pakistani]] [[gang]] led by Imran Shahid. The kidnapping was ostensibly revenge for an attack on Shahid at a [[nightclub]] in Glasgow city centre the night before by a local white gang, and Donald was chosen as an example of a "white boy from the McCulloch Street area" despite having no involvement in the nightclub attack or in any gang activity.&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6125660.stm "Gangsters, murder and extradition"], BBC News; accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt;

Donald was taken on a 200-mile journey to [[Dundee]] and back while his kidnappers made phone calls looking for a house to take him to. Having no success at this, they returned to Glasgow and took him to the [[Clyde Walkway]], near [[Celtic Football Club]]'s training ground.&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/09/race.ukcrime Three jailed for life for race murder of schoolboy]. The Guardian 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There, they held his arms (ascertained due to an absence of defensive wounds) and stabbed him multiple times. He sustained internal injuries to three [[arteries]], one of his [[lungs]], his [[liver]] and a [[kidney]]. He was doused in [[petrol]] and  set on fire as he [[Exsanguination|bled to death]].&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061102124926/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5058624.html|archivedate=2 November 2006|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5058624.html |title=Kriss trial told boy was set on fire as he bled to death|newspaper=[[Evening Times]]|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the killing quickly became politicised because of the racial element. After the murder there were reportedly 'racial tensions' in the area sufficient to lead to police intervention.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"/&gt;

==Arrests and first trials==
Initially, two men were arrested in connection with the crime. One man, Daanish Zahid, was found guilty of Kriss Donald's murder on 18 November 2004 and is the first person to be convicted of racially motivated murder in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Calum Macdonald, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23640996.html "Two others convicted THE FIRST TRIAL"], ''The Herald'', 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special extradition and later trial==
Three suspects were arrested in Pakistan in July 2005 and [[extradited]] to the UK in October 2005, following the intervention of [[Mohammad Sarwar (politician)|Mohammed Sarwar]], the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]].&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;

The [[Pakistani police]] had to engage in a "long struggle" to capture two of the escapees. There is no [[extradition treaty]] between Pakistan and Britain, but the Pakistani authorities agreed to extradite the suspects.&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt; There were numerous diplomatic complications around the case, including apparent divergences between government activities and those of ambassadorial officials; government figures were at times alleged to be reluctant to pursue the case for diplomatic reasons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/ministers-block-extradition-of-kriss-donald-murder-suspects-1-540009 "Ministers block extradition of Kriss Donald murder suspects"], ''The Scotsman'', 23 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three extradited suspects, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq, all in their late twenties, arrived in Scotland on 5 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4310410.stm "Glasgow murder suspects fly to UK"], BBC News, 5 October 2005.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with Donald's murder the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4314050.stm "Murder suspects appear in court"], BBC News, 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Their trial opened on 2 October 2006 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5400138.stm "Schoolboy murder trial under way"], BBC News, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2006, the three men were found guilty of the racially motivated murder of Kriss Donald. All three had denied the charge, but a jury at the High Court in [[Edinburgh]] convicted them of abduction and murder.&lt;ref name="BBC News 1"/&gt;

== Controversies surrounding the case ==

===Lack of media coverage===
The [[BBC]] has been criticised by some viewers because the case featured on national news only three times and the first trial was later largely confined to [[regional]] Scottish bulletins including the verdict itself. Although admitting that the BBC had "got it wrong", the organisation's Head of Newsgathering, [[Fran Unsworth]], largely rejected the suggestion that Donald's race played a part in the lack of reportage, instead claiming it was mostly a product of "Scottish blindness". In preference to reporting the verdict the organisation found the time to report the opening of a new [[arts centre]] in [[Gateshead]] in its running order.&lt;ref name="Newswatch"&gt;{{cite episode |title=NewsWatch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/shared/player/vid100.stm?clippos=0&amp;clipurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news_web/video/9012da68002d768/bb/09012da68002d97c_16x9_bb!asx&amp;title=NewsWatch%202%20December%202005&amp;wintype=200&amp;rhs=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4490000/newsid_4499400/bb_wm_4499440.stm&amp;cs=news&amp;fsname=bb_wm_fs&amp;bw=bb |series=[[NewsWatch (TV series)|NewsWatch]] |serieslink= |credits=Presenter: [[Raymond Snoddy]], Interviewee: [[Fran Unsworth]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC 1]], [[BBC News Channel]] |location=London, England |airdate=11 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The BBC again faced criticisms for its failure to cover the second trial in its main bulletins, waiting until day 18 to mention the issue and [[Peter Horrocks]] of the BBC apologised for the organisation's further failings.&lt;ref name="Newswatch2"&gt;{{cite episode |title=NewsWatch (TV series) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/video/63000/bb/63300_16x9_bb.asx |series=NewsWatch |serieslink= |credits=Presenter: Raymond Snoddy, Interviewee: [[Peter Horrocks]] |network=BBC |station=BBC 1, BBC News Channel |location=London, England |airdate=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Fahy]], spokesman of race issues for the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]], noted that the media as a whole tended to under-report the racist murders of white people, stating "it was a fact that it was harder to get the media interested where murder victims were young white men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/22/ukcrime.race |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Racial murders: nearly half the victims are white |first=Antony |last=Barnett |date=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British National Party]] were accused by [[First Minister of Scotland|Scotland's First Minister]] and [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] [[Jack McConnell]] among others of seeking to exploit the case for political advantage, and an open letter signed by [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]], trades unionists, and community leaders, condemned the BNP's plans to stage a visit to [[Pollokshields]]. The group did hold a rally in the area, leading to accusations that it was fuelling racial tension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/46396 sundayherald.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204154218/http://www.sundayherald.com/46396 |date=4 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police response===
A March 2004 article in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper alleged a lack of response by authorities to concerns of rising racial tensions and that [[Strathclyde Police]] had felt pressured to abandon Operation Gather, an investigation into Asian gangs in the area, for fear of offending ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Dan McDougall, [http://www.scotsman.com/news/murder-hunt-police-drop-politically-incorrect-gang-crackdown-1-518252 "Murder hunt police drop ‘politically incorrect’ gang crackdown"], ''The Scotsman'', 19 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2005 interview with a Scottish newspaper, prominent Pakistani Glaswegian [[Bashir Maan]] claimed that "fear and intimidation" had allowed problems with Asian gangs in some parts of the city to go unchecked. The article also quoted a former senior Strathclyde police officer who criticised "a culture of [[political correctness]]" which had allowed gang crime to "grow unfettered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0105s02.htm |title="Row over policing Asian gangs" |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231743/http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0105s02.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} by Imaad Azim in ''the iWitness''&lt;/ref&gt;

A BBC report suggests that another reason for inaction was lack of evidence, as locals were more prepared to make complaints than to give evidence in court.&lt;ref name="BBC News 3" /&gt; Some commentators have argued the murder was somewhat mischaracterised in the media, as well as expressing a doubt that significant ethnic tensions exist in Pollokshields, suggesting that "gangland revenge" may have played a part.&lt;ref name="www_spiked_online_com1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2081/ |title=spiked-online.com |accessdate=24 June 2007 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
Glasgow band [[Glasvegas]] wrote the song "[[Flowers &amp; Football Tops|Flowers And Football Tops]]" having been inspired by the tragedy and the likely effect it would have on the victim's parents. The band dedicated their 2008 Philip Hall Radar NME award win to Donald's memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-s-hogmanay-first-footers-stomp-1-1302563 "Edinburgh's Hogmanay: First footers' stomp"], ''Scotland on Sunday''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/t-in-the-park-preview-glasvegas-1-1435788 "T in the Park preview: Glasvegas"], ''The Scotsman'', 4 June 2008.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The extended NME interview |journal=New Musical Express |date=21 June 2008 |location=London |publisher=IPC Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial plaque was installed on a bench beside the [[River Clyde]], near to where he was killed, in memory of Donald.&lt;ref name=tranquil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/now_tranquil_the_place_where_horror_visited_1_724626 |title=Now tranquil, the place where horror visited|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=13 November 2006|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,a memorial plaque was placed on a public fence in Pollokshields close to the spot where he was kidnapped; in July 2018, friends and family gathered at the spot to remember him on what would have been his 30th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16330666.kriss-donald-poignant-tributes-left-on-what-would-have-been-his-30th-birthday/
|title=Kriss Donald: Poignant tributes left on what would have been his 30th birthday|newspaper=[[Evening Times]]|date=3 July 2018|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The murder led some people to examine their views of racism and its victims. [[Mark Easton]] cited the racist murders of Donald and also [[Murder of Ross Parker|Ross Parker]] as demonstrating how society has been forced to redefine [[racism]] and discard the erroneous definition of "[[prejudice plus power]]"—a definition which only allowed ethnic minorities to be victims of hate crime.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6128466.stm |work=BBC News |first=Mark |last=Easton |title=Racism and race crime redefined |date=8 November 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] also cited the Donald case when highlighting the lack of concern for white victims of racist murders. She drew comparisons with high-profile ethnic minority victims, asking whether Donald's murderers were "less evil than those who killed [[Stephen Lawrence]]". Alibhai-Brown came to the conclusion that treating "some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable—and a betrayal of [[anti-racism]] itself".&lt;ref name="Evening Standard" /&gt;

The '''National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) Inc.''' is a [[non-profit]] organization formed in 1960 with the purpose of awarding and maintaining credentialing for [[Respiratory Therapist]]s in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NBRC website"&gt;{{cite web |title=The National Board for Respiratory Care |url=https://www.nbrc.org/ |website=www.nbrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NBRC is the only organization in the United States which develops certification examinations for [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]]s (RRTs) and [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]]s (CRTs).  The NBRC also offers additional specialization credentialing for [[respiratory practitioner]]s that hold its certifications.  The CRT and RRT designations are the standard credential in respiratory care for licensure requirements in the portions of the [[United States]] that have enacted a [[Respiratory Care Act]].  States that license [[respiratory therapist]]s sometimes require the practitioner to maintain their NBRC credentialing to maintain their license to practice.&lt;ref name="pmid16477201"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Mathews P, Drumheller L, Carlow JJ, with the assistance of the American Association for Respiratory Care.

It has been in the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]] since 1974.  The NBRC is located at 10801 Mastin St, Suite 300, Overland Park, KS 66210.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbrc.org/Home/AboutNBRC/tabid/73/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification levels==
===Entry level certification===
Certification is the entry level and is separated as such by the NBRC.  [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]]s and Certified [[Pulmonary Function Technologist]]s may require oversight and supervision by their advanced-practice counterparts.

===Advanced practice certification===
The term the NBRC uses to designate an advanced practitioner is "registered" and the addition to an advanced practitioner registry which is not permanent but has a re-certification fee associated with it.   [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]] and [[Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist]] are currently the advanced credentialings maintained by the NBRC.

===Specialties===
The NBRC has sub-specialties for the [[Respiratory Therapist]] designations.  Both the CRT and the RRT are eligible to sit for additional credentialing but the CRT still requires the same supervision by the RRT in clinical applications.

* '''Sleep Disorders Specialist''' — The sleep disorder specialist (RRT-SDS or CRT-SDS) is a credential recognized by the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] for the role of Scoring in sleep studies.
* '''Neonatal &amp; Pediatric Specialist''' — The neonatal and pediatric specialist (RRT-NPS or CRT-NPS) is a [[respiratory therapist]] that may work in advanced care in pediatrics and neonatology centers and units.
* '''Adult Critical Care Specialist''' — The adult critical care specialist is only available to the RRT (RRT-ACCS) that is a pulmonary and hemodymanic specialist in intensive medicine in adult practice.

==Testing==
NBRC examinations are developed by NBRC staff and administered by [http://www.goamp.com/ AMP, a PSI business].

===Examinations maintained by the NBRC===
Students in the United States awarded an Associate of Science in Respiratory Care are qualified to sit for the '''NBRC-ELE''' and then the '''NBRC-WRE''' and '''NBRC-CSE''' then apply for state [[licensure]] as a [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]].&lt;ref name="pmid20420732"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Barnes TA, Gale DD, Kacmarek RM, Kageler WV | title=Competencies needed by graduate respiratory therapists in 2015 and beyond. | journal=Respir Care | year= 2010 | volume= 55 | issue= 5 | pages= 601–16 | pmid=20420732 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19245732"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kacmarek RM, Durbin CG, Barnes TA, Kageler WV, Walton JR, O'Neil EH | title=Creating a vision for respiratory care in 2015 and beyond. | journal=Respir Care | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 3 | pages= 375–89 | pmid=19245732 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Respiratory Therapist====
* '''NBRC-TMC''' — The '''Therapist Multiple-Choice Examination''' (TMC or ELE) is designed to objectively measure essential knowledge, skills, and abilities required of entry-level respiratory therapists, as well as determine eligibility for the Clinical Simulation Examination. There are two established cut scores for the Therapist Multiple-Choice Examination.  If a candidate achieves the lower cut score, he or she will earn the CRT credential.  If a candidate achieves the higher cut score, he or she will earn the CRT credential AND become eligible for the Clinical Simulation Examination (provided that those eligibility requirements are met and the candidate is eligible to earn the RRT credential). Candidate must be 18 years old and must have either: a minimum of an associate degree from a respiratory therapist education program supported, or be accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care]] (CoARC) or accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs]] (CAAHEP) and graduated on or before November 11, 2009, or hold the [[Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists]] (CSRT) RRT credential. The TMC consists of 160 multiple-choice questions (140 scored items and 20 pretest items) distributed among three major content areas: Patient Data Evaluation and Recommendations, Troubleshooting and Quality Control of Equipment and Infection Control, and Initiation and Modification of Interventions. Candidates are given three hours to complete the TMC Examination.
* '''NBRC-CSE''' — The '''Clinical Simulation Examination''' (CSE) is a test in which the test-taker accepts the role as an autonomous respiratory therapist handling all sorts of intervention and therapy.  Candidates that pass both the NBRC-TMC at the higher cut score and the NBRC-CSE will earn the RRT credential. CSE lasts 4 hours and consists of 22 separate patient management problems designed to simulate the clinical practice of respiratory care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrc.org RRT Examination Content ''as of August 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NBRC-WRE''' — an examination for the advanced credentialing of previously certified respiratory therapists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbrc.org/Examinations/RRT/tabid/60/Default.aspx WRE]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specialization of the Respiratory Therapist====
* NBRC-SDS — The Sleep Disorders Specialty Examination program is designed specifically for a respiratory therapist with an NBRC respiratory care credential and experience or education in the field of sleep medicine. Those who are actively certified as a Sleep Disorders Specialist are permitted to use the post-nominal letters "SDS", "RRT-SDS" or "CRT-SDS" depending on their level and preference.&lt;ref name="NBRC website"/&gt;

'''Obesity in Nauru''' is a major health concern for the nation. In 2007 [[Forbes.com]] reported that, according to the [[World Health Organization|World Health organization]]'s (WHO) latest estimate, [[Nauru]] has the highest percentage of [[overweight]] inhabitants among all countries. The estimation identified 94.5% of its residents as overweight.&lt;ref name="Forbes Fattest Countries"&gt;{{cite web|last=Streib|first=Lauren|title=World's Fattest Countries|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat.html|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=2 August 2007|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[obesity]] rate is 71.7%,&lt;ref name="Asahi Shimbun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nishiyama|first=Takaaki|title=Nauru: An island plagued by obesity and diabetes|url=http://globe.asahi.com/feature/article/2012050200007.html|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|date=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=

People with BMI more than or equal to 25 are classified as overweight, and people with BMI more than or equal to 30 are classified as obese.&lt;ref name="Forbes Fattest Countries"/&gt;

The average [[body weight]] among Nauruans is estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Asahi Shimbun"/&gt; Nauru has an average BMI between 34 and 35. &lt;ref name="How tiny Nauru"&gt;{{cite news|last=Laurance|first=Jeremy|title=How tiny Nauru became world's fattest nation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/how-tiny-nauru-became-worlds-fattest-nation-2203835.html|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of obesity==
Before Nauru [[History of Nauru#Independence|gained independence]] in 1968, there was a culture of fishing and gardening. The Nauruan diet then was primarily composed of [[marine fish]], fruits,&lt;ref name="Asahi Shimbun"/&gt; [[root vegetable]]s, and [[coconuts]].&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"/&gt; As per the analysis by ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' correspondent Takaaki Nishiyama, black-and-white-photographs taken during this time depict well-built and fit men and women. But after Nauru gained independence, there was a major economic growth resulting from mining. The profits from the mining activities were distributed among the citizens and Nauru's per capita income became very high. As a consequence, people did not feel the need to work. Over time, the minerals that made the country rich had been mined, causing the nation to sink back into hard economic times. According to a study conducted by the [[Government of Nauru]] and the WHO, the import of western food significantly reduced the existing culture of fishing and gardening, and from the 1980s, Nauruans were used to a markedly sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet. This resulted in what the study described as "the worst health conditions in the Pacific region".&lt;ref name="Asahi Shimbun"/&gt;

Ninety percent of the land area of Nauru is covered with [[Phosphate#Occurrence and mining|phosphate deposits]]. A land with phosphate deposits is inarable. This is why Nauru has very little arable land and relies on importing processed food,&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes Nauru"&gt;{{cite web|last=Streib|first=Lauren|title=Nauru: 94.5 % overweight|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat_slide_2.html?thisSpeed=undefined|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=2 August 2007|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is high in both sugar and fat,&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"/&gt; from large Oceanian countries like Australia and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Forbes Nauru"/&gt; Most, if not all, of the diet on Nauru is high fat and high sugar foods, that contain very little nutritional value.

Apart from unhealthy diet, lack of physical exercise, and lack of proper [[health education]], cultural attitude towards obesity has played an important role in the high obesity rate in the country. According to the [[University of Queensland]] professor and [[Australasia|South Pacific]] researcher Clive Moore, obesity is seen as a sign of wealth in Nauru.&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"/&gt;

[[Obesity in the Pacific|Obesity in Pacific islands]] is common.

==Consequence==
As a consequence of high rate of obesity, Nauru has the highest rate of adult [[diabetes]] in the world. The [[International Diabetes Federation]] (IDF) identified 31% of Nauruans as diabetic.&lt;ref name="Forbes Nauru"/&gt; This rate is as high as 45% among the age group 55-64.&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"/&gt;

==Efforts to cure obesity==
Nauruan health authorities have taken steps to cure obesity. People are told to walk around the {{convert|3|mi|km}} perimeter of the [[Nauru International Airport]]. Exercise sessions and sports are organised routinely.&lt;ref name="Independent Nauru"/&gt;

'''Osteitis pubis''' is a noninfectious inflammation of the pubis symphysis (also known as the pubic symphysis, symphysis pubis, or symphysis pubica), causing varying degrees of lower abdominal and pelvic pain. Osteitis pubis was first described in patients who had undergone suprapubic surgery, and it remains a well-known complication of invasive procedures about the pelvis. It may also occur as an inflammatory process in athletes. The incidence and cause of osteitis pubis as an inflammatory process versus an infectious process continues to fuel debate among physicians when confronted by a patient who presents complaining of abdominal pain or pelvic pain and overlapping symptoms. It was first described in 1924.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of osteitis pubis can include loss of flexibility in the groin region, dull aching [[pain]] in the groin, or in more severe cases, a sharp stabbing pain when running, kicking, changing directions, or even during routine activities such as standing up or getting out of a car. Tenderness on palpation is also commonly present in the adductor longus origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fricker|first=Peter|journal=Sports Medicine|date=October 1991|volume=12|issue=4|pages=266–279|doi=10.2165/00007256-199112040-00005|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-199112040-00005|accessdate=11 May 2014|title=Osteitis Pubis in Athletes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

* Pregnancy/childbirth
* Gynecologic surgery
* Urologic surgery
* Athletic activities (e.g. running, football, American football, ice hockey, tennis)
* Major trauma
* Repeated minor trauma
* Rheumatological disorders
* Unknown cause

In the pre-antibiotic era, osteitis pubis was an occasional complication of pelvic surgery, and in particular, of [[prostatectomy|retropubic prostatectomy]].

=== Overload or training errors ===
*Exercising on hard surfaces (like concrete)
*Exercising on uneven ground
*Beginning an exercise program after a long lay-off period
*Increasing exercise intensity or duration too quickly
*Exercising in worn out or ill-fitting shoes

=== Biomechanical inefficiencies ===
*Faulty foot and body mechanics and gait disturbances
*Poor running or walking mechanics
*Tight, stiff muscles in the hips, groin, and buttocks
*Muscular imbalances
*Leg length differences

==Diagnosis==
Osteitis pubis may be diagnosed with an [[X-ray]], where irregularity and widening of the [[pubic symphysis]] are hallmark findings. Similar change is also demonstrated with [[Computed Tomography|Computed Tomography (CT)]], but the multi-planar nature of CT has a higher sensitivity than conventional [[radiography]]. Though not well visualised on [[ultrasound]] (US), thickening of the superior joint capsule with cyst formation is a clue to the diagnosis, as well as secondary changes (i.e. tendinosis) of the adjacent adductor muscles - particularly the adductor longus and rectus abdominis. US is also useful for excluding a [[hernia]], which may co-exist with osteitis pubis and warrant additional treatment.

Both US and CT may be used for injecting the pubic symphysis with [[corticosteroid]] as part of an athlete's treatment program.&lt;ref name="pmid18806129"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koulouris G. |title=Imaging review of groin pain in elite athletes: an anatomic approach to imaging findings. |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=191 |issue=4 |pages=962–972 |year=2008 |pmid=18806129 |doi=10.2214/AJR.07.3410}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] combines the diagnostic advantages of CT and ultrasound, also shows bone marrow edema, and has the advantages of not being operator dependent (unlike US), nor using radiation (such as CT and X-rays). As such, MRI is the modality of choice for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment planning.&lt;ref name="pmid18487535"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zoga AC, Kavanagh EC, Omar IM, Morrison WB, Koulouris G, Lopez H, Chaabra A, Domesek J, Meyers WC |title=Athletic pubalgia and the "sports hernia": MR imaging findings. |journal=Radiology |volume=247 |issue=3 |pages=797–807 |year=2008 |pmid=18487535 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2473070049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prevention==
Until recently, there was no specific treatment for osteitis pubis. To treat the pain and inflammation caused by osteitis pubis, [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|antiinflammatory medication]], stretching, and strengthening of the stabilizing muscles are often prescribed. In Argentina, Topol et al. have studied the use of glucose and lidocaine injections ("prolotherapy", or regenerative injection therapy) in an attempt to restart the healing process and generate new connective tissue in 72 athletes with chronic groin/abdominal pain who had failed a conservative treatment trial. The treatment consisted of monthly injections to ligament attachments on the pubis. Their pain had lasted an average of 11 months, ranging from 3–60 months. The average number of treatments received was 3, ranging from 1–6. Their pain improved by 82%. Six athletes did not improve, and the remaining 66 returned to unrestricted sport in an average of 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topol GA, Reeves KD | year = 2008 | title = Regenerative injection of elite athletes with career-altering chronic groin pain who fail conservative treatment: a consecutive case series | url = | journal = Am J Phys Med Rehabil | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 890–902 | doi=10.1097/phm.0b013e31818377b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical intervention - such as wedge resection of the pubis symphysis - is sometimes attempted in severe cases,&lt;ref name="pmid17702996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paajanen H, Hermunen H, Karonen J |title=Pubic Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Surgically and Conservatively Treated Athletes With Osteitis Pubis Compared to Asymptomatic Athletes During Heavy Training |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume= 36|issue= 1|pages= 117–21|year=2007 |pmid=17702996 |doi=10.1177/0363546507305454}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its success rate is not high, and the surgery itself may lead to later pelvic problems. Recent advances in the field of hip arthroscopy have introduced endoscopic resection of the pubic symphysis which has a potentially higher success rate with less complications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Domb |first1=Benjamin |title=Endoscopic Pubic Symphysis Resection |url=https://www.vumedi.com/video/hip-arthroscopy-pubic-symphesectomy-for-recalcitrant-osteitis-pubis/ |website=VuMedi}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The [[Australian Football League]] has taken some steps to reduce the incidence of osteitis pubis, in particular recommending that clubs restrict the amount of bodybuilding which young players are required to carry out, and in general reducing the physical demands on players before their bodies mature.

Osteitis pubis, if not treated early and correctly, can more often than not end a sporting individual's career, or give them an uncertain playing future.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of osteitis pubis among Australian footballers has increased sharply over the past decade. There are believed to be three reasons for this:

* The increasing physical demands of Australian rules football. As the game has become more professionalised, with players becoming full-time athletes, such factors as running speed, kicking length, jumping, and tackling have all increased, placing increasing stress on the pubic region.
* The increasing hardness of the surfaces of football grounds. Grounds are better drained than in the past, and the game is increasingly played in roofed stadiums, in which the grounds receive no rain. Australian football evolved as a winter game played on soft, muddy grounds, and modern surfaces have made muscle and bone injuries more common.
* The increasing demand for size and strength among footballers. This has led young players to concentrate on building muscle mass before their bodies are fully mature. The additional strain that highly developed abdominal muscles place on the pubic bone explains the higher prevalence of osteitis pubis in young players. Some develop the condition while still playing school-level football.

==Pregnancy==
Damage can occur to the ligaments surrounding and bridging the pubic joint (symphysis) as a result of the hormone relaxin, which is secreted around the time of birth to soften the pelvic ligaments for labor. At this time repetitive stress or falling, tripping, and slipping can injure ligaments more easily. The hormone usually disappears after childbirth and the ligaments become strong again. In some women the weakness persists, and activities such as carrying their baby or stepping up even a small step can cause a slight but continuous separation or shearing in the ligaments of the symphysis where they attach to the joint surfaces, even causing lesions in the fibrocartilage and pubic bones. Symptoms include one or more of the following: pain in the pubic area, hips, lower back, and thighs. This can take months (or even years) to go away.

X-rays taken during the early stages of osteitis pubis can be misleading - pain may be felt, but the damage doesn't appear on the films unless stork views (i.e. standing on one leg) are obtained. As the process continues and progresses, later pictures will show evidence of bony erosion in the pubic bones. Osteitis pubis can also be associated with [[pelvic girdle pain]].

'''Parametritis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the [[parametrium]] ([[connective tissue]] adjacent to the [[uterus]]).

It is considered a form of [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].&lt;ref name="urlBroad Ligament Disorders: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/275773-overview |title=Broad Ligament Disorders: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parametritis is inflammation of the ligaments around the uterus. Parametritis is different from perimetritis which is inflammation of the serosa surrounding the uterus.

{{Use British English|date=July 2011}}

A '''patient safety organization''' (PSO) is a group, institution or association that improves medical care by reducing [[medical errors]]. In the 1990s, [[Patient safety#Prevalence of adverse events|reports]] in several countries revealed a staggering number of patient injuries and deaths each year due to avoidable adverse health care events. In the United States, the [[Institute of Medicine]] report (1999) called for a broad national effort to include the establishment of patient safety centers, expanded reporting of adverse events and development of safety programs in health care organizations.&lt;ref name=IOM&gt;{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=1999 | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9728&amp;page=R19| title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (1999) | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826010429/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9728&amp;page=R19|archivedate=26 August 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizations that developed ranged from governmental to private, and some founded by industry, professional or consumer groups. Common functions of [[patient safety]] organizations are data collection and analysis, reporting, education, funding and advocacy.

==Functions==
[[Patient safety]] organizations may use several approaches to reducing [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse events]]:
# Collect data on the prevalence and individual details of errors.
# Analyze sources of error by [[root cause analysis]].
# Propose and disseminate methods for error prevention.
# Design and conduct pilot projects to study safety initiatives, including monitoring of results.
# Raise awareness and inform the public, health professionals, providers, purchasers and employers.
# Conduct fundraising and provide funding for research and safety projects
# Advocate for regulatory and legislative changes.

==Governmental organizations==

===World Health Organization===

====World Alliance for Patient Safety====

In response to a 2002 World Health Assembly Resolution, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety in October 2004. The goal was to develop standards for patient safety and assist UN member states to improve the safety of health care.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/patientsafety/en Patient Safety], retrieved July 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance raises awareness and political commitment to improve the safety of care and facilitates the development of patient safety policy and practice in all WHO Member States. Each year, the Alliance delivers a number of programmes covering systemic and technical aspects to improve patient safety around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/patientsafety/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Fifty-Ninth World Health Assembly in May 2006, the Secretariat reported that the Alliance held patient safety meetings in five of the six WHO regions and 40 technical workshops in 18 countries. Since the launch of the Alliance in October 2004, significant progress was achieved in six areas:
# The First Global Patient Safety Challenge, which for 2005-2006  (addressing health care-associated infection) developed the ''WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in health care : first global patient safety challenge : clean care is safer care.|year=2009|publisher=World Health Organization, Patient Safety|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=978-92-4-159790-6|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597906_eng.pdf|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A patient involvement group, Patients for Patient Safety, built networks of patients’ organizations from around the world, through regional workshops.
# A patient safety [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] was developed to classify data on patient safety problems.
# Prevalence studies conducted on patient harm in ten developing countries.
# A WHO Collaborating Centre was established to develop and disseminate safety solutions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/patientsafety/information_centre/en Patient Safety Information Centre], retrieved July 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Patients for Patient Safety (PfPS)====
Patients for Patient Safety is part of the World Alliance for Patient Safety launched in 2004 by the WHO. The project emphasizes the central role patients and consumers can play in efforts to improve the quality and safety of healthcare around the world. PFPS works with a global network of patients, consumers, caregivers, and consumer organizations to support patient involvement in patient safety programmes, both within countries and in the global programmes of the World Alliance for Patient Safety.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/patientsafety/patients_for_patient/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===

====Therapeutic Goods Administration and Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee====
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is a unit of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. The TGA approves and monitors prescription and non-prescription drugs (including herbal products), medical supplies and devices, and blood and biological products. Risks to users are assessed prior to product introduction, and manufacturers are regularly audited for efficacy, quality and safety. Manufacturers are required to report [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse drug effects]] to the [[Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee]] (ADRAC) of the TGA; reporting by medical professionals and consumers is voluntary. ADRAC notifies medical professionals and the public by recalls and alerts on its website and publications.&lt;ref&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia): [http://www.tga.gov.au/recalls/index.htm Drug recall and alerts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513224757/http://www.tga.gov.au/recalls/index.htm |date=2009-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, the Australian and New Zealand Governments signed an agreement to establish a joint regulatory organization for therapeutic products. The Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority (ANZTPA) will replace the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (Medsafe), and be accountable to the Australian and New Zealand Governments. Implementing legislation is scheduled for introduction into both countries' parliaments in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority: [http://www.anztpa.org/index.htm Introduction to the project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717011008/http://www.anztpa.org/index.htm |date=2006-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2007, the New Zealand State Services Minister Annette King announced that "The Government is not proceeding at this stage with legislation that would have enabled the establishment of a joint agency with Australia to regulate therapeutic products." She further advised that "The [New Zealand] Government does not have the numbers in Parliament to put in place a sensible, acceptable compromise that would satisfy all parties at this time. The Australian Government has been informed of the situation and agrees that suspending negotiations on the joint authority is a sensible course of action."&lt;ref&gt;NZ Government Media Release: [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/therapeutics+products+and+medicines+bill+hold Therapeutics Products and Medicines Bill on hold]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care====
The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) was established by the Australian, State and Territory Governments to lead and coordinate national improvements in safety and quality. The Commission replaced the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care in 2006.

The Commission engages in collaborative work in patient safety and healthcare quality that benefits from national coordination. This includes the development of the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights and the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, improving areas such as patient identification, medication safety, clinical handover and open disclosure, and reducing healthcare associated infection. The Commission has also developed the National Safety and Quality Framework to improve the safety and quality of the Australian health system.

Other key areas of work for the Commission include National Health Service accreditation, recognising and responding to clinical deterioration, patient centred care, safety and quality in mental health and primary care and the development of national safety and quality indicators as part of the information strategies activity.

In its role primarily as a coordination and facilitation body, the Commission utilises evidence and data and the experience, enthusiasm and commitment of consumers, clinicians, managers and other stakeholders to influence the system to make changes for the safety and quality of health care in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care: [http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/index.cfm Home page]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand Health Quality &amp; Safety Commission===
The New Zealand Health Quality &amp; Safety Commission was established in November 2010 as a [[Crown entity]] under the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 to lead and co-ordinate work across the health and disability sector for the purposes of:

* monitoring and improving the quality and safety of health and disability support services
* helping providers across the whole sector to improve the quality and safety of services.

The Commission aims to reduce avoidable deaths and harm, reduce wastage, and make the best use of the health dollar. It works towards the New Zealand Triple Aim for quality improvement:

* improved quality, safety and experience of care
* improved health and equity for all populations
* best value for public health system resources.

Commission programmes include medication safety, infection prevention and control, reportable events, consumer engagement and participation, and mortality review committees.

===United Kingdom===

====National Patient Safety Agency====
The [[National Patient Safety Agency]] (NPSA) is an [[NHS special health authority]] created in July 2001 to improve patient safety within the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) by encouraging voluntary reporting of medical errors, conducting analysis and initiating preventative measures. Since 2005, the NPSA has also been responsible for: safety aspects of hospital design, cleanliness and food; safe research practices through the National Research Ethics Service (NRES); and performance of individual doctors and dentists, through the National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS).&lt;ref&gt;National Health Service: [http://www.npsa.nhs.uk National Patient Safety Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; The NPSA identifies patient safety deficiencies with the input of clinical experts and patients, develops solutions and monitors results of corrections within the NHS. Initiatives and alerts include hand hygiene, information for doctors and patients on steps to reduce risk of error, vaccine safety and disclosure of error to injured patients. In addition, the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) allows NHS employees to provide the NPSA with reports anonymously.

====National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence====
The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] is an independent organisation that produces guidance on public health, health technologies and clinical practice in England and Wales. NICE has three centres of excellence. The Centre for Public Health Excellence develops public health guidance, with information for patients on diagnosis and treatment of specific illnesses and conditions. The Centre for Health Technology Evaluation recommends medicines and evaluates the safety and efficacy of procedures within the [[National Health Service]]. The Centre for Clinical Practice develops evidence-based [[Guideline (medical)|clinical guidelines]] for clinicians on the appropriate treatment of people with specific diseases.&lt;ref&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=home Providing national guidance on promoting good health]&lt;/ref&gt; NICE and the [[#National Patient Safety Agency .28NPSA.29|National Patient Safety Agency]] (NPSA) cooperate in risk assessment of new technology, monitoring safety incidents associated with procedures, and providing solutions if adverse outcomes are reported. In addition, NICE and NPSA share reporting in areas known as "Confidential Enquiries": maternal or infant deaths, childhood deaths to age 16, deaths in persons with mental illness, and perioperative and unexpected medical deaths.

===United States===
On July 29, 2005, the United States Congress established guidelines for Patient Safety Organizations under the Patient Safety Quality Act of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (June 2006): [http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/psoact.htm Overview]. Accessed 2008-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the legislation is to provide incentives for clinicians to participate in voluntary initiatives to improve the outcomes of patient care, provide information about the underlying causes of errors in the delivery of health care, and to disseminate this information in order to speed the pace of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: PSO Overview (February 2008): [http://www.pso.ahrq.gov/psos/overview.htm Highlights of the Notice of Proposed Rule-making] Accessed 2008-06-08&lt;/ref&gt;

====Composition====
President Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry completed its work on March 12, 1998. Its final report. entitled "Quality First: Better Health Care for All Americans," recommends the following characteristics of a patient safety organization:&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry: [http://www.hcqualitycommission.gov ''Quality First: Better Health Care for All Americans''] (March 12, 1998), Retrieved on July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be located in an entity that is credible and respected.
* Be located in an entity that does not have public or private regulatory responsibilities (i.e., it should '''not''' be a licensing, accrediting, or compliance entity).
* Have the ability to collect and analyze data.
* Have mechanisms for communicating with a variety of health care entities, facilities, providers, and plans.
* Be linked with initiatives for conducting interdisciplinary research and demonstrations addressing health care quality improvement.

====Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality====
In 2001, the US Congress responded to the IOM recommendation to create a National Center for Patient Safety by allocating $50 million annually for patient safety research to the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ), the lead federal agency for health care safety. The AHRQ organizes patient safety activities, provides grants to other organizations, serves as a clearinghouse for safety information, and publishes [[Guideline (medical)|guidelines]] for [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] or "best practices". By 2006, the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) contained more than 1,700 disease-specific diagnosis, management and treatment recommendations, developed from current medical literature.&lt;ref name=guidelines&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.guideline.gov/about/about.aspx The National Guideline Clearinghouse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715174429/http://www.guideline.gov/about/about.aspx |date=2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the NGC is to provide health professionals and institutions, health plans and health care purchasers an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective clinical practice guidelines. Adoption of guidelines has been slowed by physician and hospital concern that practice guidelines threaten physician autonomy and authority, fuel [[malpractice]] liability, and allow [[managed care]] insurers to curtail patient care expenditures.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;American College of Surgeons Bulletin: [http://www.facs.org/ahp/proliab/pracgid.html Practice guidelines and liability implications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926200323/http://www.facs.org/ahp/proliab/pracgid.html |date=2006-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines for Clinical Practice: From Development to Use (Institute of Medicine, 1992) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309045894/html/116.html Concerns about Tort Liability]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines for Clinical Practice: From Development to Use (Institute of Medicine, 1992) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309045894/html/115.html Medical Review Criteria and Managing Benefit Costs]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Secretary of [[Health and Human Services]], the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality coordinates the Patient Safety Task Force composed of three other agencies with regulatory and data collection responsibilities: the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and its National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) and state [[Quality improvement organizations]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;Tommy G.

====Food and Drug Administration====
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] is an agency of the United States government that regulates food, drugs, medical devices and biological products for human use. The FDA receives medication error reports on marketed human drugs from direct contacts and manufacturer's reports, and in 1992, began monitoring medication error reports that are forwarded from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the [[Patient safety organization#Institute for Safe Medication Practices|Institute for Safe Medication Practices]] (ISMP).

The effectiveness of the FDA's drug safety monitoring procedures was called into question after several approved drugs were shown to have serious side-effects.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In September 2006, an [[Institute of Medicine]] report commissioned by the FDA found that its drug safety system is limited by inadequate funding, insufficient regulatory authority, and a lack of oversight by experts free of pharmaceutical industry ties.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine (News Release, September 22, 2006) [http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11750 Fixing Drug Safety System Will Require 'New Drug' Symbol on Labels, Major Boost in FDA Staff and Funding, and Increased Public Access to Information].

====The Leapfrog Group{{anchor|Leapfrog}}====
Staggered by increasing health insurance costs, several large US companies met in 1998 to influence quality and affordability. The resulting Leapfrog Group agreed to base their purchase of health care on principles that "encourage provider quality improvement and consumer involvement".&lt;ref&gt;The Leapfrog Group: [http://www.leapfroggroup.org/about_us/leapfrog-factsheet Fact Sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709204256/http://www.leapfroggroup.org/about_us/leapfrog-factsheet |date=2006-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was officially launched in November 2000 with the initial focus provided by the 1999 Institute of Medicine report – reducing preventable medical mistakes (the report recommended that large employers leverage their purchasing power for the quality and safety of health care). The "leapfrog" concept involved large advances stimulated by rewarding hospitals that implement significant improvements (the Leapfrog Hospital Rewards Program&lt;ref&gt;The Leapfrog Group: [http://www.leapfroggroup.org/for_hospitals/fh-incentives_and_rewards Hospital Incentives Program] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712153655/http://www.leapfroggroup.org/for_hospitals/fh-incentives_and_rewards |date=2006-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The quality practices mandated are [[computerized physician order entry]] (CPOE), evidence-based hospital referral, intensive care unit (ICU) staffing by physicians experienced in critical care medicine, and a "Leapfrog Safe Practices Score", based on the National Quality Forum endorsed Safe Practices.&lt;ref&gt;National Quality Forum: [http://www.qualityforum.org/news/txhospGrp1publicweb.pdf Hospital Care National Performance Measures (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional initiatives now include public reporting of health care quality and outcomes (hospital quality ratings) to influence consumers' choices.&lt;ref&gt;The Leapfrog Group: [http://www.leapfroggroup.org/cp Hospital Quality and Safety Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; Leapfrog now includes more than 170 large private and public healthcare purchasers providing health benefits to more than 37 million employees and retirees,&lt;ref&gt;The Leapfrog Group: [http://www.leapfroggroup.org/for_members/who_are_members/full_member_list Members] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618120952/http://www.leapfroggroup.org/for_members/who_are_members/full_member_list |date=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the [[Business Roundtable]], the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] and Leapfrog members.

====Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations====
Founded in 1951, the [[Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations]] (JCAHO) is an independent, not-for-profit organization that evaluates and accredits nearly 15,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. An organization must undergo an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every three years. The scope of reviews by JCAHO is broad, including hospitals, home care agencies, medical equipment providers, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, surgical centers and medical laboratories. Passing a survey is crucial for most organizations, since accreditation by JCAHO is required for participation in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and some state and private health care programs. Since the accreditation rate is over 90%, there have been questions raised regarding the effectiveness of these surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gaul | first = Gilbert M. | title = Accreditors Blamed for Overlooking Problems | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 2005-07-25 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/24/AR2005072401023.html | accessdate = 2006-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, JCAHO began including outcomes and other performance data into the accreditation process (the "ORYX initiative"). Information gained allowed the Joint Commission to develop National Patient Safety Goals to promote specific improvements in patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;JCAHO [http://www.jointcommission.org/PatientSafety/NationalPatientSafetyGoals National Patient Safety Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The Goals highlight problem areas in health care and describe evidence-based solutions. Examples include prevention of falls, patient identification, reducing [[hospital infections]] and [[pressure ulcers]], and improving hospital staff communication. In addition, the Joint Commission created a "do not use" list of abbreviations&lt;ref&gt;JCAHO  [http://www.jointcommission.org/PatientSafety/DoNotUseList "do not use" list] of abbreviations&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 to avoid acronyms and symbols that lead to misinterpretation.

Identifying [[sentinel event]]s and analyzing the root causes has been a focus of JCAHO since 1996; the first eight alerts were published in 1998. The Commission defines a sentinel event as "any unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof."&lt;ref&gt;JCAHO: {http://www.jcipatientsafety.org/show.asp?durki=9751&amp;site=165&amp;return=9368 Sentinel Events}&lt;/ref&gt; The health care facility experiencing the sentinel event is expected to complete a thorough [[root cause analysis]], make improvements to the underlying processes, and monitor the effectiveness of the changes.  Although the cause of most sentinel events is human error, changes in organizational systems will reduce the likelihood of human error in the future and protect patients from harm when human error does occur. Specific causes of sentinel events and the solutions that hospitals then used successfully to reduce risks are publicized by JCAHO annually. Alerts have included issues as varied as wrong site surgery, restraint deaths, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] and [[medication errors]] and patient abductions.

In 2005, JCAHO established an International Center for Patient Safety to collaborate with international patient safety organizations to identify, develop and share safety solutions, conduct joint research, and advocate public policy changes. Educational materials to help patients prevent medical errors, sentinel event alerts and other resources are provide on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;JCAHO: [http://www.jcipatientsafety.org International Center For Patient Safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

MEDMARX, an internet-based error and drug reaction reporting program, is designed for use in hospitals. The USP analyzes the data it receives through its reporting programs, develops professional education programs and disseminates alerts related to medication errors.&lt;ref&gt;United States Pharmacopeia: [http://www.usp.org/patientSafety/newsletters/practitionerReportingNews Practitioners' Reporting News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712124130/http://www.usp.org/patientSafety/newsletters/practitionerReportingNews/ |date=2006-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEDMARX report released in 2007 analyzed 11,000 medication errors during surgery in 500 hospitals between 1998 and 2005. The analysis showed that medication errors that happen in the operating room or recovery areas are three times more likely to harm a patient than errors occurring in other types of hospital care. {{As of|2007}}, this was the largest known analysis of medical errors related to surgery.&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;{{cite web | last=Gardner | first=Amanda | date=6 March 2007 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/06/AR2007030601334.html | title=Medication Errors During Surgeries Particularly Dangerous | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prevalence of tobacco use''' is reported by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which focuses on cigarette smoking due to reported data limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/indicators/compendium/2008/2ptu/en/ |title=Prevalence of current tobacco use among adults aged ≥ 15 years (percentage) |accessdate=2009-01-02 |format= |work= |publisher=World Health Organization |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211143334/http://www.who.int/whosis/indicators/compendium/2008/2ptu/en/ |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smoking]] has therefore been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption.&lt;ref name="WHOMayoReport"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/resources/publications/mayo/en/index.html | title=Mayo report on addressing the worldwide tobacco epidemic through effective, evidence-based treatment | accessdate=2009-01-02 | work= | publisher=World Health Organization | location= | pages=2 | language= | doi= | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking is generally five times more prevalent among men than women;&lt;ref name="HNPGuindonBoisclair13-16"/&gt; however, the gender gap differs across countries and is smaller in younger age groups.&lt;ref name="WomenTobaccoChallenges5-6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/WomenMonograph.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and the Tobacco Epidemic: Challenges for the 21st Century|accessdate=2009-01-02|author=The World Health Organization, and the Institute for Global Tobacco Control, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health|year=2001|publisher=World Health Organization|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2001SurgeonGeneralWomen47"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2001/sgr_women_chapters.htm |title=Surgeon General's Report—Women and Smoking |accessdate=2009-01-03 |year=2001 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |page=47 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204062326/http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2001/sgr_women_chapters.htm |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries smoking rates for men have peaked and have begun to decline, and also started to stall or decline for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Richard|last1=Peto|first2=Alan D|last2=Lopez|first3=Jillian|last3=Boreham|first4=Michael|last4=Thun|title=Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000: indirect estimates from national vital statistics|url=http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~tobacco/SMK_All_PAGES.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-22|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=9|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224232603/http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~tobacco/SMK_All_PAGES.pdf|archive-date=2005-02-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking prevalence has changed little since the mid-1990s, before which time it declined in English-speaking countries due to the implementation of [[tobacco control]]. However, the number of smokers worldwide has increased from 721 million in 1980 to 967 million in 2012 and the number of cigarettes smoked increased from 4.96 trillion to 6.25 trillion due to population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ng|first1=Marie|title=Smoking Prevalence and Cigarette Consumption in 187 Countries, 1980-2012|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Jan 8, 2014|pages=183–192|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1812960|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.284692|volume=311|pmid=24399557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western countries, smoking is more prevalent among populations with [[mental disorder|mental health]] problems, with [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] and [[physical dependence|drug]] problems, among [[crime|criminal]]s, and among the [[Homelessness|homeless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=West, Robert  |author2=Shiffman, Saul |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Fast Facts: Smoking Cessation|publisher=Health Press Ltd.|year=2007|isbn=978-1-903734-98-8|pages=20, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, about 20% of young teens (aged 13–15) smoked worldwide. 80,000 to 100,000 children begin smoking every day. Half of those who begin smoking in [[adolescent]] years are projected to go on to smoke for 15 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="WHO2002FactSheet"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/fact_sheets/fs_20020528.htm |title=WHO/WPRO-Smoking Statistics |accessdate=2009-01-01 |date=2002-05-28 |work= |publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108181404/http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/fact_sheets/fs_20020528.htm |archivedate=November 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states that "Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor". Of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies. Rates of smoking have leveled off or declined in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Countries ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia the incidence of smoking is in decline, with figures from the 2011-12 Australian Health Survey showing 18% of the population to be current smokers,&lt;ref name="ABS Australian Health Survey 2011-12" &gt;{{cite web|title=Table 7: Smoker status by age and sex, Australia|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&amp;43640do007_20112012.xls&amp;4364.0.55.001&amp;Data Cubes&amp;2B9F30C81002A8C1CA257AA30014C2AA&amp;0&amp;2011-12&amp;29.10.2012&amp;Previous|work=Australian Health Survey: First Results, 2011-12|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decline from 28% in 1989-90.&lt;ref name="ABS Tobacco smoking 2007-08" &gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Smoking in Australia, 2007–08|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4841.0Chapter32011|work=Facts at your Fingertips: Health, 2011|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the indigenous population, the rate was much higher: 50% of men and 44% of women reported being current smokers in 2007–08.&lt;ref name="ABS Tobacco Smoking in Australia 2007-08 Table 2.1" &gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Smoking in Australia 2007-08 Table 2.1|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&amp;tobacco smoking in australia.xls&amp;4841.0&amp;Data Cubes&amp;F12AFAED1EDDA9B5CA25784F000D5DCE&amp;0&amp;2011&amp;11.03.2011&amp;Previous|work=Facts at your Fingertips: Health, 2011|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People aged 25 to 34 are the most likely to smoke (24%), with a marked decline in smoking rates as age increases past 45 years in 2011-12.&lt;ref name="ABS Australian Health Survey 2011-12" /&gt;

In 2007–08, the prevalence of smoking was strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage: a greater proportion of men (33%) and women (26%) who live in the most disadvantaged 20% of areas were current smokers than those who live in the least disadvantaged 20% of areas (12% and 11% respectively).&lt;ref name="ABS Tobacco smoking 2007-08" /&gt;

In 2016 the daily smoking rate is less than 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/smoking-rates-at-record-lows-as-number-of-smokers-almost-halves/7886316|title=Smoking rates at 'all-time lows' in Australia|date=2016-09-28|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In December 2002, [[Statistics Canada]] published a report on smoking prevalence from 1985-2001. In that report they found from 1985 to 1991, prevalence of "current smoking" (which they defined as daily smokers and occasional smokers) declined overall, for both sexes and all age groups except for those aged 15 to 24. Even larger declines occurred from 1991 to 2001. While current smoking prevalence for youths did not significantly change from 1985 to 1994-1995, there was a significant decrease of 6 percentage points from 1994-1995 to 2001 (from 28.5% to 22.5%). [[Province|Provincially]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], experienced most of their declines in current smoking prevalence from 1994-1995 onwards. All of the provinces experienced some level of declines over the entire 1985 to 2001 period. Declines in daily smoking prevalence occurred for both sexes and all age groups over the entire 17-year time span, although youth smoking did not start significantly declining until the mid-1990s. Overall, for daily cigarette consumption, smokers by 2001 had a significantly lower proportion of smoking 26 or more cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (14.0% to 5.8%). Most of the declines in the different sex or age groups occurred after 1991. At the same time however, smokers in 2001 had a significantly higher proportion of smoking 1 to 10 cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (18.6% to 31.1%). Most of the decline occurred after 1991.&lt;ref name="STATSCAN"&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82f0077x/82f0077x2001001-eng.pdf Report on Smoking in Canada 1985 to 2001], [[Statistics Canada]], Health Statistics Division, December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008 the rate was estimated to be 18%, and declining.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancer.ca/canada-wide/prevention/quit%20smoking/canadian%20tobacco%20stats.aspx?sc_lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 survey estimates that 17% of Canadians smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/09/07/smoking-rate-survey.html | work=CBC News | title=Smoking rate falls to 17% in Canada | date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In 2005, 27% of the population admitted to being current smokers. 23% were regular smokers (28% of men and 19% of women,) while 4% smoked irregularly. The highest ratio of regular smokers was in the 20-24 age group: 38% of men and 30% of women.&lt;ref name="mikrozensus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Presse/pk/2006/Mikrozensus/Pressebroschuere,property=file.pdf|title=Leben in Deutschland.

Like in the most industrial countries the smoking rate in Germany decreases with increasing education level.

A 2006 comparative study found that 25.1% of male and 20.6% of female medical students in [[Göttingen]] smoke, while in [[London]] the ratios were only 10.9% and 9.1%.&lt;ref name="raupach"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raupach|first=T|author2=Shahab, Baetzing|year=2009|title=Medical students lack bacic knowledge about smoking: Findings from two European medical schools|journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tabakkontrolle.de/pdf/Newsletter_April_2009.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has the largest number of [[cigarette vending machines]] per capita in the world: 800,000 per 82 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120306163217/https://www.facharzt.de/content/red.otx/191,2725,0.html?sID=6672fc2c0e2a7e879a1cb5efff9ea6fc Rauchen: Risikofaktor Nummer 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
In Israel,&lt;ref name="WHOISR"&gt;[http://www.who.int/infobase/reportviewer.aspx?rptcode=ALL&amp;uncode=376&amp;dm=8&amp;surveycode=101391i4 Tobacco Use Introduction for Israel], [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; smoking prevalence among males had remained relatively constant at 30%  in the years 1994–2004.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Epel | first1 = O.

In 2005, research has shown that Israeli youths have begun to use [[bidis]] and [[hookah]], as alternative methods of tobacco use.&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt; In 1990, smoking was the cause of about 1,800 male deaths in Israel which was around 12% of all male deaths.&lt;ref name="CDCI"/&gt; Smoking has not been found to be significant cause of death among Israeli women.&lt;ref name="CDCI"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/WHO/israel.htm Tobacco or Health: A Global Status Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210161042/http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/who/israel.htm |date=2006-12-10 }}, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), accessed July 13, 2005 (site now down)&lt;/ref&gt; The average number of cigarettes smoked per [[Israelis|Israeli]] stands at 2162 (6).&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt;

There are several [[anti-tobacco use legislation]]s in effect. For instance, advertising is prohibited in youth publications and is forbidden on television and radio.&lt;ref name="CDCI"/&gt; in addition to substantial increases in tobacco taxes, although comparatively the prices are still among the lowest compared to all of the European countries.&lt;ref name="CDCI"/&gt; In addition, until 2004, there was no minimum age requirement for buying tobacco products in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/Document/E80607.pdf WHO European Country Profiles on Tobacco Control 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516083557/http://www.euro.who.int/Document/E80607.pdf |date=2010-05-16 }}, [[World Health Organization]], accessed November 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; however, an amendment to the tobacco marketing and advertisement law that became effective at 2004 has limited the sale of tobacco to people above the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/E13924CA-0B10-42C0-9F50-76F33C5E01CC.htm] [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Commerce and Industry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], the smoking rate in the Israeli adult population in 2009 was 20.9%, down from 34% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/HealthAndSci-Tech/Health/Article.aspx?id=181972&lt;/ref&gt; A Ministry of Health nationwide survey conducted in 2011 found that 20.6% of the population aged 21 and older were smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Record Number of Non-Smokers|url=http://health.walla.co.il/?w=/5059/2537905|accessdate=15 June 2012|newspaper=Walla|date=31 May 2012|language=Hebrew|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604060437/http://health.walla.co.il/?w=%2F5059%2F2537905|archivedate=4 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest percentage of smokers was among Arab males, 44% percent of whom smoked, though this figure is down from 50% in 1996.

=== New Zealand ===
Tobacco consumption in New Zealand peaked in the mid-1970s when 60% of the population were smokers. By 2011 that number had fallen to 20% of the population, thanks to stringent tobacco control laws which are amongst the world's strictest. However, despite these laws, the number of smokers appears to be increasing as the global economy worsens and a recent spate of natural disasters have seen an increase in tobacco sales and although more males smoke than females, this gap is slowly narrowing. Tobacco consumption by [[Māori people|Maori]] remains disproportionately high despite having decreased over recent years thanks to television, internet, radio and print media anti-smoking advertising aimed at Maori. The high rate of Maori tobacco consumption has been described by many Maori health advocates and academics as a "cultural genocide".

=== Romania ===
According to the Romanian [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Ministry of Health]], the smoking rate among the general population declined from 36% in 2004 to 26% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.incont.ro/social/sanatatea-vrea-taxa-mai-mare-la-tutun-si-alcool-pentru-a-i-convinge-pe-fumatori-sa-renunte-la-tigari.html | title=Sanatatea vrea taxa mai mare la tutun si alcool, pentru a-i convinge pe fumatori sa renunte la acest viciu.

The first research of smoking habits in Sweden was performed in 1946; it showed that 50% of men, and 9% of women were smokers. In 1977 41% of men were and  32% of women smokers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nicorette.se/sites/nicorette_se/files/publication/Fakta%20om%20tobaksbruk%20i%20Sverige.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The use of smoking tobacco, on a daily basis, had in 2011 decreased to only 12.5% and 14.3% among women. The use of [[snus]], on a daily basis among men older than 15 years, was approximately 19.4% and only 3.0% for women.&lt;ref name="scb01"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Smoking in the United Kingdom}}

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], as of 2015, a total of 15.1% of U.S. adults (16.7% of men and 13.6% of women) [[smoking|smoke]], which is down from 20.9% a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/|title=Smoking and Tobacco Use Fact Sheet|date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=30 December 2016|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of U.S. smokers in 2005, 80.8% (or 36.5 million) smoked every day, and 19.2% (or 8.7 million) smoked some days. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking also varied substantially across population groups. For instance, current smoking was higher among men at 23.9% than women at 18.1%. This is consistent with other countries (see table). Among [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[ethnic]] groups, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[Alaska Natives]] had the highest prevalence at 32.0%, followed by [[non-Hispanic whites]] at 21.9%, and non-Hispanic [[Black people|blacks]] at 21.5%. Hispanics at 16.2%, and Asians at 13.3% had the lowest rates.&lt;ref name="CDC2005"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5542a1.htm Tobacco Use Among Adults: United States, 2005], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], October 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking prevalence also based on education level, with the highest among adults who had earned a [[General Educational Development]] (GED) [[diploma]] at 43.2% and those with 9–11 years of education at 32.6%. Prevalence generally decreased with increasing education. Adults aged 18–24 years were at 24.4% and 25–44 years were at 24.1% had the highest prevalences. The prevalence of current smoking was higher among adults living below the [[poverty line]] at 29.9% than among those at or above the poverty line at 20.6%.&lt;ref name="CDC2005"/&gt;

In 2005, the CDC set a 2010 target of 12% for current cigarette smoking prevalence. Certain populations had already surpassed these when it was set. This included Hispanic (11.1%) and Asian (6.1%) women, women with [[undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] (9.6%) or [[graduate degree|graduate]] (7.4%) degrees, men with undergraduate (11.9%) or graduate (6.9%) degrees, men aged over 65 years (8.9%), and women aged over 65 years (8.3%).&lt;ref name="CDC2005"/&gt;

In 2013, the national smoking average in the United States was 19.6% of the adult population. The following have some of the lowest percentages of smokers with their states: 
* Utah, 10.6%, lowest percentage of smokers. 
* Hawaii, 14.6%, 3rd lowest. 
* Connecticut, 16%, 4th lowest.
* Massachusetts, 16.4%, 7th lowest.
* Vermont, 16.5%, 9th lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Healthiest States in America|url=http://healthinformatics.uic.edu/infographics/10-healthiest-states-in-america-infographic/|website=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among cigarette smokers in 2005, an estimated 42.5% had stopped smoking for at least 1 day during the preceding 12 months because they were trying to quit. Among the estimated 42.5% (or 91.8 million) of people who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetimes (the question the CDC asked to measure if they were ever smokers or not), 50.8% (or 46.5 million) did not smoke currently. In 2005, prevalence of current [[cigar]] smoking was 2.2% and current [[smokeless tobacco]] use was 2.3%. Prevalence of cigar smoking and use of smokeless tobacco were higher among men (4.3% and 4.5%, respectively) than women (0.3% and 0.2%).&lt;ref name="CDC2005"/&gt;

There are large regional differences in smoking rates, with Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Mississippi topping the list, and Idaho, California and Utah at significantly lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=State-specific prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults and quitting among persons aged 18-35 years—United States, 2006 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=56 |issue=38 |pages=993–6 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17898692 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5638a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons with mental illness, making up about 20% of the population, consume about 33% of the tobacco used. Persons with serious mental illness die 25 years earlier than average, often from smoking related illnesses.&lt;ref name=NYT02613&gt;{{cite news|title=Smoking, Once Used to Reward, Faces a Ban in Mental Hospitals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/health/psychiatric-hospitals-alter-rules-on-patient-smoking.html|accessdate=February 7, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 6, 2013|author=Pam Belluck|quote=New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the nearly 46 million adults with mental illness have a smoking rate 70 percent higher than those without mental illness, and consume about a third of the cigarettes in the country, though they make up one-fifth of the adult population.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention noted in their report, “The percentage of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 16.8 percent in 2014. Cigarette smoking was significantly lower in 2014 (16.8 percent) than in 2013 (17.8 
percent).” The CDC concluded this from data obtained by a survey of Americans. However, researchers said that they are not sure if products 
like e-cigarettes are in any way helpful to reduce smokers in the country. Around 4,000 minors start smoking in the US every day.&lt;ref name=MakadiaRoper2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Makadia|first1=Luv D.|last2=Roper|first2=P.

South Korea enforced strict [[smoking bans]] in public places since July 2013, with fines of ₩100,000 [[South Korean won|won]] on any spotted smoker and up to ₩5 million [[South Korean won|won]] on shop owners not following the law. It is illegal   to smoke in all bars and restaurants, cafes, [[internet cafe]]s, government buildings, kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals, youth facilities, libraries, children's playgrounds, private academies, subway or train stations and their platforms and underground pathways, large buildings, theaters, department stores or shopping malls, large hotels and highway rest areas. The strict bans came into force gradually beginning with a ban on places larger than 150 square meters in 2012, extended to 100 square meters in 2014, with a full-fledged complete nationwide ban on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref name="New Year brings"&gt; KIM BONG-MOON, [http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2999132 New Year brings in smoking ban] January 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Smoking arrived in [[Korea]] in the early 1600s from [[Japan]]{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=107}} and until around 1880, both men and women smoked.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=109}}

==Laws==
Since 1 January 2015, South Korea has completely banned smoking on all bars, restaurants and cafes regardless of size, including any smoking rooms. Any spotted smoker must pay fines of 100,000 won and up to 5 million won on shop owners not obeying the law.&lt;ref name="New Year brings"/&gt; Anyone can report a smoker via calling or sending a [[text message]] to a government hotline (in the case of Seoul, the number is 120) with their location address and authorities will raid the reported place, of which a picture of the offending smoker will be taken and fined 100,000 won. Disguised authorities also secretly check random places at random times for offending smokers.

Since 1 January 2015, [[tobacco]] prices have  nearly doubled to an average of  ₩4,500 [[South Korean won|KRW]], and it is illegal to advertise misleading claims such as "light", "mild", "low tar" or "pure" on cigarette packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29154469|title=South Korea seeks near-doubling of cigarette price - BBC News|work=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newsis,.

==Financial and medical help for quitting==

People who have successfully quit smoking will receive 50,000 to 150,000 KRW as a financial incentive from the government. A 12-week medical help program for quitting is provided at a heavily subsidised cost of 5,000KRW upon the first treatment, reduced to 3,000KRW thereafter. Smoking cessation aids such as [[bupropion]], [[varenicline]] and nicotin patches are handed out for free at any participating medical center nationwide. Anyone in need of consulting smoking cessation can dial a hotline and consult a doctor or specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news1.kr/articles/?2049574|title=대통령 한마디에…복지부 "금연 성공땐 인센티브 5만~10만원"|date=16 January 2015|work=news1.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence and effects==
Reports suggest that persistently high rates of smoking in [[military of South Korea|the military]] contribute to the high incidence of male smoking, and negate the efficacy of anti-smoking measures, as many men start smoking during their [[Conscription|mandatory]] 2-year [[military of South Korea|military service]]. The Public Health Graduate School of [[Yonsei University]] completed a 13-year medical study on 1.2 million patients and found that about 73% of male smokers and 18% of female smokers contracted [[lung cancer]].{{Citation needed|reason=Very unlikely; unable to find a study supporting those numbers|date=March 2014}} There is rising awareness of the [[health effects of tobacco]].&lt;ref name="euromonitor"&gt;{{cite web

Eight out of ten teenagers were found to think they should not smoke by looking at cigarette pack warning pictures. According to the Center for Disease Control, 83.1% of teenagers who know cigarette warning pictures responded that they thought smoking cigarettes should not be allowed to smoke. The health authorities have announced that they will replace the cigarette warning label in December and will include a picture symbolizing 'carcinogenicity' in cigarette-type electronic cigarette packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ggilbo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=513975|title=Smoking cigarette warning picture, prevention of smoking in 83% of youth|last=주|first=홍철|date=2018-06-01|work=금강일보|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korean smoking etiquette==
Local smoking [[Etiquette in South Korea|etiquette]] in South Korea is influenced by [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]]. For instance, smokers generally refrain from, or seek permission before lighting up in the presence of social superiors;&lt;ref name="James Turnbull part 1"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17157">'''Social determinants of health in Mexico''' are factors that influence the status of [[health]] among certain populations in [[Mexico]]. These factors consist of circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age, as well as the systems put in place to deal with illnesses.

In Mexico, the health inequality among the population is influenced by such social factors. In the past decade, Mexico has witnessed immense progress within their health care system that has allowed for greater access to health care and a decrease in mortality rate, yet there are still various health inequalities caused by social factors.

==Definitions==

[[Social determinants of health]] are useful when identifying risk factors that affect the health of an individual or group. [[Health]] is defined as "the overall condition of someone's body or mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/health|accessdate=20 October 2013|author=Merriam-Webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As accessed by the World Health Organization, some major determinants of whether one is healthy or not include "the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person's individual characteristics and behaviours".&lt;ref name=WHO2013&gt;{{cite web|title=The determinants of health|url=http://www.who.int/hia/evidence/doh/en/|accessdate=19 October 2013|author=World Health Organization|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social determinants of health, as described by the [[World Health Organization]], include income and [[social status]], [[education]], social support networks, [[health services]], [[gender]], employment status and conditions, and race and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

== Poverty ==
{{Main|Poverty in Mexico}}

In Mexico, poverty is reported using the [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] and the [[Human Development Index]]. Together, these indicators suggest the overall poverty gradient of Mexico. The government’s social development agency reported a 0.6 percent drop of Mexico’s poverty rate from 2010 to 2012, but there are still 53.3 million people under the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Luc|title=Mexico's poverty rate dips but little cheer for the needy: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/30/us-mexico-poverty-idUSBRE96T01F20130730|accessdate=19 October 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A major effect of this poverty rate is the continuation of a huge wealth gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico has 'giant wealth divide'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3953757.stm|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=October 26, 2004|author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although there is a huge gap between the top ten percent and the bottom ten percent, Mexico has seen an increase in the percentage of Mexicans who are within the middle-class category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico’s middle class gaining from economic growth; Canada and the U.S. trailing |url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/newsroom/news-releases/mexico%E2%80%99s-middle-class-gaining-economic-growth-canada-and-us-trailing|accessdate=20 October 2013|newspaper=Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives News Releases|date=May 22, 2012|author=Canadian Centre for Policy Alternative}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Mexico claws toward prosperity, some in middle class slide back|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-mexico-claws-toward-prosperity-some-in-middle-class-slide-back/2012/12/19/93ecfe68-31c1-11e2-92f0-496af208bf23_story.html|accessdate=19 October 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=December 19, 2012|author=William Booth|author2=Nick Miroff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poverty within Mexico can be separated into two categories: moderate and extreme. Both categories total to about 45.5 percent of the total population of 117.3 million people.&lt;ref name=AnimalPolitico&gt;{{cite news|title=1.4 millones de mexicanos dejan la pobreza extrema entre 2010 y 2012|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2013/07/hay-53-3-millones-de-pobres-en-mexico/#axzz2afm3acCw|accessdate=17 October 2013|newspaper=Animal Politico|date=July 29, 2013|author=Redaccion Animal Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to El Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social, also known as Coneval, there was a decrease in the percent of the Mexican population in extreme poverty, but an overall increase in the number of people that fall under the poverty line.&lt;ref name=AnimalPolitico/&gt;  The study showed that the extreme poverty rate fell from 11.3 percent to 9.8 percent, while the moderate poverty rate increased from 34.8 percent to 35.6 percent.

The correlation between poverty and health can be described as a negative relationship in which as poverty increases, health decreases.&lt;ref name=Mosley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosley|first=W. Henry|author2=Lincoln C. Chen |title=An Analytical Framework for the Study of Child Survival in Developing Countries|journal=Population and Development Review|year=1984|volume=10|pages=25–45|publisher=Population Council|doi=10.2307/2807954 |jstor=2807954|pmc=2572391}}&lt;/ref&gt;   With a low income, families do not have the desired access to nutrition, resources, and health care as well as a means to reach these necessities.

==Gender==

[[Gender]] is a major factor that influences the health inequity hiamong the Mexican population. There’s a certain gender bias within general health and specific diseases. [[Gender inequality]] can be described as “the departure from parity in the representation of women and men in key dimensions of social life.”&lt;ref name=Frias&gt;{{cite web|last=Frias|first=Sonia|title=Measuring Structural Gender Equality in Mexico: A State Level Analysis|url=http://lib.scnu.edu.cn/ngw/ngw/xwbk/Measuring%20Structural%20Gender%20Equality%20in%20Mexico.pdf|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media B.V|accessdate=17 October 2013|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In Mexico, [[machismo]] still affects many parts of the country and the effect that it has on gender roles in a patriarchal society.  According to the [[World Health Organization]], a major step towards improving the overall health of the population would be [[gender empowerment]].&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing the Gap in a Generation- Health equity through action and the social determinants of health|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2013|author=World Health Organization|location=Geneva: World Health Organization|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;      
According to the 2012 National Survey of Health and Nutrition (ENSANUT), 38 percent of Mexican women aged 20–29 suffer abuses at home with more than 34.9 percent in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutricion: Resultados 2012|url=http://ensanut.insp.mx/informes/ENSANUT2012ResultadosNacionales.pdf|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública|author=JP Gutiérrez|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   With results like these, Mexico witnesses a huge gender bias that could explain major problems that emerge from within the household as well as those that partake in the work force. In the Mexican work force, women generally receive lower wages than men, even with educational levels taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Rhoda&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhoda|first=Richard|title=Female quality of life in Mexico|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3577-female-quality-of-life-in-mexico|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The median wage for female skilled technicians is 97.3 percent of what their male counterparts make, teachers with 97.6 percent, and female industrial supervisors make 68.4 percent of what males make in that same field.&lt;ref name=Rhoda/&gt; The gender inequity can be emphasized with the fact that there has not been "a female head of state and has had very few female cabinet members.”&lt;ref name=Rhoda/&gt; This explains the "26 percent of equality with men in the political sphere" and that of "42 percent within the economic and legal spheres."&lt;ref name=Frias/&gt; This gender inequality produces a gender bias that favors men. Women then lack the necessary access to resources such as medical care, transportation, and nutrition.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Mexico}}

Level of educational attainment is a major determinant of health in Mexico. More education generally leads to increased income, better employment opportunities, and improved living conditions; these, in turn, lead to improved health.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; The educational system in Mexico has witnessed low enrollment as well as low student-achievement.&lt;ref name=Santibanez&gt;{{cite book|title=Education in Mexico: Challenges and Opportunities|year=2005|publisher=RAND Corporation|location=Santa Monica, CA|author=Santibanez, Lucrecia|author2=Georges Vernez |author3=Paula Razquin }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics, 99% of children are enrolled in pre-primary school.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Education (all levels) profile - Mexico|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&amp;IF_Language=eng&amp;BR_Country=4840|accessdate=20 November 2013|author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, 96% of girls and 95% of boys are in primary school.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Evaluating data on secondary schools across the nation, only 69% of girls and 66% of boys are enrolled in secondary education.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The data also shows that 28% of the population of tertiary age are in tertiary education.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

The low enrollment can be correlated with the need for Mexican families to utilize all means to an income and having the whole family seek employment, even at a young age.&lt;ref name=Santibanez/&gt;  A factor that can affect the low student-achievement is the matter of children lacking focus as a result of nutritional deprivation.&lt;ref name=Santibanez/&gt; Health indirectly influences education in the same way that education indirectly influences the health of an individual.

==Location==
Location affects overall health and "chances of leading flourishing lives".&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; Location affects the daily living conditions that people endure which in turn affects [[health equity]]. There are various differences between [[Urban areas|urban]] and [[Rural area|rural]] living conditions.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; According to the 2011 Latin American Report on Poverty and Inequality, over the past decade, both national and urban inequality have decreased, yet rural inequality has increased.&lt;ref name=IFAD&gt;{{cite book|last=IFAD|title=Poverty and Inequality: Latin American Report 2011|year=2012|publisher=IFAD|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=978-956-9153-03-7|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/pl/informe_e.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[World Bank]] data reports that about 61% of those living in rural areas live in extreme poverty.&lt;ref name=IFAD/&gt; The major causes for such social and economic gaps between these two sectors come from "a manifestation of spatially-differentiated patterns of economic development".&lt;ref name=IFAD/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFADFacts&gt;{{cite book|last=IFAD|title=Rural poverty in Mexico|year=2012|publisher=IFAD|url=http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/pl/factsheet/mexico_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major factor to such disparity is the "absence of rural development policy planning", especially because the "highest public spending on rural development benefits the country’s richest states".&lt;ref name=IFAD/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFADFacts/&gt;

===Urban===
Urban areas seem to be overpopulated with almost one-third of the population living in four major metropolitan areas-20 million people living in [[Mexico City]] alone. This major urbanization represents the differences in living standards as well as access to health and social services.  
The lack of adequate housing within urbanized cities represents a major problem.

According to research conducted by the Office of Population Research from Princeton University, the main causes of mortality in rural areas are infectious diseases and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kimberly|author2=Goldman, Noreen |title=Socioeconomic differences in health among older adults in Mexico|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=October 2007|volume=65|issue=7|pages=1372–1385|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953607002857|accessdate=4 November 2013|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, chronic disease and other health problems associated with industrialization dominate mortality within urban areas.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; A report from the World Health Organization states that about 32% of the total urban population in Latin America dwell in slums.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; [[Slum]]s do not provide the best access to sufficient living conditions. The same report details "the shift in population levels of weight towards obesity" due to nutrition transition that begins in cities.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

===Rural===
Rural regions in Mexico comprise more than 80% of the land and house around 37 million people (36% of the population).&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=OECD|title=OECD Rural Policy Reviews: Mexico 2007|year=2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9789264011526}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics confirm that Mexico is the country with "the largest population [that lives] in predominantly rural areas" within the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"/&gt;  Additionally, the standards of living in rural populations are much lower than its urban counterpart and the gap is larger than OECD standards.&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"/&gt;  The major drawbacks are the lack of good shelter, adequate drainage, and access to electricity.&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"/&gt;  Within dispersed rural areas, about 68% of the houses had a solid floor, 52% had drainage, yet 87% had electricity.&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"/&gt;

== Steps for improvement ==
In the mid-1990s, the ''[[Secretaría de Desarrollo Social]]'' introduced the ''[[Oportunidades]]'' program (formerly known as PROGRESA), which is a multi-sector policy that brought upon [[conditional cash transfer]]s.&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"/&gt; ''Oportunidades'' dispenses money directly to poor households in return the families send their children to school, health services, and provide them with better nutrition by attending classes.&lt;ref name="OECD 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Santiago|title=Progress Against Poverty: Sustaining Mexico's Progresa-Oportunidades|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815752219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rivera|first=JA|author2=D Sotres-Alvarez |title=Impact of the Mexican Program for Education, Health, and Nutrition (Progresa) on Rates of Growth and Anemia in Infants and Young Children: A Randomized Effectiveness Study|journal=JAMA|date=June 2004|volume=291|issue=21|doi=10.1001/jama.291.21.2563|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=198848|pages=2563–70|pmid=15173147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a study published in 2004 show that there have been improvements in overall health associated with better

[[File:SEDESOL logo 2012.svg|thumb|SEDESOL logo 2012]]

In 2003, Mexico's Congress enacted reforms to Mexico's health legislation that aimed at making health care available nationwide.&lt;ref name=Frenk&gt;{{cite news|last=Frenk|first=Julio|title=The quest for universal health coverage: achieving social  protection for all in Mexico|url=http://press.thelancet.com/mexicoupdate.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The Lancet|date=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico's former Minister of Health, [[Julio Frenk]], as the original architect, implemented Seguro Popular which has insured 52.6 million previously-uninsured Mexicans.&lt;ref name=Frenk/&gt;  
With the implementation of this universal health care, more Mexicans can now access the health services in their community.&lt;ref name=Frenk /&gt;

In 2008, the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health developed a plan of action to tackle the problems that social determinants of health have on health equity. The recommendations consist of "improving daily living conditions, tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources, and measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action."&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

'''Superfecundation''' is the fertilization of two or more [[ovum|ova]] from the same [[menstrual cycle|cycle]] by [[spermatozoon|sperm]] from separate acts of [[sexual intercourse]], which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3851843/twins-complications/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter|title=The Science of How Women Can Have Twins With 2 Different Fathers|first=Justin|last=Worland|date=May 8, 2015|work=Time|accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sogc.org/publications-resources/public-information-pamphlets.html?id=33|title=Public Education Pamphlets|work=sogc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term superfecundation is derived from [[fecundity|fecund]], meaning the ability to produce offspring.  '''Heteropaternal superfecundation''' refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. '''Homopaternal superfecundation''' refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twins]].&lt;ref name=pmid10641935&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10641935 |year=2000 |author1=Ambach |first1=E |title=Superfecundation and dual paternity in a twin pregnancy ending with placental abruption |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=181–3 |last2=Parson |first2=W |last3=Brezinka |first3=C }}&lt;/ref&gt; While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination.&lt;ref name=pmid26548710&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.10.930 |pmid=26548710 |title=A review of the mechanisms and evidence for typical and atypical twinning |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=214 |issue=2 |pages=172–91 |year=2016 |last1=McNamara |first1=Helen C. |last2=Kane |first2=Stefan C. |last3=Craig |first3=Jeffrey M. |last4=Short |first4=Roger V. |last5=Umstad |first5=Mark P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conception ==
Superfecundation most commonly happens within hours or days of the first instance of fertilization with ova released during the same cycle. The time window when eggs are able to be fertilized is small. Sperm cells can live inside a female's body for four to five days. Once ovulation occurs, the egg remains viable for 12–48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Thus, the fertile period can span five to seven days.

[[Ovulation]] is usually suspended during [[pregnancy]] to prevent further ova becoming fertilized and to help increase the chances of a full-term pregnancy. However, if an ovum is released after the female was already impregnated when previously ovulating, a chance of a second pregnancy occurs, albeit at a different stage of development. This is known as [[superfetation]].

==Heteropaternal superfecundation in mammals==
Heteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as cats and dogs. Stray dogs can produce litters in which every puppy has a different sire. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among [[dizygotic twin]]s whose parents had been involved in [[paternity suit]]s.&lt;ref name="suit"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1488855 |year=1992 |author1=Wenk |first1=R. E. |title=How frequent is heteropaternal superfecundation? |journal=Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |last2=Houtz |first2=T |last3=Brooks |first3=M |last4=Chiafari |first4=F. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases in mythology==
Greek mythology holds many cases of superfecundation:
* [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] lies with both her husband [[Tyndareus]] and [[Zeus]], the latter in the guise of a swan. Nine months later, she bares two daughters: [[Clytemnestra]] by Tyndareus and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] by Zeus. This happens again, this time Leda bares two sons: [[Castor and Pollux |Castor by Tyndareus and Pollux by Zeus]]. 

* [[Alcmene]] is raped by Zeus, who is disguised as her husband [[Amphitryon]]; the real Amphitryon later sleeps with Alcmene and she gives birth to two sons: [[Iphicles]] by Amphitryon and [[Heracles]] by Zeus.

==Selected cases involving superfecundation==

In 1982, twins who were born with two different skin colors were discovered to be conceived as a result of heteropaternal superfecundation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020008620&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=F6227767DB3CDB724EA92EFC60A5A985.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a2{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26548710/&gt;

In 1995, a young woman gave birth to [[diamniotic]] [[monochorionic]] twins, who were originally assumed to be monozygotic twins until a paternity suit led to a DNA test. This led to the discovery that the twins had different fathers.&lt;ref name=pmid10641935/&gt;

In 2001, a case of spontaneous monopaternal superfecundation was reported after a woman undergoing IVF treatments gave birth to quintuplets after only two embryos were implanted. Genetic testing supported that the twinning was not a result of the embryos splitting, and that all five boys shared the same father.&lt;ref name=pmid26548710/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(01)01976-8 |pmid=11532493 |title=Monopaternal superfecundation of quintuplets after transfer of two embryos in an in vitro fertilization cycle |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=621–3 |year=2001 |last1=Amsalem |first1=Hagai |last2=Tsvieli |first2=Rimona |last3=Zentner |first3=Bat Sheva |last4=Yagel |first4=Simcha |last5=Mitrani-Rosenbaum |first5=Stella |last6=Hurwitz |first6=Arye }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an IVF-implanted surrogate mother gave birth to two children: one genetically unrelated child from an implanted embryo, and a biological child from her own egg and her husband's sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/03/health/surrogate-mom-two-babies/index.html|title=Surrogate mom delivers two babies, one her own|publisher=CNN|date=November 3, 2017|author=Susan Scutti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bod Squad''''' was the collective title for a series of short public service announcements broadcast on Saturday mornings on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]], from the 1974 through the first half of the 1990s. These thirty-second and one-minute segments promoted healthy [[nutrition]] and [[personal hygiene]] through humorous animation and catchy music with clever lyrics.

The segments generally appeared at half-hour intervals, interspersed with regular commercials, between [[Saturday morning cartoon]] programs. While many were not labeled as such, at least four or five segments ended with an announcement, "Another nutritional message from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television Network]]," and accompanying stock animation identifying the series as ''The ABC Bod Squad''. The same original segments produced in the 1970s repeated every Saturday morning for nearly 20 years, so that many if not most Americans who were TV-watching children during that period are familiar with them.

The Bod Squad segments never carried official titles but are informally known by the catch phrases from their lyrics. Some of the memorable Bod Squad segments included 

* '''Yuck Mouth''' and '''Nutty Gritty''' (both sung by actor/singer [[Scatman Crothers]]), 
* '''(Watch Out For) The Munchies''', about craving food when a person ''is not hungry,'' and
* '''Quickfast''', suggesting pre-made or leftover foods for breakfast, or easily  prepared foods such as toast, for children who are too young to fix meals themselves. 

Some others not explicitly identified as Bod Squad segments but in the same vein were 

* '''Don't Drown Your Food''' (voiced by actor/comedian [[Arnold Stang]]), encouraging children not to overuse condiments, such as gravy, ketchup and salad dressing, and learn to enjoy the natural flavors of vegetables, eggs, etc.
* '''Make A Saturdae''', about using healthy foods — such as bananas and yogurt — to create "fun" snacks.
* '''Zack Of All Trades''' (sung by [[Luther Vandross]]), a hip R&amp;B singer teaches teenagers a valuable lesson about different types of careers.
* '''Beans and Rice''', about complementary proteins, and combining basic foods to create new dishes. (Curiously, this short was performed by [[Jack Sheldon]] and [[Bob Dorough]], two of the major names behind ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'', but was credited neither as a ''Schoolhouse Rock!'' short nor as a ''Bod Squad'' segment.)

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s ABC broadcast several other series of educational public service cartoon spots as well, including ''[[Time for Timer]]'' and, perhaps the most famous of all, ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!|Schoolhouse Rock]]''.

'''Tronox Limited''' ({{NYSE|TROX}}) is an American worldwide chemical company involved in the titanium products industry with approximately 3,500 employees. Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa's [[Exxaro Resources]], Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of [[titanium dioxide]] ([[titanium|Ti]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [[pigment]], which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.

Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and [[speciality chemicals]] business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the [[Kerr-McGee]] Chemical Corporation and based in [[Oklahoma City]] since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to [[Stamford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Mara Lee, [http://www.courant.com/business/hc-tronox-moves-hq-to-connecticut-20120605,0,5099319.story "With $3 Million, State Lures Chemical Firm Mired In Pollution Disputes"], ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tronox1"&gt;

The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company [[Kerr-McGee]]'s legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, "[[Kerr-McGee]], rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]] (successor to [[Kerr-McGee]]) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

==History==

The company went public in 2005, when [[Oklahoma City]]-based [[Kerr-McGee]], which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.icis.com/Articles/2005/11/23/1023333/kerr-mcgee-launches-tronox-ipo-in-us-raises-225m.html Kerr-McGee launches Tronox IPO in US, raises $225m], 23 November 2005, ICIS news, Brian Ford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tronox.com/media/news/archive/news2006/news_20060331.htm Tronox Incorporated Becomes Independent Company; Thomas W. Adams Named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer], Tronox.com media news archive, 2006 3 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the [[S&amp;P 600|S&amp;P SmallCap 600]] index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its [[stock]] in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B [[security (finance)|security]]. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.

In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became [[penny stock]]s.

In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.

On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tronox Chapter 11 Petition|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/KH44IEQ/Tronox_Incorporated__nysbke-09-10156__0001.0.pdf|website=PacerMonitor|publisher=PacerMonitor|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], 19 Jan. 2009, "Pigment Maker TRONOX Files for Bankruptcy", p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Huntsman Corporation]] announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9416224 Tronox Cancels Asset Sale to Huntsman], The Associated Press, December 24, 2009 (AP)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i36/8736news1.html Huntsman To Buy Most Of Tronox], Alexander H.

Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.

Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.tronox.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=611271 Tronox Appoints Tom Casey CEO], Tronox.com, October 05, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, "We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.tronox.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=683427 Tronox Announces Closing of Exxaro Mineral Sands Acquisition ], Tronox.com, June 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to [[Kerr-McGee]]) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; According to one report, "[[Kerr-McGee]], rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from [[Kerr-McGee]] was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/us-reaches-5-15-billion-environmental-settlement-191641453--politics.html |title=US reaches $5.15 billion environmental settlement |work=AP |author=Eric Tucker |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

==Kerr-McGee spin-off==

Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by [[corporate raider]] and major Kerr-McGee shareholder [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroleumnews.com/pntruncate/650013342.shtml Kerr-McGee caves in to Icahn] by Ray Tyson, Petroleum News, 2005 Apr 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other things, Tronox inherited several [[radioactive waste]] sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]] and the [[Rare Earths Facility]]. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.&lt;ref name="nrc1"&gt;

It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked [[perchlorate]] (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated [[Lake Mead]] and the [[Colorado River]], which supply water to millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndep.nv.gov/bmi/tronox.htm Remediation of the BMI Complex], State of Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, website accessed 2010 4 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/6065/report/F Final Report: The Fate and Transport of Perchlorate in a Contaminated Site in the Las Vegas Valley], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], Batista, Amy, Chen, Papelis, and Unz. 1999-2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vladimir Zabugin''' (21 June 1880, [[Pargolovo]] – 14 September 1923, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]], [[Italy]]) was a Russian historian and publicist. He was a prominent figure in [[Russian Catholic Church|Russian Catholicism]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Life==
Zabugin was born into a family of [[Civil service|civil servants]]. In 1903, he graduated with honors from [[St. Petersburg State University]]. He was then sent to [[Italy]] to do scientific work. While there, he became interested in the [[Greek Catholic Church]], and he talked with the monks of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholic]] [[Monastery]] of [[Grottaferrata]], including the [[abbot]] [[Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini|Antonio Pellegrini]], and with a future [[exarch]] of the Russian Catholic Church, [[Leonid Fyodorov]].

In 1907, Zabugin converted to Catholicism from his native religion, Russian Orthodoxy. In 1911, he completed his doctoral thesis. After that, he worked as a professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], where he taught the history of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. He published numerous papers on the history of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Renaissance humanism|Italian humanism]], where he sought to emphasize the Christian component of this cultural phenomenon. From 1910 to 1919, he worked as an editor of the journal ''Roma e l'Oriente'' (''Rome and the East''), which was published in the monastery of Grottaferrata. He also wrote numerous journal articles on the history of Russian Christianity, interfaith relations, and religious relations between Russia and the rest of Europe. Zabugin actively participated in the church and in the social lives of Russian Catholics in Europe, and he worked with [[Metropolitan Archbishop]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]]. Zabugin was the author of the Russian Catholic [[catechism]].

In June 1917, Zabugin was sent to Russia by the Italian government as a special envoy to strengthen bilateral ties. After the [[October Revolution]], he returned to Italy, where he published ''Mad Giant: The Documentary Chronicles the Russian Revolution'', a book about his impressions of the recent events in Russia.

Vladimir Zabugin died on 14 September 1923 in a mountaineering accident in the [[Alps]].

A '''wheelchair-accessible van''' is a vehicle in a range of them that have been modified to increase the interior size of the vehicle and to equip it with a means of [[wheelchair]] entry such as a [[wheelchair ramp]] or [[wheelchair lift|powered lift]], to allow access.

==Modifications==
The general steps manufacturers undergo to convert a van differ greatly from one manufacturer to another.
Modifications fall into two categories, the first is where the individual in a wheelchair is the driver and the second is where the individual in a wheelchair is a passenger.

Conversions generally involve the following:
*Some portion of the floor is lowered
*Seating is modified to allow wheelchair access and is reconfigurable
*Means of external access added. This is most often a ramp, lift, or turning seat
*Suspension may be stiffened to allow extra weight of power chairs / additional weight from conversion
*Power kneeling system is typically added to reduce the slope of the ramp (side entry conversions)
*Gas tanks and fuel lines may be modified
*Vehicle is certified to meet safety requirements of the country in which it is to be used

Passenger conversions involve the following:
*The floor is reinforced
*Seats are added
*AMF-Bruns of America, Q'Straint (or Wheelchair) tiedowns/securements are installed
*Ramp or hoist installed
*Windows installed
*Van lining (finishing)

==Entry configurations==
There are two types of entry configurations:  side-entry and rear-entry.  The entry location impacts wheelchair seating positions, parking options, the ability to accommodate other passengers, and storage availability.

===Side entry===
Advantages of a side-entry configuration include:  ability to drive from a wheelchair or sit in the front passenger position in a wheelchair or driver position; enter and exit curbside away from traffic; and more storage space.  Disadvantages of this style are that it requires a handicap parking space or extra room for ramp deployment and that some driveways are not wide enough to accommodate the vehicle.  Over 75% of personal use wheelchair-accessible vehicles employ a side-entry configuration.

===Rear entry===
A rear-entry configuration can be used for attended applications in which the wheelchair occupant is not driving the vehicle but rather riding as a passenger.  One advantage of a rear-entry vehicle is that, with the exception of parallel parking, no extra room is required for a ramp and the side passenger doors aren’t blocked if a folding-style ramp is installed.  In addition, mid-passenger seats can be mounted next to the wheelchair position.  Other advantages include more ground clearance and more room for long wheelchairs and/or leg rests.  Limitations of the rear-entry style are the requirement to enter and exit from a traffic area, the inability to drive from the wheelchair and/or have the wheelchair in the front passenger position, and less storage space.

==Types of access==

===Ramp===
Ramp based modifications are most commonly performed on minivans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In order to provide access for the wheelchair user, the floor on side-entry vehicles is lowered {{convert|8|-|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.  In rear-entry configuration, the floor is not lowered but rather removed, and a composite or steel tub is inserted.

Ramps come in two styles—fold-up or in-floor—and two operating modes—manual or motorized.  Fold-up ramps fold in half and stow upright next to the side passenger door in a side-entry configuration or inside the rear access doors in a rear-entry configuration.  Fold-up ramps present a lower ramp angle than in-floor ramps; however, in side-entry configurations, they are in the way of the passenger entrance when stowed.  In-floor ramps slide into a pocket underneath the vehicle's floor and are only available for side-entry configurations.  Folding ramps are available in manual or motorized versions for both entry configurations.  However, in-floor ramps are only available as motorized.  Power applications may also have a “kneeling feature” that reduces the angle of the ramp by compressing the suspension of the van on the ramp side.

In addition, portable ramps are available for use with many vehicles and typically do not require any vehicle modification.  Portable wheelchair ramps cost much less both to purchase and to maintain.  Since they are not attached to the vehicle, they can be also be used for handicapped access for other applications.

Minivans that are most frequently converted:
* [[Dodge Grand Caravan]]/[[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]
* [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]]
* [[Toyota Sienna]]
* Vehicle Production Group [[MV-1]] - not a conversion but factory-equipped with a ramp.
* RAM Promaster 2500

Some manufacturers also provide wheelchair accessible versions of their out going vehicles.

===Platform lifts===
Full size vans require lifts in the form of a platform that can be raised and lowered from inside the vehicle down to the ground outside.
There are many types of lifts available on the market. Mono-arm lifts, double-arm lifts and underbody lifts. Double-arm and underbody lifts are best-able for bigger vehicles such as minibuses or buses used for public transport. They have a bigger platform and higher load capacity so they are suitable even for heavy electric wheelchairs with a heavy occupant (more than 300&amp;nbsp;kg. in all). A mono-arm Lift is preferable for private transport because it can fit smaller vehicles. A mono-arm lift is lighter and smaller than the other ones and it ensures a clear view when it's installed in the back of the car. Moreover, mono-arm lifts are preferable for the side-door installation because they are thinner than a double-arm.

===Other types===
Crane type lifts are combined with seats that turn and lower to the ground as a means of providing wheelchair access to some types of vehicles.

Some companies offer the option of a "transfer seat", in which the front driver's or passenger's seat moves on a track back to the wheelchair's position allowing the wheelchair user to transfer into the OEM front seat and then move the seat back into its original position.  The conversion is very simple and does not carry the complicated engineering and electronics typically found in a side-entry conversion.  As a result, they are very well suited for commercial and heavy-cycle applications (i.e.-taxi, non-emergency ambulance, paratransit, assisted living, and dial-a-ride) and geographic areas prone to vehicle corrosion from salt and chloride usage on highways in winter seasons.

According to the text ''Self-Description of Chisongzi'' (赤松子自述; "Master Red Pine") kept at the [[Wong Tai Sin Temple (Hong Kong)|Wong Tai Sin Temple]] in [[Hong Kong]], Wong Tai Sin was born Huang Chuping (Wong Cho Ping in Cantonese) in 328 in [[Lanxi, Zhejiang|Lanxi]], [[Jinhua]], [[Zhejiang]] province.&lt;ref name="Temple"&gt;Self-Descriptions of Chisongzi at the temple&lt;/ref&gt;  Western sources have him listed at c. 284 to 364 CE.&lt;ref name="Geertz" /&gt;

Wong Cho Ping is said to have experienced poverty and hunger, becoming a [[shepherd]] when he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="Siksbio"&gt;Siksikyuen. "[http://www.siksikyuen.org.hk/public/contents/article?ha=&amp;wc=0&amp;hb=&amp;hc=&amp;revision%5fid=2034&amp;item%5fid=2033 Siksikyuen]." "Bio." Retrieved on [2007-04-18].&lt;/ref&gt;  He began practising [[Taoism]] at the age of fifteen after meeting an [[Xian (Taoism)|immortal]] or saintly person on Red Pine Mountain in his hometown. Legend has it that he was able to transform [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s into sheep forty years later.&lt;ref name="Siksbio" /&gt; Wong Tai Sin later became known as the '''Red Pine Immortal''' (赤松仙子), after the mountain where he had his hermitage, and his birthday is celebrated on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month.&lt;ref name="Temple" /&gt;

==Establishment==
In the early 20th century, Leung Renyan (梁仁菴) spread the devotion to Wong Tai Sin from [[Xiqiao Mountain]] (西樵山) in [[Nanhai District|Nanhai County]], [[Guangdong]] to [[Wan Chai]] in [[Colonial Hong Kong]]. Leung arrived in Hong Kong in 1915 &lt;ref name="Siks"&gt;Siksikyuen. "[http://www.siksikyuen.org.hk/public/contents/article?ha=&amp;wc=0&amp;hb=&amp;hc=&amp;revision%5fid=3841&amp;item%5fid=2015 Siksikyuen]." ''History.'' Retrieved on 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon renting an apartment in Wan Chai 灣仔, set up an [[altar]] to Wong Tai Sin in his apartment. He later opened an [[herbal medicine]] shop nearby and moved the altar to the back of the shop, where customers could pray to Wong Tai Sin and seek advice for their ailments. Leung would then fill their prescriptions, and the popularity of Wong Tai Sin grew probably due to several successful cures. Leung's shop was destroyed by fire in 1918.

===Construction===

In 1921, Leung said that he received a message from Wong Tai Sin instructing him to build a new shrine. Leung and some Taoist priests were told to walk 3,000 paces northwards from [[Kowloon City Pier]], eventually stopping at [[Chuk Yuen Village]] (竹園村). They marked the place with a piece of bamboo in the ground, and using ''[[Fuji_(planchette_writing)|Fu Ji]]'' (扶乩) to consult Wong Tai Sin, were told that it was an auspicious site. Wong Tai Sin taught them to determine the would-be centre of the temple by three Chinese feet (approximately {{convert|1|m|disp=or}}) on the right and three Chinese feet backwards of the bamboo mark and the would-be temple was named as "Chik Chung Sin Shrine" (赤松仙館) (Red Pine Immortal Shrine). The Taoist god of literature, [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Dijun]] (文昌帝君), told the priests, again via ''Fu Ji'', to begin construction of the shrine on 24th of the sixth lunar month.

Eventually, the shrine was completed and was dedicated on the 20th of the seventh lunar month, and the gods communicated several name changes over the next few years through ''Fu Ji''. In the same year, during the celebration of the birthday of Wong Tai Sin on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month, the altar was named "Pu Yi Tan" (普宜壇) by the [[Jade Emperor]] (玉帝). Later on, Wenchang Dijun gave the name of the premises as "Sik Sik Yuen" (嗇色園) and the managing body was established.&lt;ref name="Refugee God"&gt;Lang, Graeme Ragvald, Lars. [1993] The Rise of a Refugee God; Hong Kong's Wong Tai Sin. Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-585755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the shrine was renamed "Chik Chung Wong Sin Hall" (赤松黃仙祠) (Red Pine Wong Immortal Hall) by the god [[Lü Ju]] (呂祖), and it has been in use since then.

Sik Sik Yuen was once restricted to Taoists and their family members until 1934, when it formally applied to the government to have the temple open to the public during every 1st lunar month. The temple was finally opened to the general public in 1956.

==Transition==
The revival of venerating Wong Cho Ping as Wong Tai Sin occurred at the end of the 19th century. Prior to 1911, the [[Emperor of China]] was the primary divine religious symbol,&lt;ref name="Geertz" /&gt; often stretching the [[Mandate of Heaven]] into religious terms. After the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]], a replacement symbol was needed, and Leung Renyan arrived in Hong Kong in 1915 with a portrait of the god; it is thus disputed whether the success of [[Wong Tai Sin Temple (Hong Kong)|Wong Tai Sin Temple]] is due to the timing of his worship's revival and historical circumstance.

==Influence==
The [[Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong|Wong Tai Sin]] area and [[Wong Tai Sin District|Wong Tai Sin]] [[district of Hong Kong|district]]s are named after the deity.  Today, Sik Sik Yuen is an educational and charitable foundation that, true to Leung's origins as a healer, runs a free clinic.
In Hong Kong, there is one MTR station named after Wong Tai Sin and there is a Wong Tai Sin Temple. Many tourists from all over the world visit Wong Tai Sin Temple every day.
