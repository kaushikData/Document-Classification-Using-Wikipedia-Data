'''Albanian International School''' is an [[English language|English]]-language [[international school]] in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alb-int.org School website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
As the most academically rigorous institution in Albania, the Albanian International School (AIS) curriculum adheres to the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] Standards developed in the United States with slight modifications to accommodate the international nature of our school. To ensure all students are ready for success after high school, the Common Core Standards establish clear, consistent guidelines for what every student should know and be able to do in math, English language arts, and history from kindergarten through 9th grade.

The Common Core standards focus on developing the critical-thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills students will need to be successful. The standards also provide a way for teachers to measure student progress throughout the school year and ensure that students are on the pathway to success in their academic careers. Forty-two states, the District of Columbia, four territories, and the [https://www.dodea.edu/ Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA)] have voluntarily adopted the standards.

== Academics ==
The Albanian International School utilizes the [https://www.nwea.org/map-growth/ NWEA MAP Growth] evaluation for student growth assessment. AIS remains the only international school in Tirana to both test and publicly share its students international test scores.

The Albanian International School is also the first and only school in the Balkans to utilize [[Standards-based assessment|Standards Based Grading]] (SBG) for its English and Math class assessments.  SBG refers to systems of instruction, assessment, grading, and academic reporting that are based on students demonstrating understanding or mastery of the knowledge and skills they are expected to learn as they progress through their education. [[File:MAP Score Growth.pdf|thumb|AIS Student Growth Comparison|alt=|left]]

== Facilities ==
The school is centrally located on the outskirts of downtown [[Tirana]] and is housed in the former French Embassy.  The building was substantially renovated and improved over the last two years with small improvements ongoing. AIS has recently expanded the kindergarten classroom, added to the cafeteria, added a master fire alarm system, added an external emergency stairwell, added surveillance cameras, instructional technology to accommodate the MAP testing, and two main entry office spaces. The outdoor space fills one side of a city block directly across from the US Embassy, with high stucco walls topped with wrought-iron fencing surrounding the perimeter, with two large gates for vehicles to pass through. The perimeter defines a U-shaped, paved driveway that loops around the building allowing easy access for parents to enter and exit when picking up their children. There is a large outdoor playing field covered with artificial turf and enclosed with chain-link fencing all around and netting over the top. This field is fitted for soccer, basketball and volleyball.

Outside next to the playing court is a small playground for preschool with swings, slides, playhouse, and other pre-school equipment. The school is licensed by the Ministry of Education and meets or exceeds the requirements of the [[Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth (Albania)|Albanian Ministry of Education]] for education, health safety, and labor regulations.

The use of '''all-women shortlists''' ('''AWS''') is a [[affirmative action|positive action]] practice intended to increase the proportion of female [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in the United Kingdom, allowing only women to stand in particular [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] for a particular [[political party]].&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McSmith | first = Andy | title = The Big Question: Are all-women shortlists the best way to achieve equality in Parliament? | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 23 August 2006 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-are-allwomen-shortlists-the-best-way-to-achieve-equality-in-parliament-412987.html | accessdate = 31 December 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Barratt | first = Samuel | title = Landmark diversity change will make the Liberal Democrats look like the nation we want to represent - Sal Brinton | url = http://www.libdems.org.uk/landmark_diversity_change_will_make_the_liberal_democrats_look_like_the_nation_we_want_to_represent_sal_brinton | website = libdems.org.uk | publisher = [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] | date = 13 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; currently use this practice.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childs |first1=Sarah |last2=Lovenduski |first2=Joni |last3=Campbell |first3=Rosie |title=Women at the top 2005: changing numbers, changing politics |publisher=[[Hansard Society]] |location=London |date=November 2005 |url=http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/publications/archive/2007/10/01/Women-at-the-Top-2005.aspx |isbn=9780900432972 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912044929/http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/publications/archive/2007/10/01/Women-at-the-Top-2005.aspx |archivedate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political parties in other countries, such as South Korea and Latin American countries have used practices analogous to AWS, especially in relation to government sex quotas. AWS and practices similar to it have had mixed impacts in terms of the percentage of candidacies and offices women hold as a result of their use.

==United Kingdom==

===Background===
In the 1990s, women constituted less than 10% of MPs in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament.&lt;ref name="peake"&gt;Peake, Lucy (1997), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=F-za8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 Women in the campaign and in the commons]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Tonge | editor-first1 = Jonathan | editor-last2 = Geddes | editor-first2 = Andrew | editor-link1 = Jonathan Tonge | title = Labour's landslide: the British general election 1997 | pages = 165&amp;ndash;178 | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | location = Manchester, UK | isbn = 9780719051593 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political parties used various strategies to increase female representation, including encouraging women to stand and constituency associations to select them, and providing special training for potential female candidates.&lt;ref name="peake"/&gt;
Another strategy, the creation of all-women shortlists, is a positive discrimination strategy making it compulsory for selection of women candidates in some constituencies.&lt;ref name="peake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bacchi"/&gt;

The strategy has been criticised as undemocratic, as "bypassing competitive principles and hence as ignoring the merit principle,"  and as "a form of discrimination against men."&lt;ref name="peake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bacchi"&gt;Bacchi, Carol (2006), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=H8kkYXBKSXYC&amp;pg=PA32 Arguing for and against quotas: theoretical issues]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Dahlerup | editor-first = Drude | title = Women, quotas and politics | pages = 32&amp;ndash;34 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415375498 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 1992 general election, the Labour Party had a policy of ensuring there was at least one statutory female candidate on each of its shortlists, however few of these women were successful in being selected in winnable seats (seats within a 6% swing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wynn Davies |first=Patricia |title=Labour to set quotas for women: Executive to vote on move that could ensure 80 female MPs after next election |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-to-set-quotas-for-women-executive-to-vote-on-move-that-could-ensure-80-female-mps-after-next-election-1494772.html |date=30 June 1993 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following polling that suggested women were less likely to vote Labour than men, the party introduced All-women shortlists at their 1993 annual conference.&lt;ref name="peake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovenduski, Joni (2005), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=5w7JoYciejkC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115 Examples: quotas and ''parité'']", in {{cite book |editor-last = Lovenduski |editor-first= Joni |title=Feminizing politics |year=2005 |publisher=Polity Press | location = Oxford Malden MA | isbn = 9780745624631 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997 general election===
[[File:Smith, Jacqui (crop).jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Jacqui Smith]], the first female UK Home Secretary, was elected using an AWS.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/5429425/Jacqui-Smith-the-rise-and-fall.html|title=Jacqui Smith: the rise and fall|date=2 June 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Labour used all-women shortlists to select candidates in half of all winnable seats for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], with the aim of reaching 100 female MPs post-election; a goal that was achieved.&lt;ref name="peake"/&gt; The shortlists provoked controversy, however. In 1996, Labour Party branches in [[Croydon Central]], [[Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil &amp; Rhymney]], [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]] and [[Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Slough]] all submitted hostile motions criticising the policy.&lt;ref name="independent2" /&gt;

Concern about such sex discrimination was especially strong in [[Slough]] where the local party refused to even co-operate in selecting a candidate after having an AWS imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rentoul |first=John |author2=Donald Macintyre |title=Blair prepares to drop all-women shortlists |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/blair-prepares-to-drop-allwomen-shortlists-1593214.html |date=26 July 1995 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern was that AWS were being used as a device to keep out certain men who might have made trouble for [[Tony Blair]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; then-Labour Party leader [[Tony Blair]] stated that AWS were "not ideal at all" in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rentoul |first=John |title=Labour faces test over quotas for women MPs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/labour-faces-test-over-quotas-for-women-mps-1525198.html |date=11 December 1995 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, Peter Jepson and Roger Dyas-Elliott, prevented from standing on Labour shortlists because of their gender, challenged the policy in court.&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wynn Davies |first=Patricia |title=All-women lists face new legal challenge |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/allwomen-lists-face-new-legal-challenge-1597219.html |date=21 August 1995 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by the [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]], they claimed that they had been illegally barred from applying to be considered to represent the party and that the policy contradicted Labour's policy of aiming to promote equality of opportunity.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] also opposed gender quotas, preferring to persuade constituencies to select female candidates in winnable seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lena Krook |first=Mona |first2=Joni |last2=Lovenduski |first3=Judith |last3=Squires |title=Gender quotes in the context of citizenship models |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8kkYXBKSXYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |year=2006 |work=Women, quotas and politics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1999 European parliament elections, the Liberal Democrats used a system called "zipping" in which equal numbers of men and women were elected as MEPs.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

===2005 general election===
Following the reduction in female MPs after the 2001 general election and increased lobbying by gender equality advocates, Labour introduced the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]], which allows parties to use positive discrimination in the selection of candidates.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cutts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=All-women shortlists clear new hurdle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1721937.stm |date=21 December 2001 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were to remain legalised until the end of 2015, due to the "Sunset Clause",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= King |first= Oliver |title= All-women shortlists a must, says report |publisher = [[The Guardian]] |date= 15 November 2005 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/15/women.gender | accessdate= 31 December 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that deadline was extended to 2030 as part of the [[Equality Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080306/debtext/80306-0007.htm |title=Hansard, 6 Mar 2008 : Column 1932 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021810/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080306/debtext/80306-0007.htm |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/105 |title=Equality Act 2010 - section 105(3) |publisher=Act of Parliament |year=2010 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] rejected a proposal to use AWS in 2001; suggesting such shortlists were illiberal and unnecessary.&lt;ref name=bbc2001/&gt; Prominent women MPs of the party opposed the  use of all-women shortlists.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Party members argued that the main problem was not discrimination, but a lack of female candidates.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2001/&gt; Instead the party set a target of having 40% female candidates in winnable seats.&lt;ref name=bbc2001&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lib Dems reject women-only lists |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1564419.stm |date=27 September 2001 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2005 general election, the shortlists helped to increase the number of female MPs in Parliament to 128, with the Labour Party's 98 women constituting 77% of the total.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cutts"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutts|first=D|first2=Sarah |last2=Childs |last3=Fieldhouse |first3=Edward |year=2008|title=This is what happens when you don't listen?

===2010 general election===
A Speaker's conference was set up in 2008 to study the reasons why MPs were predominantly White, male and able-bodied. An interim report released in July 2009 called for women to make up at least 50% of new candidates at the following general election.&lt;ref name=guardian2009/&gt; However, all-women shortlists continued to elicit criticism. Conservative [[Ann Widdecombe]] criticised the use of AWS stating that women in the past who fought for equality such as the [[Suffragette]]s "wanted equal opportunities not special privileges" and "they [[Emily Davison|would have thrown themselves under the King's horse]] to protest against positive discrimination and all-women shortlists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Widdecombe |first=Ann |title=EDM 895A2 - 90th Anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918 |url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=35098&amp;SESSION=891 |date=7 February 2008 |work=Early Day Motions |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane Abbott]], one of the early supporters of all women shortlists criticised their failure to recruit [[ethnic minority]] women into politics, stating that they had in effect "been all white women shortlists" &lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/spconf/uc167-v/uc16702.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence of this claim, she cited the 1997 Parliamentary intake; where none of the MPs selected using all women shortlists were Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/gender.women | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A race against time | first=Diane | last=Abbott | date=10 July 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] tried to institute AWS in 2006. There was opposition from some female Conservative MPs, such as [[Nadine Dorries]] and [[Ann Widdecombe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jones | first = George | title = Tories shy away from all-women shortlists | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date = 22 Aug 2006 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1526943/Tories-shy-away-from-all-women-shortlists.html | accessdate = 31 December 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, David Cameron stated that the under-representation of women and ethnic minorities was "a real problem for parliament and for my party", and reversed his opposition to AWS.&lt;ref name=guardian2009&gt;{{Cite news|author1= Allegra Stratton|author2=Andrew Sparrow  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/20/cameron-all-women-shortlists |title=David Cameron to reverse opposition to all-women shortlists |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=8 May 2010| date=20 October 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, he indicated that he would impose AWS because the pace of change towards the selection of more female MPs had been too slow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7265221/David-Cameron-I-will-impose-all-women-shortlists.html The Telegraph 18/2/10]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] stated that he would consider introducing all-women shortlists if the number of female MPs did not increase following the next election, but he did not see this as a long-term solution for the unrepresentative nature of parliament.&lt;ref name=guardian2009/&gt;

===Impact===
All-women shortlists had been credited with breaking down prejudices that impeded the selection of women and discouraged women from offering their candidacy.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;  In both 1997 and 2005, 50% of women MPs elected were selected from all-women shortlists.&lt;ref name="cutts"/&gt;

The increase in women in politics brought increased parliamentary priority to issues such as women's health, domestic violence, childcare.&lt;ref name="cutts"/&gt; In addition, the increased number of women MPs and greater focus on women's concerns likely resulted in increased female support for Labour at the polls.&lt;ref name="cutts"/&gt;  AWS may also have made it easier for women to be selected non-all-women shortlist seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-are-allwomen-shortlists-the-best-way-to-achieve-equality-in-parliament-412987.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The Big Question: Are all-women shortlists the best way to achieve equality in Parliament? | first=Andy | last=McSmith | date=23 August 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortlists also gave rise to the appointment of the first British female Home Secretary, [[Jacqui Smith]] in June 2007.

However, the United Kingdom has had two female Prime Ministers ([[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979-1990) and [[Theresa May]]) (2016-present), both of whom were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-27|title=List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;oldid=832770990|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the only major political party not to use all women shortlists.

In May 2018, over 300 women were claimed to be quitting the Labour Party in protest at the inclusion of transgender women on all-women shortlists. In an open letter to [[The Times]], ten members said that the policy "reeks of male authority and male supremacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Allegretti | first = Aubrey | title = 300 women 'to quit' Labour to protest all-women shortlist update | url = https://news.sky.com/story/300-women-quit-labour-to-protest-all-women-shortlist-update-11354746 | work = [[Sky News]] | date = 1 May 2018 | access-date = 2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zeffman | first = Henry | title = Women quit Labour over transgender row | url = https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/women-quit-labour-over-transgender-row-jlxpgtp0c | work = [[The Times]] | subscription = yes | date = 1 May 2018 | access-date = 2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
Many countries today use political gender quotas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quotaproject.org/country.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the first to use party reservations for female candidates by political parties were Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In 1983, the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] mandated that "at all elections and nominations both sexes must be represented by at least 40 per cent", and in 1994, the [[Swedish Social Democratic Workers' Party]] mandated  "every second on the list a woman", which meant that male and female candidates would be alternated between each other on the [[party list]] of preferred candidates, a format known as a "zipper quota".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’brien|first=Diana Z.|last2=Rickne|first2=Johanna|date=2016-02-01|title=Gender Quotas and Women's Political Leadership|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/div-classtitlegender-quotas-and-womenandaposs-political-leadershipdiv/0C8CC7B51CC37871A1B1FD925A8AA976|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=110|issue=1|pages=112–126|doi=10.1017/S0003055415000611|issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quota was imposed on 290 local parties by the national party organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the party created a handbook for women with advice about how to seek political office.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1988, the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democrats]] "each sex has the right to a representation of at least 40 per cent of the Social Democratic candidates for local and regional elections. If there is not a sufficient number of candidates from each sex, this right will not fully come into effect"; however, this party law was abolished in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.idea.int/women/parl/ch4c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iraq]] held its first post-Saddam parliamentary elections in January 2005 under an electoral law providing for compulsory integration of women on the candidate lists, like several European countries with a [[Proportional representation|proportional electoral system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Demirdöğen|first=Ülkü|year=2014|title=The Role of International Organizations in the Adoption of Gender Quotas: Afghanistan and Iraq as Case Studies|url=http://paperroom.ipsa.org/papers/paper_15771.pdf|journal=International Journal of Social Inquiry|volume=7|pages=1–21|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Latin American political parties’ gender policies for candidates often have a relationship to their respective countries’ legalized gender quotas for governing bodies. Fourteen Latin American countries have such a quota for their legislatures; these countries consist of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/world/americas/02iht-letter02.html|title=Latin America Opens Up to Equality|last=Torregrosa|first=Luisita Lopez|date=2012-05-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-10|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political parties in Latin American countries utilize a variety of systems to pick their candidates for office, with Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay having “fairly informal selection rules” for their candidates, in which party elites have large amounts of influence, while those in Paraguay and Costa Rica use more stringent methods of selection described by formal and written rules within the political parties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjarnegård|first=Elin|last2=Zetterberg|first2=Pär|date=2014-07-03|title=Why Are Representational Guarantees Adopted for Women and Minorities?

=== South Korea ===
[[South Korea]] has a system in which gender quotas exist for its single national legislative body, the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]], with a requirement that women hold 30% of the National Assembly’s 246 single-member constituency seats and 50% of its 54 proportionally elected seats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Hyunji|last2=Shin|first2=Ki-Young|date=2016-06-01|title=Gender Quotas and Candidate Selection Processes in South Korean Political Parties|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/paaf/paaf/2016/00000089/00000002/art00006|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=89|issue=2|pages=345–368|doi=10.5509/2016892345}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, “neither of the two major political parties has thus far nominated women to more than 10 percent of the single-member district seats,” resulting in women constituting 15.7% of National Assembly members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This situation is largely due to the candidate selection process of South Korean political parties, whose “rules governing candidate selection lack routinization,” allowing party leaders to have significant influence regarding candidates and the ability to circumvent gender quotas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
All-women shortlists and similar policies have largely drawn the same criticisms as the [[Women in government|gender quotas]] of which they represent a subset. One category of criticism asserts that gender quotas represent a positive step, but do not accomplish enough. Some criticism in this vein asserts that quotas should include penalties for groups who do not follow them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3220131/gender-quotas-european-union/|title=Only Gender Quotas Can Stop the E.U. from Being a Boys Club|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/do-quotas-for-female-politicians-work/381320/|title=Do Quotas for Female Politicians Work?|last=Moura|first=Paula|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some critics argue that quotas in corporations in addition to those in governing bodies, should be instituted among other measures to improve public and private sector career opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

However, other critics believe that gender quota policies, like those of which all-women shortlists represent a subset, do not, no matter their requirements, provide a way for women to achieve equality in government. For instance, some critics in this arena believe that gender quotas and debate regarding them does not represent real or substantive gains for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-german-gender-mystery|title=The German Gender Mystery|date=2013-09-30|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some criticisms of gender quotas, including all-women shortlists, argue that even with quotas in place, societal norms discouraging women from holding leadership positions still prevent significant changes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; More specifically, these critics assert that even when women do run for office under quota systems, they face a lack of monetary support and as a result often do not win elections.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">The '''''Begabtenprüfung''''' ({{IPA-de|bəˈɡaːptn̩ˌpʁyːfʊŋ|lang}}, "aptitude examination", literally "examination of the gifted") is a [[Tertiary education|college]] admission examination in [[Germany]] which provides an alternative to the [[Abitur]] or qualifies the student for a "field-specific Abitur" (''[[:de:Fachgebundene Hochschulreife|Fachgebundene Hochschulreife]]''). Its formal German name is ''Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen'' (Examination for College Attendance by Specially Qualified Workers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmk.org/fileadmin/veroeffentlichungen_beschluesse/1982/1982_05_28-Pruefung-Hochschulzugang_bes_befaehig_Berufstaetige.pdf Vereinbarung über die Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen], Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 27./28.05.1982, Sekretariat der ständigen Konferenz der Kultusminister der Länder in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, revised 3 March 2010 {{de icon}} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Candidates must be 25 or older, unable to enroll in an educational institution and take the non-student Abitur (see below) and not in possession of a field-specific Abitur with the possibility of upgrading it to the general Abitur, and have completed an [[apprenticeship]], trade school training, or governmental/military training and then worked for 5 or more years in that profession, or completed secondary school with a non-college-bound certificate and then have seven or more years of employment and/or as a single head of household with dependents, and show evidence of independent preparation. Those who have failed the examination twice are ineligible to re-take it, subject to the right of individual [[States of Germany|states]] to grant exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Vereinbarung über die Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative examinations==
Instead of the Begabtenprüfung, the states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Saarland]] offer a ''Nichtschülerprüfung'' (examination for non-students) or ''Externenabitur'' (external Abitur), formally called a non-student Abitur, ''Abiturprüfung für Nichtschülerinnen und Nichtschüler''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abi-nachholen.de/begabtenpruefung.html Begabtenprüfung in neun Bundesländern], abi-nachholen.de, 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has a minimum age of 19 and requires the candidate not to have been enrolled in an educational institution during the preceding year, except for special cases such as [[Waldorf school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abi-nachholen.de/externenpruefung.html Nichtschülerprüfung, auch Externenprüfung], abi-nachholen.de, 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination==
The Begabtenprüfung is regulated and administered at the state level by a commission.&lt;ref&gt;Vereinbarung über die Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example in [[Bavaria]]: [http://www.stmuk.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/schulen/merkblatt_begabtenpr_fung.pdf Merkblatt über die Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen - Begabtenprüfung]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Unterricht und Kultus, July 2006 {{de icon}} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination consists of an oral and a written component, to be graded at a standard corresponding to the Abitur.

The written examination consists of 3 components each of 4–5 hours:
* a German language test
* a test in the candidate's choice of mathematics or a foreign language
* a test in the subject the person wishes to study, which must be offered by a college in the state (this may be waived for demonstrably qualified candidates)

The oral examination consists of
* a test in mathematics or a foreign language, whichever the candidate did not elect for the written examination
* a test in the subject the person wishes to study
* a test in another subject chosen by the examiners from one of two groups such that it is remote from the candidate's employment expertise but demonstrates his or her well roundedness&lt;ref&gt;Vereinbarung über die Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen pp. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Begabtenprüfung dates to before World War II. For example, &lt;!-- [[Basilea Schlink|Mother Basilea]] passed the Begabtenprüfung in 1930 after training as a teacher and thereafter studied in Berlin and Hamburg for her doctorate, and --&gt; Fritz Behrens, a communist who became a professor at the [[University of Leipzig]] immediately after completing his [[Habilitation]] in 1947, entered university after taking the Begabtenprüfung and received his doctorate in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Jessen, ''Akademische Elite und kommunistische Diktatur: die ostdeutsche Hochschullehrerschaft in der Ulbricht-Ära'', Kritische Studien zur Geschichtswissenschaft 135, Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999, {{ISBN|3-525-35797-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=38eKPXNuLrwC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=Begabtenpr%C3%BCfung+SBZ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TFzQTI7wC4WmcKz21JgC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Begabtenpr%C3%BCfung%20SBZ&amp;f=false p. 319] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, making further education available to those who had been unable to graduate from a ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' was a priority in both Western and Russian sectors of Germany, but in the Soviet zone and later the [[East Germany|GDR]] responsibility for the Begabtenprüfung was placed with the college or university rather than the locality; institutions were required to provide ''Vorstudienanstalten'' (pre-study institutes) to prepare workers for the examination, and after 1949, to have integrated departments for workers and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;"Nr. 9 Hochschulkonferenz Wiesbaden (17.6.1946)" in Mannfred Heinemann, Klaus-Dieter Müller, Michael Reinbold and Thomas Heerich, ''Süddeutsche Hochschulkonferenzen 1945-1949'', Berlin: Akademie, 1997, {{ISBN|3-05-002852-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbAIR5m3px8C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Begabtenpr%C3%BCfung+SBZ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TFzQTI7wC4WmcKz21JgC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Begabtenpr%C3%BCfung%20SBZ&amp;f=false p. 76 and note 2] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Booktrack''' is the creator of the [[e-reader]] technology that incorporates multimedia such as music, sound effects, and ambient sound. The company was founded and maintains offices in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] and is headquartered in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booktrack About|url=https://booktrack.com/about|work=Booktrack.com|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is privately funded by a wide range of investors including [[Peter Thiel]], founder and former CEO of [[PayPal]], and Mark D'Arcy, Director of Global Creative Solutions at [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kiwi software puts the interactive into e-books|url=http://www.idealog.co.nz/news/2011/08/kiwi-software-puts-interactive-e-books|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The idea for Booktrack arose in 2008 when co-founder Mark Cameron regularly commuted by ferry in [[Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New company aims to enhance the act of reading|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/83932/new-company-aims-to-enhance-the-act-of-reading|newspaper=Radio New Zealand|date=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realized that as he read, a song would regularly come up on his music player that would complement the passage, with a bright song serendipitously accompanying a lighthearted passage. As he looked around the ferry at other commuters who were also simultaneously reading and listening to music, he realized the potential for a company that could replicate this experience, melding sound with text to provide an immersive reading environment. He reached out to his brother, Paul, and they spent three years building the technology before launching the site in August, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mace|first=William|title=Kiwis launch 'world-first' eBook app|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/5509434/Kiwis-launch-world-first-e-book-app|newspaper=NZ Stuff|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
The proprietary and patented technology behind Booktrack works by determining the speed at which any given reader is expected to progress through every word of a given text, and then matching music, sound effects, and ambient sound to every word. Using advanced algorithms, the audio is matched to readers' speed. Music, sound effects, and ambient audio tracks are recorded separately, allowing readers to set their own preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJAOOPdw3h8|work=What is Booktrack|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Booktracks incorporate both original and licensed music from a wide range of sources. To date, Booktracks have included original music composed by acclaimed sound artist Stephen Gallagher performed by the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]], as well as music licensed from [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]. Many authors work in conjunction with the composers to develop appropriate music for their books.

Booktracks are available for download through the Booktrack Bookshelf app in the Apple App Store,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=iTunes App Store|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/booktrack-bookshelf/id455861970?ls=1&amp;mt=8|work=iTunes App Store "Booktrack"}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Play]] and on a PC using a web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booktrack|url=https://www.booktrack.com/|work=Booktrack.com|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booktrack Studio===

In September 2013, Booktrack introduced Booktrack Studio allowing writers and creatives to add a synchronized movie-style soundtrack—including music, ambient audio and sound effects—to a story, with the audio paced to each individual’s reading speed. The platform enables writers to create and share stories and provides readers with a new type of reading experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawler|first=Ryan|title=Booktrack Gives Everyone The Tools To Add Soundtracks To Their Stories With Booktrack Studio|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/05/booktrack-studio/|accessdate=October 3, 2013|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Booktrack Studio app was selected by Google to be featured on the re-launched Chrome Web Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Jon|title=Google celebrates Chrome's 5th birthday with desktop/mobile Chrome Apps|url=http://www.techworld.com.au/article/525852/google_celebrates_chrome_5th_birthday_desktop_mobile_chrome_apps/|accessdate=October 3, 2013|newspaper=TechWorld|date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Booktrack Studio anyone can easily add music, ambient sound and effects to any digital text, from a book or a short story to poetry or a travel blog. They can then immediately publish their work to the Booktrack Library for anyone to read and listen to. Versions are in development for mobile, all browsers and other e-reader platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Popescu|first=Adam|title=Booktrack Adds Customized Playlists to E-Books|url=http://mashable.com/2013/09/10/booktrack/|accessdate=October 3, 2013|work=Mashable|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booktrack Editions===

The first Booktrack download was a version of [[The Power of Six]], the second book in the [[Lorien Legacies]] by Pittacus Lore and the sequel to [[I Am Number Four]]. The book was released in conjunction with [[HarperCollins]] and [[James Frey]]'s transmedia publishing company, Full Fathom Five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booktrack.com Blog|url=https://www.booktrack.com/a-proud-day|work=NEW EBOOK GENRE BACKED BY MAJOR NAMES IN PUBLISHING, LITERATURE, MUSIC AND TECHNOLOGY|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Booktrack edition of The Power of Six includes more than 70 originally scored compositions and was produced under the direction of John Neill, the head of sound at [[Park Road Post]], and includes contributions by award-winning composer and sound editor Stephen Gallagher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio New Zealand Sunday Arts|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/artsonsunday/audio/2498170/book-track|work=Booktrack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Stephen|title=StephenGallagher.Co.NZ|url=http://www.stephengallagher.co.nz/diary/power-six-booktrack|work=The Power Of Six /Booktrack|accessdate=October 28, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208024351/http://stephengallagher.co.nz/diary/power-six-booktrack|archivedate=February 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also provided a Booktrack edition of [[Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes']] The Adventure of the Speckled Band. Since then, the company has published editions of [[Salman Rushdie| Salman Rushdie's]] short story '' In the South '' and classics including [[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]], [[The Ugly Duckling]], [[The Happy Prince and Other Tales|The Selfish Giant]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], [[Peter Pan]], [[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]], and [[Charles Dickens| Charles Dickens']] [[A Christmas Carol]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Booktracks created by Booktrack Studio users can be read from the Booktrack Studio app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booktrack|url=https://www.booktrack.com/readers|work=Booktrack.com|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Booktrack was met with a great interest, with articles written about it in [[The New York Times]], [[The Atlantic]], [[Mashable]], [[Business Insider]], the '' [[Los Angeles Times]] '' and '' [[The Guardian]] '' among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booktrack Press|url=http://www.booktrack.com/press|work=Booktrack.com Press|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '' [[The Times]] '' called Booktrack "An Advance in electronic publishing" while '' [[The Huffington Post]] '' said it was "Revolutionary", ''[[TechCrunch]]'' called it "An effort to create a whole new genre of e-books," and ''[[The Atlantic]]'' asked whether it might be "the future of reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mansey|first=Kate|title=Can you Turn Down that Book Please?|newspaper=The Sunday Times of London|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Booktrack Adds A Soundtrack To The Books You Read|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/01/booktrack-adds-book-soundtrack_n_944971.html|work=The Huffington Post | first=Andrew|last=Losowsky|date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wauters|first=Robin|title=Fad Or Future?

While many praised the idea, several people criticized it as a bad idea that was counter to the entire purpose of a reading experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Paul|title=Booktrack: Just A Horrible Idea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6914">[[File:A beach party.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bystander intervention aims to teach people to intervene at parties and dances when they see a person making sexual advances on an intoxicated person.]]
'''Bystander intervention''' is a type of training used in post-secondary education institutions to prevent [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]],  [[binge drinking]] and harassment and unwanted comments of a [[racism|racist]], [[homophobia|homophobic]], or [[transphobia|transphobic]] nature. A bystander is a person who is present at an event, party, or other setting who notices a problematic situation, such as a man making sexual advances on a drunk person. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=A proactive bystander is an individual who accepts personal responsibility for a situation and intervenes to ensure the well-being and/or safety of others.}} &lt;/ref&gt; The bystander then takes on personal responsibility and takes action to intervene, with the goal of preventing the situation from escalating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The bystander who is intervening has several options, including distracting either of the people, getting help from others, checking in later, or directly intervening. There are risks to bystander intervention; it can lead to fights, it can ruin the mood for the people who were "intervened" into, and it can lead to confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Bystander intervention may also be called "bystander education", because the model is based on a system of educating trainers and leaders who will then go on to train people from their community.
==Preventing sexual assault==
One bystander intervention researcher suggests that a potential sexual assault be stopped by pretending to spill a drink on a drunk man who is trying to make sexual moves on an intoxicated woman, to distract him and "...stop bad behavior before it crosses the line from drunken partying to sexual assault". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Advocates hope that bystander intervention programs can yield the same results on sexual assault that designated driver initiatives have had in reducing impaired driving; another similarity is that both programs do not discourage drinking itself, only the combination of drinking and law-breaking. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some US universities are introducing bystander education initiatives to comply with [[Title IX]], which requires US universities which receive federal funding to not discriminate according to gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A study on bystander intervention by the University of New Hampshire showed that 38 percent of the men who saw a bystander intervention campaign said they intervened to stop a sexual assault, versus only 12 percent of the control group (who did not see the campaign). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; An Ohio University study compared men who took a bystander intervention session with a group of men who did not have the training; 1.5 percent of the bystander intervention participants said they had committed sexual assault over the last four months, versus 6.7 percent from the untrained group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvdvpw/white-women-less-likely-to-help-sexual-assault-victim-if-shes-black |title=White Women Less Likely to Help Sexual Assault Victim If She's Black {{!}} Bystander intervention is seen as one of the most powerful tools in preventing on-campus sexual assaults—but a new study shows that white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help their black peers. |last= Bess|first=Gabby |date=13 March 2017 |website=broadly.vice.com |publisher=Broadly/Vice |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote="We found that although white students correctly perceived that black women were at risk in a pre-assault situation, they tended not to feel as personally involved in the situation," the researchers at SUNY Geneseo, Jennifer Katz and Christine Merrilees, said in an interview with PsyPost. In other words, "despite their shared status as women, white female bystanders in the current study may have felt that a Black woman's plight was not as personally relevant because race has a more powerful effect than gender on intent to intervene and feelings of responsibility to intervene," they write in the study.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CEB (Continuing Education of the Bar • California)''' is a self-supporting program of the [[University of California]]. Founded in 1947 to educate veterans returning to the practice of law after service in World War II, CEB pioneered formal [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) and modernized its presentation by providing three, six, and 24 hour courses in locations that were convenient to California practitioners. CEB fulfills its mandate to cultivate the professional development of California lawyers by offering CLE courses and by publishing practice guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceb.com/aboutceb/welcome.asp |title=About CEB |publisher=Ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEB has received multiple awards from the [[Association for Continuing Legal Education]] (ACLEA), including the Award of Professional Excellence for Publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Winners of ACLEA awards|url= http://www.aclea.org/?page=winners#entries.|publisher=Aclea.org|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, CEB accepted ACLEA’s Best Publication award for the book, “Employee Leave Laws: Compliance and Litigation.” In addition, in 2016 CEB was ranked as the best CLE provider in California by the readers of The Recorder legal newspaper for the sixth year in a row, and in 2013 the third-best legal research vendor.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/ca/TR_The%20Best%202014_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives of the program==
As set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding for the Sponsorship of the Continuing Education of the Bar Program by the [[Regents of the University of California]], CEB's objectives are to:

# Keep members of the legal profession informed of changes and developments in the law through instruction, publications and other services;
# Provide continuing legal education to members of the legal profession in significant areas of legal practice;
# Promote greater efficiency in the practice of law by providing instruction, publications, and other services for law office management;
# Present courses and publish materials concerned with the ethical and professional responsibilities of the members of the legal profession;
# Provide such other services supportive of the purposes set forth above.

CEB's goal is to collaborate with members of the legal profession to "deliver the best current knowledge for the proficient and successful practice of law, thereby contributing to the betterment of the members of the legal profession, the public and the administration of justice."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum of Understanding for the Joint Sponsorship of the Continuing Education of the Bar, executed by the State Bar of California and the Regents of the University of California on September 12, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing committee==
Oversight of CEB is provided by the CEB Governing Committee. The Committee consists of nine voting members: four members appointed by the [[State Bar of California]] and five members appointed by the [[University of California]]. The University appoints the chair, and the State Bar's Board of Governors appoints the vice chair. The vice chair must be a lawyer in active practice in California. The other members the State Bar appoints include the Executive Director of the State Bar, or the Executive Director's designee who must be a lawyer, and two members who are actively practicing law in California, at least one of whom represents the interests of the sections of the State Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cc.calbar.ca.gov/CommitteesCommissions/Special/CEBGoverningCommittee.aspx |title=Continuing Education of The Bar Governing Committee |publisher=Cc.calbar.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee reviews and approves CEB's annual publishing and educational program, strategic objectives, annual budget, and recommendations from the Director on the overall operation of CEB.

==CLE courses==
CEB's CLE courses are typically presented by practicing attorneys and judges with expertise in the course's subject matter. All CEB courses are also available through CEB's "On Demand" service. In June 2012, CEB began offering podcasts on recent developments, beginning with two podcasts on the decision in Brinker Restaurant Corp. v Superior Court (Hohnbaum) (2012) 53 C4th 1004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceb.com/lawalerts/brinker-discussion.asp |title=Podcasts: Find out what Brinker means for plaintiffs and defendants in wage and hour class actions |publisher=Ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLE courses cover substantive practice areas including business law, criminal law, employment law, estate planning, real property law, family law, and litigation. CEB also offers law practice management programs, including "Making Sure You Get Paid: Accounts Receivable Management" which is available online to members of the Bar free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceb.com/CEBSite/product.asp?calling%5Fpage=CLEProgramsDisplay%2Easp&amp;catalog%5Fname=CEB&amp;menu%5Fcategory=CLE+Courses&amp;main%5Fcategory=CLE+Program&amp;sub%5Fcategory=CLE+Programs+Practice+Skills&amp;category%5Fname=&amp;product%5Fid=MI57024&amp;Page=1 |title=Making Sure You Get Paid: Accounts Receivable Management :: Free Program! [2010&amp;#93; (CLE) |publisher=ceb.com |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEB also tackles subjects required by the [[California State Bar]]'s minimum Continuing Legal Education Program, including legal ethics, elimination of bias, and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceb.com/CEBSite/menu_category.asp?catalog%5Fname=CEB&amp;menu%5Fcategory=CLE+Courses |title=CEB Continuing Legal Education - Live Seminars, Telephone Topics, On Demand Webcast, CLE Passports, Audio CDs, Reference Materials |publisher=ceb.com |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year CEB and the [[University of California, Los Angeles School of Law]] present a 12-hour Estate Planning Institute in Los Angeles. The program focuses on advanced estate planning and estate tax issues. Each January, CEB presents a two-day fair in several locations across California that focuses on recent developments in the areas of estate planning, real property, business law, civil litigation and torts, and ethics.

In 2013 CEB created the Estate Planning Intensive Course (EPIC) and in 2015 the Family Law Intensive Course (FLIC). Both courses prepare attorneys for the Certified Specialist exams in their respective fields. The courses are online over 12 weeks from July to Oct every odd year before the late October exam is administered.

==Publications==
CEB publishes more than 120 regularly updated practice guides in substantive areas including business law; civil litigation and torts; criminal law; employment law &amp; workers' compensation; estate planning, trust and probate; family law; public law; and real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceb.com/CEBSite/menu_category.asp?catalog%5Fname=CEB&amp;menu%5Fcategory=Bookstore |title=CEB Books - Print and Online, Action Guides, Reporters, Judicial Council Forms, Forms Manual |publisher=ceb.com |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEB also publishes books on law practice management topics.

==Spirit of CEB Awards==
Throughout the years, the key to the success of CEB's programs and publications has been the generosity of the attorneys and judges who have volunteered to speak and write for CEB. These individuals—motivated not by hopes of personal gain but by their love of teaching and dedication to improving the profession—have made an enduring contribution to the continuing education of attorneys through their work over the years. To acknowledge these contributors and their service to the legal profession, CEB initiated the "Spirit of CEB" Awards in 2005. These awards are an acknowledgement of the selfless sharing of information by these colleagues for the betterment of the legal profession and the society it serves.

'''Civic nationalism''', also known as '''liberal nationalism''', is a form of [[nationalism]] identified by [[political philosophy|political philosophers]] who believe in an inclusive form of [[nationalism]] that adheres with traditional liberal values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auer|first1=Stefan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Central Europe|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134378602|page=5|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=BhNsM_ttOb4C&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, Yael. 1993.

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

'''Education in Nicaragua''' is free for all [[Nicaragua]]ns. Elementary education is free and compulsory although this is not strictly enforced. Many children are not able to attend if their families need to have them work. Communities on the Atlantic Coast have access to education in both Spanish and the languages of the native indigenous tribes that live in the more rural areas of Nicaragua. Higher education has financial, organic and administrative autonomy, according to the law. Freedom of subjects is recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-12/06/content_5442752.htm Nicaragua's President, Daniel Ortega] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228223949/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-12/06/content_5442752.htm |date=2006-12-28 }} to enforce free education&lt;/ref&gt; The school year runs from February through November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solentiname.org/alianza/sister-schools/nicaraguan-school-background-info.html School Background Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The higher education system ==

The oldest institution of higher education in Nicaragua is the [[Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua]], which was founded in 1812, which dates back to the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial period.  Nicaragua became a part of the [[Central American Federation]] in 1821 and declared its independence from [[Spain]]. It left the Federation in 1838 for full independence.

There are many commercial schools and eight [[universities]] throughout the country. Between 2002 and 2003, a total of 100,363 Nicaraguan students attended universities and other institutions of higher learning.  The National Council of Universities is the body responsible for strategic planning in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;The Europa World of Learning 2010. Volume 2, 60th edition. P. 1500-1502&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission to higher education is on the basis of the ''Bachillerato'', the leading [[secondary school]] qualification. Students are also subject to an entrance examination. The ''Licenciado'', the main [[undergraduate]] degree, is a four- or five-year course of study. A professional title may be awarded depending on the subject. Following the ''Licenciado'', the first [[postgraduate]] degree is the ''Maestria'', which lasts two years and culminates with the submission of a [[thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;The Europa World of Learning 2010. Volume 2, 60th edition. P. 1500-1502&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions of higher learning can offer two- or three-year courses in [[technical education|technical]] and [[vocational education]]. The main qualification studied for is the Tecnico Superior.&lt;ref&gt;The Europa World of Learning 2010. Volume 2, 60th edition. P. 1500-1502&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 30 public universities and over 75 private institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altillo.com/universidades/universidades_nicaragua.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education during the Sandinista era==
When the [[Sandinistas]] came to power in 1979, they inherited an education system that was one of the poorest in [[Latin America]]. Under the Somozas, limited spending on education and generalized poverty forced many adolescents into the labor market and constricted educational opportunities for [[Nicaragua]]ns. In the late 1970s, only 65% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school; of those who entered first grade only 22% completed the full six years of the primary school curriculum. Most rural schools offered only one or two years of schooling, and three-quarters of the rural population was illiterate.

Few students enrolled in secondary school, in part because most secondary institutions were private and too expensive for the average family. By these standards, the 8% of the college-age population enrolled in Nicaraguan universities seemed relatively high. Less surprising was that upper-class families typically sent their children abroad for higher education.

[[Image:Nicaragua boys.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Boys at the [[American Nicaraguan School]] in [[Managua]]]]

By 1984 the Sandinista government had approximately doubled the proportion of [[GNP]] spent on pre-university education, the number of primary and secondary school teachers, the number of schools, and the number of students enrolled at all levels of the education system. 

At the [[college]] level, enrollment jumped from 11,142 students in 1978 to 38,570 in 1985. The Sandinistas reshaped the system of higher education: reordering curricular priorities, closing down redundant institutions and programs and establishing new ones, and increasing lower-class access to higher education. Influenced by [[Cuba]]n models, the new curricula were oriented toward development needs. Agriculture, medicine, education, and technology grew at the expense of law, the humanities, and the social sciences.

==Literacy campaign==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:brigs.jpg|thumbnail|right|Literacy campaign propaganda poster]] --&gt;
A 1980 literacy campaign, using secondary school students as volunteer teachers, reduced the [[illiteracy]] rate from 50% to 23% of the population. (The latter figure exceeds the rate of 13% claimed by the literacy campaign, which did not count adults whom the government classified as learning impaired or otherwise unteachable.)

In part to consolidate the gains of the literacy campaign, the Ministry of Education set up a system of informal self-education groups known as Popular Education Cooperatives. Using materials and pedagogical advice provided by the ministry, residents of poor communities met in the evenings to develop basic reading and mathematical skills. The key large-scale programs of the Sandinistas included a massive [[National Literacy Crusade]] (March–August 1980), social program, which received international recognition for their gains in [[literacy]], [[health care]], [[education]], [[childcare]], [[Trade union|unions]], and [[land reform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/arts/nicaragua/discovery_eng/history/background.html Background History] of Nicaragua&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalexchange.org/tours/NicaraguaReportOct2001.html globalexchange.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930000000/http://www.globalexchange.org/tours/NicaraguaReportOct2001.html |date=September 30, 2006 }} Report on Nicaragua&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the hallmarks of Sandinista education (and favored target of anti-Sandinista criticism) was the ideological orientation of the curriculum. The stated goal of instruction was the development of a "new man" whose virtues were to include patriotism, "internationalism," an orientation toward productive work, and a willingness to sacrifice individual interests to social and national interests. Textbooks were nationalist and prorevolutionary in tone, giving ample coverage to Sandinista heroes.

After the 1990 election, the Chamorro government placed education in the hands of critics of Sandinista policy, who imposed more conservative values on the curriculum. A new set of textbooks was produced with support from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), which had provided similar help during the [[Somoza]] era.

Despite the Sandinistas' determined efforts to expand the education system in the early 1980s, Nicaragua remained an undereducated society in 1993. Even before the [[Contra War]] and the economic crisis that forced spending on education back to the 1970 level, the education system was straining to keep up with the rapidly growing school-age population. Between 1980 and 1990, the number of children between five and fourteen years of age had expanded by 35%. At the end of the Sandinista era, the literacy rate had declined from the level attained at the conclusion of the 1980 literacy campaign. Overall school enrollments were larger than they had been in the 1970s, however. Especially in the countryside, access to education had broadened dramatically. But a substantial minority of primary school-age children and three-quarters of secondary school-age students were not in school, and the proportion of students who completed their primary education had not advanced beyond the 1979 level. Even by Central American standards, the Nicaraguan education system was performing poorly.

==Grading system&lt;!--'Academic grading in Nicaragua' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Academic grading in Nicaragua'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; works on a 100-point scale. For [[primary school]] and [[high school]] levels, a 60 is good enough to pass, while for further levels the pass grade is 70. Students who attain from 60 to the [[Grade (education)|pass grade]] get the chance to take one extra test that reviews the year's topics and in which a 70 is needed to achieve a pass grade.

[[File:Sleeping_while_studying.JPG|thumb|Typical example of a sleep deprived college student who is unable to concentrate on her studies, leading to things such as impaired learning and decreased academic performance]]
[[Sleep deprivation]] is simply a condition of having an inadequate amount of sleep. At least 50% of college students exhibit daytime sleepiness due to sleep deprivation compared to 36% of adolescents and adults.&lt;ref name="Hershner_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershner SD, Chervin RD | title = Causes and consequences of sleepiness among college students | journal = Nature and Science of Sleep | volume = 6 | pages = 73–84 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25018659 | pmc = 4075951 | doi = 10.2147/NSS.S62907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; College students, on average, get about 6 to 6.9 hours of sleep per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.uhs.uga.edu/sleep | title = Managing Stress | work = SleepUniversity Health Center | publisher =  University of Georgia University Health Center | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Stanford University]]'s Department for the Diagnosis and Treatment for Sleep Disorders, the recommended amount of sleep needed for college students is around 8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.stanford.edu/~dement/sleepless.html | title = Sleepless at Stanford | publisher = Stanford University | access-date=2018-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most college students are sleep deprived, as 70.6% of students reported that they get less than 8 hours of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lund HG, Reider BD, Whiting AB, Prichard JR | title = Sleep patterns and predictors of disturbed sleep in a large population of college students | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 124–32 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20113918 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.06.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;There are various effects that sleep deprivation can have on college students, including lower academic performance, impaired learning, and decreased physical activity.&lt;ref name="Hershner_2014" /&gt; One primary cause as to why college students experience a lack of sleep is improper sleep hygiene.&lt;ref name="Hershner_2014" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Sleep Hygiene ===
Inadequate sleep hygiene is one primary cause as to why college students experience sleep deprivation. [[Sleep hygiene]] is defined as habits or practices that allow for healthy amounts of sleep on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/sleep-hygiene|title=Sleep Hygiene|website=sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good sleep hygiene habits include keeping a consistent sleep schedule, having a quiet sleep environment, and avoiding consuming caffeine and alcohol before sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepeducation.org/essentials-in-sleep/healthy-sleep-habits|title=Healthy Sleep Habits and Good Sleep Hygiene|website=www.sleepeducation.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students have inadequate sleep hygiene that leads to sleep deprivation.  

==== Alcohol ====

According to a study by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]], approximately 80% of college students have drunk alcohol, with nearly 40% of the students reporting to "binge drinking," or the consumption of an excessive amount of alcohol over a short amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/taskforcereport.pdf|title=A Call to Action: Changing the Culture of Drinking at U.S Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; While alcohol may help with faster sleep, it can affect the quality of the sleep. Alcohol may effect one's REM sleep, the stage of sleep where most dreams and memories occur and are stored. Without REM sleep, one would go straight into deep sleep. This may be why people who have insomnia resort to consuming alcohol in order to fall asleep. However, this can result in alcohol dependence. Relying on alcohol as a sleeping aid can lead to sleepwalk, sleep talk and memory problems.&lt;ref name="Vita_Talalay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vitatalalay.com/alcohol-effects-on-sleep|title=Alcohol Effects On Sleep|work=Vita Talalay|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking alcohol has also been linked to causing obstructive sleep apnea, where it causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep.&lt;ref name="Vita_Talalay" /&gt; In addition, it has been proven that alcohol can cause insomnia. Researchers from the [[University of Missouri School of Medicine]] observed the effects of alcohol on sleep. The results showed that drinking alcohol boosted the adenosine levels. Adenosine levels go up when one is awake and go down when one is asleep. The participants in this study had extended periods of regular drinking and as a result, sleep came quickly to them. However, the participants woke up in a few hours and suffered from insomnia.&lt;ref name="Vita_Talalay" /&gt;

==== Technology ====
The blue light that is emitted from the screens of phones, computers and other devices stops the production of melatonin, the hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle of the circadian rhythm. Reducing the amount of melatonin produced makes it harder to fall and stay asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sleep.org/articles/ways-technology-affects-sleep/|title=How Technology Impacts Sleep Quality {{!}} Sleep.org|work=Sleep.Org|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundation, it reported that approximately 90% of Americans used technology in the hour before bed.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sleepfoundation.org/media-center/press-release/annual-sleep-america-poll-exploring-connections-communications-technology-use-|title=Annual Sleep in America Poll Exploring Connections with Communications Technology Use and Sleep|website=sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poll noted that young adults and teenagers were more likely to use cell phones, computers, and video game consoles.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation" /&gt; Additionally, the authors of the poll found that technology use was connected to sleep patterns. 22% of participants reported going to sleep with cell phone ringers on in their bedroom and 10% reported awakenings in at least a few nights per week due to their cell phones' ringers.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation" /&gt; Among those with the cell phone ringers on, being awakened by their cell phone was correlated to difficulty sustaining sleep.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation" /&gt;

==== Caffeine ====
A study from the [[University of Kentucky]] depicted that more than 78% of college freshmen consume above the recommended amount of caffeine each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=McIlvain|first=Gary Eugene|title=Caffeine Consumption Patterns and Beliefs of College Freshmen|date=2008|publisher=University of Kentucky|url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/gradschool_diss/638/|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one group of researchers' study from the Henry Ford Hospital's Sleep and Research Center and Wayne State College of Medicine, they discovered that caffeine consumed at least six hours before bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep.&lt;ref name="Drake_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drake C, Roehrs T, Shambroom J, Roth T | title = Caffeine effects on sleep taken 0, 3, or 6 hours before going to bed | journal = Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1195–200 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24235903 | pmc = 3805807 | doi = 10.5664/jcsm.3170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this study who consumed caffeine right before bedtime, three hours before bedtime, and six hours before bedtime all experienced a shorter night's sleep, lower sleep quality and spent more time awake at night.&lt;ref name="Drake_2013" /&gt;

== Effects  ==

=== Academic ===
There is evidence that sleep is correlated with [[Grading in education|GPA]]. GPA is associated with the students' overall academic performances in their classes. Students who had longer amounts of sleep had higher GPAs than students who had shorter amounts of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285664611_The_relationship_between_sleep_length_and_grade-point_average_among_college_students| vauthors = Kelly W, Kelly KE, Clanton RC | title = The relationship between sleep length and grade-point average among college students | journal = College Student Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–86  |date= January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, researchers from the Sleep Health Institute and Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorder at the Departments of Medicine and Neurology in the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, created a study to discover how irregular sleep patterns are associated with poorer academic performances. The students who participated in this study kept online diaries of their sleep schedules for 30 days. The researchers divided the participants into two groups: regular sleepers, or those who went to bed and woke up around the same time every day and irregular sleepers, or those who have different sleep patterns every day. Using a scoring index from zero to 100 to calculate a student’s sleep schedule, students with irregular sleeping patterns were given lower scores closer to zero while the students with regular sleeping patterns had scores closer to 100. The researchers found that for every score increase of 10 on the scoring index, the student had an average increase of 0.10 of their GPA. The researchers concluded that college students who do not go to bed or wake up at consistent time are likely to have lower GPAs. The study suggests that irregular sleeping schedules do indeed affect student’s GPA and academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips AJ, Clerx WM, O'Brien CS, Sano A, Barger LK, Picard RW, Lockley SW, Klerman EB, Czeisler CA | title = Irregular sleep/wake patterns are associated with poorer academic performance and delayed circadian and sleep/wake timing | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 3216 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28607474 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03171-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical ===
Student's physical shape seems to be affected by sleep deprivation as well. Researchers from the Imperial College School of Medicine conducted a randomized controlled study to investigate the effects of a night of sleep deprivation on the physical performance in students. The participants were randomized into two conditions, normal sleep or one night of sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation was monitored using an online-time stamped questionnaire at 45 minute intervals, done in the participant’s homes. The results show that reaction time and exercise performance were significantly affected by sleep deprivation. The researchers concluded that sleep deprivation can affect physical performance in university students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patrick Y, Lee A, Raha O, Pillai K, Gupta S, Sethi S, Mukeshimana F, Gerard L, Moghal MU, Saleh SN, Smith SF, Morrell MJ, Moss J | title = Effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive and physical performance in university students | journal = Sleep and Biological Rhythms | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 217–225 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28680341 | pmc = 5489575 | doi = 10.1007/s41105-017-0099-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Interventions ==

=== Naps ===
Daytime naps offer a potential intervention for sleep deprivation in college students. Napping may improve certain memory tasks as students who were excelling in their academics were more likely to nap than those who had low academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eliasson AH, Lettieri CJ, Eliasson AH | title = Early to bed, early to rise! Sleep habits and academic performance in college students | journal = Sleep &amp; Breathing = Schlaf &amp; Atmung | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–5 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19603214 | doi = 10.1007/s11325-009-0282-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep Courses ===
In one study, participants took a two-credit, 18-week course that included group discussions, lectures, and self-evaluation of topics that included circadian rhythms, sleep hygiene, muscle relaxation, and public sleep education. Participants reported that they had improved sleep quality and sleep hygiene throughout the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai LL, Li SP | title = Sleep education in college: a preliminary study | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 99 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 837–48 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15648478 | doi = 10.2466/pms.99.3.837-848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ===
In one study, a revised type of cognitive behavioral for treating insomnia was sent to participating students by email. The email contained an attachment addressing several aspects of sleep, such as techniques for relaxation and methods to stabilize the circadian rhythm. This method was compared to another program called Breathe which was created in order to reduce symptoms of depression and to cope with high stress. Participants in the Breathe program showed improvements in sleep quality and a decrease in depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Trockel M, Manber R, Chang V, Thurston A, Taylor CB, Tailor CB | title = An e-mail delivered CBT for sleep-health program for college students: effects on sleep quality and depression symptoms | journal = Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–81 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21677898 | pmc = 3113967 | doi = 10.5664/JCSM.1072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;While this study only had a small number of participants, the final results showed hope as an effective method that can help with sleep deprivation for college students.

'''Ernst von Glasersfeld''' (March 8, 1917, [[Munich]] &amp;ndash; November 12, 2010, [[Leverett, Massachusetts|Leverett]], [[Franklin County, Massachusetts]]) was a [[philosopher]], and [[emeritus professor]] of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Georgia]], research associate at the [[Scientific Reasoning Research Institute]], and adjunct professor in the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. He was a member of the board of trustees of the [[American Society of Cybernetics]], from which he received the [[McCulloch Memorial Award]] in 1991. He was a member of the scientific board of the [[Instituto Piaget]], [[Lisbon]].

==Biography==
Von Glasersfeld was born in [[Munich]], where his father, Leopold, worked as a [[cultural attaché]] in Vienna before going into photography after World War I. He was a student of mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]] before having to move out because of the [[Nazi]] threat, considering that his [[Pan-European identity|Pan-European]] family (they subscribed to the ideology of [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]]) was known to be "enemies of any form of nationalism" and his grandfather was [[Jewish]] (a convert to [[Roman Catholicism]])&lt;ref&gt;Gisela Holfter &amp; Horst Dickel, ''An Irish Sanctuary: German-speaking Refugees in Ireland 1933–1945'', Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG (2016), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;. He thus spent large parts of his life in Ireland (1940s), in Italy (1950s) where he worked with [[Silvio Ceccato]], and in the United States. Elaborating upon [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[genetic epistemology]], [[Bishop Berkeley]]'s theory of perception, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', and other important texts. Von Glasersfeld developed his model of [[Constructivist epistemology#Radical constructivism|radical constructivism]], which is an [[ethos]] shared by all of these writers to one degree or another.

Ernst von Glasersfeld’s literary estate is administered and curated at the Ernst-von-Glasersfeld-Archive at the University of Innsbruck.

'''European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System''' ('''ECTS''') credits are a standard means for comparing the "volume of learning
based on the defined learning outcomes and their associated workload" for [[higher education]] across the [[European Union]] and other collaborating European countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ECTS Users’ Guide | publisher = Publications Office of the European Union | page = 10 | year = 2015 | url = https://ec.europa.eu/education/sites/education/files/ects-users-guide_en.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;. For successfully completed studies, ECTS credits are awarded. One academic year corresponds to 60 '''ECTS credits''' that are normally equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of total workload, irrespective of standard or qualification type. ECTS credits are used to facilitate transfer and progression throughout the Union.
ECTS also includes a standard [[ECTS grading scale|grading scale]], intended to be shown in addition to local (i.e. national) standard grades:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-policy/doc48_en.htm|title=European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) - Education and training - European Commission|website=Education and training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloria J. Romero''' (born July 10, 1955) is active in education reform in California, a former California State Senator and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[majority leader]] of the [[California State Senate]] from 2001 until 2008. She was the first woman to ever hold that leadership position.

==Early life and career==
Romero grew up in [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], one of six children. Her father worked in the railroad yards and her mother, who left school after sixth grade, stayed home and raised the kids. Romero received her [[associate's degree]] from [[Barstow Community College]] before going on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[California State University, Long Beach]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[psychology]] from the [[University of California, Riverside]].

She taught as a [[professor]] at state universities and served as a trustee and vice president of the board of trustees of [[Los Angeles Community College District]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Legislative career==
She was elected to the [[California State Assembly]] in 1998 and to the Senate in 2001.  Romero represented the [[California's 24th State Senate district|24th district]], which includes [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]], portions of the city of Los Angeles, as well as a major part of the [[San Gabriel Valley]], including the cities of [[Azusa, California|Azusa]], [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]], [[Covina, California|Covina]], [[Duarte, California|Duarte]], [[El Monte, California|El Monte]], [[Industry, California|City of Industry]], [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]], [[La Puente, California|La Puente]], [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], [[Rosemead, California|Rosemead]], [[West Covina, California|West Covina]] and [[Whittier, California|Whittier]].

In 2008, Romero stepped down as Majority Leader and became chairman of the Education Committee.&lt;ref name=WSJ01/&gt; In that position she authored and guided to passage a fiercely contested&lt;ref&gt;Libby, Ken, [http://www.schoolsmatter.info/2010/03/how-to-buy-candidate-gloria-romero-for.html "How to Buy a Candidate: Gloria Romero for CA Superintendent of Public Instruction"], ''SchoolsMatter'' blog, March 08, 2010. Retrieved 2012-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘parent trigger’ law which allows a majority of parents in a failing school to vote on a method to restructure the school.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John, [http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2012/02/02/q-a-gloria-romero-author-of-californias-parent-trigger-law/ "Q &amp; A: Gloria Romero, Author Of California’s ‘Parent Trigger’ Law"], ''StateImpact'' (local public media and [[NPR]]), February 2, 2012. Retrieved 2012-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romero was term-limited in 2010.&lt;ref name=WSJ01/&gt;

As a public university professor in California, she is a member of the [[California Faculty Association]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Campaign for State Superintendent of Public Instruction==
Following U.S. Representative [[Hilda Solis]]'s December 2008 selection to become [[U.S. Secretary of Labor]] by President-elect [[Barack Obama]] (and expected subsequent confirmation), Romero indicated strong interest in running in the [[California's 32nd congressional district special election, 2009|special election for California's 32nd congressional district]] to replace her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama's pick of Hilda Solis for Labor prompts some to eye her House seat |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/12/campaigns-begin.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 18, 2008 |accessdate=19 December 2008 |author=[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/dan/morain Morain, Dan]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later chose to run for the nonpartisan [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;

==Education reform==
Romero leads the California chapter of [[Democrats for Education Reform]], an interest group funded by Wall Street hedge fund managers who support charter schools. In the 2012 election, she is campaigning for California's [[California state elections, November 2012#Proposition 32|Prop. 32]] that would bar unions from withholding money from worker paychecks to finance political activities.&lt;ref name=WSJ01&gt;Finley, Allysia, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444443504577601664135014368?mod=opinion_newsreel "Gloria Romero: The Trials of a Democratic Reformer"], ''Wall Street Journal'', August 31, 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1437">The '''Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies''' at [[Tsinghua University]] ({{zh|c= 清华IUP中文中心}}) is a prestigious [[Mandarin Chinese]] study center in [[Beijing]] associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]]. IUP started in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] in 1963 and was known as [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Center. In 1997 it moved to Beijing, following [[Mainland China]]'s [[Reform and opening]], and the original Stanford Center in Taipei was renamed the [[International Chinese Language Program]].

IUP currently offers a 32-week Academic Year Program, a 16-week Semester Option, and an 8-week Summer Intensive Program. All programs are located on its [[Tsinghua University]] campus in Beijing.

Classes sizes are very small: typically a class will involve 50-minutes of Chinese-only instruction with a professor and 2-3 students seated around a small table. A typical course load is 3-5 such classes a day from Monday to Friday, with about 4–6 hours of homework in the evenings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15613">The '''International History Bee and Bowl''' ('''IHBB''') are history quiz competitions for individual students and school teams outside the United States. Within the United States, students compete in the comparable [[National History Bee and Bowl]]; the same organization, [[International Academic Competitions]], oversees the International and National (i.e. American) tournaments. The International History Bee and Bowl debuted in the 2011-2012 school year in Europe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihbbeurope.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihbbasia.com&lt;/ref&gt; A European Championship has been held since 2012; the Asian Championships debuted in spring 2014. In the 2014-15 school year, the Australian and New Zealand Division debuted as did the Canadian Division. Tournaments are held in approximately 30 countries each year. IHBB also organizes the [[International History Olympiad]], which debuted in 2015 at [[College of William &amp; Mary|The College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], and was held in Hawaii in 2016 and Berlin in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyolympiad.com&lt;/ref&gt; Students can qualify for the Olympiad by participating at IHBB tournaments around the world or by taking an official qualifying exam administered by a teacher if no IHBB tournament exists nearby.

The International History Bee and Bowl test knowledge of all aspects of history in a buzzer-based competition format, which bears a resemblance to some television quiz shows. However, unlike on a quiz show most IHBB questions are paragraph-length, and move from harder to easier information. When students think they know the answer, they ring in with the buzzer. If they are correct, they, or their team members get points, if incorrect, then the other students (in the History Bee) or the other team (in the History Bowl) has an opportunity to hear the rest of the question. All IHBB matches are conducted in English - tournaments in other languages may be added at some point in the future. 

The International History Bee and Bowl World Championships are contested at the International History Olympiad. However, the International History Bowl World Championships features matches between teams of 2 or 3 students representing either a particular US state or country (or a mix of two or three of these) and is thus unlike any other International History Bowl competition. A full list of IHBB world champions is maintained on the [[International History Olympiad]] page

== Regional Tournaments ==

Regional tournaments are held throughout Asia, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Any school or student may attend as long as they have not participated at an earlier regional tournament that school year. Each tournament features a Varsity division for students roughly 16–18 years of age, a Junior Varsity division for students roughly 13–15 years of age, and a Middle School division for younger students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isl.ch/page.cfm?id=1267&amp;noticeid=220&amp;isnewsletter=YES&amp;sitechoice=0 History Bowl and Bee – ISL Teams Compete at Le Rosey], International School of Lausanne Newsletter, 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Each tournament features a series of preliminary rounds for the History Bee for individual students and the History Bowl for teams. Students who finish in the top half in their age classification for the History Bee, and Bowl teams who finish the preliminary rounds with a .500 winning percentage or better qualify for their regional Championships, as well as the International History Olympiad. At the end of the preliminary rounds, the top Bee students advance to the Bee Finals, while Bowl teams are seeded according to their preliminary results and advance to the playoffs.

Students and teams who finish in the top half of their regional tournament earn the right to compete at the Canadian, European and Asian Championships. The Championships also feature a Consolation Bee for students attending with their History Bowl team who did not qualify for the Bee Championships, as well as a Geography Bee which is open to all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinternationalschool.ch/en-GB/News/SIS%20Basel%20Team%20wins%20History%20Bowl SIS Basel Team wins History Championship], SIS Basel News, 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Championships in Europe and Asia also feature a separate Sports and Entertainment History Bee which is open to all participants, including coaches and also an all-subject team quiz competition, the Academic Bowl of Asia (or Europe).

The 2012 European Championships were held in [[Grasse]], [[France]]; the 2013 European Championships were held in [[Paris]]; the 2014 and 2017 Championships were in Rome, the 2015 Championships in Switzerland, the 2016 Championships were in Berlin, and the 2018 European Championships were held in [[Prague]]. The Asian Championships were held in Hong Kong in 2014, and in Khao Lak, Thailand in 2015 and 2016. The inaugural Canadian Championships were held in 2015 in Ottawa, and the 2016 Canadian Championships were held in Toronto.

Qualified students and schools from Middle Eastern countries are welcome to compete at either the IHBB European or Asian Championships, but not both in any given year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7030">The '''International Symposium on Fluorine Chemistry''' (ISFC) is an [[academic conference]] where researchers present their most recent original results on the chemistry of [[fluorine]] and its derivatives. Communications deal with all [[compounds of fluorine]], from [[hydrogen fluoride]] to [[fluoropolymer]]s and other [[fluorocarbon]]s. Participants to editions from 18th ISFC onwards have been nearly 500, most of them were from academia, researchers from [[fluorochemical industry]] being the second largest group.

== History ==
On 14 – 17 July 1959, Colin J. Tatlow organized in [[Birmingham]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]) an event which was "a milestone in fluorine chemistry", namely he arranged “an International Symposium on Fluorine Chemistry, which became the first of the now regular and important familiar series”.&lt;ref&gt;Fluorine Chemistry at the Millennium: Fascinated by Fluorine; R. E. Banks Ed.; Elsevier, Oxford, 2000; pgg. 68 and 489. {{ISBN|0 08 043405 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 8th ISFC, held in [[Kyoto]] ([[Japan]]) on 22 – 27 August 1976, ISFCs were systematically organized every three years under the governance of an International Steering Committee. From the very beginning ISFCs were reference events for scientists involved in [[fluorine]] chemistry and they played a major role in framing and maintaining the community of fluorine chemists. Some emblematic confirmations of this roles are: results presented at the 1st ISFC (Birmingham, 1959) are cited in a [[Houben-Weyl Methods of Organic Chemistry|Houben-Weyl]] volume on fluorine chemistry published in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Houben-Weyl Methods of Organic Chemistry, vol. E 10 b/1, Stuttgart, 1999; pg. 113. {{ISBN|3 13 220304 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  results presented at the 4th ISFC ([[Estes Park]], 1967) are mentioned in a book on the chemistry and technology of [[lubricant]]s published in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Synthetics, Mineral Oils, and Bio-Based Lubricants: Chemistry and Technology; L. R. Rudnick Ed.; Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Raton, 2013; pg. 186. {{ISBN|978 1 4398 5537 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''[[Henri Moissan|Moissan Prize]]'' &lt;ref&gt;The prize was created after the Centennial 1986 Paris Symposium to commemorate Moissan's isolation of elemental fluorine in 1886, it is presented every three years to stimulate research in the fields of fluorine chemistry. {{Cite web |url=http://actions.maisondelachimie.com/prix_henri_moissan.html|title=Prix Henri Moissan}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most prestigious prize in fluorine chemistry and is presented at ISFCs.

[[George Andrew Olah|George A. Olah]], [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] in 1994, gave a plenary lecture at the 15th ISFC ([[Vancouver]], 1997).&lt;ref&gt;15th International Symposium on Fluorine Chemistry, Program and Abstracts, PL2&lt;/ref&gt;  
The Book of Abstracts of 13th ISFC has been published as a special issue of the Journal of Fluorine Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00221139/54/1-3|title=Journal of Fluorine Chemistry 1991, volume 54, issues 1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Abstract of 21st ISFC can be tracked by its ISBN.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Abstracts; P.

==Biography==
Farquhar was born at [[Aberdeen]] in 1861. He was educated at [[Aberdeen Grammar School]] and [[Aberdeen University]] and served an apprenticeship as a [[draper]], but he returned to school at an age of 21, and finished his studies at [[Oxford University]]. With no prior [[ordination]], he was recruited by [[London Missionary Society]] as a lay educational missionary and sent to [[India]] in 1891.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;

He arrived at [[Calcutta]] and started his missionary work by teaching at [[Bhowanipur]] for eleven years from 1891. He joined [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) in 1902 as a national student secretary; later, as a literary secretary, a post which he held until 1923. While working at YMCA, he strived to enable the association to widen its appeal to students through lectures, through personal friendships, and through production of whole new body of literature of the highest grade that India had ever known before.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lyle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Eddy |first= Sherwood  |title= Pathfinders of the World Missionary Crusade |publisher= Ayer Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_PyVMElYr0C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=William+Miller,+scottish+missionary,+Madras+Christian+college&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J2g5RY88vX&amp;sig=A7mtK64z1kN2U-qdwwty-n8qjDs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wR29T7StCcbsrAeM17GxDQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Farquhar&amp;f=false |year= 1945| page= 108 |isbn= 9780836911275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to ill-health, he left India in 1923. He spent last six years of his life working as a professor of [[comparative religion]] in the [[University of Manchester]]. He died in [[Manchester]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;

==Bibliography==
During his stint at [[Young Men's Christian Association|YMCA]], he wrote several books; notably, ''The Crown of Hinduism'' in 1913, ''A Primer of Hinduism'' in 1914, and ''Modern Religious Movements in India'' in 1915, and edited many more.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="lyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

In his famous publication ''The Crown of Hinduism'', he aspired to present Christ, rather than an organizational structure or intellectual system to India. He argued that [[Karma]] and [[Caste]], traditional concepts enshrined in [[Hindu]] belief, are no longer essential in the construction of modern nation; instead, the '''''message of Christ''''' with high regard to freedom, progress, and civic virtue provides a better intellectual platform upon which to build a progressive India. He accepts that the Caste-system itself is a collective response to the pursuit of a structured and well-balanced society, still, he points at the caste-system for devoid of [[social justice]] and [[egalitarianism]]. However, he says a society that embraces the heart of Christ's message will inevitably develop social freedom for citizenry.&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt; According to Farquhar:{{cquote|Christ and His message fulfills the quest for an ordered nation which gave rise to the institution of caste;the ethics of Christ completes this quest in a way that caste never could, since the system lacks the concept of social quality.&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;}}
His work ''An Outline of the Religious Literature of India'' published in 1920, clearly demonstrates his excellent [[linguistic]] skills in both [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

As an editor for "Religious life of India," he inspired missionaries to write to the highest standards of accuracy, sympathy, and Christian-centric; however, he was less fortunate in finding the right [[Indian people|Indian]] Christian co-workers, and never agreed fully to terms with the changed climate of opinion in India after 1919.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;

==Fulfilment Theology==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
According to O. Kandaswami Chetty, biographer of [[William Miller (missionary)|Dr. William Miller]], for Miller "Christ was the friend of all that was good and true not only in Christianity, but in Hinduism."{{sic}}. The idea of "Christ the fulfiller" was made familiar to the minds of [[South Indians]] of [[Madras Presidency]] long before Farquhar's ''The Crown of Hinduism'' published in 1913. Even the colleagues of Miller like Bernard Lucas and T.E. Slater, author of ''The Higher Hinduism in Relation to Christianity'' published in 1909, long before articulated "Fulfilment theology" at the [[1910 World Missionary Conference|World Missionary Conference]] held at [[Edinburgh]] in 1910 itself—Edinburgh conference is considered as the starting point for modern theology of mission and also a launch-pad of the modern [[Ecumenism|ecumenical movement]].&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt;

According to [[Eric J. Sharpe]], professor of Religious studies at [[University of Sydney]]; author of books like ''"Not To Destroy, But To Fulfil:the contribution of J.N. Farquhar to Protestant missionary thought in India before 1914"'', ''"John Nicol Farquhar and the missionary study of Hinduism"'', ''"John Nicol Farquhar, a memoir"'', and ''"Faith meets Faith: Some Christian Attitudes to Hinduism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries"''; and who extensively wrote on Farquhar's theology and [[missiology|missiological]] approach to Indian religions, has observed that Farquhar, although fully worked out "Fulfillment thesis" in his [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work, yet his work on "Fulfillment theology" in [[Bengal]] was built on foundations laid out initially at Madras by William Miller itself.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

He was the pioneer in popularising his missionary theology ''Fulfillment theology''. Although, he didn't invent it by himself, but based his theology on [[William Miller (missionary)|William Miller]] ''Fulfilment theology'' that took its shape in [[Madras Presidency]]. According to this theology, "Christ came to fulfill and bring to completion not only the law and the prophets(''Matt.''5:17) but all the world's higher religions."{{sic}}—in this sense, Christ is the "Crown" of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt;

He popularised and expressed the idea that Christianity was the fulfilment of other religions; he advocated that Christianity was not out to destroy other religions but to fulfill. He intended to develop a workable [[apologetic]] to maintain a satisfactory relationship between Christianity and Hinduism—during his days, there was a radical change in Indian Christian thoughts against Western Christianity, sense of nationalism and self-consciousness was growing among Indians, Hindu nationalism started reasserting its opposition to Christianity, Christian missionaries were considering non-Christian religions as evil, and Church union movement towards Christian unity was growing for Indianisation and indigenisation of Church in its administration, [[liturgy]] and theology. With "Fulfilment theology," he affirmed that Christianity or rather Christ, is the "Crown" of Hinduism. He hoped, progressive Hindus will embrace the Christianity; Christians, including Christian missionaries would be more sympathetic to other religions. With an intention of developing satisfactory relationship between Hinduism and Christianity, rather than of mere exclusion, he gradually worked out his idea of "I came not to destroy but to fulfill."(Mathew 5:17)&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lyle"/&gt;

In his publication ''The Crown of Hinduism'' published in 1913, Farquher argued that:
{{cquote|If all religions are human, and yet men can in the long run hold only Christianity, clearly it must be, in some sense, the climax of the religious development in the world, the end and culmination of all religions. If all the great religious instincts, which have created the other faiths, find ultimate satisfaction in Christianity, then Christianity stands in a very definite relation to every other religion. It is the fulfilment and crown of each; and it is our privilege and duty to trace the lines of connection and lead the peoples up to the Christ.&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt;}}
Farquhar, though saw some amount of truth in non-Christian religions, yet he denounced some elements that Christianity cannot accept. Caste system is one among them, as he felt that equality, freedom, and justice are distinctive aspects of Christianity.&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt; According to Farquher, though, "Fulfilment" dictated sympathy and reverence as the only "way of wisdom" for the missionary to the Hindu, it indirectly spelt ultimate extinction for all non-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stanley  |first= Brian |title= The World Missionary Conference, Edinburgh 1910|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DGctpiHH-EkC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=William+Miller,+scottish+missionary,+Madras+Christian+college&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K44phwrGuX&amp;sig=FkrjVtQYw-x2Atv9NKIIYwYUOd8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bB29T-xmxbysB728uKMN&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Farquhar&amp;f=false|year= 2009 |page= 219 |isbn= 9780802863607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Sharpe has remarked that Farquhar was "more than any other individual responsible for bringing about a decisive change in the thinking of Christians over against the phenomena of other faiths."{{sic}}&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

===Criticism===
A.G. Hogg, professor at [[Madras Christian College]] and author of ''Karma and Redemption'' in 1904, criticised Farquhar's "Fulfilment thesis" that says "Christianity fulfils all the noblest aspirations of the Hindus,"{{sic}} as Hogg perceived that "in Hinduism there was searching and finding, and that a Christian was not offering what a Hindu was searching. Under certain circumstances, a Christian however could make the Hindu feel the need for what is available only in Christianity." {{sic}}&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lyle"/&gt;

Farquhar's Fulfillment School has also been discussed, with praise and / or censor, by many writers on philosophy or theology of religion, including Gavin D'Costa, Jacques Dupuis, John Hick, David Marshall, Ivan Satyavrata, James Sharpe, and James Thrower: Satyavrata and Sharpe provide extended analyses.  Farquhar is often taken as a leading representative of the Inclusivist School, though this would be more plausible if the focus were on ontology and ethics, which are Farquhar's foci, rather than on salvation.

== Early life and education ==
Roper was born on January 25, 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roper|first1=Jake|title=So, my awesome girlfriend @rebeccaaaa just had a singing guerilla come and wish me a happy birthday in front of my whole office.|url=https://twitter.com/jakerawr/status/29989937222782976|website=Twitter|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Evergreen, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="Vsauce.com" /&gt; He attended New York's [[School of Visual Arts]] where he received a degree in film.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/vsauce3-jake-roper-interview/|title = Vsauce3: The man, the myth, the legend|date = 2015-10-14|work = The Daily Dot|access-date = 2017-09-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to working on YouTube, Roper used his film degree for various jobs in television and advertising.&lt;ref name="Vsauce.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt;

== Career ==
Before meeting [[Michael Stevens (educator)|Michael Stevens]], Roper hosted a YouTube show called Space Lab,&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt; which was a space show for kids.&lt;ref name="Vsauce.com" /&gt; Stevens brought on Roper to edit videos in 2011;  in 2012, Roper started uploading on Vsauce3 regularly beginning with the segment ''App All Knight''.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Vsauce3|title = Rainbow Whale Butt and MORE! - App All Knight #1|date = 2012-09-12|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag2EpAu1SL4|accessdate = 2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Roper began to host all of the shows on Vsauce3, effectively making it his own channel.

Segments on this channel, such as ''Game LÜT'', ''App All Knight'', ''HeadShot'', ''9bit'', and ''Fact Surgery'' have either been discontinued or moved to other Vsauce network channels.{{Citation needed|date = September 2017}} This allowed for Roper to focus on the main content of the channel, which focuses on explanations of the science behind fictional worlds.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt; Over the years, Roper has worked with various celebrities and experts including [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Bill Nye]], [[Jack Black]], and [[Paul Rudd]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Vsauce3|title = Time ft.

The first '''Japanese students in the United Kingdom''' arrived in the nineteenth century, sent to study at [[University College London]] by the [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] and [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]] domains, then the [[Bakufu]] (Shogunate). Many went on to study at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and a smaller number at [[Oxford University]] until the end of the [[Meiji period]]. The primary motive for this was an effort to modernise Japan in the long run.

'''LivingStone International University''' (LIU) is a private university in [[Uganda]]. The university is affiliated with two church organizations, namely the [[Christian_Church_(Disciples_of_Christ)|Christian Churches]] and the [[Churches of Christ]], based in the [[United States]].

==Location==

LIU has opened on a leased campus near the center of [[Mbale]], Uganda, approximately {{convert|250|km|mi}}, by road, northeast of [[Kampala]], the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distance Between Kampala And Mbale With Map|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=Globefeed.com| url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Uganda_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Kampala%20()&amp;toplace=Mbale%20(Mbale)&amp;fromlat=0.3155556&amp;tolat=1.0644444&amp;fromlng=32.5655556&amp;tolng=34.1794444}}&lt;/ref&gt; LIU plans to occupy this leased campus for a period of up to three years while simultaneously constructing a permanent campus. Fifty-six acres of land have already been purchased just outside Mbale municipality on the main road that goes west toward Kampala. A campus master plan has been developed, and fund-raising is taking place for eventual construction of LIU's permanent campus on this site. The coordinates of the current university campus are: 1°05'03.0"N, 34°10'45.0"E (Latitude:1.084167; Longitude:34.179167).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Location LivingStone International University Campus At Google Maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/1%C2%B005'03.0%22N+34%C2%B010'45.0%22E/@1.0844893,34.1794589,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0|first=.|last=Google|publisher=[[Google|Google Maps]]| accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''LivingStone International University Strategic Plan 2009-2014'' was completed December 19, 2007 and submitted to the Uganda National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) with the goal of being chartered as a fully [[accredited university]] by the Uganda government. The first step in this process was accomplished December 19, 2008 when the NCHE issued to LIU a Letter of Interim Authority.  This allowed LIU to begin buying property, prepare curricula, hire faculty and staff and set up banking and other business tasks. LIU received its Provisional License from the NCHE in March, 2011. This prepared the way for the first student intake in January, 2012. Currently LIU is working under the guidance of the NCHE toward qualifying for a full university charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unche.or.ug/institutions/private-universities/page/3|
title=Private Universities: LivingStone International University|
first=.|last=UNCHE|publisher=Uganda National Council for Higher Education (UNCHE)|date=2011|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2012 the inaugural class of LivingStone International University began with thirty-four students. With the second intake in September 2012, the student body grew to over fifty.
{{asof|June 2011}} over US$1.4 million had been invested into the development of LIU, the acquisition of the land, and operating funds for the launching of classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=11 July 2014|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/640721-livingstone-international-university.html|title=LivingStone International University Takes Root In Eastern Uganda|publisher=[[New Vision]]|date=17 March 2013|first=Joseph|last=Wanzusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
LIU offers bachelors and diploma programmes.

===Innovation and technology===
All faculty and students participate in a mentoring program that encompasses spiritual, social, and academic dimensions of human development. Each student at LIU has a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] electronic book reader as a medium for accessing textbooks as well as receiving other instructional materials and assignments from lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muzafalu Katamba|first=and Amina Muhammed|url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15862&amp;Itemid=106|title= Livingstone International University Takes To Hitech Learning|date=13 November 2011|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=[[The Observer (Uganda)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently a 1:2 computer-to-student ratio. Students in the Communications and Media Technology program receive hands-on experience in digital video and audio production on up-to-date equipment in the studios of ''Good News Productions International (Mbale)'', which partners with LIU.

At UBC, she is known for the summer mathematics camps she developed to improve the mathematical education of [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous]] secondary-school students.{{r|gnm|tyee}} She is the 2012 winner of the [[Adrien Pouliot Award]], given by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] for significant contributions to mathematics education in Canada.{{r|pouliot}}

Alvarez grew up in [[Mexico City]], where she completed her undergraduate education at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. She later earned master's degrees in economics and anthropology from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and in [[operations research]] from [[Stanford University]].{{r|gnm|pouliot}}
In 2016 she completed a Ph.D. in mathematics education at [[Simon Fraser University]] under the supervision of Peter Liljedahl.{{r|sfu}}

She gained her interest in helping disadvantaged minorities with mathematics from an incident of racial discrimination that occurred in Madison, where her sixth-grade son (who had inherited his mother's talent for mathematics) was placed in a lower-level mathematics track because of his Latino ethnicity. She moved to Vancouver in 2004, and began her mathematics camp program at UBC in 2007.{{r|gnm}} As well as her work with indigenous people, Alvarez has been active in organizing mathematics competitions, workshops, and fundraising for mathematics education among the general population.{{r|pouliot|straight}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2953">'''Dr. Michael K. Clifford''' is an American education investor and advisor, and a proponent of higher education globally.

==Early life==
Initially following his father's trade as a musician, Clifford converted to [[Christianity]] and decided to follow Jesus in his mid-twenties. Contacts made through faith-based non-profit organizations introduced him to [[John Sperling]] and [[Brian Mueller]], and he moved into the field of online higher education.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Michael Clifford|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/interviews/clifford.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working as a fundraiser for faith-based organizations brought Clifford to the notice of [[Pat Robertson]], and he co-managed Robertson's [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1988|1988 bid]] for the U.S. Presidency.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

==Career==
Clifford's early business practices involved identifying and purchasing nonprofit colleges and converting them to a new model.&lt;ref name="Weiss2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W.

In 2010 Clifford was profiled in the [[PBS]] documentary ''College Inc.'', which examined the effects of and issues surrounding the for-profit college industry.&lt;ref name="Weiss2014"/&gt;

In 2013 Clifford created DreamDegree, an unaccredited online learning portal.&lt;ref name="ihe"/&gt; He founded Significant Systems, a consultancy firm for higher education institutions,&lt;ref name="ppg"/&gt; which later rebranded as SignificantFederation.&lt;ref name="huff"/&gt;

''MoneyForce''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moneyforce.org.uk MoneyForce]&lt;/ref&gt; is a programme that aims to improve the [[financial capability]] of the [[UK Armed Forces]] by providing money guidance to all those serving in the military and their families.

The ethos and branding is built around the concept of getting 'MoneyFit' with MoneyForce and the MoneyForce website is fronted by former Olympic gold medallist [[Dame Kelly Holmes]].

Comprising online resources and briefings at military bases across the UK, the programme is delivered for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] by the [[Royal British Legion]]. Funding comes from the [[Standard Life]] Charitable Trust, and some of the online content is provided by the [[Money Advice Service]].

The programme was officially launched&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uy9F7wWNqU MoneyForce launch event]&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2013 by [[Mark Francois]], the [[Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans]], at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] in Woolwich.

Development of the MoneyForce programme was overseen by [[Bill Rollo|General Sir Bill Rollo]].

'''Movement Research''' is a non-profit organization that offers dance classes, workshops, residencies and performance opportunities for artists in [[New York City]]. Its focus is on improvisation, post-modern dance, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvement.net/teteatete/portraits/questions-en-mouvement Portrait of Movement Research in the French magazine Mouvement]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1978 under the name “The School for Movement Research &amp; Construction” and incorporated in 1980 after its first public performance in 1979. Movement Research organizes performances at the [[Judson Memorial Church]] among other locations around New York City. It has a long tie with Judson Church and [[Judson Dance Theater]] which shares some of the same base of artists.&lt;ref name=newm&gt;{{cite web|title=Movement Research in Residence|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/movement-research|work=Rethinking the Imprint of Judson Dance Theater Fifty Years Later September–December 2012|publisher=[[New Museum]]|accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 2018, Movement Research announced they will be occupying 3 spaces in the newly renovated 122 Community Center, making 122CC Movement Research's first permanent home in their 40 year history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9217">'''Owen Astrachan''' is an American computer scientist and professor of the Practice of Computer Science at [[Duke University]] where he is also the department's Director of Undergraduate Studies. He is known for his work in curriculum development and methods of teaching computer science. He was one of the first [[National Science Foundation]] CISE Distinguished Education Fellows, and is a recipient of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Outstanding Educator Award. He was the principal investigator on the multi-year NSF/[[College Board]] project that led to the release of the [[AP Computer Science Principles]] course and exam.

==Early Life==
Astrachan was born in New York City in 1956 to Gail Lovejoy and Anthony Astrachan. He has a younger brother, [[Joshua Astrachan]]. 

==Education and early career==
Astrachan graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1978 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] degree in mathematics. He received a [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] from Duke in 1979, doing his initial teaching at [[Lejeune High School|Camp Lejeune High School]], [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web |title=Owen L. Astrachan - Curriculum Vitae |url=https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/olavita.pdf |publisher=Duke University |accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to 1985 he taught math and computer science at [[Durham Academy]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=CV /&gt; During the summer of 1983 he attended a summer program for high school teachers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] preparing to teach the new [[College Board]] AP Computer Science course. He joined the development team for the new exam.&lt;ref name=Aspray2016&gt;{{cite book |author=William Aspray |title=Participation in Computing: The National Science Foundation’s Expansionary Programs |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGiJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-24832-5 |pages=114–119 |chapter=4.3 CS Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Astrachan began graduate studies in computer science at Duke. His thesis work was with [[Donald W. Loveland]] on [[automated theorem proving]].&lt;ref name=CV /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Astrachan |first1=O. L.|last2=Loveland |first2=D.

Stickel]].&lt;ref name=CV /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Owen L. Astrachan |author2=Mark E.

While a student in 1989 he became the Chief Reader for the AP Computer Science test with the [[Educational Testing Service]], a position he held until 1994.&lt;ref name=CV /&gt; For four years, from 1990 to 1993, he and other graduate students ran the first distributed, internet-based programming contest. It was inspired by the [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] but open to a wider range of students and required no travel, only access to email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khera |first1=Vivek |last2=Astrachan |first2=Owen |last3=Kotz |first3=David |title=The internet programming contest |url=http://www2.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/papers/astrachan:contest.pdf |journal=ACM SIGCSE Bulletin |volume=25 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=48–52 |issn=0097-8418 |doi=10.1145/169073.169105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science education and curriculum development==
In 1993 Astrachan joined the Duke faculty in the Department of Computer Science as Assistant Professor of the Practice of Computer Science. That fall he became the Director of Undergraduate Studies.&lt;ref name=CV /&gt; He changed the introductory computer science course to use C++ as the programming language and began writing an introductory textbook.&lt;ref name=briefbio&gt;{{cite web |first=Owen |last=Astrachan |title=A Brief Biography |url=https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/bio.html |accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of ''A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++'' was published in 1997&lt;ref name="Astrachan1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Astrachan |first=Owen L. |title=A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++ |date=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-002036-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely used.&lt;ref name=ACMeducator&gt;{{cite web |title=Owen Astrachan |url=http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/astrachan_3068814 |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Astrachan2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Astrachan |first=Owen L. |title=A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++ |edition=2nd |date=2000 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-232203-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrachan continued his work with the AP Computer Science Development Committee. He was part of the team developing the [[AP Computer Science AB]] and became the Chief Reader on that exam.&lt;ref name=Aspray2016 /&gt; Later he was a leader in the change of programming language from Pascal to C++&lt;ref name=ACMeducator /&gt; and again from C++ to Java.&lt;ref name=Aspray2016 /&gt; In 2007, he and [[Peter J. Denning]] were named NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering Distinguished Education Fellows for "their outstanding efforts to revitalize undergraduate computing education in the United States."&lt;ref name=NSFfellow&gt;{{cite press release |date=13 July 2007 |title=NSF Announces First Annual Computer and Information Science and Engineering Distinguished Education Fellows |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=109713 |publisher=National Science Foundation |access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Astrachan became the [[principal investigator]] for the joint NSF/[[College Board]] project to develop a new Advanced Placement (AP) course, [[AP Computer Science Principles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Using Computational Thinking to Model a New Course: Advanced Placement Computer Science: Principles |url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0938336 |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=20 August 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the continuing grant to complete the development of the AP CSP exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Collaborative Research: Broadening Participation in Computer Science: AP Computer Science Principles Phase II |url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1246919 |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=16 September 2015 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new course was designed to broaden participation in computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The National Science Foundation Provides $5.2 Million Grant to Create New Advanced Placement Computer Science Course and Exam |url=https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2013/national-science-foundation-provides-52-million-grant-create-new-advanced-placement-compute |publisher=College Board |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first courses began in Fall 2016 and the first exam was given in May 2017. Over 50,000 students took the exam, setting a record for the largest initial AP exam participation.&lt;ref name=ACMeducator /&gt;

In 2016 the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) awarded Astrachan its Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award for "three decades of innovative computer science pedagogy and inspirational community leadership in broadening the appeal of high school and introductory-level college computer science courses."&lt;ref name=ACMeducator /&gt; The citation ended by quoting "Astrachan's Law" as an example of his approach to teaching: "never ask a student to use a computer to solve a problem that is more easily solved without it."&lt;ref name=ACMeducator /&gt;

==Personal Life==
Astrachan is married to Laura Heyneman and has two sons, Ethan, born 1999, and Adam, born 2002.

'''''Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy''''' is a book by [[historian]] [[Andrew J. Kirkendall]] published by the [[University of North Carolina Press]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469622248/paulo-freire-and-the-cold-war-politics-of-literacy/|title=Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy {{!}} Andrew J. Kirkendall {{!}} University of North Carolina Press|work=University of North Carolina Press|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the involvement of Brazilian [[Teacher|educator]] and [[critical pedagogy]] philosopher [[Paulo Freire]] (1921-1997) in literacy programs in Latin American during the [[Cold War]], and analyzes the effect of politics on literacy programs. The book also details Freire's work with organizations such as the [[World Council of Churches]] and the spread of his ideas.

== Synopsis ==
This book is an analysis of Paulo Freire's work in Latin American literacy campaigns during the mid 20th century. The first chapter, "Entering History", helps set the stage for the rest of the book. It summarizes Freire's early life and the historical context of [[Brazil]] in the 1940s and 1950s. It goes on to explain how the need for improving literacy rates was becoming apparent during this time, and describes Freire's ideas regarding education and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, Andrew J. Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy. Univ Of North Carolina Pr, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter, "The Revolution that wasn't and the Revolution that was in Brazil", describes Freire's work in the northeast of Brazil during the presidency of [[Joao Goulart]]. It describes the literacy programs that he set up in the region, particularly in Angicos, and also discusses Freire's methods of education. It explains how the issue of literacy became increasingly prominent during the 1960s due to the government's need to define itself and expanding student movements. The chapter also argues that talk of a "revolution" in Brazil, which was common on in Goulart's party, was interpreted in widely varying ways with some fearing that it could lead to communist uprisings and others believing that it simply described rapid progress towards literacy and democracy. The involvement of the [[United States]], which tried to promote literacy through the [[Alliance for Progress]] but also was preoccupied with preventing the spread of communism, was also discussed. The chapter ends with the 1964 coup, motivated by fears of a radical Left, that deposed Goulart and forced Freire to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 28-60&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
"Reformist Chile, Peasant Consciousness, and the Meaning of Christian Democracy" describes Freire's time in [[Chile]] from 1964 to 1969. During this time, he served under the administration of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]], who made the eradication of illiteracy a central aspect of his vision for the county. This chapter argues that Freire experienced some of his most productive years in Chile due to the success of his programs in spreading literacy in the Chilean countryside. This helped him gain increased international recognition and ensured that his ideas would spread globally. However it also points out that many of the attempts to increase the political awareness of the illiterate were also designed to promote Christian Democratic views at the expense of other political parties. Frei's party also encouraged the formation of unions in rural areas in order to gain political support. By the end of the chapter the Christian Democratic party has lost much of its support despite its achievements, and failed to receive a mandate in the 1970 election. Freire, who now increasingly viewed himself as a revolutionary, left Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 61-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth chapter, "[[Paulo Freire]] and the World Council of Churches", Freire travels extensively on behalf of the World Council of Churches (WCC). His brief visit to the United States, where he exchanged ideas with academics such as [[Jonathan Kozol]] and Denis Goulet, is summarized. Freire also spends time in Europe, particularly in Geneva, the base of the WCC. Freire also worked on literacy programs in many African countries, such as Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Tanzania. This chapter also describes the influence of Freire and his ideas on the WCC, particularly his belief that education should be for "liberation and continuity". The contradictions between Freire's political ideas and his reliance on American liberals, who often disagreed with his beliefs, for funding are also pointed out. Finally, Kirkendall points out that during this period in Freire's life, he started working with single party states rather than multiparty democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 90-117&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth chapter, "The Sandinistas and the Last Utopian Experiment of the Cold War", focuses on Freire's work in Nicaragua from 1979 to 1980. It gives an overview of the history of [[Nicaragua]] starting from the rise of the Somoza family dynasty in 1936. Kirkendall then describes the rise of the Sandinista party and describes the political importance of literacy within the revolution. Many Sandinistas believed that becoming   literate was an important part of the process of self transformation that defined the revolution. After the [[Sandinista]] victory, education became an important part of their agenda and a "National Literacy Crusade" was started. Freire's help was requested and he arrived in Nicaragua in October 1979. Kirkendall states that one of the most important contributions of Freire was to legitimize the Sandinista literacy campaign. He also points out that the United States contributes a large amount to the literacy campaign despite being historically opposed to the Sandinistas. The literacy campaign was partially successful, but by 1985 illiteracy rates had risen back to 20 percent. Kirkendall argues that Freire remained proud of the accomplishments of the literacy campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, 118-152&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last chapter, "The Long, Slow Transition to Democracy in Brazil", Freire's role in restoring democratic government in Brazil is discussed.  After his return was facilitated by the 1979 Amnesty Law, Freire helped found the Workers Party. Kirkendall describes the process of democratization and describes the Freire's work as education secretary during this time. The book ends with a description of the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 153-164&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==
=== The Political Importance of Education ===
Throughout the book, Kirkendall makes the argument that politics and education significantly influenced each other in Cold War era Latin America. He claims that following the rise of Joao Goulart, "national and international dynamics turned illiteracy into a national issue of great political importance"&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010 p.28&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that education itself was used by political parties as a tool to generate support. Indeed, according to Kirkendall, "the Brazilian student Left in the early 1960s considered politicizing and raising the consciousnesses of the Brazilian popular class to be a central part of their own political activity".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, 45&lt;/ref&gt; He further claims that this phenomenon was not confined to Brazil but also manifested itself in Chile and Nicaragua. Frei's emphasis on education in the countryside, he claims, was "hardly apolitical" and probably motivated by the fact that "the Christian Democrats lagged behind the Marxist parties in organizing the industrial and mining sectors".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Kirkendall claims that the United States involved itself in literacy programs for the purpose of stopping the spread of communism.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of Paulo Freire's Ideas ===
Kirkendall argues that Freire's ideas about education have gained international importance. He points out that Freire's belief in the importance of consciousness-raising among the lower classes and his idea that the illiterate should be the agents of their own education rather than mere recipients of knowledge have influenced literacy campaigns throughout the world. To corroborate these claims, Kirkendall points out that "phraseology reminiscent of Freirean programs" was used in Nicaragua even though Freire himself spent a very limited amount of time in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, 2010, p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkendall also argues that Freire's ideas contained some contradictions, such as the fact that he helped implement literacy programs supposedly designed to promote democratization in one party states, therefore legitimizing undemocratic governments.

== Critical Reception ==
The book has received positive reviews with many people citing its thoroughness and balanced commentary on Freire's life. Robert Arnove from Indiana University praises it as "immensely informative and engaging" and calls it "the most authoritative account of the life and times of Paulo Freire" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnove|first=Robert F.|date=2011|title=Review of Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy|jstor=41239167|journal=The Americas|volume=68|issue=1|pages=157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Héctor Lindo-Fuentes also has a very positive impression of the work, praising it for "illuminating an important aspect of the Cold War" but points out that the style could be better adapted to convey a sense of the excitement of the times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LINDO-FUENTES|first=HÉCTOR|date=2012|title=Review of Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy|jstor=41349727|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=44|issue=1|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkendall's book also received a glowing review from Tanya Harmer from the London School of Economics and Political Science, who calls it "an impeccably researched and thoughtful book"&lt;ref&gt;Harmer, Tanya.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Robie Macauley was born on May 31, 1919, in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. He was the older brother of the noted photographer and movie producer [[C. Cameron Macauley]]. His uncle owned and published the [[Hudsonville, Michigan|Hudsonville]] newspaper, ''[[The Ottawa Times]]'' (named for [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]]), and Macauley used the printing press to publish his first books of fiction and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:APFftOyuQDkJ:www.thefossils.org/fossil/fos334.doc+%22Charles+C.+Macauley%22&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us "Leslie W. Boyer, James F. Guinane, Charles C. Macauley: Our Final Salutes"], by Guy Miller, ''The Fossil'', Volume 104, Number 1, Whole Number 334, Glenview, Illinois, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At age 18 he printed and bound a limited edition of [[Walter Duranty#Books|''Solomon's Cat'']], a previously unpublished poem by [[Walter Duranty]],&lt;ref&gt;Walter Duranty, ''I Write As I Please'', Read Books, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-4067-2181-2}}, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; setting the type and engraving the illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;"Scoops Big Publishers On Book of Poetry", ''The Washington Post'', Feb. 6, 1938, p. PY1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
As an undergraduate at [[Olivet College]], he was a student of [[Ford Madox Ford]] (describing him as "my first teacher and editorial mentor."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Junker, [http://www.zyzzyva.org/sp99-note.htm "Editor's Note: The Last Word: West Coast Writers and Artists"], ''ZYZZYVA'' Spring 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) and then won a three-year literary prize scholarship and transferred to [[Kenyon College]] to be a student of [[John Crowe Ransom]]. There he lived in a [[writer's home|writer's house]] with [[Robert Lowell]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hamilton, ''Robert Lowell: A Biography'', Faber Faber Inc; First UK edition, May 1983. {{ISBN|978-0-571-13045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;McAlexander, Hugh, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4337918 "Peter Taylor: The Undergraduate Years at Kenyon"] ''The Kenyon Review,'' New Series, Vol. 21, No. 3/4 (Summer - Autumn, 1999), pp. 43-57&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Randall Jarrell]]. He was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] during February 1941, and the same year was awarded a fellowship to attend the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hobson, "New Creative Writers: 17 Novelists Whose First Work Appears This Season", ''Library Journal'', October 1, 1952, p. 1642.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from Kenyon in June 1941.

===War years===

He was drafted in March 1942 and served in World War II as a special agent in the [[Counterintelligence Corps]] (CIC) with the [[97th Infantry Division]], in the "[[Ruhr Pocket]]" and then in Japan after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Thomas E., [http://www.webdelsol.com/AGNI/ag-08tk.htm "A Last Conversation with Robie Macauley"], ''Agnii,'' Vol. 45, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 1945 Macauley's division helped liberate [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]]. Macauley later said, "I entered some concentration camps the day we liberated them-- the most horrifying days of my life. My job was to interview survivors. Most of the bodies that I saw had been stripped and it was impossible to tell which were those of Jews and which of Christians. Nazi murder was a great leveler, fully ecumenical... Hitler's bell tolled for all...&lt;ref&gt;Macauley R. "Who Should Mourn?" ''The New York Times'', Letters to the Editor, Aug. 8, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;"

Macauley wrote four autobiographical short stories based on his experiences doing intelligence work, collected in ''[[The End of Pity and Other Stories]]'', (1957). In "[[A Nest of Gentlefolk]]", (winner of the 1949 Furioso Prize) he describes the CIC's futile search for [[Nazi war criminals]] in the war-ravaged town of [[Hohenlohe (district)|Hohenlohe]];&lt;ref&gt;Macauley R. "A Nest of Gentlefolk." ''Furioso'', 1949:5-19.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Thin Voice]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4333212|title=The Thin Voice|first=Robie|last=Macauley|date=7 July 2017|publisher=|journal=The Kenyon Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=50–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; he describes the unlawful murder of a Russian prisoner by American troops in [[:de:Heiligenkreuz (Titting)|Heiligenkreuz]], Germany;&lt;ref&gt;Macauley R. "The Thin Voice." ''The Kenyon Review'', 1951;13(1):50-63.&lt;/ref&gt; in "[[The End of Pity]]" he tells the story of a woman's suicide after visiting her ruined house in a combat zone in [[Düsseldorf-Oberkassel|Oberkassel]];&lt;ref&gt;Macauley R. "The End of Pity." ''New World Writing'', 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; and in "[[The Mind is its Own Place]]" he describes his brief post-war encounter in [[Karuizawa]], Japan with Captain [[Kermit Beahan]], bombardier of the bomber "The [[Bockscar]]" who released the [[atomic bomb]] over [[Nagasaki]]. Macauley described Beahan as "a young captain with a college-boy face [who] had suffered some strange mutation of feeling so deep and so destructive...&lt;ref&gt;Macauley R. "The Mind Is Its Own Place", ''The Partisan Review'', September, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;"

According to Macauley's letters archived at the [[University of North Carolina]], while in Karuizawa he was friends with former Japanese Ambassador to the US [[Saburō Kurusu]] and German Admiral [[Paul Wenneker]], as well as pianist [[Leo Sirota]] and artist [[Paul Jacoulet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uncg.edu/depts/archives/mss/html/Mss069.htm|title=Finding Aid for the Robie MaCauley Papers at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also acquainted with former Japanese Prime Minister [[Prince Fumimaro Konoe]], to whom he presented a copy of ''[https://archive.org/details/americanleviatha00bear The American Leviathan: The Republic in the Machine Age]'' by [[Charles A. Beard]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Lindsay, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sew/summary/v119/119.4.lindsay.html "Anthony Hecht in Occupied Japan."] ''Sewanee Review,'' 2011, 119 (4). pp 641-655&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as CIC Station Chief he supervised the arrests, on October 30, 1945 of a number of [[List of Japanese government and military commanders of World War II#German Liaison in Jewish topics .28until 1942.29|major Nazi leaders]] who were in hiding in Karuizawa:&lt;ref&gt;"26 Germans in Spy Ring Seized", ''New York Times'', Oct 30, 1945, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Franz Joseph Spahn, [[Nazi]] Gruppenleiter in Japan; Paul Sperringer, a former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Stormtrooper]] and assistant to [[Gestapo]] Chief Colonel [[Josef Meisinger]]; Karl Hamel, Meisinger's secretary; Charles Schmidt-Jucheim, a former San Francisco police officer and an ex-US Army sergeant who attended Gestapo training in Germany and renounced his US citizenship; [[Karlfried Graf Dürckheim]], chief of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] propaganda system in Japan;&lt;ref&gt;In 1995 Macauley described Dürckheim inaccurately as "an authentic war criminal".

==Publications==

===Novels===
During his life Robie Macauley published two novels, ''[[The Disguises of Love]]'' (1951), the story of a university professor's love affair with a student and how it affects his wife and son, and ''[[A Secret History of Time to Come]]'' (1979), an adventure thriller set in a devastated post-apocalypse America 200 years in the future.

His last two novels, ''[[Citadel of Ice: Life and Death in a Glacier Fortress during World War I]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cmacauley.wordpress.com/|title=Citadel of Ice|website=Citadel of Ice}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2014), and ''[[The Escape of Alfred Dreyfus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Escape-Alfred-Dreyfus-Novel/dp/1522875867|title=The Escape of Alfred Dreyfus: A Novel|first1=Robie |last1=Macauley|first2=Cameron |last2=Macauley|publication-date=December 5, 2016|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016) were published posthumously.

In spite of his expertise and experience, Macauley's own fiction received only moderate recognition. "Robie Macauley's prose, like the best poetry, has a startling economy of means and precision of language", declared [[Melvin J. Friedman]] in ''[[Contemporary Novelists]]''. "The author's work", continued Friedman, "is the enviable product of years spent in close and sympathetic relationship with the best novels from [[Jane Austen]] through [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Novelists'', 6th edition, St. James (Detroit), 1996, pp. 633-34.&lt;/ref&gt;" [[David H. Lynn]], editor of ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'', described Macauley's fiction as "subtle, stinging, disturbing, witty.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, 1996, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;" [[Eugene Goodheart]], commenting on ''[[The End of Pity and Other Stories]]'', said "Macauley has all the gifts of a master short story writer: narrative power, a quick and vivid imagination of character...a capacity for delivering the scene that at once surprises and satisfies the reader's expectation, i.e., a fine sense for the significant scene or action, a felicity of phrase that is not merely decoration, but becomes perception."&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Goodheart, "The Limits of Irony: ''The End of Pity and Other Stories'' by Robie Macauley", ''Critique'', 5:2, Fall 1962, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001 [[StoryQuarterly]] has awarded the annual '''[[Robie Macauley Award for Fiction]]'''.

===Nonfiction===
He co-authored (with [[George Lanning]]) a textbook on writing, ''[[Technique in Fiction]]'' (1964, revised in 1989), and co-authored (with [[William Betcher]]) a book on marriage counseling, ''[[The Seven Basic Quarrels of Marriage]]'' (1990).

Jordan]] in 2008 to improve the retention of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-03|title=Tuajuanda C.

Students from over 100 universities nationwide engage in authentic individual research that includes a [[Wet lab|wet-bench laboratory]] and a [[bioinformatics]] component.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaphages.org/|title=SEA-PHAGES|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==
During the first semester of this program, classes of around 18-24 undergraduate students work under the supervision of one or two university faculty members and a graduate student assistant—who have completed two week-long training workshops—to isolate and characterize their own personal [[bacteriophage]] that infects a specific bacterial host cell from local soil samples.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan TC, Burnett SH, Carson S, Caruso SM, Clase K, DeJong RJ, Dennehy JJ, Denver DR, Dunbar D, Elgin SC, Findley AM, Gissendanner CR, Golebiewska UP, Guild N, Hartzog GA, Grillo WH, Hollowell GP, Hughes LE, Johnson A, King RA, Lewis LO, Li W, Rosenzweig F, Rubin MR, Saha MS, Sandoz J, Shaffer CD, Taylor B, Temple L, Vazquez E, Ware VC, Barker LP, Bradley KW, Jacobs-Sera D, Pope WH, Russell DA, Cresawn SG, Lopatto D, Bailey CP, Hatfull GF | display-authors = 6 | title = A broadly implementable research course in phage discovery and genomics for first-year undergraduate students | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e01051-13 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24496795 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.01051-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once students have successfully isolated a phage, they are able to classify them by visualizing them through [[Electron microscope|Electron microscope (EM) images]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, [[DNA]] is extracted and purified by the students, and one sample is sent for sequencing to be ready for the second semester's curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second semester consists of the annotation of the [[genome]] the class sent to be sequenced. In that case, students work together to evaluate the genes for start-stop coordinates, [[ribosome-binding site]]s, and possible functions of those [[protein]]s in which the sequence codes. Once the annotation is completed, it is submitted to the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]'s (NCBI) DNA sequence database [[GenBank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If there is still time in the semester or the sent DNA was not able to be sequenced, the class could request genome file from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] that had yet to be sequenced. In addition to the laboratory and bioinformatic skills acquired, students have the opportunity to publish their work in academic journals and attend the national SEA-PHAGES conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] or a regional symposium.

== Online Databases and Bioinformatic Programs Used ==

=== PhagesDB ===
All of the details regarding each student's phage is made public by entering it into the online database [[PhagesDB]] to expand the knowledge of the SEA-PHAGES community as a whole.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Daniel A.|last2=Hatfull|first2=Graham|date=December 6, 2016|title=PhagesDB: the actinobacteriophage database|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/5/784/2731030|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=33|issue=5|pages=784–786|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Starterator ====
Starterator creates a report by comparing the called start sites of genes in the same Pham in annotated phage genomes and other drafts; therefore, students can suggest an appropriate start for the auto-annotated genes in their actinobacteriophage genome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is not usually a primary source for calling a gene start because it is not always supported by the information from other programs or the start-stop coordinates are not the same for a gene called by DNA Master.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Local Blast and Blastp ====
These compare the amino acid sequence of a gene to other sequenced or annotated phage genomes within the database for students in the SEA-PHAGES community to predict starts and functions of their proteins.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phagesdb.org/|title=The Actinobacteriophage Database {{!}} Home|website=phagesdb.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GeneMark ====
This software generates a report with its algorithm that shows the coding potential for the six possible open reading frames of a specific genome, so the probability of a gene's existence can be assessed during annotation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== DNA Master ===
DNA Master is a free software that students can download on a windows computer that utilizes the programs [[GLIMMER]], [[GeneMark]], Aragorn, and tRNAscan-SE to auto-annotate a genome that is uploaded as a [[FASTA format]] file.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since this is done by a computer algorithm that only uses three programs and may not be as updated as the online versions, each suggested gene has to be confirmed by student annotations.These go through several rounds of peer-review before it is accepted to be reviewed by experts from PhagesDB, then it can be submitted to [[GenBank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== GLIMMER ====
These programs are used by DNA Master to predict the starts of the genes by assessing the probability of the six open reading frames (ORFs) and the ribosome binding site (RBS) signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelley DR, Liu B, Delcher AL, Pop M, Salzberg SL | title = Gene prediction with Glimmer for metagenomic sequences augmented by classification and clustering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = e9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22102569 | pmc = 3245904 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often times, [[GLIMMER]] and [[GeneMark]] agree on the predictions during the auto-annotation, but sometimes they give different starts which have to be assessed during manual annotation; GLIMMER is currently the most updated software and is usually used for the final start coordinate.

==== Aragorn ====
This algorithm is utilized by DNA Master, and there is an online version that can be used to cross-reference the calls made by the software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It shows definitive [[Transfer RNA|tRNAs]] and [[Transfer-messenger RNA|tmRNAs]] within a genome by looking for very specific sequences that would fold into the distinctive cloverleaf secondary structure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laslett D, Canback B | title = ARAGORN, a program to detect tRNA genes and tmRNA genes in nucleotide sequences | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–6 | date = 2004 | pmid = 14704338 | pmc = 373265 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this algorithm is considered very accurate considering how fast it produces results, it can miss some tRNAs that are not exactly within its search parameters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== tRNAscan-SE ====
This program allows students the ability to identify possible coding regions for tRNAs in sequence that would have been missed by Aragorn because it includes detection for unusual tRNA homologues; although, both programs have sensitivities between 99-100%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowe TM, Eddy SR | title = tRNAscan-SE: a program for improved detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 955–64 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9023104 | pmc = 146525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tRNAscan-SE does not detect tRNAs itself, but instead outputs the results of the information processed from three independent tRNA prediction programs: tRNAscan, EufindtRNA, and tRNA covariance model search.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Phamerator ===
Phamerator shows a visual representation of the genes and their similarity to other selected phage genomes by marking them with colored rectangles based on the Phamily or Pham it groups it in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Students can then view, compare, save, and print color-coded genome maps during their annotations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Possible insertions or deletions can be seen through connecting lines between the selected phage genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cresawn SG, Bogel M, Day N, Jacobs-Sera D, Hendrix RW, Hatfull GF | title = Phamerator: a bioinformatic tool for comparative bacteriophage genomics | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 12 | pages = 395 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21991981 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-12-395 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the nucleotide and protein sequences can be accessed through this program; however, the starts and stops do not always match that of DNA Master so the sequences may be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phamerator.org/|title=Phamerator|website=phamerator.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCBI Blast and HHPred ===
These online programs are used to predict the functions of proteins by comparison of the amino acid or nucleotide sequences of all genomes sequenced, not just that of phages. HHPred detects homology in the sequences with other proteins that have had their functions called in any organism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also, if the protein has been identified in another sequence, the computer-generated structure might be provided to visualize the possible folding of the amino acids.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhpred|title=Bioinformatics Toolkit|website=toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL or SoTL)''' is often defined as systematic inquiry into student learning which advances the practice of teaching by making inquiry findings public&lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, P., &amp; Shulman, L. S. (1999). The Scholarship of Teaching: New Elaborations, New Developments. ''Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning, 31''(5), 10-15. doi:10.1080/00091389909604218&lt;/ref&gt;.

SOTL necessarily builds on many past traditions in higher education, including classroom and program assessment, action research&lt;ref&gt;Sappington, N., Baker, P. J., Gardner, D., &amp; Pacha, J. (2010). A signature pedagogy for leadership education: Preparing principals through participatory action research. ''Planning and Changing, 41''(3/4), 249-273. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zambo, D. (2010). Action research as signature pedagogy in an education doctorate program: The reality and hope. ''Innovative Higher Education, 36''(4), 261-271. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, D. M., Eaton, S. E., Brown, B., Simmons, M., &amp; McDermott, M. (2018). Action research for graduate program improvements: A response to curriculum mapping and review. ''Canadian Journal of Higher Education, 48''(1), 82-98. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/188048&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, the reflective practice movement, peer review of teaching, traditional educational research, and faculty development efforts to enhance teaching and learning. 

As such, SOTL encompasses aspects of professional development or faculty development, such as how teachers can not only improve their expertise in their fields, but also develop their pedagogical expertise, i.e., how to better teach novice students in the field or enable their learning. It also encompasses the study and implementation of more modern teaching methods, such as [[active learning]], [[cooperative learning]], [[Problem-based learning|problem based learning]], and others. SOTL scholars come from various backgrounds, such as those in educational psychology and other education related fields, as well as  specialists in various disciplines who are interested in improving teaching and learning in their respective fields. Some scholars are educational researchers or consultants affiliated with [[teaching and learning center]]s at universities.

Inquiry methods in SOTL include reflection and analysis, interviews and focus groups, questionnaires and surveys, content analysis of text, secondary analysis of existing data, [[quasi-experiment]]s (comparison of two sections of the same course), observational research, and case studies, among others. As with all scholarly study, evidence depends not only upon the methods chosen but the relevant disciplinary standards. Dissemination for impact among scholarly teachers may be local within the academic department, college or university, or may be in published, peer-reviewed form. A few journals exclusively publish SOTL outputs, and numerous disciplinary publications disseminate such inquiry outputs (e.g., ''J. Chem. Educ.'', ''J. Natural Resour. Life Sci. Educ.'', ''Research in the Teaching of English'', ''College English'', ''J. Economic Education''), as well as a number of core SoTL journals and newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilstu.edu/~sknaylor/sotl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signature pedagogies ==

Signature pedagogies are ways of learning in specific disciplines&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, L. (2005). The signature pedagogies of the professions of law, medicine, engineering, and the clergy: Potential lessons for the education of teachers. ''Proceedings of the Math Science Partnerships (MSP) Workshop: "Teacher Education for Effective Teaching and Learning" Hosted by the National Research Council’s Center for Education''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.taylorprograms.com/images/Shulman_Signature_Pedagogies.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, L. (2005). Signature pedagogies in the professions. ''Daedalus, 134''(3), 52-59. &lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of signature pedagogies include medical residents making rounds in hospitals or pre-service teachers doing a classroom-based practicum as part of their teacher training. The notion of signature pedagogies has expanded in recent years, as scholars have examined their use in e-learning&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, S. E., Brown, B., Schroeder, M., Lock, J., &amp; Jacobsen, M. (2017). ''Signature pedagogies for e-learning in higher education and beyond''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/1880/51848&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., Eaton, S. E., &amp; Schroeder, M. (2017). Signature pedagogies in online classes. In A. P. Preciado Babb, L. Yeworiew, &amp; S. Sabbaghan (Eds.), ''Selected Proceedings of the IDEAS Conference 2017: Leading Educational Change Conference'' (pp. 66-74). Calgary, Canada: Werklund School of Education, University of Calgary. Retrieved from https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/52096&lt;/ref&gt;, for example. Some scholars contend that SoTL itself is a signature pedagogy of higher education&lt;ref&gt;Felten, P., &amp; Chick, N. (2018). Is SoTL a signature pedagogy of educational development? ''To Improve the Academy, 37''(1), 4-16. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/tia2.20077&lt;/nowiki&gt; doi:10.1002/tia2.20077&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Professional Societies ==

The [[International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching &amp; Learning]] (ISSOTL)] was founded in 2004 by a committee of 67 scholars from several countries and serves faculty members, staff, and students who care about teaching and learning as serious intellectual work. ISSOTL has held annual conferences since 2004, attended by scholars from about a dozen nations.  The conferences sites include Bloomington, Indiana USA (2004); Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2005); Washington, DC, USA (2006); Sydney, Australia (2007); Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (2008); Bloomington, Indiana, USA (2009); Liverpool, UK (2010); Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA (2011); Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (2012); Raleigh, North Carolina, USA (2013); Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (2014).

'''Serbian school 'Nikola Tesla' Budapest''' ({{lang-hu|Szerb Tanítási Nyelvű Óvoda, Általános Iskola Diákotthon, és Gimnázium}}; {{lang-sr|Српско забавиште, основна школа, ђачки дом и гимназија}}) is an educational institution located in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It was begun as a school for all [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] nations in 1948. The [[school]] began its work in [[Pécs]], but was soon out of political reasons, moved to Budapest. School was subsequently replaced by the name South Slavic into [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. In 1993, because of the war in former [[Yugoslavia]], the school expelled part Croatian from name. Оn 25 November 2012, [[Serbian President]] [[Tomislav Nikolić]] visited the school.&lt;ref name="nikola-tesla.net"/&gt;

'''Taecanet''' (pronounced Tie-Can-Et) is an [[electronic learning|online learning service]] for students and teachers which supports the UK [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], covering a range of subjects in [[Key Stage|Key Stages 1 to 4]] for primary, middle and secondary schools. It combines knowledge and expertise from teachers with secure web based delivery. Taecanet provides "learning journeys" – specially selected by teachers to meet objectives and outcomes for students.

Schools like Holy Trinity Primary School in [[Cookham]] report that using Taecanet with their Year 6 students has increased their Science SATs results by up to 50%.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TaecanetLearningJourney.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An example of a learning journey in Taecanet Springboard]] --&gt;

Taecanet operates in a unique way to share knowledge; teachers across the country contribute good learning material which the organisation then makes available to all schools who subscribe. The subscriptions are used to operate the service and pay for the teachers who contribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taecanet.com/sstnews.htm Taecanet - Making Time For Teachers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of name==
The name 'Taecanet' comes from the [[old English]] word ''taeca'' (or teacher). These early teachers would give ''taecans'' (or tokens) to their students, to prove that they had, in fact, been taught.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The [[suffix]] -net, comes from the organisation's presence on the [[Internet]].

'''TNTP''',''' formerly known as The New Teacher Project''', is an organization in the United States with a mission of ensuring that poor and minority students get equal access to effective teachers. It helps urban school districts and states recruit and train new teachers, staff challenged schools, design evaluation systems, and retain teachers who have demonstrated the ability to raise student achievement.  TNTP is a non-profit organization and was founded by [[Michelle Rhee]] in 1997.

==Overview==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
A national nonprofit organization founded by teachers, TNTP is driven by the belief that effective teachers have a greater impact on student achievement than any other school factor (even to the exclusion of social factors). In response, TNTP develops customized programs and policy interventions that enable education leaders to find, develop and keep great teachers. Since its inception in 1997, TNTP has recruited or trained approximately 43,000 teachers - mainly through its Teaching Fellows programs - who have taught an estimated 7 million students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tntp.org/what-we-do What We Do], TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt; TNTP has also released a series of studies of the policies and practices that affect the quality of the nation's teacher workforce, including ''The Widget Effect'' (2009),&lt;ref name="widget"&gt;''[http://tntp.org/assets/documents/TheWidgetEffect_2nd_ed.pdf The Widget Effect]'', and see [http://www.widgeteffect.org widgeteffect.org]. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Teacher Evaluation 2.0'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://tntp.org/assets/documents/Teacher-Evaluation-Oct10F.pdf Teacher Evaluation 2.0]''. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Irreplaceables'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://tntp.org/assets/documents/TNTP_Irreplaceables_2012.pdf The Irreplaceables]''. Accessed 2013-3-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, TNTP is active in more than 25 cities, including 10 of the nation's 15 largest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tntp.org/what-we-do/where-we-work Where We Work], TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a New York Daily News opinion piece, Timothy Daly, President of TNTP, advocated for "making student test scores one of many factors in the tenure decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==History==
TNTP was founded in 1997 by [[Michelle Rhee]].  It began with the aim of giving poor and minority students equal access to effective teachers, and during its first 10 years, TNTP initially focused on helping urban districts improve the way they recruited, trained, and hired new teachers.  In 2000, TNTP began the Teaching Fellows and Academy programs, which served as alternate routes to teacher certification for high-need schools.  Today, TNTP also works with states and public school districts in the areas of measurement and management of teacher performance.&lt;ref name="tntpHistory"&gt;[http://tntp.org/about-tntp/our-history Our History], TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it became increasingly familiar with the needs of urban districts, TNTP began helping districts identify and address additional challenges, including hiring teachers earlier, staffing challenged schools and providing rigorous teacher certification training.&lt;ref name="tntpHistory"/&gt; It also began identifying policies counterproductive to overcoming these challenges and publishing reports to offer solutions and encourage reform.&lt;ref&gt;Philanthropy Roundtable, [http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/file_uploads/TeacherExcellence_B.pdf Achieving Teacher and Principal Excellence: A Guidebook for Donors], philanthropyroundtable.org, 2008. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Model==
TNTP is a revenue-generating nonprofit. The majority of its revenue comes from contracts with districts and states to supply services; additional funding for new program development and research is provided by donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tntp.org/about-tntp/our-funding-model Our Funding Model], TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==

===The Widget Effect (2009)===

In 2009, TNTP published ''The Widget Effect: Our National Failure to Acknowledge and Act Upon Teacher Effectiveness''. The report, which surveyed over 15,000 teachers and 1,300 principals in 12 school districts, concluded that the U.S. public education system treats teachers as interchangeable parts, rather than individual professionals.&lt;ref name="widget"/&gt; [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) President Randi Weingarten provided a public statement of support for the report, saying it “points the way to a credible, fair, accurate and effective teacher evaluation system that would improve teaching and learning.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://widgeteffect.org/images/uploads/Widget_Effect_Supporters_60309.pdf/ Widget Effect Supporters], widgeteffect.org, 2009. Accessed 2012-7-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Education Policy Center]] (NEPC) review of ''The Widget Effect'' praised the overall quality of the report but said, "'it is unclear ... how and why particular districts were selected, and whether they represent the range of teacher evaluation practices being implemented in school districts and states across the United States.' Omissions in the report's description of its methodology (e.g., sampling strategy and survey response rates) and its sample lead to questions about the generalizability of the findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher Evaluation 2.0 (2010)===

The [[National Education Policy Center]] was critical of TNTP's report ''Teacher Evaluation 2.0'', which, it said, contained "recommendations for teacher evaluation [that] boil down, for the most part, to truisms and conventional wisdom, lacking a supporting presentation of scholarly evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Irreplaceables (2012)===
In 2012, TNTP published ''The Irreplaceables: Understanding the Real Retention Crisis in America’s Urban Schools''.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://tntp.org/ideas-and-innovations/view/the-irreplaceables-understanding-the-real-retention-crisis], TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2013-3-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The study identified the failure of public schools to keep more of their strongest teachers (or “irreplaceables”) in the classroom than their weakest as the fundamental problem with teacher retention in urban school districts. The report, which focused on four large urban school districts, also offered solutions for how districts and schools can help keep more of their best teachers.

Upon ''The Irreplaceables''’ release, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan publicly supported TNTP’s findings &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| accessdate = 29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) praised the report, noting that TNTP had “helped focus attention on one of our nation’s most valuable assets: the dedicated professionals who educate our children.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Teacher Preparation Programs==
2008 data from Louisiana showed “that TNTP teachers outperform beginning and experienced teachers in math, reading, and language arts.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Out of 17 teacher preparation providers, TNTP was the only one to earn top marks in 4 of 5 subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2015}}[http://regents.louisiana.gov/assets/docs/TeacherPreparation/RegentsRecapAugust10FINAL1.pdf Regents Recaps (August 2010)], [http://regents.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=pagebuilder&amp;tmp=home&amp;pid=113 Value-Added Teacher Preparation Program Assessment Model], Louisiana Board of Regents, regents.louisiana.gov. Accessed 2012-7-29. {{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 study out of [[Louisiana State University]] indicated TNTP Practitioner Program is one of a group of programs in that state “producing teachers who in aggregate appear to be making a positive contribution to student achievement from the time they complete their training program and begin teaching" insofar as they are programs "whose results were generally consistent with the student achievement results of experienced certified teachers" (the other programs were The Louisiana State University - Shreveport NM/CO program and Southeastern Louisiana University Master's Alternate Certification program).&lt;ref&gt;Gansle, Kristin A., Noell, George H., Knox, R. Maria, Schafer, Michael J., [http://regents.louisiana.gov/assets/docs/TeacherPreparation/2010VATechnical082610.pdf Value Added Assessment of Teacher Preparation in Louisiana: 2005-2006 to 2008-2009], August 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a report by the [[Center for American Progress]], [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[American Enterprise Institute]] included TNTP along with certain public school districts, charter school entrepreneurs, and other independent organizations as “addressing stubborn challenges by pursuing familiar notions of good teaching and effective schooling in impressively coherent, disciplined, and strategic ways.”&lt;ref name="laggards"&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/11/pdf/leaders_and_laggards.pdf Leaders and Laggards: A State by State Report Card on Educational Innovation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421193109/http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/11/pdf/leaders_and_laggards.pdf# |date=2010-04-21 }}, Center for American Progress, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Frederick M. Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, November 2009. Accessed 2010-10-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it stated that TNTP has "demonstrated a strong record, validated by independent research, of bringing nontraditional applicants into the classroom."&lt;ref name="laggards"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2009, TNTP published its ''Widget Effect'' report on teacher evaluation, conducted in collaboration with over 50 district and state officials and 25 teachers union representatives.&lt;ref name="widget" /&gt; Although the [[American Federation of Teachers]] agreed that the “overall conclusions of the report are sound,” the union disputed the data on the number of teachers dismissed in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

According to a memorandum issued by TNTP, after the Toledo Federation of Teachers (TFT) contacted TNTP with concerns over their data, TNTP responded by reviewing new data provided by the TFT and then reconciling the Toledo Public Schools teacher dismissal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Union Académique Internationale''' (UAI)—in English, '''International Union of Academies'''—is a federation of many national academies and international academies from more than 60 countries all over the world which works in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences.

The Union wants to create an international collaboration between its Member Academies, offering to them a chance to meet and work together on projects of medium and long term and enabling them to participating to the great national and international movement of scientific research. Its purpose is to encourage cooperation in the advancement of studies through collaborative research and joint publications in those branches of humanities and social sciences promoted by the Academies and Institutions represented in the UAI: [[philology]], [[archaeology]], [[history]], [[moral sciences]] and [[political sciences]]. The UAI works to promote the advancement of knowledge and scientific exchanges and to support initiatives of all its academies.

French is the official language of the union.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History ==

=== Creation ===
The UAI was founded in 1919 on the initiative of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]. After four years of war, the world was longing for peace and understanding between nations. With this in mind, international cooperation was to be promoted in all areas and at all levels, including those of intellectual and scientific work. 
At a meeting held in Paris in May 1919, the draft statutes were prepared. They were revised and adopted at a second meeting held again in Paris from 15 to 18 October 1919. The proposed project envisaged international academic cooperation in the area of the humanities.  During these assemblies, representatives of National Academies from eleven countries adhered to the Union (Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and Russia, the United States) and National Academies of three other countries gave their agreement without being represented (Spain, Norway and Romania). Later in that year, Jugoslavia and Portugal adhered to the Union. Currently, the UAI has members from more than 60 countries all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of the Member Academies |url=http://www.uai-iua.org/en/members|publisher=uai-iua.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First Assembly in Brussels ===

The first general assembly was held in Brussels from 26 to 28 May 1920 where the Belgian historian [[Henri Pirenne]] was elected the first president. The administrative seat of the Union was established in the [[Palace of Academies]] in Brussels. The [[Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique]] is in charge of the secretariat of the UAI and its Permanent Secretary is ''ex officio'' the General Secretary.

During this first session, three projects (in French, ''entreprises'') were submitted: the [[Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum|Corpus vasorum antiquorum]], the ''Alchemical Manuscripts'', and publication of the ''Works of Grotius''. These projects of a real international character have since earned the thanks of scholars by the meticulous precision with which they have been executed.  Up to the Second World War one can observe a slow development:  13 projects were adopted.  Currently, the UAI has 81 projects completed or in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of the Projects |url=http://www.uai-iua.org/en/projects|publisher=uai-iua.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAI can only realize its projects through the international cooperation of its Member Academies.

=== The following years ===

Between 1937 and 1947 no General Assemblies were held because of the world catastrophe and all its consequences. In 1949, the UAI takes pride in having assisted in the foundation of the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]] (ICPHS ){{mdash}}in French: Conseil International de la Philosophie et des Sciences Humaines (CIPSH). In 1964, the UAI received the [[Erasmus Prize]] for its success in promoting international collaboration. In 1969, the 50th anniversary of the UAI was celebrated:  a ceremony was held under the cupola of the prestigious [[Institut de France]] in Paris.  In 1976, the UAI included 31 member countries and the number of its projects had risen to 32.  In 1995, the 75th anniversary of the UAI was celebrated in Prague.

The 100th anniversary will be celebrated at the [[Institut de France]] in Paris in 2019.

== Missions and objectives of the UAI ==

The missions of the Union Académique Internationale are:

:'''1'''. to encourage cooperation between national Academies (and comparable institutions) whose activities are mainly or partly concerned with the field of human and social sciences. This cooperation is achieved by leading projects of high scholarly and intellectual standard and by coordinating interdisciplinary and joint activities, conceived in full partnership, over the long and medium-term. These should result in the production of fundamental reference tools that enhance the knowledge and advance fundamental research, for the benefit of both the people involved in the research (scholars, experts, researchers,…) and the general public;
:'''2'''. to preserve and promote of the human and social sciences, at the level of both national and international academies;
:'''3'''. to develop a solid support for every national academy and its members, provided people are convinced of the rightfulness and the advantages of this solidarity and international cooperation.

To achieve its mission, the UAI will work, in the years to come:

:'''1'''. to increase inter-academy cooperation by multiplying the projects which it will share or initiate ;
:'''2'''. to encourage all the national organisations that are active in the domain of human and social sciences, to join the uai by developing or cooperating on scholarly projects of a high standard recognised at the international level ;
:'''3'''. toat the international level to represent jointly and in a proactive way, directly or indirectly (in partnership with supranational and or non governmental organisations) both the academies themselves and their fundamental principle of excellence.

To fulfil its mission and to carry out its vision, the UAI will have the following objectives:

:'''1'''. to strengthen the progress and the implementation of current projects and to increase their relevance in a positive and critical way; to undertake syntheses, made available to the Member Academies ;
:'''2'''. to set up a strategic plan that will consider the dissemination of information to be essential in the new information age, a plan that will facilitate the sharing of knowledge and the spread of information, and that will be updated through periodic assessments ;
:'''3'''. to update the functioning of its governance and management bodies and to develop a positive image by a critical reassessment of its communication tools;
:'''4'''. to increase its financial means and the funds made available for projects through a systematic search for partnership with international public or private foundations ;
:'''5'''. to encourage member academies to participate more actively in current projects and to set up new interdisciplinary and internationally oriented projects;
:'''6'''. to strengthen its presence and its participation in international organizations by increasing its visibility in these venues, utilizing its accumulated knowledge and that of its members, and emphasizing its links with the global communications set up by them.

== Management of the UAI ==

=== The Board ===
The Board (in French, ''le Bureau'') is responsible for organizing the General Assembly and presides over its deliberations; it controls the general administration and the progress of works. It is entitled to take urgent measures in the interval between General Assemblies and, if necessary, to convene an Extraordinary General Assembly. The Board has all the powers of management and administration that are necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the association, except those specifically reserved to the General Assembly.

It is composed of a President, two Vice-Presidents and six members, with Honorary Presidents in a consultative role. All are elected for a term of three years. The Secretary General is also a member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Board Members |url=http://www.uai-iua.org/en/structures/board|publisher=uai-iua.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Assembly ===
Each year, a representative (called "delegate") from every member academy attends a General Assembly to discuss and to cooperate in meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Delegates |url=http://www.uai-iua.org/en/members/delegates|publisher=uai-iua.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The General Assembly is always held at the seat of one of the UAI's Member Academies and each year at a different location: one year in Brussels, one year somewhere else in Europe, one year somewhere outside Europe.

=== General Secretariat ===
The Secretary General attends to the coordination of the activities of the UAI, follows the progress of the various projects and supports the Bureau in its handling of the correspondence and agenda of the UAI and in the organization of annual sessions. Since its foundation the UAI has its seat in the Palace of Academies in Brussels. The [[Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique]] is in charge of the secretariat of the UAI and its Permanent Secretary is the ''ex officio'' General Secretary.

== Projects ==
Since 1919, the number of projects sponsored, supported or supervised by the UAI has steadily increased:  from the first three projects adopted in 1919, to 81 projects completed or in progress today.

An initiative for a new project can only be taken by a Member Academy of the UAI (through its delegate mandated for this purpose) or by the Board of the UAI itself. The proposal must contain  a precise definition of its subject, an explanatory memorandum, a work plan, a budget and a statement of the financial responsibility for its execution. The project must set and maintain high standards of scholarship, as well as possessing international character and interest.

'''Stanley William (Bill) Toomath''' (12 November 1925 – 20 March 2014) was a [[Wellington]] ([[New Zealand]]) [[architect]]. He was a founding member of the Architectural Group in [[Auckland]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Toomath "The Gestation of the Group." p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; a life member of the [[Wellington Architectural Centre]] and a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Architects.  Both the founding of the Group and the Architectural Centre were important factors in New Zealand's [[modernist]] [[architectural history]]. 

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Lower Hutt]], Toomath studied [[architecture]] at the Auckland College of the University of New Zealand between 1945 and 1949. He graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture, and was awarded a UNZ two-year travelling scholarship which took him to Europe in 1951.  Adding an early Fulbright Graduate Award in 1952 enabled him to complete a MArch at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] where he was taught by [[I. M. Pei]] and was a co-student with [[John Hejduk]].&lt;ref&gt;"Shopping Center in Three Circles." pp. 72-75. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly worked with [[Walter Gropius]] at the Architects' Collaborative and then with I. M. Pei before returning to New Zealand in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''Antonello and the Architect'' dir Tony Hiles (Wellington: City Associates, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural practice==
On his return from New York Toomath set up practice, and three years later was joined by [[Derek Wilson]] to establish Toomath and Wilson. Toomath and Wilson were later joined by Don Irvine and Grahame Anderson in 1972, forming the firm Toomath Wilson Irvine Anderson Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;"Toomath Wilson Irvine Anderson" pp. 174-84&lt;/ref&gt;

Toomath's work reflects an exploratory and intelligent engagement with modernist architectural ideas.  A key architectural interest was the articulation of continuous space, which is particularly evident in his Toomath Senior house, Lower Hutt (1949), and the Mackay house, Silverstream (1961).  The Toomath Senior house is famous as the site of a discussion Toomath and Lew Martin had with architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] about New Zealand construction.  Pevsner found the detailing of a post in the carport unrefined.  Toomath argued that it reflected an honesty in detailing, relevant to New Zealand architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Walker. ''Looking for the Local.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mackay House, Silverstream is symmetrically planned and was designed for a couple without children.  It was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) Bronze Medal in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Clark. "Space Explorer." pp. 170-73.; Dudding. "A Final Formality" p. 10.; McCarthy "Going for Gold" pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Toomath's other key works include Wool House, Featherston Street, Wellington (1955, in association with Bernard Johns &amp; Whitwell) and the [[Victoria University of Wellington Faculty of Education|Wellington Teachers' College]], Donald Street, Karori (1966–1977).&lt;ref&gt;"Teachers Training College, Wellington" pp. 154-159.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wellington Teachers College, Karori, Stage One was awarded an NZIA Silver Medal (1972), and an NZIA Local Award (Enduring Architecture) (2005).  Wool House (also now known as Old Wool House) was recognised with an NZIA Wellington Branch Enduring Architecture Award (2002)and the residential Dobson House, Hankey St, Wellington received an NZIA Wellington Branch Enduring Architecture Award (2004)

==Architectural exhibitions and advocacy==
Following his return from studying architecture in the United States and working with Walter Gropius and I. M. Pei, Toomath spent the majority of his architectural career in New Zealand (including over 35 years in professional practice).  He was an advocate for several heritage buildings (see below), and played key roles in the [[Wellington Architectural Centre]]'s projects on Wellington's urban form, namely: "Te Aro Replanned" (1947), "Homes Without Sprawl" (1957), "City Approaches" (1959) and "Wgtn 196X" (1961).&lt;ref&gt;Gatley. "The Wellington CBD Replanned: Wgtn 196X." pp. 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Toomath also presented professional evidence for the Wellington City Council on proposals for controlling building heights, protected viewshafts and urban form planning (1989–1990) in hearings before the Planning Tribunal.

Toomath led a small team whose report on the Old Town Hall stopped moves for its demolition.&lt;ref&gt;"Wellington Town Hall" pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote papers on conservation matters and presented evidence in support of a number of heritage buildings including: the AMP Head Office Building, the State Fire Insurance Building, Wharf Sheds 7 and 21.  He had an active role in campaigns to save [[Old St. Paul's, Wellington|Old St Paul's]].

==Design educator==
Toomath was also the Head of the School of Design, Wellington Polytechnic (1979–1989), and a contributor of articles to the New Zealand journal ''Designscape''.  He was a regular participant of the "Designmark" Advisory Panels, New Zealand Industrial Design Council from 1969, and a Judge of the Prince Philip Award for New Zealand Industrial Design (1981–1985).

==Documentary==
Toomath is the subject of a documentary [http://www.cityfilms.co.nz Antonello and the Architect], which reveals his influences, designs, ideas - and the painting that he built - Antonello da Messina's St Jerome in his Study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3612">The '''Youth Innovation Fund''' is a national program that seeds [[youth activism]], [[service learning]], [[youth-led media]] through [[civic engagement]] programs in eight cities across the [[United States]]. Based in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Fund operates in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], [[San Francisco, California]], [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Portland, Maine]], [[Nashville, Tennessee]], [[Hampton, Virginia]], [[Cleveland, Mississippi]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It is funded by the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]] and supported by the [[National Service-Learning Partnership]].

==History==
In 2003 the '''Youth Innovation Fund''' was funded by the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]] to help the National Service-Learning Partnership, at the [[Academy for Educational Development]], establish a new development source for "youth-directed civic action".&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.wkkf.org/default.aspx?tabid=55&amp;CID=275&amp;ProjCID=275&amp;ProjID=102&amp;NID=28&amp;LanguageID=0 "Youth Leaders Prepare Today for Tomorrow’s Challenges."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005601/http://www.wkkf.org/default.aspx?tabid=55&amp;CID=275&amp;ProjCID=275&amp;ProjID=102&amp;NID=28&amp;LanguageID=0 |date=September 27, 2007 }} Kellogg Foundation website article about YIF.&lt;/ref&gt; The Youth Innovation Fund's primary purpose is to support [[youth]], working in partnership with community institutions, and to create innovations that address public issues and problems using a [[service learning]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.cived.net/wwwboard/messages/Fellowships%20and%20Grants/WKKF%20youth%20innovation%20fund.htm Youth Innovation Fund Announced] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630184027/http://www.cived.net/wwwboard/messages/Fellowships%20and%20Grants/WKKF%20youth%20innovation%20fund.htm |date=June 30, 2007 }}. CivicEducation.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight sites were chosen nationwide to receive grants in [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland, Mississippi]], [[Hampton, Virginia]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Portland, Maine]], [[Portland, Oregon]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]. These boards were to consist of diverse youth ages 12-19 that represented the wide variety of races and socio-economic backgrounds of the youth population at the site.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.teenedge.com/yip/about.aspx History of the Fund]. Youth Innovation Fund of Nashville. Retrieved 6/17/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Each youth board makes strategic mini-grants to youth-directed civic action projects that utilize a service-learning framework. The youth boards also develop impact plans to create the structures and policies to sustain systemic youth engagement in a city and/or school district.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aed.org/Projects/YouthFund.cfm Youth Innovation Fund details].
