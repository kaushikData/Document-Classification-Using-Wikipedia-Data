The '''Paris Peace Accords''' ({{lang-km|សន្ធិសញ្ញាសន្តិភាពទីក្រុងប៉ារីស}}, {{lang-fr|Accords de Paris}}) formally titled '''Agreements on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict''' were signed on October 23, 1991, and marked the official end of the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]]. The agreement led to the deployment of the first post-[[Cold War]] peace keeping mission ([[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|UNTAC]]) and the first ever occasion in which the UN took over as the government of a state. The agreement was signed by nineteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR, Cambodia - 20 years on from the Paris Peace Agreements, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Cambodia-20yearsonfromtheParisPeace.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

23 October is a public holiday in Cambodia to commemorate the anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement. It was announced by the government in late 2012.

The '''2015 South Coast blackout''' was a [[power outage]] that affected more than 710,000 residents living in the [[Lower Mainland]]  and [[Vancouver Island]] regions of the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]]. It was the largest blackout event in [[BC Hydro]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pawson|first=Chad|title=B.C.

The hardest hit areas were [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], [[Pitt Meadows]], [[Port Coquitlam]], [[Port Moody]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=B.C. storm: 'Largest outage event' in BC Hydro history|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-storm-hydro-1.3210919|date=September 1, 2015|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout lasted more than 72 hours for some neighbourhoods in these municipalities.&lt;ref name="metro news" /&gt;

==Blackout==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The blackout began with a windstorm that knocked over trees and blew away branches sometime in the early morning of August 29, 2015. Later around noon, a generator blew out, with most of the electricity going out in neighbourhoods in Coquitlam, Port Moody, and Port Coquitlam, with certain buildings equipped with partial emergency lighting and businesses closing for the day as a result of the blackout. Reports also surfaced that people saw sparks blow up on cables in neighbourhoods. Wind speeds reached 90 to 100 km/h at the time of the blackout. People who were desperate of getting warm food either had to travel to nearby Burnaby to order, resulting in cramped lineups. The same also happened in select businesses in Port Coquitlam, with cramped lineups also occurring there. The next day, [[BC Hydro]] stated that the power to the homes should resume by midnight August 31, 2015, but resumed 6 hours earlier than most expected. However, some local areas of BC took longer to regain power.

The '''2015 [[Trophée Éric Bompard]]''' was the fourth event of six in the [[2015–16 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating]], a senior-level international invitational competition series. It was held at the Meriadeck Ice Rink in [[Bordeaux]] on November 13. Medals were awarded in the disciplines of [[single skating|men's singles, ladies' singles]], [[pair skating]], and [[ice dancing]]. Skaters earned points toward qualifying for the [[2015–16 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2015–16 Grand Prix Final]].

The competition was cancelled after the first day following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]. The [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]]s and [[short dance]]s had been completed on 13 November, but the [[free skating]]s and [[Free dance (figure skating)|free dance]]s were to be held on the second day.&lt;ref name=cbc151113/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS151114/&gt;

[[File:Helicopter which crashed in bad weather during Falklands War.jpg|thumb|Remains of a helicopter shot down in South Georgia Island during Falklands War. (Photo taken 1999)]]

The aftermath of the 1982 '''[[Falklands War]]''' (''Guerra de Malvinas'' in Spanish) between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] saw an impact upon world [[geopolitics]], the local [[political culture]] in Argentina and the UK, military thought, medical treatment, and the lives of those who were directly involved in the war.

==Political aftermath==
Diplomatic relations between the UK and Argentina were not restored until 1989 under a formula which put the issue of sovereignty to one side (''the sovereignty umbrella'') and established a framework within which further talks on matters of mutual interest could be held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklands.info/history/agreements.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831092618/http://www.falklands.info/history/agreements.html |date=31 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
The Argentine loss of the war led to ever-larger protests against the military regime and is credited with giving the final push to drive out [[National Reorganization Process|the military government]] that had overthrown [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] in 1976 and perpetrated the crimes of the [[Dirty War]]. [[Galtieri]] was forced to resign and elections were held on 30 October 1983 and a new president, [[Raúl Alfonsín]], the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR) party candidate, took office on 10 December 1983, defeating Italo Luder, the candidate for the [[Justicialist Party]] ([[Peronism|Peronist]] movement). In the long term the debacle concluded the periodical intervention of the Argentine military in the politics since the 1930s.

In 2009, Argentine authorities in [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] ratified a decision made by authorities in [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego]] (which, according to Argentina, have authority over the islands) charging 70 officers and corporals with inhumane treatment of [[conscription|conscript soldiers]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/27/um/m-01947578.htm Confirman el juzgamiento por torturas en Malvinas], (In Spanish), ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', Buenos Aires, 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "We have testimony from 23 people about a soldier who was shot to death by a corporal, four other former combatants who starved to death, and at least 15 cases of conscripts who were staked out on the ground", Pablo Vassel, under-secretary of human rights in the province of Corrientes, told Inter Press Service News Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37337 ARGENTINA: Soldiers Report Torture, Murder - By Superiors - in Malvinas. By Marcela Valente. IPS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621072108/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37337 |date=21 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are claims that false testimonies were used as evidence in accusing the Argentine officers and NCOs and Vassel had to step down from his post as under-secretary of human rights of Corrientes in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cescem.org.ar/informacion/noticias/pag09_057.html Centro de Ex Soldados Combatientes en Malvinas de Corrientes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407054559/http://www.cescem.org.ar/informacion/noticias/pag09_057.html |date=7 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Falkland Islands===
The Falkland Islands remained a self-governing British overseas territory, but shortly after the war the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]] granted the Islanders British citizenship (replacing British Dependent Territories citizenship), strengthening the link between the Islanders and the UK. {{further|Politics of the Falkland Islands}} The economy also benefited indirectly from UK military investment and directly from development of fisheries. The future of the Falkland Islanders' link to the UK has been more certain as a result of the war, and the Islands' government remains committed to self-determination and British sovereignty. The only civilian deaths during the war were three women who were killed when a [[Royal Navy]] shell hit the house they were sheltering in during a bombardment of military targets inside Stanley itself.

===United Kingdom===
For the UK, the war cost 255 men, six ships (ten others suffered varying degrees of battle damage), 34 aircraft and £2.778 billion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Freedman]]: "The campaign itself, Operation Corporate, is now estimated to have cost about £1.5 billion. The cost of replacing lost equipment is put at £1,278 million. The largest single item in this figure is £641 million for four new Type 22 frigates... to replace Sir Galahad is put at £69 million, and new aircraft account for another £116 million." - Britain &amp; the Falklands War, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; but the campaign was considered a great victory for the United Kingdom. The months following the war saw the popularity of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Government increase, with some attributing [[Rally 'round the flag effect|this rise]] to the aftermath of the war&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, H.D. Stewarr, M.C. Zuk, G. 1986. Politics, Economics and Party Popularity in Britain, 1979–83. ''Electoral Studies''. 5(2): 123-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Norpoth, 'War and Government Popularity in Britain', paper given at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Washington, D.C., August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; with others suggesting that the rise in popularity was due to an increase in economic optimism, with the war increasing productivity by 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders,D. Ward, H. Marsh, D. 1987. Government Popularity and the Falklands War. ''British Journal of Political Science''. 17(3): 281-313.&lt;/ref&gt; The war did however cause several members of the government to resign, including the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], the most recent time that a UK government minister resigned openly in response to a failure of his department (in not anticipating the war).

Criticism was levelled at [[Ted Rowlands, Baron Rowlands|Ted Rowlands]], a former junior foreign minister in the preceding government, who disclosed in Parliament in April 1982 that the British had broken the Argentine diplomatic codes. As the same code machines were used by the Argentine military, this disclosure immediately served to deny British access to valuable intelligence. This, and other responses to parliamentary questions, and leaks of information to the BBC has been alleged by historian [[Hugh Bicheno]] to be a deliberate attempt to undermine the Thatcher government on the part of a variety of individuals who had a vested interest in its fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bicheno | first = Hugh | title = Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War | publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | location = London | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-297-84633-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} There is some debate as to the accuracy of the claims regarding Ted Rowlands. [[Mark Urban]] in his book ''UK Eyes Alpha'' makes reference to a "figure intimate with the workings of GCHQ" who suggested that Rowlands's comment had no noticeable effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Urban |first=Mark |title=UK Eyes Alpha |publisher=Faber and Faber |location= London |year= 1996 |isbn=978-0-571-17689-2 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the successful conclusion of the war gave a noticeable fillip to British patriotic feeling, with the mobilisation of national identity encapsulated in the so-called "Falklands Factor". Since the failure of the 1956 [[Suez Crisis|Suez campaign]], the [[British Empire|end of Empire]] and the economic decline of the 1970s which culminated in the [[Winter of Discontent]], Britain had been beset by uncertainty and anxiety about its international role, status and capability. With the war successfully concluded, Thatcher was returned to power with an increased Parliamentary majority and felt empowered to press ahead with the economic readjustments of [[Thatcherism]].

A second major effect was a reaffirmation of the [[Special Relationship (US-UK)|special relationship]] between the US and UK. Both [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]] (his [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]) were appointed honorary [[Order of the British Empire|Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) for their help in the campaign, but the more obvious result was the common alignment of Britain and the USA in a more confrontational foreign policy against the [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet bloc]], sometimes known as the [[Cold War (1979–1985)|Second Cold War]].

In 2007 the British government expressed regrets over the deaths on both sides in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6515803.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK 'regret' over Falklands dead | date=1 April 2007 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Thatcher was quoted as saying "in the struggle against evil... we can all today draw hope and strength" from the Falklands victory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6748125.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thatcher rallying call to troops | date=13 June 2007 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while former Argentinian President [[Néstor Kirchner]] claimed while in office that the UK won a colonial victory and vowed that the islands would one day return to Argentine sovereignty.

The United States' reputation in parts of Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1= Sennes|first1= Ricardo|last2= Onuk|first2= Janina|last3= de Oliveira|first3= Amacio Jorge |title= The Brazilian foreign policy and the hemispheric security|url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0717-14982006000100001&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en|accessdate= 22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was damaged because of the perception that it had broken the Rio Treaty ([[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] or TIAR) by providing the UK with military supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://britainandamerica.typepad.com/britain_and_america/2007/04/americas_role_d.html] "Caspar Weinberger who was the Defence Secretary at the time.... His staunch support later earned him a British Knighthood. He provided the United Kingdom with all the equipment she required during the war. Ranging from submarine detectors to the latest missiles. All this was done very discreetly."&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001 the then [[President of Mexico]] [[Vicente Fox]] cited the Falklands War as proof of the failure of the TIAR.

Regarding the attitude of the Latin American governments, K.J. Holsti presents another sight of the South American dilemma:&lt;ref&gt;K.J.Holsti, "The state, the war, and the state of war", University of Cambridge Press, {{ISBN|0-521-57790-X}} (pbk), first published 1996, page176:&lt;/ref&gt; "While South American governments (except Chile) publicly supported Argentina in its conflict with Great Britain, in private many governments were pleased with the outcome of the war. Argentina's bellicosity against Chile over the Beagle Channel problem ... [its] foreign intervention ([in] Bolivia and Nicaragua) ... and [its] propounded geopolitical doctrines that were seen in other countries as threatening to them". So, according to David R. Mares, "Brazilian military analysts worried about the problems of having a successful and belligerent Argentina as neighbour".&lt;ref&gt;David R. Mares, "Violent Peace", Columbia University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-231-11186-X}}, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===The visit of Pope John Paul II===

In May 1982, [[Pope John Paul II]] carried out a long-scheduled [[Pope John Paul II's visit to the United Kingdom|visit to the United Kingdom]]. In view of the crisis it was decided that this should be balanced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcsouthwark.co.uk/papal_visit_intro.htm] The twenty-fifth anniversary of the visit of Pope John Paul II to Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt; with an unscheduled trip to Argentina in June.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, June 1982, '' Archbishop Says Pope's Visit To Argentina Is Nonpolitical''&lt;/ref&gt; It is contended that his presence and words spiritually prepared Argentines for a possible defeat, contrary to the [[propaganda]] issued by the Junta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1152529685863&amp;a=KArticle&amp;aid=1181130566265] TONY BRENTON, BRITISH AMBASSADOR INTERVIEW TO GAZETA 14.06.2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516142234/http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1152529685863&amp;a=KArticle&amp;aid=1181130566265 |date=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Argentina in 1987 after the return of democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of pastoral visits of Pope John Paul II outside Italy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military analysis==
Militarily, the Falklands conflict remains the largest air-naval combat operation between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant "lessons learned" include the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of coordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.

===Vulnerability of surface ships===
In his book ''The Price of Admiralty'', military historian Sir [[John Keegan]] noted that the brief conflict showed the irremediable vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles, and, most importantly, to submarines: despite the seemingly limited consequences of the war, it confirmed the dominance of the submarine in naval warfare. This is especially so, Keegan argues, because submarines are far less vulnerable than aircraft to counterattack, being able to approach and destroy their targets with almost complete impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, Sir John, ''The Price of Admiralty: the Evolution of Naval Warfare'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 1990, {{ISBN|0-14-009650-7}}, pages 324–325&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many prominent naval tacticians have recently argued this point; the sinking of the [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] was the result of a modern nuclear-powered submarine hunting a pre-World War II ship with no anti-submarine capabilities, and the British ships sunk by the Argentinian Air Force were acceptable casualties in view of the fact that they were screening forces, either for the British aircraft carriers in the cases of HMS ''Sheffield'' and even ''Atlantic Conveyor'', or for the amphibious landing forces as with HMS ''Coventry'', HMS ''Ardent'' and HMS ''Antelope''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Wayne P., "Fleet Tactics and Coastal Combat" Naval Institute Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of air power===
Neither side achieved total air supremacy; nonetheless, air power proved to be of critical importance during the conflict, due to the isolated, rough landscape of the Falklands in which the mobility of land forces was restricted. Air strikes were staged against ground, sea and air targets on both sides, and often with clear results. All of the UK losses at sea were caused by aircraft or missile strikes (by both the Argentine Air Force and Naval Aviation). The French [[Exocet|Exocet missile]] proved its lethality in [[air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface]] operations, leading to retrofitting of most major ships with [[Close-in weapon system]]s (CIWS).

The [[Argentine air forces in the Falklands War|air war in the Falklands]] vindicated the UK decision to maintain at least the [[STOVL]] aircraft carriers after the retirement of {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}}. The domination of air power in major naval engagements was demonstrated, along with the usefulness of carriers and it proved the small but manoeuvrable Sea Harrier as a true fighter. Sea Harriers shot down [[Argentine air forces in the Falklands War#Casualties and aircraft losses|21 aircraft]] with no air-to-air losses themselves, although six were lost to ground fire and accidents.

It should be noted that the disparity in figures, with the Argentine fighters failing to shoot down a single Sea Harrier, can be explained by several factors, including limited fighter control that was provided by British warships in [[San Carlos Water]], the then almost unparalleled Blue Fox radar, and the extreme manoeuvrability of the Sea Harrier. Additionally the British had the latest [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] missiles, while the only Argentine planes with air-to-air missiles for self-defence were the Mirages. The AIM-9Ls had a much wider angle of engagement than the earlier versions employed by the Argentines, which could only effectively engage the rear quarter of an enemy aircraft. The only advantage of the Argentine jets was their higher maximum speed, but Argentine pilots could not benefit from this unless they risked running out of fuel, as was seen in the first air combat of the war when a Mirage IIIEA was forced to attempt a landing at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].

The importance of [[Airborne Early Warning]] (AEW) was shown. The Royal Navy had effectively no over-the-horizon radar capability. This was hastily rectified after the war, with Sea King helicopters fitted with radomes containing a variant of the [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] aircraft's [[Searchwater radar]]. These first travelled south after the war on the brand new {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}}, sister ship to {{HMS|Invincible|R05|3}}.

The usefulness of helicopters in combat, logistic, and [[casualty evacuation|casevac]] operations was confirmed.

===Logistics===
The logistical capability of the UK armed forces was stretched to the limit in order to mount an amphibious operation so far from a land base, in mountainous islands with few roads. After the war much work was done to improve both the logistical and amphibious capability of the Royal Navy. Task force commander Rear Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward referred to the conflict as "a lot closer run than many would care to believe", reflecting the naval and military belief that few people understood—or understand—the extent to which the logistical dimension made the war a difficult operation for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/falklands/story/0,,678047,00.html Falklands victory 'a close run thing']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships of the task force could only remain on station for a limited time in the worsening southern hemisphere winter. With such a high proportion of the Royal Navy's surface fleet engaged, or lost in combat, there were few units available for northbound traffic. At the core of the fleet, ''Invincible'' could possibly have been replaced by the hastily prepared ''Illustrious'' or the loaned ''{{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2}}'',&lt;ref name="usni20120627"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.usni.org/news-analysis/news/reagan-readied-us-warship-82-falklands-war-0 | title=Reagan Readied U.S. Warship for '82 Falklands War | work=News and Analysis, U.S. Naval Institute | date=5 February 2013 | accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no replacement available for ''Hermes'', the larger of the two British carriers. Woodward's strategy, therefore, required the land war to be won before ''Hermes'', in particular, succumbed to the harsh environment. Woodward called the operation "a damned close-run thing", quoting the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] after the [[Battle of Waterloo]].

===Special forces===
The usefulness of [[special forces]] units was reaffirmed. British special forces destroyed many Argentine aircraft (notably in the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] [[raid on Pebble Island]]) and carried out highly informative intelligence-gathering operations. Contrary to popular understanding, the Argentine special forces also patrolled hard, in appalling climatic conditions, against a professional enemy and showed that they could sometimes get the upper hand.&lt;ref&gt;(Jon Cooksey, 3 PARA MOUNT LONGDON, page 44)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other lessons learned===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
[[Nylon]] was shown{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} to be a poor choice for fabric in uniforms, as it is more flammable than cotton and also melts with heat. Burning nylon adheres to the skin, causing avoidable casualties.

===Impact on the Royal Navy===
Strained by two oil crises ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]), the United Kingdom's government desired to cut defence spending in line with the rest of Europe. Many former British possessions in Africa and Asia had gained independence from the UK by the 1980s. Due to this [[decolonisation]], successive British governments investigated closing British overseas bases and reducing the UK's armed forces in the belief that capabilities such as a [[Blue-water navy|blue water navy]] were no longer required. The Conservative government's Defence Secretary [[John Nott]] produced a [[white paper]] in 1981 proposing major cuts for the navy in the next ten years (the army and the RAF had already been tailored for NATO.)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hastings and Jenkins: ''The Battle for the Falklands'', chapter 1: "Forgotten Islands"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Healey]], the Defence Secretary in 1966, once said that aircraft carriers were required only for operations involving 'landing or withdrawal of troops against sophisticated opposition outside range of land-based air cover'. When the last conventional carrier in the Royal Navy, {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}}, was decommissioned in 1978, the pro-carrier lobby succeeded in acquiring light carriers (euphemistically christened 'through deck cruisers') equipped with [[VTOL]] [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] as well as helicopters, justified by the fact that one of their primary roles was anti-submarine warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621174940/http://www.btinternet.com/~warship/Today/invincible.htm] Invincible Class Aircraft Carriers&lt;/ref&gt; John Nott's defence review concluded that anti-submarine defence would be performed more cheaply by a smaller number of destroyers and frigates. The carrier {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} was therefore to be scrapped and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} sold to Australia. Under the review, the Royal Navy was focused primarily on anti-submarine warfare under the auspices of NATO. Any out-of-area amphibious operations were considered unlikely. The entire Royal Marines was in jeopardy of being disbanded and the sale of {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|6}} and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} was mooted.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings and Jenkins: ''The Battle for the Falklands'', chapter 5: "Task Force": "In the previous decade, the very existence of the marines had come into question." and "both the assault ships ''Fearless'' and ''Intrepid'' were at that time threatened with sale to foreign powers"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, low funding caused many ships to be in harbour for months due to lack of spare parts and fuel. The largest cut in the Royal Navy's conventional forces led to the resignation of the Navy Minister [[Keith Speed]] in 1981. Sea battles, mass convoys, amphibious landings, and coastal bombardments were considered obsolete in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The head of the admiralty, [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[Henry Leach]], was still fighting the cuts in the Ministry of Defence together with the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of Defence Staff]], who by chance, was also a naval officer — Admiral of the Fleet [[Terence Lewin|Sir Terence Lewin]].

At the onset of the crisis, First Sea Lord Sir Henry Leach was summoned to brief the Prime Minister. He claimed that Britain was able to recapture the islands, and that it should be done. "Since here was a clear, imminent threat to British overseas territory that could only be reached by sea, what the hell was the point in having a Navy if it was not used for this sort of thing?".&lt;ref&gt;Falklands 25 - Official Commemorative Publication, 2007, Newsdesk Communications LTD, {{ISBN|1-905435-44-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of the necessity for speed, Leach had already given orders for the ships of a potential task force to be prepared for deployment. On 2 April, at a briefing at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Leach advised the Prime Minister that a task force was necessary and could sail within 48 hours. Lewin, who was forced to return from a scheduled visit to New Zealand, also impressed on the War Cabinet that the primary objective for the United Kingdom should be: "to bring about the withdrawal of Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands, and the re-establishment of British administration there, as quickly as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71891|title=Lewin, Terence Thornton, Baron Lewin (1920–1999)|first=Richard|last=Hill|authorlink=J.

After the war, the sale of HMS ''Invincible'' to Australia was cancelled, with ''Hermes'' offered instead (eventually being sold to India as [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']] in 1986), and the operational status of all three support carriers was maintained. The proposed cutback in the surface fleet was abandoned and replacements for many of the lost ships and helicopters plus more Sea Harriers were ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Preston | first = Antony | title = Sea Combat off the Falklands |chapter=chapter 7: Conclusion| publisher = Willow Books | location = London | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-00-218046-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amphibious assault ships {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} and {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|6}} were not decommissioned until 2002 and 1999 respectively, being replaced by {{HMS|Albion|L14|6}} and {{HMS|Bulwark|L15|6}}.

A RN ship always patrols the South Atlantic on a six-month rotation. In 2012, the thirtieth anniversary of the war, the RN's most powerful warship, [[HMS Dauntless (D33)|HMS Dauntless]] visited the Falkland Islands, and it was theoretically capable of destroying the entire Argentine airforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17606130|publisher=BBC Sport|title=HMS Dauntless sets sail for the Falklands|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy confirmed its commitment to a carrier force with the order of two [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|Queen Elizabeth class]] carriers in 2007.

===Soviet Union===
For the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] militaries, the Falklands War forced a re-examination of their estimates in the quality of Western troops and in particularly, how well an all-volunteer force would compare against conscripted forces. The Soviets became aware that the British relied heavily on the quality and training of their personnel to compensate for the extreme logistical difficulties the campaign presented. It was also noted that both sides were using many of the same western made weapon systems, their combat performance and effectiveness information collected during and after the war was analyzed by the Soviets, to be used to create counter-combat strategies to be adopted by their forces in an event of a then-possible war against [[NATO]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Weapon export controls===
The [[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls]] (COCOM) failed to anticipate a conflict between Argentina and the UK when approving weapon exports to Argentina.{{Clarify|so what did they do afterwards?|date=February 2010}}

===Allegations of nuclear deployment===
It has been reported that two years after the war, Labour MPs demanded an inquiry&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051125021940/http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/11/21/145709.shtml Margaret Thatcher Threatened to Use Nukes During Falkland Islands War] News Max, 21 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; into reports that a [[Resolution class submarine]] armed with the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBMs]] had deployed to [[Ascension Island]] during the operation, ostensibly to prepare for a nuclear strike. The Ministry of Defence is reported to have denied the allegations, and [[Lawrence Freedman|Freedman]]'s Official History does the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110663 Falklands: “The Sphinx and the curious case of the Iron Lady’s H-bomb” (memoirs of Mitterrand’s psychoanalyst)], The Sunday Times, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, British warships were routinely armed with the [[WE.177#Falklands War|WE.177]], a [[tactical nuclear weapon]] with a [[variable yield]] of either 10 [[kilotons]] or 0.5 kiloton, which was used as a [[Nuclear Depth Bomb]] in an [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] role. The Official History describes the contorted logistical arrangements that led to the removal of the nuclear depth bombs from the frigates, following political alarm in Whitehall. Eventually at least some of the depth bombs were brought back to the UK by an RFA vessel. In December 2003, Argentine President [[Néstor Kirchner]] demanded an apology from the British government for the "regrettable and monstrous" act of arming warships engaged in the conflict with nuclear depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/12/07/uk.nukes.reut/index.html Argentina demands UK nuke apology], CNN News, 7 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence analysis==

===MI6 activity===
In his 2002 memoirs [[John Nott|Sir John Nott]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Defence]] during the conflict, made following disclosure regarding the activities of the UK's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6):

===Norwegian intelligence===
According to a documentary by the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK), during the war a [[Norwegian Intelligence Service]] facility situated at [[Fauske]] in the northern county of [[Nordland]] regularly intercepted [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] satellite intelligence data, which was forwarded to the [[Northwood Headquarters]]. Said "a high-ranking British military source":

{{quote|When the war broke out, we ourselves almost didn’t have any intelligence information from this area. It was here we got help from the Norwegians, who gave us a stream of information about the Argentine warships’ positions. The information came to us all the time and straight to our war headquarters at Northwood. The information was continuously updated and told us exactly where the Argentine ships were.&lt;ref name="Fauske"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1861285.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629035444/http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1861285.html |archivedate=29 June 2009 }} ''Article about the Fauske II station (in Norwegian)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Soviet intervention===
According to Russian journalist Sergei Brilev, whose claims were reported in ''[[The Times]]'' on 2 April 2010, Argentina may have received satellite imagery of British positions from the Soviet Union during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7085117.ece|title=Argentina had help from the Soviet Union during the Falkland's War|author=Tony Halpin|work=[[The Times]]|date=2 April 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1269664&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
In 2005, an Argentine film called "Blessed by Fire" exposed the mistreatment of Argentine conscripts during the war. That film "led directly to a criminal investigation" which resulted in the filing of formal charges of [[crimes against humanity]] against 70 Argentine military officers for the alleged abuse, torture and, in one case, murder of their own troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8373942.stm BBC News.

Accessed 19 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical==

===Survival and recovery of wounded British soldiers===
During the operations, several wounded British soldiers had to spend hours in the cold before receiving medical aid—yet no British soldier died who was evacuated to a medical aid station, a fact confirmed by Surgeon Commander [[Rick Jolly]], the Medical Officer In Charge of the refrigeration plant at [[Ajax Bay]] (nicknamed "The Red and Green Life machine" by the medics). Many recovered better than medical opinion of the time considered possible; subsequent theories have postulated this may have been due to a combination of the extreme cold and the good standards of physical fitness amongst the wounded. Britain also had medical staff familiar with high velocity gunshot wounds, due to their experiences in the [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland conflict]] with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].

===Medical and psychological treatment of Falklands veterans===
The British Ministry of Defence was accused several times of a systematic failure to prepare service personnel for the horrors of war and to provide adequate care for them afterwards.

There are allegations that the Ministry of Defence has tried to ignore the issue of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD), which left many sufferers emotionally scarred and unable to work, immersed in social dislocation, [[alcoholism]], and [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. Veterans have suffered prolonged personality disorders, [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashbacks]], and anxiety sometimes reaching pathological levels.

It has been claimed that more veterans have committed suicide since the Falklands War ended than the number of servicemen killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1758301.stm Falklands Veterans suicide toll] BBC News. Retrieved 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Atlantic Medal Association (SAMA82), which represents and helps Falklands veterans, believes that some 264 veterans had taken their own lives by 2002, a number exceeding the 255 who died in active service, although no estimate is available for the expected number of suicides that would have occurred anyway.

A comprehensive statistical study of the deaths of personnel deployed to the Falklands since the end of the conflict was published by [[Defence Analytical Services and Advice]] (DASA) on Tuesday 14 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/causes-of-deaths-among-the-uk-armed-forces-veterans-of-the-1982-falklands-campaign A study of deaths among UK Armed Forces personnel deployed to the 1982 Falklands Campaign: 1982 to 2012] published: 14 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that:

:{|
|-
| align=right |25,948 || || || || UK Armed Forces personnel served in the Falklands Campaign
|-
| align=right |    237 || || || || personnel died during the campaign
|-
| align=right |  1,335 || || || || Falklands veterans have died since 1982
|-
| align=right |     95 || || || || of these deaths (veterans and in-service) were attributable to suicide and open verdict deaths
|}

The statistics show that 7% of the deaths of Falklands veterans since the campaign were attributed to suicide, significantly less than the number of deaths during the campaign, and that, for Falklands veterans,

{{quote|For deaths due to intentional self harm and events of undetermined intent (suicide and open verdict deaths) there was a 35% significant decreased risk of dying compared to the UK general population.}}

The trials of one British patient, [[Robert Lawrence (British Army officer)|Robert Lawrence]], MC, were chronicled in a book co-authored by him entitled ''When The Fighting is Over'' which was later adapted into a television film.

'''Air France Flight 8969''' was an [[Air France]] flight that was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]]ed on 24 December 1994 by the [[Armed Islamic Group]] of Algeria (GIA) at [[Houari Boumediene Airport]], [[Algiers, Algeria]]. The terrorists murdered three passengers and their intention was to blow up the plane over the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris. When the aircraft reached [[Marseille]], the [[GIGN|National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (GIGN), a counter-terror unit of the French [[National Gendarmerie]], stormed the plane and killed all four hijackers.&lt;ref name="Sancton"&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Sancton |author-link=Tom Sancton |title=Anatomy of a Hijack |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,163487,00.html |date=24 June 2001 |location=Paris |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] |accessdate=1 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523083536/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C163487%2C00.html |archivedate=23 May 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Algeria was in a state of [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] at the time of the hijacking. Aircraft flying to Algiers faced the possibility of missile attacks. As a result, Air France's flights to Algiers had crews entirely made of people who volunteered for the route. Air France had asked government officials if it absolutely had to continue flying to Algeria; as of the time of the hijacking, but they never gave Air France a reply. Bernard Delhemme was the captain of the flight.&lt;ref name="Mayday"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Killing Machine |access-date=14 November 2015 |series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]] |network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]] |season=2 |number=3|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Paul Borderie was the copilot, and Alain Bossuat was the flight engineer.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; The [[Airbus A300B2-1C]], tail number F-GBEC, had first flown on 28 February 1980.&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A300B2-1C F-GBEC Marseille–Marignane Airport (MRS) |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19941226-0 |date=14 November 2015 |website=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===24 December===
On 24 December 1994, at [[Houari Boumedienne Airport]] in [[Algiers]], four armed men boarded Air France Flight 8969 which was due to depart for [[Orly Airport]], [[Paris, France|Paris]] at 11:15&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The men were dressed as Algerian presidential police; they wore blue uniforms with [[Air Algérie]] logos. Their presence originally did not cause any alarm.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Two of the men began inspecting the passengers' passports while one went into the cockpit and the fourth stood guard. Claude Burgniard, a [[flight attendant]], recalled noticing that the "police" were armed and one of them had dynamite showing, which she considered to be unusual as the Algerian police were not normally armed when carrying out checks. The Algerian military felt suspicious on noticing that the Air France flight appeared to have an unauthorised delay, so they began surrounding the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled seeing members of the [[Special Intervention Group]] (GIS), known as "[[ninja]]s," outside the aircraft. Kakachi recalled hearing one of the "police" say "taghut," an Arabic word for "[[infidel]]", upon seeing the GIS men gathering outside the A300; she then realised that the four men on board the plane were terrorists. The four hijackers then revealed that they were not police, but [[mujahideen]] seeking to establish an [[Islamic state]] in Algeria. They had hijacked the aircraft because the national airline Air France was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

The leader, Abdul Abdullah Yahia, already a notorious murderer, and the other three members of the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (Groupe Islamique Armé, or GIA) brandished firearms and explosives and announced their allegiance to the GIA, demanding co-operation from the 220 passengers and 12 flight crew.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The hijackers had [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] assault rifles, [[Uzi]] submachine guns, pistols, homemade [[hand grenade]]s, and two 10-stick [[dynamite]] packs. Later, at one point during the flight, the men placed one pack of dynamite in the cockpit and one pack under a seat in the middle of the aircraft, then linked them with detonator wire.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; They also took the uniforms of the pilots to confuse Algerian army [[sniper]]s.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;
&lt;!--Did Abdul Abdullah Yahia say this next bit to the passengers?--&gt;
{{quote|text=Allah has chosen us to die and Allah has chosen you to die with us. Allah guarantees our success, [[Insha'Allah]].
|author=Abdul Abdullah Yahia&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRHbJCPRhM Zero Hour: Shootout in Marseille]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in particular one called "Lotfi", disliked seeing a lack of adherence to their Islamic beliefs; according to Burgniard, the hijackers objected to men and women sitting together and sharing the same toilets and women having their heads uncovered. Once they had taken control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced the women to cover their heads, including the cabin crew members.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets as head coverings. An elderly Algerian man told the ''[[TF1]]'' network that the hijackers "had a kind of art in their terror. Twenty minutes of relaxation and twenty minutes of torture. You never knew what was next."&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

The men stated over the aircraft's cockpit radio: {{quote|text=We are the Soldiers of Mercy. [[Allah]] has selected us as his soldiers. We are here to wage war in his name.
|author=Abdul Abdullah Yahia&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2008), 1:25 and 2:20 minutes in.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abderrahmane Meziane Chérif, the [[Minister of the Interior]] of Algeria, came to the airport control tower to begin negotiating with the hijackers, who were using the captain to speak for them. They demanded the release of two [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) political party leaders, [[Abassi Madani]] and [[Ali Belhadj]], who were under [[house arrest]]; the FIS was banned in Algeria in 1992. Chérif demanded that the hijackers begin releasing children and the elderly if they wanted to talk to the Algerian government.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; The media began arriving at the airport to cover the crisis.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

At noon, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Alain Juppé]], organised a crisis team, and [[Charles Pasqua]], [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister of France]], met his aides. French Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]] was recalled from his Christmas vacation in [[Chamonix]], France, and other government officials were also summoned from their vacations.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Balladur recollected spending the entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine what was happening and feeling confused. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted to crack down on the terrorists and Balladur himself encountered difficulties discussing the events.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the FIS party leaders.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Two hours into the hijacking, the men told the captain to depart for Paris so that they could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off because the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the plane and the Algerian authorities were blocking the runway with parked vehicles. When the hijackers forced the captain to ask for the boarding stairs to be removed, the Algerian authorities refused, determined not to give in to any of the hijackers' demands. The GIA men announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities followed their orders.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

During the passport check, the hijackers had noticed that one of the passengers on the flight was an Algerian police officer. In order to force the Algerian government to comply with their demands, the hijackers approached the police officer and told him to follow them. Kakachi remembered that the police officer, seated two rows behind her, was hesitant as he did not know what they were going to do.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Several passengers recalled him pleading "Don't kill me, I have a wife and child!"&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; The hijackers shot the police officer in the head at the top of the boarding stairs. The pilots and most of the passengers were not aware at first that the man had been killed. Captain Delhemme recalled that his first contact with the passenger cabin during the hijacking was when a flight attendant, allowed into the cockpit, asked the pilots if they needed anything. According to Delhemme, he asked for a glass of water from the attendant to ease the pilots' parched throats. At this point, the attendant whispered to Delhemme that the hijackers had killed a passenger.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

The Algerian authorities still refused to agree to the hijackers' demands. Burgniard recalled that he and the other occupants began to realise that "things were going wrong" when the hijackers came to collect another passenger.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; They selected 48-year-old Bui Giang To, a commercial attaché at the Embassy of Vietnam in Algeria.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Burgniard described To as "the real foreigner on this plane." She remembered that To was not intimidated by the hijackers and she believed that this attitude upset the hijackers. The Vietnamese diplomat thought he was about to be released because he was a foreigner; instead he was shot dead on the boarding stairs. Delhemme recalled that when the flight attendant next appeared with refreshments, she whispered to him that two passengers, not one, had died.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

The French government wanted to bring French military personnel into Algeria to safely resolve the hijacking, but the Algerian government would not allow foreign military to land on Algerian soil to resolve an Algerian political crisis. Prime Minister Balladur said that he asked the Algerian government "extremely forcefully and urgently" to give permission for the aircraft to take off. He felt that the French government held responsibility for solving the problem as the aircraft belonged to a French airline and almost a third of the passengers were French.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

Seven hours into the hijacking, the cabin was calm but tense; at that point, few of the passengers knew that two people had been killed. It had grown dark outside and the aircraft was surrounded by spotlights. The pilots now attempted to defuse the situation by talking to the hijackers and trying to gain their trust. Delhemme explained that the beginning of a hijacking is violent, so the role of the pilot is to keep the participants calm, "buy time", show the hijackers who the crew are as people, and find out details about the hijackers; then the pilot has to try gaining the trust of the hijackers.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

During the night, the French military authorised its forces to be sent to [[Majorca]], Spain, which was as close to Algeria as was possible without being accused of interfering in the situation.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; At 8&amp;nbsp;pm, [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale]] (GIGN) operatives boarded an [[Airbus A300]] aircraft similar to F-GBEC, the hijacked plane, at a military base in France.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; En route to Majorca, the GIGN operatives were able to familiarise themselves with the A300 in preparation for storming the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; After the GIGN's plane arrived at [[Palma de Mallorca Airport]], the Algerian government made it clear that French forces were not welcome in Algeria.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

===25 December===
Captain Delhemme made a tour of the cabin at about 2&amp;nbsp;am the next morning to check on the situation; he said that the cabin was "calm" during that time. He noticed two of the hijackers asleep on the floor.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; In the morning, French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur flew to Paris.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

New information arrived at the [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] of France in [[Oran]], Algeria, via a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in the GIA: {{quote|We received this information directly from members of the Algerian secret service. And this information was very worrying. The terrorists' true aim was to crash the plane in Paris.|[[Minister of the Interior (France)|French Minister of the Interior]] [[Charles Pasqua]]&lt;ref name="Taylor9"&gt;Taylor (2008), 9 minutes in.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Police confirmed this plan after a raid on a [[safe house]].&lt;ref name="Taylor9"/&gt;

The hijackers released some of the passengers, mainly women with young children and those with severe medical conditions. Over 170 people still remained on board the plane. The hijackers offered to release the remaining Algerian passengers, but the Algerians refused to leave the aircraft. Delhemme recalled that one passenger who was refusing to leave said that he thought the crew would be killed if he did, and Delhemme believes that the passengers' motives were sincere.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; By the end of 25 December, the hijackers had freed a total of 63 passengers.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor625"&gt;Taylor (2008), 6:25 minutes in.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Algerian police used [[night vision]] devices to identify the lead hijacker, who was Abdul Abdullah Yahia.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; The French government sent Yahia's mother to plead for him to release the passengers, in the hope that she could persuade her son to give in,&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; but the tactic backfired. Passenger Kakachi recalled Yahia becoming enraged by this move. At this point the hijackers began targeting the French passengers; there were two staff members of the French Embassy in Algiers on board the flight, a secretary and a chef.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The hijackers forced the chef, Yannick Beugnet, to plead into the microphone. Through Beugnet, they demanded that unless the Algerian government cleared the A300 for takeoff before 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm, they would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw him out of the door. The Algerian passengers assured him that the hijackers were bluffing while the French passengers were demanding that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the 9:30 deadline passed, the hijackers shot the chef and threw his body outside.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Nundy |title=Jet hijackers die as 170 are freed |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/jet-hijackers-die-as-170-are-freed-1390663.html |date=27 December 1994  |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities "See what you get when you play tough?!"&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The airline knew that the chef had been murdered as it was listening in on the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, said in an interview that the airline employees "lived through [the event] with great emotion." Zahida Kakachi recalled Lotfi calmly trying to convert her and another stewardess to [[Islam]], though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage him.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

The French government were informed of the events. Balladur spoke on the telephone to the [[Prime Minister of Algeria]], [[Mokdad Sifi]]; he told him that the French government would hold the Algerian government responsible for the outcome if it did not authorise them to intervene in the situation.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Just before midnight, Balladur told the [[President of Algeria]], [[Liamine Zéroual]], that France was ready to receive the Air France flight.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; As a result of Balladur's demands, 39 hours after the start of the hijacking, Zéroual allowed the aircraft to leave Algiers. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard recalled that everyone was relieved when the aircraft departed because they thought the crisis was over.

There was insufficient fuel on board the plane to reach Paris, because the [[auxiliary power unit]] had been running ever since the hijackers took over the plane, so a refuelling stop was scheduled at [[Marseille Provence Airport]]. Delhemme confronted Yahia to find out whether he planned to blow up the aircraft between Algiers and Marseille. Yahia insisted that the plane would fly to Marseille, take on fuel, then fly to Paris for the press conference; reassured, Delhemme prepared for takeoff. In an interview, Delhemme suggested that the hijackers would probably have said this anyway to prevent the crew from taking action against them. Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in the cockpit, seemed excited and "like kids".&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

===26 December===
The aircraft approached Marseille during the early hours of 26 December. The hijackers did not know that Major [[Denis Favier]]'s [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] squad was already in Marseille,&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; having flown from Majorca to a military base near Marseille, and planned to storm the aircraft while it was in Marseille. The GIGN squad practised entering the A300 before Flight 8969 arrived in Marseille.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Favier explained in an interview that the enemy was arriving in friendly territory, and the power difference would be a key element in the struggle.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The Flight 8969 aircraft landed at 3:33&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

Steward Claude Burgniard said that the hijackers felt that the landing in Marseille was a "magic moment" as they had arrived in France. Burgniard recalled that the airport was dark and that she only saw the lights of the A300 and a car that the A300 followed. The French authorities deliberately led the aircraft away from the terminal and into a remote corner of the airport. By 26 December, the French government had received information stating that the hijackers had planned to attack Paris. Favier planned to appear conciliatory and prolong the negotiations as long as possible. He believed that the hijackers were tired, so he planned to wear them down.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Alain Gehin, the Chief of Police of Marseille, spoke to the group of hijackers in the control tower. Gehin implemented Favier's strategy.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

While using Delhemme to speak for them,&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; the hijackers asked for 27 tonnes of fuel; the aircraft needed approximately 9 tonnes&lt;!--9 from Mayday, 10 from TIME--&gt; to fly to Paris from Marseille. The request indicated to the French authorities that the aircraft was going to be used as a firebomb or to fly the aircraft to an Islamic country sympathetic to the hijackers' cause. Hours later, the authorities received word of the firebomb plot. Passengers who were released in Algiers stated that the A300 had been rigged with explosives. Demolition experts determined that the plane was likely rigged in a way that would cause it to explode.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; [[Charles Pasqua]] said in an interview that the French government had decided that the aircraft was not going to leave Marseille, regardless of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

At around 8:00&amp;nbsp;am, the hijackers demanded that the forces let the aircraft take off by 9:40&amp;nbsp;am. The negotiators delayed the ultimatum by giving the aircraft additional food and water, emptying the toilet tanks, and providing vacuum cleaners. The GIGN operatives servicing the aircraft were disguised as regular airport personnel. They discovered the aircraft doors were not blocked or [[booby trap]]ped.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; The men planted eavesdropping devices while others trained long-range "cannon" microphones on the A300's fuselage and windows.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Favier's group asked the hijackers if they would rather do a press conference in Marseille instead of Paris, since all of the major press is in Marseille. The hijackers agreed to hold a press conference on the A300. The negotiators requested that the front of the aircraft would be cleared for the press conference. In fact, this was to create an area for the GIGN during the storming of the aircraft. Favier explained in an interview that the press conference was an important tactic as it allowed the passengers to be moved to the rear of the aircraft. The hijackers did not realise that the doors of the A300 could be opened from the outside.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

Twelve hours after the A300 arrived at Marseille, the GIGN knew how many hijackers were on board and their location on the aircraft with the help of eavesdropping devices, infrared vision equipment, and "cannon" microphones.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; It intended to wait until sundown to take advantage of the darkness. The occupants of the aircraft were unaware of the GIGN's true motives, and the militants were confused about why the press had not yet arrived. Yahia, frustrated by the absence of the press and sensing the authorities were up to something, ordered the pilot to move the aircraft. Dellemme parked the aircraft at the foot of the [[airport control tower]] and in close proximity to the terminal and other aircraft. An explosion in this position would result in  many more casualties than in the earlier, remote location.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

This was a tactical disadvantage for the GIGN; the positions were based on the aircraft being parked where the French authorities ordered the placement of the A300. When the aircraft moved, the GIGN had to quickly reorganise its forces. Favier placed snipers on the roof so they would have a view of the cockpit. He organised a group of thirty men with three [[Ground support equipment#Passenger boarding steps/stairs|passenger boarding stairs]] to rush the aircraft and take it over. Favier planned to have two teams, each with 11 people, open the rear left and rear right doors of the A300. A third team of eight would open the front right door. The forces planned to isolate the cockpit, with Yahia, from the rest of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

By 5&amp;nbsp;pm, the authorities had not delivered any amount of fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected the youngest member of the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an [[atheist]]. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying "I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.".&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the [[Quran]] on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but "nothing like what seemed to be about to happen."  Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

Once the hijackers noticed the [[airstair]]s moving towards them, they recognised the imminent assault. Through the cockpit window, a hijacker fired upon the airstair containing the forward GIGN team. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, it became apparent that it was elevated too high on the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Written without a source - we need to be sure it was a mistake if we're going to mention it}} After a short delay in repositioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers in the rear of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

Flight attendant Claude Burgniard described the firefight as "the apocalypse". Christophe Morin, a flight attendant, recalled that the GIGN ordered passengers and crew to get down as low as possible with their hands over their heads, hide, and then to not move. Morin described the situation as "violent". He recalled putting his overcoat over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands. Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in "a rather bad spot", so he crouched and made himself "as small as possible." His mind made him believe that his body could stop bullets.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

A few minutes after the beginning of the assault, most of the passengers had escaped. At that point, three of the four hijackers were fatally shot. Delhemme recalled that the cockpit only had himself, the flight engineer, and the last hijacker. Delhemme said that the hijacker could have killed him and his colleagues out of spite, but instead did not. In an interview, Denis Favier explained that there likely was a mutual recognition and "respect" between the hijackers and the hostages. He believes the bonds between the hijackers and hostages helped save lives of passengers and crew in the conflict.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

GIGN commando Philippe Bardelli was leading a column up the front right airstair, as that team was tasked with throwing stun grenades in the cockpit, when a 7.62×39mm bullet from an [[AK-47]] struck his drawn pistol and detonated the cartridges; Bardelli later remarked that his pistol which took the bullet actually saved his life since such AK-47 rounds were able to penetrate the GIGN's helmet visors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBzxzyFhU2w&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining hijacker kept the GIGN at bay for 20 minutes, but he eventually ran out of ammunition and died from a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, the GIGN operatives were not sure which men were the hijackers and how many were still alive, so they considered all male passengers as potentially being hijackers.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The flight engineer, Alain Bossuat, radioed the tower stating that the hijackers were dead and that there were no more left.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; This signaled to GIGN forces that a final clearing of the A300 could begin. Delhemme said that when the forces entered the aircraft, they ordered him to put his hands on his head. Delhemme said that, after the hijacking ordeal had run its course, he refused to leave with his hands on his head and be "punished like a child." Burgniard said that when she saw Bossuat handcuffed, the cabin crew told the forces to let him go as the individual was the flight engineer.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; At 5:35&amp;nbsp;pm, Favier radioed to the tower that the incident was over; the incident unfolded in 54 hours.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

All of the hijackers had been killed. The 166&lt;sup id="fn_a_back"&gt;[[#fn a|A]]&lt;/sup&gt; remaining passengers and crew survived the 20-minute gun battle.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Of the 154&lt;sup id="fn_a_back"&gt;[[#fn a|A]]&lt;/sup&gt; remaining passengers, 13 received minor injuries.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Nine of the 30 GIGN operatives received injuries; of them, one received serious wounds.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Three crew members received injuries.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Delhemme was struck by bullets in his right elbow and thigh.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Bossuat received minor injuries; the dead bodies of two hijackers had shielded Delhemme and Bossuat from gunfire. Borderie, the most seriously injured, fractured his elbow and thigh from the 5 metre (16&amp;nbsp;ft) drop.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Favier said that he determined that the operation was a success since none of the GIGN received fatal injuries. French Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]] said that the events unfolded "exceptionally well."&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
As a result of the damage to the aircraft, the A300 was [[written off]].&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; Several hours after the incident ended, the Armed Islamic Group, which had claimed responsibility for the event, killed four [[Roman Catholic]] priests in retaliation in [[Tizi-Ouzou]], Algeria. Three of the priests were French, while one was Belgian.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

The crew of the A300 and the GIGN forces received high national honours. [[Charles Pasqua]], then the [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], said that throughout the ordeal the crew "rose to the occasion."&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Bernard Delhemme returned to flying and worked for Air France for nine years before retiring. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard said that she "kept seeing the faces" of the three passengers who had been executed; when she received her medal she realised that she had helped save 173 people; this allowed her to mourn and get over the incident. Burgniard said that she does not wear the medal, but that she felt like she deserved it. Burgniard, who also received a message of thanks from the airline, never again worked for Air France. Flight attendant Christophe Morin stopped working for Air France and began to work for a charitable organisation.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

A former militant group leader admitted that the men had planned to detonate the aircraft over the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The militant group never again attempted this plot. Pasqua said that if the militants crashed an aircraft on the Eiffel Tower or the [[Palais de l'Élysée|Élysée Palace]], they would have committed what they would believe to be "an extraordinary feat."&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

Flights between Algiers and Paris are now Flights 1555, 1855, 2155, and 2455 (operating to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] instead of Orly).&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.flightmapper.net/route/Air_France_AF_ALG_CDG Air France flights from Algiers to Charles De Gaulle, Paris.]&lt;/ref&gt; Flight number 8969 is now a [[codeshare]] flight number for [[Delta Air Lines]] flight number 1584 between [[Greater Rochester International Airport]] and [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.flightmapper.net/flight/Air_France_AF_8969 AF8969 schedule. (Air France flight: Rochester -&amp;gt; Atlanta)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passengers and crew==
Most of the passengers were Algerians; 138 of the passengers were Algerian citizens.&lt;sup id="fn_a_back"&gt;[[#fn a|A]]&lt;/sup&gt; A significant number of the passengers were French people leaving Algeria. Captain Bernard Delhemme said that the hijackers, who had extensively planned the operation, did not anticipate that most of the passengers would be Algerians.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The hijackers recited [[Quran]] verses and tried to reassure the Algerian passengers. Witness accounts said that they "terrorised" non-Algerians.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

Jean-Paul Borderie, the co-pilot was looking forward to spending Christmas with his family at their vineyard in Bordeaux. Zahida Kakachi was going to experience a Parisian Christmas; she had wanted to go to Midnight Mass to see what it was like. Christophe Morin was especially anxious to get home. A few months before (over the summer), his brother and sister had both died, so Morin had asked Air France if it was possible for him not to fly during the actual Christmas celebrations, but they had refused his request. He therefore went to work on the flight feeling very reluctant, because he had wanted to be with his parents and family.&lt;ref&gt;Age of Terror: The Paris Plot&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hijackers==
25-year-old Abdul Abdullah Yahia, also known as "The Emir," was a petty thief and greengrocer from the [[Bab El Oued]] neighbourhood of Algiers. The negotiators said that Yahia spoke "approximate" French and always ended his sentences in "[[Insha'Allah]]" ("God willing").&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt; Several passengers said all but one of the hijackers had no beards and closely cropped hair. A woman said that the men "were polite and, correct" and that they "had the determined air of cold-blooded killers." Another passenger said the hijackers "seemed excited, very euphoric" and that they told the occupants that they would teach the French and the world a lesson and show what they were capable of doing.&lt;ref name="Sancton"/&gt;

As the hijacking progressed, the passengers recognised the personalities of the hijackers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled that the crew and passengers gave nicknames to the hijackers "to make things simpler." Yahia, the leader, had given his name, so the passengers called him by that name. According to Burgniard, Lotfi had a "peculiar" character, "was always on a knife edge," and "the most fanatic" and "the most fundamentalist" of the hijackers. Therefore, he received the nickname "Madman" from the passengers. According to Burgniard, Lotfi was the hijacker who insisted that the passengers follow Islamic law. Lotfi found women having their heads uncovered "intolerable," making him very angry. One hijacker did not give his name to the passengers, so they called him "Bill." Burgniard stated that Bill was "a little bit simple" and "more of a goatherd than a terrorist." She said his role as a hijacker was "an error in casting." Burgniard remembered that the occupants wondered why Bill was there and that they saw Bill appearing as if he wondered why he was there, as well. The hijacker nicknamed "The Killer" shot the hostages whom the hijackers had targeted.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The events of Flight 8969 were featured in "The Killing Machine", a [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 2 (2004)|Season 2 (2004)]] episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; (called ''Air Emergency'' and ''Air Disasters'' in the U.S. and ''Air Crash Investigation'' in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatisation was broadcast in the United States with the title "Hijack Rescue"; and with the title "Hijacked" in the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. The captain of Flight 8969, Bernard Delhemme, still feeling under threat after the events, agreed to make his first ever television interview for ''Mayday'' provided he could appear in silhouette. Colonel Denis Favier, then a major who was head of the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] counter-terrorist unit assigned to the flight, also asked for his face to be obscured as members of the public believed that the militants were offering a reward for his assassination.
* The incident was also featured in an episode of the ''[[Zero Hour (2004 TV series)|Zero Hour]]'' television series called "Shoot-Out in Marseille". Using a mix of real footage and dramatic reenactment, it suggests that two of the terrorists were killed by the GIGN snipers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBzxzyFhU2w&lt;/ref&gt;
* A one-hour documentary, episode 3 of the UK [[BBC Two]] television series ''The Age of Terror'', was transmitted on 29 April 2008. This showed an in-depth reconstruction of the hijacking, and included interviews with passengers, crew, GIGN commando, and government official eyewitnesses, including the co-pilot who jumped out of the cockpit window.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; It was stated explicitly that a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] with the GIA terrorists informed the French, but not Algerian,{{Clarify|date=February 2009|contradicts spoken words of Charles Pasqua, see 9 minutes into http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/05/080617_age_of_terror_three.shtml}} authorities that the intention was to use the aircraft as a missile to attack Paris.
* A 2011 French film called ''[[L'Assaut]]'' was made with the collaboration and advice of the GIGN.
* Flight attendant Christophe Morin and passenger Zahida Kakachi co-authored the book ''Le vol Alger-Marseille: Journal d'otages'', recalling the events of the attack and how it had affected their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kakachi |first1=Zahida |last2=Morin |first2=Christophe |date=5 October 2006 |title=Le vol Alger-Marseille: Journal d'otages |trans-title=The Algiers-Marseille Flight: Journal from the Hostages |language=French |location=Paris |publisher=[[Plon (publisher)|Plon]] |isbn=978-2259203753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Alice's Restaurant Massacree'''" (also known as simply "'''Alice's Restaurant'''") is a song by singer-songwriter [[Arlo Guthrie]], released as the title track to his 1967 debut album ''[[Alice's Restaurant (album)|Alice's Restaurant]]''. The song is a satirical, deadpan protest against the [[Draft lottery (1969)|Vietnam War draft]], in the form of a comically exaggerated but essentially true story from Guthrie's own life: he is arrested and convicted of dumping trash illegally, which later leads to him being rejected by the [[draft board]] due to his criminal record of "littering". The title refers to a restaurant owned by one of Guthrie's friends, which plays no role in the story aside from being the subject of the chorus.

Despite its running time of over 18 minutes, it was a hit song, and an inspiration for the 1969 film also named [[Alice's Restaurant (film)|''Alice's Restaurant'']]. The work has become Guthrie's [[signature song]] and he has periodically re-released it with updated lyrics. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or artistically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-028/|title=National Recording Registry Reaches 500|date=March 21, 2018|work=Library of Congress|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The song consists of a protracted spoken [[monologue]], with a constantly repeated fingerstyle [[Ragtime#Historical context|ragtime guitar (Piedmont style)]] backing and light [[percussion mallet#Brushes|brush]]-on-[[snare drum]] percussion (the drummer on the record is uncredited), bookended by a short chorus about the titular diner&lt;!-- note: word "diner" isn't in the lyrics, used here for variation --&gt;. (Guthrie has used the brief "Alice's Restaurant" bookends and guitar backing for other monologues bearing the ''Alice's Restaurant'' name.) The track lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds, occupying the entire A-side of the ''Alice's Restaurant'' album. Due to Guthrie's rambling and circuitous telling with unimportant details, it has been described as a [[shaggy dog story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/booth-reviews/2010/11/song-of-the-day-alices-restaurant-massacree-by-arlo-guthrie/|title=Song Of The Day – "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" by Arlo Guthrie &amp;#124; Booth Reviews|author=Eric Berman|date=|publisher=Chicagonow.com|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guthrie refers to the incident as a "[[wiktionary:massacree|massacree]]", a colloquialism originating in the [[Ozark Mountains]]&lt;ref name="mountain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecu.edu/ncfa/amfolk/mtnlang.html|title=Mountain Language|last=Blanton|first=Linda|date=1989|work=Encyclopedia of Southern Culture|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105213739/http://www.ecu.edu/ncfa/amfolk/mtnlang.html|archivedate=January 5, 2005|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes "an event so wildly and improbably and baroquely messed up that the results are almost impossible to believe". It is a corruption of the word ''[[wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]'', but carries a much lighter and more sarcastic connotation, rather than describing anything involving actual death.&lt;ref name="ozeng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozarque.livejournal.com/26331.html?nojs=1|title=Linguistics; Ozark English; "massacree"|date=October 3, 2004|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

=== Prologue ===
Guthrie explains that his friend Alice owns a restaurant, but that isn't the name of the restaurant, merely the name of the song. He then sings the chorus, which is in the form of a [[jingle]] for the restaurant, beginning "You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant", and continuing with directions to it.

===Part One===
Guthrie then recounts that two years prior, he and a friend spent the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] holiday at a [[deconsecrated]] church that their friends Alice and Ray were using as a home. As a favor to them, Guthrie and the friend volunteered to take their large accumulation of trash to the local dump in their [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Microbus]], not realizing until they arrived there that it was closed for the holiday. Unable to find an appropriate place to dispose of the garbage, they came across a pile of garbage that had previously been dropped down the side of a cliff, and decided to simply add theirs to it.

The next morning, a police officer called, accusing him of dumping based on an envelope with Guthrie's name that he'd found in the garbage. After initially trying to claim that he had merely buried the envelope there, Guthrie confessed to the illegal dumping. He and his friend drove to the police station, hoping in vain to be praised for their honesty, and expecting a verbal reprimand, but they were instead arrested by "Officer Obie", handcuffed, and taken to "the scene of the crime". There several officers collected extensive evidence of the incident, including "twenty-seven 8-by-10 color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was, to be used as evidence against us". The pair were briefly locked up before Alice arrived and got them released, taking them back to the former church with her.

Guthrie and his friend stood trial the next day, but to Obie's disappointment, the judge presiding over the case relied on a [[seeing-eye dog]], rendering the officer's painstaking visual evidence irrelevant. Nonetheless, Guthrie and his friend pleaded guilty, and were fined $50 and required to pick up the garbage. 

===Part Two===
{{Anchor|Group W|group W}}Guthrie then states that the littering incident was "not what I came to tell you about", and describes his subsequent experience before a Vietnam-era draft board. He tried various strategies to be found unfit for military service, including getting drunk the night before so he was hung-over, and attempting to convince the psychiatrist that he was homicidal, which only earned him praise. 

Finally, Guthrie was asked whether he had ever been convicted of a crime. He attempted to fully recount the incident of the "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" and his trial, but was stopped and told to sit with "Group W", those who required a [[moral waiver]] to enlist. The convicts ("mother-rapers... father-stabbers... father-rapers") were initially put off that his conviction had been of "littering", but accepted him when he added "and creating a nuisance". Ultimately he was rejected by the officials – for "bein' a litterbug", as Guthrie puts it – but because they didn't like "[his] kind", his fingerprints were sent to the federal government to keep on record.

=== Epilogue ===
In the final part of the song, Guthrie explains to the live audience that anyone finding themselves in a similar situation should walk into the military psychiatrist's office, sing the opening line from the chorus and walk out. He predicts that a single person doing it would be rejected as "sick", two people doing it in harmony would be rejected as "[[Faggot (slang)|faggots]]", three people doing it would be perceived as "an organization", and fifty people a day would be recognized as "the Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacree Movement". As he continues fingerpicking, he invites the audience to sing the chorus along with him "the next it comes around on the guitar", then chides them for doing it horribly, and challenges them to sing it with him more loudly, as the finale.

== Development ==

Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie performed the song several times live on WBAI in 1966 and 1967, prior to the song's commercial release. The song proved so popular that at one point Fass (who was known for playing songs he liked over and over again in his [[graveyard slot]]) started playing a recording of one of Guthrie's live performances of the song repeatedly;&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt; eventually the non-commercial station rebroadcast it only when listeners pledged to donate a large amount of money.

"Alice's Restaurant" was performed on July 17, 1967, at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in a workshop or break-out section on "topical songs", where it was such a hit that he was called upon to perform it for the entire festival audience. The song's success at Newport and on WBAI led Guthrie to record it in front of a studio audience in New York City and release it as side one of the album, ''Alice's Restaurant'', which was released in October 1967.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/brief-history-alices-restaurant-180967276/ |title=A Brief History of "Alice's Restaurant" |last=Sears |first=David |date=2017-11-20 |website=Smithsonian |access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original album spent 16 weeks on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' album chart, peaking at #29 during the week of March 2, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1968-03-02|title=Top 200 Albums {{!}} Billboard 200 chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; then re-entered the chart December 27, 1969 after the [[Alice's Restaurant (film)|film version]] was released and peaking that time at #63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/arlo-guthrie/chart-history/billboard-200/song/765947 |title=Arlo Guthrie Billboard Chart History |publisher=billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song itself was far too long to be released (or even fit) on a [[single (music)|45 rpm single]], and so never made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (because of this, ''Billboard'' classifies Guthrie as a [[one-hit wonder]] for his later hit, "[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]", without regard to his success with "Alice's Restaurant").&lt;ref&gt;Jancik, Wayne (1997). ''The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after the album came out, Guthrie released "Alice's Rock &amp; Roll Restaurant" as a single—a much shorter (4:43) tune that incorporated the chorus, removed the entire monologue, used a significantly different arrangement, and added extra verses (all of which do little but advertise the restaurant). It peaked at #97 on the ''Billboard'' singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvf.com/Arlo+Guthrie.art |title=Arlo Guthrie Songs ••• Top Songs / Chart Singles Discography ••• Music VF, US &amp; UK hits charts |publisher=Musicvf.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Boston Globe'' (August 26, 2015). Retrieved November 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; When performing the song in later years, Guthrie began to [[Expurgation|change the line to something less offensive]] and often topical: "They'll think you're gay—not that there's anything wrong with that" or "They'll think they're trying to get married in some parts of Kentucky."

After the release of the original album, Guthrie continued to perform the song in concert, frequently revising and updating the lyrical content. In 1969, for instance, he performed a 20-minute rendition of the song which (instead of the original narrative) told a fictional story of how Russian and Chinese military operatives attempted to weaponize "multicolored rainbow [[roach (cannabis culture)|roaches]]" they had found at Alice's restaurant, and the [[Lyndon Johnson Administration|Lyndon Johnson administration]] orchestrated a plan for the nation to defend itself. A recording of this version, given the title "Alice: Before Time Began", was released in 2009 on a CD distributed by Guthrie's [[Rising Son Records]] label; another recording of this version, given the title "The Alice's Restaurant Multicolored Rainbow Roach Affair", has also been released through that record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-arlo-guthrie-tales-of/|title=Music Review: Arlo Guthrie&amp;nbsp;– ''Tales of '69''|author=Richard Marcus|publisher=blogcritics.org|date=2009-08-07|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, Guthrie had removed the song from his regular concert repertoire.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt;

In 1984, Guthrie, who was supporting [[George McGovern]]'s ultimately unsuccessful comeback bid for the Democratic presidential nomination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marano |first=Richard Michael |title=Vote Your Conscience: The Last Campaign of George McGovern |publisher=Praeger Publishers |year=2003 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; revived "Alice's Restaurant" to protest the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s reactivation of the [[Selective Service System]] registrations. This version has not been released on a commercial recording; at least one [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] of this version from one of Guthrie's performances exists. It was this tour, which occurred near the 20th anniversary of the song (and continued as a general tour after McGovern dropped out of the race), that prompted Guthrie to return the song to his playlist every ten years, usually coinciding with the anniversary of either the song or the incident. The 30th anniversary version of the song includes a follow-up recounting how he learned that [[Richard Nixon]] had owned a copy of the song, and he jokingly suggested that this explained the famous [[18½ minute gap|{{frac|18|1|2}}-minute gap]] in the [[Watergate]] tapes. Guthrie re-recorded his entire debut album for his 1997 CD ''[[Alice's Restaurant: The Massacree Revisited]]'', on the Rising Son label, which includes this expanded version. The 40th anniversary edition, performed at and released as a recording by the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]], made note of some parallels between the 1960s and the then-current [[Iraq War]] and [[George W. Bush Administration|George W.

The tour, which features Guthrie's daughter [[Sarah Lee Guthrie]] as the opening act, was scheduled to wrap up in 2020.

==Historicity==
Although some details of the story as told by Guthrie differ from independent sources, or cannot be verified, the people are real, and the events took place more or less as described.

=== Alice and the restaurant ===
The Alice in the song was restaurant-owner '''[[Alice Brock|Alice May Brock]]''' (born c. 1941). In 1964, shortly after graduating from [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Alice used $2,000 supplied by her mother to purchase a deconsecrated church in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], where Alice and her husband '''Ray Brock''' (c. 1928–1979) would live. Alice was a painter and designer, while Ray was an architect and woodworker. Both worked at a nearby private academy, the music and art-oriented [[Stockbridge School]], from which Guthrie (then of the [[Queens]], [[New York City]] neighborhood of [[Howard Beach]]) had graduated.  [[File:stockbridge-alices-restaurant.jpg|thumb|Sign to restaurant]]
Alice Brock operated a restaurant called "The Back Room" in 1966, at 40 [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|Main Street in Stockbridge]], located behind a grocery store and directly underneath the studios of [[Norman Rockwell]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/obituaries/william-j-obanhein-alice-s-restaurant-lawman-69.html William J.

Retrieved October 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (Theresa's Stockbridge Café was last known to occupy the site; the café's sign makes note that the space was "formerly Alice's Restaurant".) After a breakup and abortive reconciliation, Alice divorced Ray in 1968; she went on to launch two more restaurants (a take-out window in [[Housatonic, Massachusetts|Housatonic]] in 1971 and a much larger establishment in [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]] in the late 1970s)&lt;ref&gt;Flint, Andrew (April 23, 2014).

Ray Brock, after the divorce, moved back to his original home of Virginia and died in 1979.&lt;ref name="bfa2014"&gt;Giuliano, Charles (March 27, 2014).

Retrieved October 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Random House published ''The Alice's Restaurant Cookbook'' ({{ISBN|039440100X}}) which featured recipes and hippie wisdom from Alice Brock, as well as photos of Alice and Guthrie, and publicity stills from the movie.&lt;ref&gt;as stated on the front page of  ''Alice's Restaurant Cookbook''.  Some of the pictures have word balloons drawn on them.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Flexi-disc|tear-out record]] was included in the book with Brock and Guthrie bantering on two tracks, "Italian-Type Meatballs" and "My Granma's Beet Jam".&lt;ref&gt;"An Introduction by Arlo Guthrie to Alice's Restaurant Cookbook".  The tracks are credited to Guthrie-Brock.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The church===
{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote,|date=December 2011}}
[[File:Guthrie Center.jpg|thumb|The former church where the story begins, located at 4 Van Deusenville Road in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]]; the building later became the Guthrie Center.]]The church, originally built as the St. James Chapel in 1829, was enlarged in 1866 and renamed Trinity Church. Ray and Alice Brock purchased the property in 1964 and made it their home. Alice sold the building shortly after the film adaptation was released, commenting that the song and film had brought a great deal of unwanted publicity.&lt;ref name=bfa2014/&gt; The building changed ownership several times in the 1970s and 1980s&lt;ref name=center&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guthriecenter.org |title=at the old Trinity Church |publisher=The Guthrie Center |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Guthrie bought the facility in 1991 and converted it to the Guthrie Center, a nondenominational, interfaith meeting place.

The church's exterior is covered with white vinyl siding with the original cornerstone dedications still intact. There are two public entrances, a ramp for guests with disabilities on the side of the building and another consisting of two large wooden doors. The entrance from the side leads directly into the chapel. The front entrance leads into a living room with couches and a kitchen to the left. Bathrooms are located down a straight hallway to the right. Above this hallway is a sign that reads "One God&amp;nbsp;— Many Forms / One River&amp;nbsp;— Many Streams / One People&amp;nbsp;— Many Faces / One Mother&amp;nbsp;— Many Children -Ma".

In the main chapel area is a stage on which Officer Obie's chair sits as a reminder of the arrest. In the rear of the chapel is a set of stairs and a loft area. A set of private rooms in which Alice and Ray once lived remains.

In later years, the Guthrie Center became a [[folk music]] venue, hosting a Thursday evening [[hootenanny]] as well as the Troubadour Concert series annually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Musical guests have included [[John Gorka]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Ellis Paul]], [[Tom Rush]], [[The Highwaymen (folk band)|The Highwaymen]] folk group and, of course, Arlo Guthrie. The Troubadour series helps to support the church's free community lunch program which is held at the church every Wednesday at noon. On Thanksgiving, the church hosts a "Thanksgiving dinner that can't be beat" for the local community. The annual "Garbage Trail Walk", retracing the steps of Arlo and folksinger Rick Robbins (as told in the song), raises money for [[Huntington's disease]] research.

=== The "massacree" incident ===
The incident which Guthrie recounts in the first half of the song was reported in ''[[The Berkshire Eagle]]'' on November 29, 1965. It describes the conviction of Richard J. Robbins, age 19, and Arlo Guthrie, age 18, for illegally disposing of rubbish, and a fine of $25 each, plus an order to remove the trash. The arresting officer was [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]] police chief [[William J. Obanhein]] ("Officer Obie"), and the trial was presided over by Special Judge James E. Hannon. It identifies the incriminating evidence as an envelope addressed to a male resident of Great Barrington (presumably Ray Brock) rather than Guthrie.&lt;ref name=eagle&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3747386/alices_restaurant_massacree/ | title = Youths Ordered to Clean Up Rubbish Mess | newspaper = Berkshire Eagle | date = November 29, 1965 | location = Pittsfield, Massachusetts | page = 25 | via = Newspapers.com | quote = Richard J.

The movie was released in August 1969, a few days after Guthrie appeared at the [[Woodstock Festival]]. A soundtrack album for the film was also released by [[United Artists Records]]. The soundtrack includes a studio version of the "Massacree", which was originally divided into two parts (one for each album side); a compact disc reissue on the [[Rykodisc]] label presents this version of the song in full and adds several bonus tracks to the original [[LP record|LP]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''Antonio Cando Halili''' (February 8, 1946 – July 2, 2018) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] politician who served as the [[Mayor]] of [[Tanauan, Batangas]] from 2013 until his death in 2018. His term as Mayor was controversial due to his methods of dealing with crime and illegal drugs in his city. On July 2, 2018, he was killed during a ceremony after being shot through the chest by an unknown gunman.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/philippine-mayor-antonio-halili-assassinated-ceremony-180702054409964.html|title=Philippine Mayor Antonio Halili assassinated during ceremony|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/philippines-mayor-antonio-halili-tanauan-shot-sniper-drug-suspects-walks-shame/|title=Mayor known for humiliating drug suspects killed by sniper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Prior to pursuing a political career, Antonio Halili was a businessman. He established ANC Halili Group of Companies (ANC HGC), a fully Filipino-owned [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with subsidiaries participating involved in the real Estate, information technology, and private emission &amp; drug industries. ANC HGC runs 60 emission testing centers in Luzon alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Political career==
===Mayor of Tanauan===
Halili became mayor of [[Tanauan, Batangas|Tanauan]], a city in the province of [[Batangas]] in the [[Philippines]], in 2013. During his term as Mayor, he gained notoriety for his treatment of suspected criminals, namely those involved in drug-related crimes. In 2016, Halili became the center of newfound attention after he ordered drug suspects to be paraded around the city, in a campaign that was dubbed the ‘walk of shame’. Suspected criminals were forced to wear cardboard signs that read, “I'm a pusher, don't emulate me”. His campaign was criticized by human rights groups and other politicians. Later on in his term, Halili himself would be accused of having drug related ties, an accusation he denied. In October 2017, he had his supervisory powers over the local police stripped from him.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt;

==Assassination==
{{main|Assassination of Antonio Halili}}
On July 2, 2018, during a flag raising ceremony, Halili was shot by an unidentified sniper. The bullet hit a mobile phone in Halili’s pocket and pierced his chest. Halili’s bodyguards fired back towards a hill where the bullet appeared to have come from. The police searched the hill but failed to find anyone. Bystanders were shocked, and began panicking and taking cover. Halili was driven to the Reyes Memorial Hospital and was declared dead less than an hour after the bullet was fired. Philippine National Police Chief Director General [[Oscar Albayalde]] said that a regional special task group had been convened to investigate the killing, and was considering the suspect parades a motive. One day later, another Philippine Mayor, Ferdinand Bote of [[General Tinio, Nueva Ecija]], was also shot.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/07/01/asia/philippines-mayor-halili-tanuan-shot-intl/index.html?rm=1|title=Philippines mayor shot dead by sniper, police chief says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/ferdinand-bote-killed-assassinated-philippines-mayor-nueva-ecija-antonio-halili-a8429121.html|title=Philippine mayor assassinated one day after another was shot dead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'' This is about the dam in Austin, Texas in 1900; for the dam in Austin, Pennsylvania see [[Austin Dam]]'' 
[[Image:Austin Dam After the Break.jpg|right|300px|thumb|alt=The Great Granite Dam in Austin Texas 1 hour after the break in 1900]]
The '''Austin Dam''', also referred to as '''"The Great Granite Dam" failure''' was a catastrophic dam failure near [[Austin, Texas]] that killed several dozen people in 1900. The destruction of the dam drained the Lake McDonald [[reservoir]] and left the city of Austin without electrical power for a number of months.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At 11.20 a.m. on April 7, when the lake level had reached a height of 11.07 feet above the crest of the dam, the dam gave way at a point . . . about 300 feet from the east end of the dam. Observers [at three different points] all agree in their testimony that it first opened [at the point about 300 feet from the east end of the dam], and as though the mad current had simply pushed its way through the structure. Sooner than it takes to write these words the two sections . . . each about 250 feet long, were shoved or pushed into the lower positions . . . , about 60 feet from their former positions in the dam. There was not the slightest overturning. . . . 
 
As soon as the sections were broken out . . . , the partially pent-up waters rushed through the gap, those held back by [the intact section] producing a strong current in the direction of the power house. This current struck the wall of the power house almost on a level with the floor of the pump room (about 12 feet below the crest of the dam), crushed in all of the windows on the west side, flooded all of the lower stories, and caught and drowned five employees and three small boys. Two of the employees miraculously escaped by climbing through a belt hole in the dynamo room. These workmen were pumping water from the lower portions of the power house."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.utexas.edu/books/landscapes/publications/txu-oclc-2564523/txu-oclc-2564523-003.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent attempts to rebuild the dam were unsuccessful. The dam was finally replaced by the [[Tom Miller Dam]] in the 1940s.

[[File:2018 Baraboo High boys junior prom group.jpg|alt=A group of about sixty boys on courthouse steps. Many have raised their right hand in an apparent Nazi salute. One is displaying a white power hand sign.|thumb|2018 [[Baraboo High School]] boys junior prom group photo]]

On November 11 and 12, 2018, a photograph of a group of [[Baraboo High School]] boys, many with their arms raised in what what looks like the [[Nazi salute]], went viral on social media. The photographer and one student deny there was any political intent or that insult was intended, describing it as innocuous gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/baraboo-high-school-nazi-salute-photo-student-refused-to-participate/|title=Wisconsin student who refused to participate in apparent Nazi salute speaks out|work=CBS NEWS|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fox47.com/news/local/interview-student-in-baraboo-photo-speaks-out|title=Interview: Student in Baraboo photo speaks out|work=Fox47|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another student in the photo, who did not raise his hand, stated that he recognized instantly that his peers were making a Nazi salute.

One of the boys in the photograph, who did not raise his hand, later described experiencing years of racist comments at the school and another, who also did not raise his hand, described enduring years of bullying that went unaddressed by the school administration.

Several meetings have been held or scheduled to address the incident. The controversy broke at a time when, nationwide, hate speech and nationalism are rising, two weeks after eleven Jews were killed in the [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]], and two years after Baraboo school district had reported a steep increase in racial harassment complaints.

==History==
On Sunday November 11, 2018, a group photograph of about sixty male [[Baraboo High School]] students, many giving what looks like a [[Nazi salute]], was shared on social media, and by the next morning it was viral on Twitter.&lt;ref name=Madison.com&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/update-nazi-salutes-appear-to-be-used-in-group-photo/article_3224ea4a-7423-5fc1-b2ca-20159f7129e5.html|title=Parents address school board as Nazi salutes in Baraboo High School prom photo spark outrage online|website=[[Baraboo News Republic]]|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo, which had been taken six months earlier before the junior prom, was condemned by the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum|Auschwitz Memorial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/12/wisconsin-schools-investigation-after-photo-shows-boys-giving-nazi-salute|title=Wisconsin school district investigates photo of boys giving Nazi salute|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; State Senator [[Jon Erpenbach]], and Wisconsin Governor-elect [[Tony Evers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/11/12/us/ap-us-nazi-salute-students-the-latest.html|title=The Latest: Wisconsinites Rally for Love After Nazi Photo|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Wisconsin-district-investigates-boys-apparent-Nazi-salute-500290341.html|title=Wisconsin district investigates boys’ apparent Nazi salute|publisher=WBAY|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it attracted international media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/education/baraboo-student-in-viral-photo-says-he-was-shocked-and/article_7e252871-bee3-5900-981d-47d7a2667ca2.html|title=Baraboo student in viral photo says he was 'shocked and confused' as classmates made Nazi salute, blames imitation|last=Endres|first=Susan|work=Baraboo News Republic|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baraboo School District]] Administrator Lori M. Mueller issued a statement that said in part, "The photo of students posted to #BarabooProud is not reflective of the educational values and beliefs of the School District of Baraboo. The District will pursue any and all available and appropriate actions, including legal, to address."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/District-responds-to-viral-photo-of-Baraboo-students-possibly-making-anti-semitic-gesture-500281042.html|title=Community distressed, divided after photo of Baraboo boys' alleged Nazi salute goes viral|publisher=NBC News 15|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==
The only black student in the photo, who did not salute, says he has heard racist comments for years at the school. "People are making jokes all the time. Like, throughout middle school, people slinging the 'N-word' with the hard 'r'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisn.com/article/baraboo-jonathan-schieber-nazi-salute-photo-racism-bullying-25097169/25097169|title=Black Baraboo student says he's worn headphones to drown out N-word at school|date=2018-11-14|publisher=WISN|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another student in the photo, who did not salute, said on Twitter, "I knew what my morals were, and it was not to salute something I firmly didn't believe in. ... These classmates have bullied me since entering middle school. ... Nothing has been done, and my question is wi(ll) anything ever be done?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/school-launches-investigation-prom-picture-students-appearing-perform-nazi-salute-goes-viral-193759971.html?guccounter=1|title=School launches investigation after prom picture of students appearing to perform Nazi salute goes viral|publisher=Yahoo! News|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The salute==
The photographer is quoted as saying he told the students to give the "hi" sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/B-500883111.html|title="Baraboo Gathers:" Community gathers to heal after photo controversy|publisher=NBC News 15|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student in the front row, Jason Ramos, who did not salute, confirms this and supports another student who says that none of the boys knew what "high sign" meant. Ramos recognized instantly that his peers were making a Nazi salute. Both of these students are sure most of the boys in the photo are not racist and did not mean to make a Nazi salute. He said he believes one student thought it would be funny to give the salute, "One hand shot up and then everyone else went with, so it was kind of like 'monkey see, monkey do.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/education/baraboo-student-in-viral-photo-says-he-was-shocked-and/article_7e252871-bee3-5900-981d-47d7a2667ca2.html|title=Baraboo student in viral photo says he was 'shocked and confused' as classmates made Nazi salute, blames imitation|last=Endres|first=Susan|work=Baraboo News Republic|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The community's response==
In a rally on the steps of the [[Sauk County Courthouse]] (where the photo was taken) on November 12 (the day the image was going viral) young local businesspeople and BHS students chanted "Love, not hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/royals/people-chant-love-not-hate-at-baraboo-rally/vp-BBPDwxR|title=People chant 'love, not hate' at Baraboo rally|publisher=MSN|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large gathering of community members in the Baraboo Civic Center on November 15 to talk about healing and how to create change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbs58.com/news/we-need-to-pause-and-reflect-baraboo-community-looking-for-change-after-nazi-salute-photo|title=‘We need to pause and reflect’: Baraboo community looking for change after Nazi salute photo|publisher=CBS 58|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, Milwaukee's [[Rufus King High School]], which includes Jewish and Muslim students, posted a picture of 50 students and about 15 staff giving the [[American Sign Language]] sign for "I love you" as well as hand signs for [[Peace_symbols#V_sign|peace]] and [[Hand heart|hearts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2018/11/19/milwaukee-high-school-reacts-baraboo-nazi-photo-message-love/2054145002/|title=In response to Nazi salute photo from Baraboo, one Milwaukee high school wants to spread a message of love|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 19, the first in a three-step program of community meetings called Baraboo Gathers was held by the Baraboo School District, city leaders and community members. Between two and three hundred attended, including some students who were in the photo. School District Administrator Mueller "acknowledged bullying is a problem in most school districts, including Baraboo, and said leaders are committed to doing better", and she called for [[Restorative justice|restorative practices]]. "While the photo 'as alleged' is an issue of free speech, she said the students involved need to repair the damage they’ve done." The second meeting in the series is scheduled for November 29. At that meeting the audience will be invited to comment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/baraboo-leaders-take-defensive-apologetic-tone-over-controversial-photo/article_97350467-b375-5b73-9796-d799e179e3c6.html#1|title=Baraboo leaders take defensive, apologetic tone over controversial photo|last=Endres|first=Susan|work=Baraboo News Republic|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/B-500883111.html|title="Baraboo Gathers:" Community gathers to heal after photo controversy|publisher=NBC News 15|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Big Dig ceiling collapse''' occurred on July 10, 2006, when a concrete ceiling panel and debris weighing {{convert|26|shtn|kg}} and measuring {{convert|20|by|40|ft|m}} fell in Boston's [[Fort Point Channel]] Tunnel (which connects to the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Why Did It Fail? | url=http://www.foundationperformance.org/pastpresentations/FowlerPresSlides-10Nov10.pdf | accessdate=2014-04-16 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011826/http://www.foundationperformance.org/pastpresentations/FowlerPresSlides-10Nov10.pdf | archivedate=2014-04-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel fell on a car traveling on the two-lane ramp connecting northbound I-93 to eastbound I-90 in [[South Boston]], killing a passenger and injuring the driver. Investigation and repair of the collapse caused a section of the [[Big Dig]] project to be closed for almost a full year, causing chronic traffic backups.

==Cause==
The east ends of the westbound and eastbound connector tunnels were designed and constructed in the same manner. Both ends of the tunnel were built sooner than the connecting section to allow the D Street bridge above to be constructed sooner. The end sections were not designed to incorporate a hanging ceiling system like that used in the connecting section.

The collapse of the ceiling structure began with the simultaneous [[Creep (deformation)|creep-type]] failure of several [[Anchor bolt|anchors]] embedded in [[epoxy]] in the tunnel's roof slab. Each of the panel's intersecting connection points consists of several individual bolts anchored into the roof slab concrete. The failure of a group of anchors set off a [[chain reaction]] which caused other adjacent connection groups to creep then fail, dropping {{convert|26|shtn|kg}} of concrete to the roadway below.

Numerous problems with this same system of bolts and epoxy in the Ted Williams Tunnel had been previously revealed in a 1998 (Massachusetts) Office of the Inspector General report. Not only were the bolts too short, but the epoxy used to glue the bolts into the concrete was not up to standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sean P. | last=Murphy |author2=Scott Allen | title=Workmanship and design of tunnel are called into question |url=http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/12/workmanship_and_design_of_tunnel_are_called_into_question | publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=4 July 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720004605/http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/12/workmanship_and_design_of_tunnel_are_called_into_question/ | archivedate=July 20, 2006&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Turnpike Authority]] and the [[Federal Highway Administration]], citing the ongoing criminal investigation, refused requests received after the accident to release documents relating to the work conducted along the Seaport connector, including:&lt;ref name=Wedge /&gt;

*Deficiency reports that would have shown problems flagged during initial work on the tunnel.
*Construction change orders that would have shown costly repairs and contract revisions that occurred because of deficiencies.
*Inspection reports and other documents that would show who would have knowledge of the workmanship and building material quality.

One year earlier, US House Representative [[Stephen Lynch (politician)|Stephen Lynch]] also had trouble obtaining records regarding the Big Dig tunnel leaks for the Congress' [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Government Oversight]].&lt;ref name=Wedge&gt;{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Wedge | author2=Casey Ross | url=http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=148110 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715211430/http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=148110 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2006-07-15 | title=From Big Dig officials: Info under wraps | publisher=The Boston Herald | date=2006-07-13 | accessdate=2006-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and response==

After the ceiling collapse, [[Massachusetts Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Thomas Reilly|Tom Reilly]] described the tunnel as a [[crime scene]] and issued subpoenas to the companies and individuals responsible for the tunnel construction and testing. Governor [[Mitt Romney]] returned from a vacation in [[New Hampshire]] to view the condition of the tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jay | last=Lindsay | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/11/reilly_big_dig_collapse_is_crime_scene/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20101230130508/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/11/reilly_big_dig_collapse_is_crime_scene/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2010-12-30 | title=Reilly: Big Dig collapse is crime scene | publisher=boston.com |date=2006-07-11 | accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/localPolitics/view.bg?articleid=148121|title=Mitt’s MIA as bigs dig into tunnel tragedy|last=Atkins|first=Kimberly|date=2006-07-13|work=[[Boston Herald]]|publisher=[[bostonherald.com]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715211417/http://news.bostonherald.com/localPolitics/view.bg?articleid=148121|archive-date= 2006-07-15|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governor ordered connecting roads that lead into the Fort Point Channel Tunnel and several ramps to the westbound section from within the city be closed. These closures caused dramatic overflow congestion throughout the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/13/city_girds_as_connector_shuts_indefinitely/|title=City girds as connector shuts indefinitely|last=Daniel|first=Mac|date=2006-07-13|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[boston.com]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715070504/http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/13/city_girds_as_connector_shuts_indefinitely/|archive-date= 2006-07-15|accessdate=4 July 2017|location=[[Boston]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as motorists sought alternate routes to and from [[Logan International Airport]] and several other key arterial routes. Beyond the difficulties posed within the city, the Fort Point Channel Tunnel and [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] link the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and [[Interstate 93]] to Logan, so this also blocked a key inbound link for airport travelers coming from outside the city, forcing them to seek alternate routes like the [[Callahan Tunnel]] or follow poorly marked detours that wound through the city, often resulting in additional travel times of one hour or more.

The legislature approved the governor's plan to assume oversight of the investigation into the collapse (as Romney had only gained office in 2003, long after any decisions about the construction had been made, he was seen as a good choice for an independent investigator), taking responsibility away from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, and additionally allocating $20&amp;nbsp;million for a "stem to stern" safety review of the Central Artery system. At the request of all the members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] dispatched a six-member civil engineering team to Boston to inspect the accident scene and determine whether a full-scale investigation was warranted.

Safety inspections following the accident identified 242 potentially dangerous bolt fixtures supporting the ceiling tiles in the [[Interstate 90]] connector tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Raja | last=Mishra |author2=Sean P.

The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] released a report on the one-year anniversary of the disaster, that attributed the major cause of the collapse to "[[Creep (deformation)|epoxy creep]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{NTSB|article=Accident Report Ceiling Collapse in the Interstate 90 Connector Tunnel|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HAR0702.aspx|accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 2007, a [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]] Grand Jury indicted epoxy company Powers Fasteners, Inc., on one charge of [[involuntary manslaughter]], with the maximum penalty in Massachusetts being a fine of one thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Casey | last=Ross | url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2007/08/epoxy_company_hit_big_dig_indictment| title=Epoxy company hit with Big Dig indictment | publisher=Boston Herald |date=2007-08-08 | accessdate=4 July 2017}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epoxy used in the D Street portal that failed cost $1,287.60. The cost to redesign, inspect, and repair all of the tunnels after the collapse was $54&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=Modern Marvels|title=Engineering Disaster 21 |year=2007 |publisher=History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political fallout==
On July 13, 2006, the leaders of the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Senate]] President [[Robert Travaglini]] and [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House]] Speaker [[Salvatore DiMasi|Sal DiMasi]], called upon [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Turnpike Authority]] chairman [[Matthew J. Amorello]], who provided oversight of the project, to consider stepping down from his position and accepting a diminished role.&lt;ref name="lesser"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D61E30F937A25754C0A9609C8B63|title=Loose Tunnel Bolts Count In Hundreds, Officials Say|last=Belluck|first=Pam|last2=Zezima |first2=Katie|date=2006-07-14|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|language=English|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Governor Romney and Attorney General Reilly both called for the resignation of Amorello. This stance was supported in editorials in Boston's two major newspapers, the ''[[Boston Herald]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=''Boston Herald'' editorial staff |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/editorial/view.bg?articleid=147940 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714205436/http://news.bostonherald.com/editorial/view.bg?articleid=147940 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-14 |title=Tunnel tragedy was no accident |publisher=Boston Herald |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=''Boston Globe'' editorial staff | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2006/07/12/time_to_go/| title=Time to go | publisher=Boston Globe |date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2006-07-20}}{{Subscription required |via=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, Amorello was presented with a formal list of charges that Romney intended to use to justify Amorello's removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=''Boston Globe''&lt;!--Original page useless.--&gt;|url=http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/25/in_violation_of_your_duty/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516010753/http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/25/in_violation_of_your_duty/|archive-date= 2008-05-16|access-date= 4 July 2017| title='In violation of your duty:' ''Excerpts from Governor Mitt Romney's July 17 letter to Matthew J.

Amorello made an unsuccessful effort to ask the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] to postpone the removal hearing before Romney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrea | last=Estes | url=http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2006/07/25/amorello_failed_at_big_dig_letter_says/| title=Amorello failed at Big Dig, letter says | publisher=Boston Globe | page=B1+ |date=2006-07-25 | accessdate=2006-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2006, after the Supreme Judicial Court rejected his request and shortly before the hearing was to have begun, Armorello announced his intention to resign as Chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority effective August 15, 2006.

Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation [[John Cogliano]] also came under fire after he chose to hire [[Bechtel|Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff]], the company that was responsible for overseeing the original construction of the tunnel, to inspect the repairs.&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Casey|title=Mitt passes buck on Bechtel hiring ; Blames Cogiliano for `mistake'|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/1152362271.html?dids=1152362271:1152362271&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT|accessdate=2011-08-12|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hiring of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff resulted in an inquiry from the [[Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation]].

==Lawsuits==
On November 27, 2006, departing Attorney General Tom Reilly announced that the state would launch a civil suit over the collapse of the ceiling in the Ted Williams Tunnel. The Commonwealth will be seeking over $150&amp;nbsp;million from project manager Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, builder [[Modern Continental|Modern Continental Construction Co.]] and the manufacturer of the epoxy used to hold the ceiling bolts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061127/us_nm/massachusetts_bigdig_dc Mass. to sue Big Dig firms over tunnel accident, ''Reuters'', 2006-11-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney General [[Martha Coakley]] on March 1, 2007 named Paul Ware from [[Goodwin Procter]], a Boston law firm to lead the criminal investigation into whether there is criminal culpability in the Big Dig tunnel collapse. Paul Ware will be appointed as a special assistant attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Coakley tabs private attorney to lead Big Dig criminal probe |url=http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO44760/ |quote=The man chosen to lead the criminal investigation into last summer's deadly Big Dig tunnel ceiling collapse was a prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair and more recently in the disciplinary hearing against former Superior Court Judge Maria Lopez. |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230093853/http://www3.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO44760/ |archivedate=December 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other difficulties with the design and construction of the [[Big Dig#Problems|Big Dig project]], including numerous [[leak]]s, dangerous [[guardrail]]s, and the threat of heavy [[lighting fixture]]s also falling from the ceilings.

The [[Georgia DOT]] found that failure of the same epoxy at fault for the ceiling collapse was also to blame for the 2011 fall of a fenced and lighted covered-walkway structure attached to the south side of the relatively new 17th Street Bridge, which links [[Atlantic Station]] to [[Midtown Atlanta]] over [[Interstate 75/85]]. No injuries occurred in that incident, as the collapse was in the overnight hours, with very little traffic on the freeway.&lt;ref name="11alive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midtown.11alive.com/news/news/98991-midtown-were-all-accountable-says-gdot-about-17th-street-canopy-collapse|title=MIDTOWN &amp;#124; "We're all accountable" says GDOT about 17th Street canopy collapse &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Midtown News|publisher=midtown.11alive.com|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cliff Hanger''''' is the name of two different 1983 [[comic strip]]s, one published in the [[United Kingdom]] and the other in the [[United States]].

==British version==

The British ''Cliff Hanger'' was written and drawn by [[Jack Edward Oliver]]. It first appeared in the 25 June 1983 issue of the British comics magazine [[Buster (comics)|Buster]]. 

Watching a television show called 'Now Get Out of This' (a [[parody]] of [[Now Get Out of That]]), Cliff remarks that he thinks he could get out of everything. This is overheard by the '''Evil Spies''', agents of M.E.S.S. (the Mysterious Evil Spies Society). They tell Cliff that he's now a [[guinea pig]] in their traps, and if he doesn't survive, they'll know the traps will be good enough to use against secret agents.

From then on, the premise of the strip every week would be that Cliff is suddenly transported into a dangerous situation by the spies, using the Atomic Matter Transmitter. Three options would be presented to the readers, who would select one by ticking one of the boxes, and turning to another page to see whether their choice was correct or not. For example, in the first strip, Cliff is stranded on a moving artificial desert island. Just as it's about to hit the shore, the [[Ocean current|current]] changes and Cliff is driven back into the [[shark]] infested sea. The choices were 'Take off his shoe and use it to paddle the island to the shore', 'Pull out the tree and use it as a raft' and 'Climb the tree'. A and B were incorrect- using the shoe as a paddle simply sent Cliff round in circles, and pulling out the tree revealed it was plugging a hole, causing the island to sink. The correct answer was C, as Cliff's weight caused the tree to bend over onto the shore, lifting Cliff to safety.

The strip featured several minor background details that would occur in every issue, including a box with a handle, a plaster, the word '[[Acme Corporation|Acme]]', an arrow with another (backwards facing) arrow inside it, a [[warthog]], the initials 'JEO', a [[worm]], and a sign saying "Abolish Tuesdays". A running gag would feature one of the Evil Spies' constant wondering why his counterpart would frequently call him "Ray" even though that wasn't his name, when in fact he was simply referring to one of the gadgets ("Fire the Transporter Ray!").
Another thing of note is that Cliff's jumper often featured the strip number on it, starting with a "1" in the first, and going on well into the hundreds at the end. Over the years, several continuous storylines emerged featuring parodies of popular film and television series of the day, including [[James Bond]], the [[Star Wars]] Trilogy, [[Back to the Future]] and [[List of Transformers TV series|Transformers]]. The strip ended in 1987, replaced by [[Vid Kid]].

However, as Buster moved into the 1990s, the amount of reprints started to dramatically increase, and several old strips began to reappear. Cliff Hanger was one of these, though as J. Edward Oliver was still working for the comic, he was able to turn the originally black and white pages into full colour. With most of the readers unaware that these were reprints, this gave the impression that they were brand new. In February 1998, when the strips started being reprinted for a third time, rather than continue to advertise them as new, the '''Cliff Hanger Classic''' strand was started. Here there would be an afterword at the bottom of the strips, written by Jack, featuring factual information like the original issue dates, background details explained, the most popular television programmes of that week, or the top 5 of that week's [[UK Singles Chart]].

By 1999, virtually the entire comic featured reprints. Because of this, J. Edward Oliver decided to draw one final strip, which appeared in issue 118/99, dated 7–21 July 1999 (the comic had become a fortnightly publication in 1995). Finding the Evil Spies in danger, all three options led to the conclusion that the Evil Spies would never trap Cliff again (if Cliff called the police, the spies would be arrested, if Cliff helped them out, they would stop trapping Cliff as a gesture of thanks, etc.). This issue also featured the final appearance of 'b-mail', the name used at the time for the Letters Page (which Jack also wrote). Cliff's final appearance was in a cameo appearance in the last page of Buster's final issue, which occurred half a year later. Explaining how all the characters ended, and once again drawn by J. Edward Oliver, Cliff was seen mourning the passing of Bernie Banks (the lead character in [[Memory Banks (comic strip)|Memory Banks]], another Buster strip) who had apparently forgotten how to breathe. Symbolising that this was indeed the final issue, his jumper carried the word 'END'.

==American version==
The American ''Cliff Hanger'' was written by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] with artwork by [[Al Williamson]].  The title character was a swashbuckling adventurer who crashlands in an unnamed jungle region in the late 1930s and finds himself in a mysterious plot involving a secret research facility.

A '''Commemoration ball''' is a formal [[Ball (dance)|ball]] held by one of the colleges of the [[University of Oxford]] in the 9th week of [[Trinity Term]], the week after the end of the last Full Term of the academic year, which is known as "Commemoration Week". Commemoration balls are held by different colleges each year, following a cycle by which each college holds a ball every three years.&lt;ref&gt;Balsdon, J.P.V.D.: ''Oxford Life'', page 240. Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration Week is so known because of the ceremonies in commemoration of the benefactors of the university that are held then, namely the Commemoration Day sermon formerly held (until 2006) on the Sunday, and the [[Encaenia]] ceremony (where the annual Creweian Oration in honour of benefactors is given) and garden party on the Wednesday of that week. Commemoration Week was formerly one of two occasions when balls were traditionally held, the other being Eights Week, the 5th week of Trinity term when the [[Summer Eights]] rowing races occur. Eights balls are nowadays comparatively rare.

==Definition==

There is no formal definition of a Commemoration ball, but the usual Oxford convention is to refer only to the larger, triennial balls as Commemoration balls. The dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during Commemoration Week that they call summer balls or parties rather than Commemoration balls. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]]. [[Merton College]] holds a triennial winter ball, of which the next will be in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merton College Winter Ball|url=http://mertonball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent and upcoming balls==

In the past, Commemoration balls were held "night after night"&lt;ref&gt;Balsdon, J.P.V.D (supra)&lt;/ref&gt; by different colleges during Commemoration Week. With many colleges now holding smaller annual summer balls, Commemoration balls are now held by only some of the larger colleges, who still follow the traditional triennial cycle. [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] hosts a ball in the first year of the three-year cycle, and until recently [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] also did. However [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] cancelled their ball in 2015 at the last minute downgrading to a smaller affair. Currently, in the second year, there are Commemoration balls held by [[New College, Oxford|New College]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]]. In the third year, there are now four colleges with this honour ([[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]], [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], [[St. John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]]).

The 2005 Christ Church Commemoration ball was the first to be held by that college for fifteen years because of an incident at the 1990 ball that led to the Governing Body suspending the ball and replacing it with an annual summer party until 2005. Until 1990 the three great Oxford choral foundations of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] (first year), [[New College, Oxford|New College]] (second year) and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] (third year) held their "white tie" Commemoration Balls in consecutive years on a triennial basis, each being widely regarded as the most prestigious ball being held in Oxford in that year, but the 1990 incident at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] upset the tradition as various other colleges claimed [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]'s (third year) slot, and continue to do so after the Christ Church Ball was reinstated in 2005. The cancellation of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]'s (first year) Commemoration Ball in 2015, and its reinstatement in the "[[New College, Oxford|New College]]" (second) year of 2016, completed the break with tradition. 

In 2013, Balliol College held a Commemoration ball to mark the 750th Anniversary of the College's foundation, the first Commemoration Ball at Balliol since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balliol 750th Anniversary Commemoration Ball|url=http://balliol750.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213010121/http://www.balliol750.co.uk/|archivedate=13 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the commemoration ball hosted by Worcester College on 27 June 2014 was the highlight of celebrations to mark the college's tercentenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thetercentenaryball.co.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904030635/http://thetercentenaryball.co.uk/ |archivedate=4 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparisons between the Great Recession and the Great Depression''' explores the experiences in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

On April 17, 2009, head of the IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression.  "The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today."  The [[IMF]] pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronized by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Evans |first=Ambrose |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5166956/IMF-warns-over-parallels-to-Great-Depression.html |title=IMF warns over parallels to Great Depression |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief economist of the IMF, Dr. [[Olivier Blanchard]], stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. "Long-term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the US, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression." The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the [[economic inequality|wealth gap]] reached such skewed extremes was in 1928-1929.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph (UK), 2010 Sept. 14, "IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis: America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned," https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We've frightened consumers to the point where they imagine there is a good prospect of a Great Depression. That certainly is not in the prospect.

Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] predicted a series of depressions in his ''[[The Return of Depression Economics]]'' (1999), based on "failures on the demand side of the economy." On January 5, 2009, he wrote that "preventing depressions isn't that easy after all" and that "the economy is still in free fall."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html | work=The New York Times | title=Fighting Off Depression | first=Paul | last=Krugman | date=2009-01-05 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Krugman explained that a major difference in this situation is that the causes of this financial crisis were from the [[shadow banking system]]. "The crisis hasn't involved problems with deregulated institutions that took new risks... Instead, it involved risks taken by institutions that were never regulated in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/business/fp/Great+Depression/1388627/story.html |title=Not the Great Depression |publisher=Ottawacitizen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322021337/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/fp/Great%2BDepression/1388627/story.html |archivedate=March 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2009, NYU economics professor [[Nouriel Roubini]] said that the crisis was the worst since the Great Depression, and that without cooperation between political parties and foreign countries, and if poor fiscal policy decisions (such as support of [[zombie bank]]s) are pursued, the situation "could become as bad as the Great Depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=6932460 |title=Roundtable: Nationalizing the Banks - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 27, 2009, Roubini expressed a more upbeat assessment by noting that "the bottom of the economy [will be seen] toward the beginning or middle of next year."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/26/AR2009042601517.html 'I Am Not Dr. Doom'], Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2009 [[Vernon L. Smith]] and Steven Gjerstad offered the hypothesis "that a financial crisis that originates in consumer debt, especially consumer debt concentrated at the low end of the wealth and income distribution, can be transmitted quickly and forcefully into the financial system. It appears that we're witnessing the second great consumer debt crash, the end of a massive consumption binge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gjerstad |first=Steven |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123897612802791281 |title=Steven Gjerstad and Vernon Smith Explain Why the Housing Crash Ruined the Financial System but the Dot-com Collapse Did Not - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-04-06 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final press conference as president, [[George W. Bush]] claimed that in September 2008 his chief economic advisors had said that the economic situation could at some point become worse than the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/12/raw-data-transcript-bushs-white-house-press-conference/ |title=George W.

A [[tent city]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]] was described as "images, hauntingly reminiscent of the iconic photos of the 1930s and the Great Depression" and "evocative Depression-era images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/#29603738 |title=NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams: News and videos from the evening broadcast NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams: News and videos from the evening broadcast- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austrian School of economics]] view is that the size of a bust is based, at least in part, on the size of the preceding credit boom. A check of debt levels prior and during the Great Depression shows debt levels prior to the Great Depression at about 200% of GDP, with a rise to about 300% due to massive government intervention to combat the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/10/slouching_toward_the_1930s.html |title=Immediately prior to the Great Depression US debt was about 200% of GDP.

==In the United Kingdom==
On 10 February 2009, [[Ed Balls]], [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]] of the [[United Kingdom]], said that "I think that this is a financial crisis more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s and we all remember how the politics of that era were shaped by the economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7880189.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; Recession 'worst for 100 years' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 24 January 2009, Edmund Conway, Economics Editor for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', had written that "The plight facing Britain is uncannily similar to the 1930s, since prices of many assets – from shares to house prices – are falling at record rates [in Britain], but the value of the debt against which they are held remains unchanged."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Conway |first=Edmund |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/4326894/Britain-on-the-brink-of-an-economic-depression-say-experts.html |title=Britain on the brink of an economic depression, say experts |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Daily Mail'' Circuit of Britain air race''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] cross-country [[air race]] which took place from 1911 until 1914,  with prizes donated by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper on the initiative of its proprietor, [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]. It was one of [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|several races and awards]] offered by the paper between 1906 and 1925.

The 1911 race took place on 22 July and was a {{convert|1010|mi|km}} event with 11 compulsory stops and a circular route starting and finishing at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.
The winner was [[Jean Louis Conneau|Jean Conneau]] in a [[Blériot XI]] who took 22 hours, 28 minutes to complete the course, an average speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and received the first prize of £10,000. The runner up was [[Jules Védrines]] in a [[Morane-Borel monoplane]]  with [[James Valentine (aviator)|James Valentine]], in a [[Deperdussin 1910 monoplane|Deperdussin]], third.

The 1913 race was for British seaplanes and had a first prize of £5,000.  Only one aircraft started the course; it was damaged when landing near [[Dublin]], and did not complete the course.

The 1914 race, also offering a prize of £5,000, was to have been held between 1 and 15 August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200518.html The ''Daily Mail'' £5,000 Prize][[Flight International|''Flight'']], 15 May 1914&lt;/ref&gt; It was cancelled due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]].

==1911 competition==
[[File:1911-circuit of Britain-competitors.png|thumb|The competing aircraft]]
The 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain was a contest for the fastest completion of a course around Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Times39637" /&gt; The proprietors of the Daily Mail offered a £10,000 prize to any aviator to complete an approximately 1,000 miles circuit of Britain in the shortest time.&lt;ref name="Times39637" /&gt; The contest was run by the [[Royal Aero Club]] and was held between 22 July 1911 and 5 August 1911.  Following the success of the £10,000 competition for the [[1910 London to Manchester air race]], the editor announced that a further £10,000 prize would be awarded, it would either be between London and Edinburgh and return or London and Paris and return.&lt;ref name="Flight1911-1" /&gt;  It was decided that the competition would be a tour round Great Britain and a committee of the Royal Aero Club was formed to set the rules and organize the competition on behalf of the Daily Mail.&lt;ref name="Flight1911-1" /&gt; For an entrance fee of £100 the event was open to all licensed aviators, and as well as the Daily Mail prize a number of smaller prizes were also offered.&lt;ref name="Flight1911-1" /&gt; The circuit was to start and finish at [[Brooklands]], and the competitors had to land  at [[Hendon]], [[Harrogate]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Stirling]], [[Glasgow]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]], [[Exeter]], [[Salisbury]] and [[Brighton]].&lt;ref name="Flight1911-1" /&gt; Four competitors completed the course, the first and winner of the prize was the Frenchman Lieut [[Jean Louis Conneau]], flying under the name of André Beaumont.&lt;ref name="Flight1911-2" /&gt;

Entrants included the [[Cody Floatplane|Cody Waterplane]], the [[Radley-England waterplanes|Radley-England Waterplane]] and the [[Sopwith 1913 Circuit of Britain floatplane|Sopwith Circuit of Britain floatplane]].
Cody was killed during a test flight of his design on 7 August when his aircraft broke up in flight, and the Sopwith, flown by [[Harry Hawker]] with [[Harry Kauper]] as passenger, was the only aircraft to start; it retired after being damaged in an emergency landing near [[Dublin]] having completed about two-thirds of the course. Hawker was given a prize of £1,000 for his effort.

==Overview==
DigiTour Media produces live events and unique content that features some of the most popular acts on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/02/18/meridith-valiando-is-bringing-youtube-to-concert-halls |title=Meridith Valiando Is Bringing YouTube To Concert Halls |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DigiFest NYC, a full-day festival property owned by DigiTour, is typically held on the first Saturday of June in New York City.&lt;ref name="fanlala1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fanlala.com/news/digitour-coming-your-city |title=DigiFest NYC is Kicking Off the DigiTour! |publisher=Fanlala.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the acts at DigiTour events do not get their music played on the radio yet continually sell out DigiTour's multiple events with their tens of millions of fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |url=http://nymag.com/news/media/internet-fame/intro-2014-4/ |title=The Weird World of Internet Fame - New York Magazine |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dolores Della Penna''' (December 13, 1954 – July 12, 1972) was a school girl from [[Philadelphia]] who was [[torture]]d, murdered by dismemberment, and [[Decapitation|beheaded]] in the [[Kensington, Philadelphia|Kensington]] neighborhood in July, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gory Killing of '72 Solved, Sources Say Arrests Sought In Case That Obsessed Police |author= |first=Robert J. |last=Terry |authorlink= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url= |format= |agency= |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=July 10, 1996 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate= |language= |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mauryzlevy.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/dead-end-at-toms-river-a-bizarre-murder-mystery/|title=Dead End at Toms River: A Bizarre Murder Mystery|date=2011-02-02|website=Maury Z.

==Disappearance==
Shortly before midnight on July 11, 1972, Della Penna was abducted from her home in Philadelphia. Witnesses later informed the police that they had seen her beaten and dragged, while she was unconscious, into a car. Della Penna's [[torso]] and arms were later located in [[Jackson Township, New Jersey]]. Her legs were found in adjacent [[Manchester Township, New Jersey]]. Her head was never recovered and her murder remains unsolved.

== Investigation and aftermath ==
Her fingertips had been severed from her hands to prevent the police from identifying her. Their reports state that Della Penna was killed by drug dealers who thought that her boyfriend had stolen drugs from them. The crime remains unsolved, and is hotly debated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mja--inc--investigations.webs.com/apps/blog/show/44272039-unsolved-homicides-missing-person-cases|title=UNSOLVED HOMICIDES &amp; MISSING PERSON CASES|website=Missing Persons &amp; Unsolved Crimes &amp; Doe's|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act passed in 2012 by the Pakistani Senate defines domestic violence as including, “all acts of gender based and other physical or psychological abuse committed by a respondent against women, children or other vulnerable persons…”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.af.org.pk/Important%20Courts'%20judgement/Women%20protection%20against%20domestic%20violence%20bil%2013pages.pdf|title=Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act|last=|first=|date=2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition then further specifies assault, attempt at assault, criminal force, criminal intimidation, emotional, psychological, and verbal abuse, harassment, stalking, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and economic abuse as some of the actions that fall under domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Statistics ===
An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled.&lt;ref name="Hansar2" /&gt;  Lisa Hajjar, an Associate Professor at the [[University of California]], describes abuse against women in Pakistan as "endemic in all social spheres".&lt;ref name="Hajjar"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Rights and Islamic Family Law: Perspectives on Reform|last=Hajjar|first=Lisa|publisher=Zed Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1842770955|page=265|chapter=Domestic Violence and Sharía: A Comparative Study of Muslim Societies in the Middle East, Africa and Asia|editor=Lynn Welchman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[observational study]] published in the ''Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences'' based on a [[convenience sample]] of 218 women in the gynecology wards of three hospitals, 97% of the interviewed women said they had been victims of some form of assault, ranging from verbal abuse or threatened, to being subjected to beatings [[Rape in Pakistan|or non-consensual sex]].&lt;ref name="Shaikh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=Masood Ali|year=2003|title=Is domestic violence endemic in Pakistan: perspective from Pakistani Wives|url=http://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/janmar03/article03.pdf|journal=Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=19|issue=1|pages=23–28}} Cited in: {{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence|last=Hanser|first=Robert D.|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0415969680|edition=1st|page=211|chapter=Cross-cultural examination of domestic violence in China and Pakistan|editor=Nicky Ali Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the United Nations found that 50% of married women have experienced sexual violence and 90% have been psychologically abused.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasrullah|first=Muazzam|last2=Haqqi|first2=Sobia|last3=Cummings|first3=Kristin|year=2009|title=The epidemiological patterns of honour killing of women in Pakistan|url=|journal=European Journal of Public Health|volume=19|issue=2|pages=193–197|via=|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckp021|pmid=19286837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by the Pakistan Nation Women's Division and Zakar et al. confirmed these statistics of high percentages of domestic violence in Pakistani households.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Types of abuse==

=== Physical violence ===

==== Dowry deaths ====
[[Dowry death]]s have been described by the [[United Nations]] as a form of domestic violence in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Van Wormer" /&gt; Women are often attacked and murdered if their in-laws deem their [[dowry]] to have been insufficient.&lt;ref name="Pickup"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ending Violence Against Women: A Challenge for Development and Humanitarian Work|last=Pickup|first=Francine|publisher=Oxfam|year=2000|isbn=978-0855984380|edition=|page=91|author2=Suzanne Williams|author3=Caroline Sweetman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst dowry-related violence, [[bride burning]]s, also known as "stove deaths",&lt;ref name="Terzieff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/021027/pakistans-fiery-shame-women-die-stove-deaths|title=Pakistan's Fiery Shame: Women Die in Stove Deaths|last=Terzieff|first=Juliette|date=October 27, 2002|newspaper=Women's eNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; are widely reported. In 1988 a survey showed that 800 women were killed in this manner, in 1989 the number rose to 1100, and in 1990 it stood at 1800 estimated killings.  According to the Progressive Women's Association, such attacks are a growing problem and, in 1994 on [[International Women's Day]], announced that various NGOs would join to raise awareness of the issue.&lt;ref name="Rappaport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers, Volume 1|last=Rappaport|first=Helen|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=978-1576071014|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newspapers in [[Lahore]] in a six-month period (1997) reported on average 15 attacks a month.&lt;ref name="Jilani"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=QWUKUF1MAu8C&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Violence, Law and Women's Rights in South Asia|last=Jilani|first=Hina|publisher=Sage|year=2004|isbn=978-0761997962|page=161|chapter=Violence against Women: The Legal System and Institutional Responses in Pakistan|author2=Eman M. Ahmed|editor=Savitri Goonesekere|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's eNews]] reported that 4,000 women had been attacked in this manner in [[Islamabad]]'s surroundings over an eight-year period, and that the average age range of victims was between 18 and 35, with an estimated 30 percent being pregnant at the time of death.&lt;ref name="Terzieff" /&gt; The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that about four women are killed in this manner every day, by either family members or husbands.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Sushma|date=June 2000|title=Domestic Violence Against Women and Girls|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/digest6e.pdf|journal=Innocenti Digest|page=7|issn=1028-3528|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shahnaz Bukhari]], who runs the [[Progressive Women's Association]] in Islamabad, has said of such attacks: "Either Pakistan is home to possessed stoves which burn only young housewives, and are particularly fond of genitalia, or looking at the frequency with which these incidences occur there is a grim pattern that these women are victims of deliberate murder."&lt;ref name="Terzieff" /&gt;

==== Acid attacks ====
[[Acid throwing|Acid attacks]] in Pakistan came to international attention after the release of a documentary by [[Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy]] called ''[[Saving Face (2012 film)|Saving Face]]'' (2012).&lt;ref name=Rodriguez /&gt; According to Shahnaz Bukhari, the majority of these attacks occur in the summer when acid is used extensively to soak certain seeds [[Seed#Inducing germination|to induce germination]].&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Sahar|title=Acid attack victim demands justice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3097469.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=July 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various reasons have been given for such attacks, such as a woman dressing inappropriately or rejecting a proposal of marriage. The first known instance of an acid attack occurred in [[East Pakistan]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=Weightman&gt;{{cite book|last=Weightman|first=Barbara A.|title=Dragons and Tigers: A Geography of South, East, and Southeast Asia|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470876282|edition=3rd|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], up to 150 attacks occur every year. The foundation reports that the attacks are often the result in an escalation of domestic abuse, and the majority of victims are female.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|title=Pakistan offers little justice for victims of acid attacks|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/29/world/la-fg-pakistan-acid-attacks-20120529|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Honour killing ====
A recent report noted that one in five homicides in Pakistan are attributed to [[Honor killing|honour killings]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobson|first=Roger|year=2009|title="Honour killings" are a public health problem for Pakistan|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=338|pages=739|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of such honour killings that have been reported are around 2,000 killings every four years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Overall, out of all homicides of both men and women in Pakistan, honour killings of women constitute 21%.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moreover, the perpetrator in most honour killings is the husband.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One study found as high as 92% of all honour killings are committed by the spouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The highest occurring reason in spousal honour killings was alleged extramarital affairs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Much of the data has been collected by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan through newspaper reports, however, it is clear there needs to be more systematic research by a health agency is needed to assess this public health crisis and effectively plan for solutions as many cases go unreported.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another analysis of this research states that a possible explanation of the high rate of honour killings towards married women could be attributed to the generally high statistics of domestic violence in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Psychological abuse ===
Psychological abuse generally includes yelling, insulting, controlling behaviors, and threatening. In a study by Zakar et al., of 373 randomly selected married women of reproductive age interviewed in Pakistani hospitals, 60.8% reported as current victims of severe psychological violence with 15% having been victims in the past.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The percentage of women going through current psychological violence far surpassed the percentages of women going through current sexual (27.3%) and physical (21.7%) violence. Moreover, more than half of these participants, 54%, reported being currently in a poor state of mental health.

==Factors==
[[File:Smile of Poverty.jpg|thumb|A young girl in a rural area of the Sindh province of Pakistan is selling these baskets her family has made for a living.]]

=== Poverty ===
Associated with poverty is illiteracy and social stigma against domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Dawn: factors 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Poverty, illiteracy termed causes of domestic violence|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2006/03/04/nat41.htm|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=3 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of an education due to financial reasons accompanies a lack of awareness about women’s rights.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bibi|first=Seema|last2=Ashfaq|first2=Sanober|last3=Shaikh|first3=Farhana|last4=Qureshi|first4=Mohammad|year=2014|title=Prevalence, instigating factors and help seeking behavior of physical domestic violence among married women of Hyderabad, Sindh|url=|journal=Pakistani Journal of Medicine Science|volume=30|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because mental health illiteracy is especially widespread in low-income areas, many women to not get appropriate treatment for the after effects of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Patriarchalism ===
Another reason given for abuses is [[Patriarchal society|patriarchalism]] in Pakistani society, which marginalizes women’s role.&lt;ref name="Zaman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Family, Law and Politics: Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: 2|last=Zaman|first=Habiba|publisher=Brill|year=2004|isbn=978-9004128187|page=124|editor=Suad Joseph|editor2=Afsaneh Najmabad}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Traditional society|traditional societies]], a man is considered to have the right to physically beat his spouse on his wish.&lt;ref name="Van Wormer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Wormer|first=Katherine|title=Human Behavior and the Social Environment, Macro Level: Groups, Communities|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199740574|edition=2nd|author2=Fred H. Besthorn|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rahel Nardos, it is "the dual constructs of women as the property of men and as the standard-bearers of a family's honour set the stage for culturally sanctioned forms of violence".&lt;ref name="Hassan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nardos|first=Rahel|title=Overcoming Violence Against Women and Girls: The International Campaign to Eradicate a World-wide Problem|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0742525009|chapter=Cultural, Traditional Practices and Gender-Based Violence|pages=87–88|author2=Michael L. Penn|author3=Mary K. Radpour|author4=William S. Hatcher|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=yfpCY3PdpDoC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, women perpetuate patriarchalism and domestic abuse especially in regard to mothers-in-law.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roomani|first=Fahad|last2=Tayyab|first2=Faiza|last3=Kamal|first3=Nudrat|last4=Siddique|first4=Kashif|year=2016|title=Role of Women in Perpetuating Violence against Women: Case Studies of Domestic Violence Victims|url=|journal=Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences|volume=36|pages=1185–1195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Many women are expected to be homemakers and to perform key household duties, however, if a woman is not performing her duties by her mother-in-law's standards, the mother-in-law may seek to punish the woman through her son.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In analysis of data from 3,867 married or previously married women from the 2012 - 2013 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, association was found between the intergenerational transfer of spousal violence and cultural views of women.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aslam|first=Syeda|last2=Zaheer|first2=Sidra|last3=Shafique|first3=Kashif|year=2015|title=Is Spousal Violence Being "Vertically Transmitted" through Victims?

This idea is enforced by a study done of 759 Pakistani women between the ages of 25 and 60 years old in which 27% admitted they had never told anyone of the spousal violence they had endured or were currently enduring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Tazeen|last2=Mogren|first2=Ingrid|last3=Krantz|first3=Gunilla|year=2013|title=Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Effects: A Population-Based Study among Married Women in Karachi, Pakistan|url=|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine|volume=20|pages=131–139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child marriage ===
[[File:Women_and_girls_in_Qamber,_Shadadkot,_north-west_Sindh,_Pakistan_(8406155976).jpg|thumb|Women and girls in Qamber, Shadadkot, north-west Sindh, Pakistan (8406155976)]]Defined as marriage before the age of 18 years, child marriage is widespread in Pakistan and linked to spousal violence.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasrullah|first=Muazzam|last2=Zakar|first2=Rubeena|last3=Zakar|first3=Muhammad|year=2014|title=Child Marriage and Its Associations With Controlling Behaviors and Spousal Violence Against Adolescent and Young Women in Pakistan|url=|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=55|issue=6|pages=804–809|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.06.013|pmid=25123525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child marriage occurs most often in rural and low-income households where education is minimal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 reported that 47.5% of currently married women aged 15 to 24 had been married before the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Moreover, of those child marriages, one-third of those women reported spousal violence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Marriages within the extended family ===
[[Consanguinity|Consanguineous]] marriages, or those within blood relations such as first and second cousins, are considered marriages in ''biraderi,'' or brotherhood, within many Pakistani subcultures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=Masood|year=2016|title=Domestic violence in consanguineous marriages - findings from Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2012-13|url=|journal=Journal of Pakistan Medical Association|volume=66|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on reported research, about two-thirds of all Pakistani marriages are within families.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Analysis of a Pakistani Health Demographic Survey from 2012 to 2013 showed that women in consanguineous marriages are more likely to face psychological domestic abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, findings in this study also reported the prevalence of domestic violence within the larger Pakistani population as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Increased urbanization ===
Another factor given for the rise in domestic violence has been due to increased [[urbanization]]. As people move from villages and increasingly live apart from an extended family, assaults are less likely to be prevented by the intervention of family members, who in past times often intervened in domestic conflicts.&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;{{cite book|title=India and Pakistan: The First Fifty Years|last=Weiss|first=Anita M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0521645850|page=146|chapter=Pakistan: Some progress, sobering challenges|editor=Selig S. Harrison|editor2=Paul H. Kreisberg|editor3=Dennis Kux}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, women who move cities or areas after marriage away from their respective family are more at risk for domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These women are left without parental or familial support as the only contacts they have are now limited to their husband and husband's family.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Violent spousal relationships are perpetuated by isolation of the victim and lack of social support.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Impact on women ==
=== Physical and psychological health outcomes ===
Domestic violence leads to increased risk towards certain health outcomes like major depression, dysthymia, conduct disorder, and drug abuse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moreover, because women are primary caretakers in Pakistan, children also face increased risk for depression and behavioural problems.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Zakar et al. found in their study that of those interviewed (373 women from Pakistani hospitals) including women who had experienced severe domestic violence, 54% reported poor current mental health. Associated with this self-reported statistic of women in a poor state of mental health was also a high prevalence of mental health disorders with anxiety and depression being the most common.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In particular, physical violence has long-term, negative psychological impacts on women with stigma against mental health serving as an impediment to treatment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; At times, physical violence may cause permanent disfiguration of the body causing physical ailments that lead to a variety of psychological disorders like depression.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassan" /&gt; Furthermore, women are often unable to receive treatment for psychological disorders as mental health within the cultural realm of Pakistan is not considered a health matter.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF" /&gt; Mental health illiteracy leads to treatment of mental health disorders superstitiously or not at all.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassan" /&gt;

Another study that examined domestic violence and pregnancy among Pakistani women found that 51% of respondents reported experiencing domestic violence in the six months prior to or after pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karmaliani|first=Rozina|last2=Irfan|first2=Farhana|last3=Bann|first3=Carla|last4=Mcclure|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Moss|first5=Nancy|year=2008|title=Domestic violence prior to and during pregnancy among Pakistani women|url=|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=87|issue=11|pages=1194–1201|via=|doi=10.1080/00016340802460263|pmid=18951219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers of this study and others have suggested due to the prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women that domestic violence be screened for during antenatal care.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mufiza|first=Farid|last2=Saleem|first2=Sarah|last3=Karim|first3=Mehtab|last4=Hatcher|first4=Juanita|year=2008|title=Clinical Article: Spousal abuse during pregnancy in Karachi, Pakistan|url=|journal=International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics|volume=101|pages=141–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bargaining power ===
Women in domestic violence relationships often have no recourse of escaping due to fear of murder from the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacoby|first=Hanan|last2=Mansuri|first2=Ghazala|year=2010|title="Watta Satta": Bride Exchange and Women's Welfare in Rural Pakistan|url=|journal=American Economic Association|volume=100|issue=4|pages=1804–1825|via=|doi=10.1257/aer.100.4.1804}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vivid example of this is the practice of ''watta satta'', or bride exchange, whereby &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; a daughter from one family is swapped for a daughter of another in a brother-sister pair.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Power dynamics between the families follow a revenge-based model. If a husband is harsh on his wife then the mutual threat exists of the husband's brother-in-law being harsh on his sister.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These reciprocal threats leave women in positions with little to no bargaining power.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This leaves women in a position where they cannot escape a marriage because of cross bride exchange family entanglement.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Adding to the complexity, divorce is also highly stigmatized within the Pakistani culture.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Bargaining power of women in domestic violence relationships is also minimal due to residence with the husband's family.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Particularly, in rural areas, if a woman in a domestic violence relationship is living with her husband's family, she has little recourse to seek help or escape.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Studies on attitudes of domestic violence in Pakistan have shown that though these families in rural areas may wish to help their daughter, it is costly to continuously visit her.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In other cases, domestic violence perpetrator families have been shown to taunt or ridicule those seeking justice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Policy initiatives==

=== General legislation against domestic violence ===
In 2009 a Domestic Violence Protection bill was proposed by Yasmeen Rehman of the [[Pakistan People’s Party]].

=== Specific legislation against certain offenses ===

==== Dowry deaths ====
In 1976 the Pakistani government passed legislation on dowry and bridal gifts in an attempt to eliminate the custom but, because of cultural and societal norms combined with government ineffectiveness, such killings over inadequate dowries continue.&lt;ref name="Zaman" /&gt;

==== Acid attacks ====
In 1999 the [[Senate of Pakistan]] rejected a resolution which would have condemned the practice of murdering women for the sake of family honour.&lt;ref name="Ajmal 1999-08-25"&gt;{{cite news|title=World:South Asia Bride burning 'kills hundreds'|last=Ajmal|first=Umer Bin|date=25 August 1999|newspaper=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the Senate passed the ''Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill'' to repress acid attacks in the country; the senate also passed the prevention of anti-women practices bill.&lt;ref name="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights and Democracy: The 2011 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Report|publisher=TSO|year=2012|isbn=978-0101833929|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Honour killing ====
On April 21, 2001, the national government leader [[Pervez Musharraf]] declared that [[Honour killing in Pakistan|honour killings]] were "vigorously condemned" by the government and would be treated as murder.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Sushma|date=June 2000|title=Domestic Violence Against Women and Girls|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/digest6e.pdf|journal=Innocenti Digest|page=6|issn=1028-3528|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ministry of Women Development set up ten crisis centres to help the victims of domestic violence and raise the awareness level of the people on this issue.&lt;ref name="Shahina Imran"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/77226/PAKISTAN-Domestic-violence-endemic-but-awareness-slowly-rising|title=Pakistan: Domestic violence endemic, but awareness slowly rising|date=11 March 2008|agency=[[Integrated Regional Information Networks]]|location=Lahore|accessdate=4 September 2012|author=Shahina Imran}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in 2004, Pakistan's Criminal Law (Amendment) Act passed that provided legal protection for womenOn April 21, 2001, the national government leader [[Pervez Musharraf]] declared that [[Honour killing in Pakistan|honour killings]] were "vigorously condemned" by the government and would be treated as murder.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2" /&gt;  The Ministry of Women Development set up ten crisis centres to help the victims of domestic violence and raise the awareness level of the people on this issue.&lt;ref name="Shahina Imran" /&gt; Particularly in 2004, Pakistan's Criminal Law (Amendment) Act passed that provided legal protection for women against any offense committed by family members for the sake of honour.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, Pakistan's legal system has done little to uphold this legislation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad|first=N|last2=Omer|first2=F|last3=Mushtaq|first3=A|last4=Shah|first4=M|year=2012|title=Honor killing in Pakistan: An Islamic perspective|url=|journal=Asian Social Science|volume=10|pages=180–185|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Commission on the Status of Women reports that Pakistan is doing little to bring justice to perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; If the family of the victim forgives the perpetrator, then the perpetrator will be set free despite clear violation of Pakistani law.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Oftentimes, families who are caught in an honour killing case come from rural areas where families must work together in a village on the daily to live.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; When an honour killing occurs, the family of the victim are highly likely to forgive the perpetrator based on what elders of the village advise them to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamal|first=A|year=2015|title=Piety, Transgression, and the Feminist Debate on Muslim Women: Resituating the Victim-Subject of Honor-Related Violence from a Transnational Lens|url=|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=41|pages=55–79|via=|doi=10.1086/681771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Protector (2017)''' was an annual [[professional wrestling]] major event produced by Mexican [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG), which took place on February 19, 2017 in [[Arena Naucalpan]], [[Naucalpan, State of Mexico]], Mexico. The 2017 El Protector was the eight annual event produced under that name and the fourth to be held in January. The focal point of the show was the El Protector [[tag team]] tournament where eight teams composed of a "rookie" and a "vet" team up to compete for a trophy.

Rookie [[Diablo Jr.]] teamed up with veteran [[Black Terry]] to win the 2017 El Protector tournament defeating [[Demonio Infernal]] and [[Negro Navarro]] in the finals. The tournament also saw the teams of Black Dragón and [[Pantera (wrestler)|Internacional Pantera]], [[El Hijo de Dos Caras]] and [[El Hijo del Alebrije]], [[Herodes Jr.]] and [[Imposible (wrestler)|Imposible]], Hip Hop Man and [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Mr. Electro]], [[Dragón Fly (wrestler)|Dragón Fly]] and [[Villano IV]], Alfa and [[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]]  participated in the tournament. The show also featured four non-tournament matches.

==Production==
===Background===
''Lucha Libre'' has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or ''novato'', would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a [[tag team]] tournament in the hopes of giving the ''Novato'' a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] has held a [[CMLL Torneo Gran Alternativa|Torneo Gran Alternativa]] ("Great Alternative Tournament") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/grand.html | title=CMLL Gran Alternativa | accessdate=August 1, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican [[wrestling promotion|professional wrestling company]] [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG; at times referred to as ''Grupo Internacional Revolución'' in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Projecting a new promise lightning tournament") but would be renamed the [[IWRG El Protector|El Protector]] tournament in 2012. The El Protector shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in "Arena Naucalpan", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 El Protector show was the eight time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament.

===Storylines===
The El Protector event featured 11 [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = "Okay... what is Lucha Libre?" | page = 31 | quote=featuring clearly distinguished good guys and bad guys, or técnicos and rudos | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
During the fourth match of the night, [[Relámpago (wrestler)|Relámpago]] dove out of the ring at [[Apolo Estrada Jr.]], who moved out of the way at the last moment which caused Relámpago to crash into the steel barricade. As a result of the impact, Relámpago was unable to return to the ring and was counted out. It's unclear if this was the planned end or if Relámpago hit the guardrail harder than expected, rendering him unable to get back up.&lt;ref name=Protector2017/&gt;

==Aftermath==
As a result of winning the 2017 El Protector Diablo Jr. and Black Terry earned a match for the [[IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=Estrellas/&gt; A week after the tournament Diablo Jr. and Black Terry defeated Chicano and [[Veneno (wrestler)|Veneno]] to win the championship.&lt;ref name=IWRGTag30&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/las-dinastias-se-llevan-la-copa-high-power/ | title=Las Dinastías se llevan la Copa High Power| first=Diego | last=Mejía Eguiluz | date=February 27, 2017 | accessdate=February 28, 2017 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reign as champions lasted for 190 days and included two successful championship defenses until they were defeated by [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]] and Warrior Jr. on September 3, 2017.&lt;ref name=IWRGTag31&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/eterno-gana-la-cabellera-de-bombero-infernal/ | title=Eterno gana la cabellera de Bombero Infernal. | date=September 4, 2017 | accessdate=September 19, 2017 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish | first=Alfonso | last=Lizárraga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergency Room''' is an art exhibition format devised by [[Thierry Geoffroy]] for artists with desire to engage quickly in the current debate. Artists are invited to contribute with art works that are produced daily in response to ongoing social issues, contributing to a constantly changing exhibition. The format avoids the need for an artist to wait months or years before being able to exhibit their art. Emergency Room exhibitions have been held in a number of locations globally.

== Emergency Room format ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Artists, audience and media have been fighting for weeks in order to get to see and participate in the new and innovating exhibition that with its "art of the news" puts the art institution itself to debate. Reuters, The New Yorker and the TV-channel ABC News are some of the leading media that have brought the story about the original exhibition, and at P.S.1 more than a thousand visitors per day have been seeing it…''" said Danish newspaper ''[[Weekendavisen]]'' in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaj M. Lassen, [http://www.emergencyrooms.org/coverage/weekendavisen.pdf "Art = Retard" (in Danish)], ''Weekendavisen'', 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emergency Rooms are "carefully prepared environment[s] for hectic bursts of creation".&lt;ref name="Emergency short"&gt;[http://www.emergencyrooms.org/short.html The Emergency Room Format], Emergencyrooms.org. Retrieved 2013-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency Rooms can take place in several places across the world at the same time. When art institutions wish to host the Emergency Room format they are given a license to produce a version of the format.&lt;ref name="Artinasia09"&gt;[http://www.artinasia.com/institutionsDetail.php?catID=9999&amp;galleryID=1224&amp;view=7&amp;eventID=2104 Emergency Room Hanoi], ''artinasia.com'', October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emergency Room format involves a system which is taught to the participating artists by Emergency Room staff. The system requires the artwork of the previous day to be removed daily (normally around 12.30 p.m.) and replaced by fresh artworks. Geoffroy calls this central element of the process "The Passage".&lt;ref name="Artinasia09" /&gt; The number of artists turning up for the Passage will vary, sometimes with nobody showing up. Other days the news of the day will stimulate responses from the artists and participation in the Passage increases.

Emergency Room can be combined with the 'Delay Museum', a nearby exhibition space where yesterday’s artwork is archived and shown.&lt;ref name="Artinasia09" /&gt; This museum is no longer contemporary in the sense of the word used by Emergency Room. This delay of opinions and reactions are preserved. Geoffroy describes this as a critical way of thinking about contemporary art, with The Delay Museum becoming a place for studying the aesthetics of the fast moving 'emergency'.&lt;ref name="Emergency short" /&gt; It is recorded externally by media coverage and internally usingf blogs, webcasting and artist interviews by the Emergency Room staff.&lt;ref name="Emergency short" /&gt;

Geoffroy describes the Emergency Room as a format where artists can "train their awareness muscle", encouraging experimentation and artistic daring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Alternatives – Thierry Geoffroy|url=http://culturaldevelopmentconsulting.com/2013/03/16/7522/|website=Cultural Development Consultation|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing artists 2006 - present ==
The Emergency Room events involve large numbers of local and overseas artists. By November 2008 over 150 artists had been involved in the format in a number of locations internationally.&lt;ref name="Artnet remede"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Cyril|title=Le remède à la morosité : EMERGENCY ROOM (in French)|url=http://www.artnet.fr/magazine/portraits/thomas/emergency%20room.asp|accessdate=2013-04-25|newspaper=ArtNet.fr|date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atomic cloud over Nagasaki from Koyagi-jima.jpeg|thumb|288x288px|Cloud over Nagasaki following the atomic blast]]
'''Frederick C. Bock''' (January 18, 1918&amp;nbsp;– August 25, 2000) was a [[World War II]] pilot who took part in the atomic bombing of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in 1945.

Bock attended the [[University of Chicago]] and went on to enroll in a graduate course in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Upon the entry of the United States into the [[World War II|Second World War]] Bock enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Force]], becoming a pilot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bock flew missions from [[India]] to [[China]] over the [[Himalayas]], a route known as [[the hump]]. He also participated in air raids on [[Japan]] flown from China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Raid ==
{{See also|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
On the Nagasaki Raid Bock flew the [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bomber ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', which was used for scientific measurements and [[photography]] of the effects caused by the nuclear weapon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/29/us/f-c-bock-82-monitor-of-nagasaki-bombing.html|title=F. C. Bock, 82, Monitor of Nagasaki Bombing|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=2000-08-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A civilian observer was aboard ''The Great Artiste'' named [[William L. Laurence]] who was a science writer with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]].'' His account of the mission was to be awarded the 1946 [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his subsequent book ''Dawn Over Zero'' (Knopf 1946), Laurence describes the scene aboard the B-29;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Quote|text=''I watched Capt. Frederick C. Bock, the pilot of our ship, go through the intricate motions of lifting a B-29 off the ground and marveled at the quiet efficiency of this Michigan boy who had majored in philosophy at Chicago University... I talked to him on the ground and I was amazed at the transformation that had taken place. Man and machine had become one, a modern centaur.''|sign=William L. Laurence|source=Dawn Over Zero (1946)}}

The bomber which actually dropped [[Fat Man]] was called ''[[Bockscar]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2546 USAF Museum - Bockscar Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117185238/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2546 |date=2007-11-17 }} Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; as it was usually flown by Frederick Bock. The staff was swapped just before the raid and Major [[Charles Sweeney]] piloted ''Bockscar'', which flew with ''The Great Artiste'' and another aircraft.

== Post War Career ==

After the war Bock returned to [[Chicago]] where he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[zoology]] with a specialisation in mathematical statistics and [[genetics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Working in Chicago based [[Research|research laboratories]] Dr. Bock created [[algorithm]]s for solving complex problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dr. Bock retired in 1986 from [[Baxter International|Baxter Travenol]] Laboratories. It was there he devised a mathematical model for [[peritoneal dialysis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A native of [[Greenville, Michigan]], Bock died at his [[Arizona]] home in 2000, of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-08-30/news/0008300191_1_mr-bock-great-artiste-nagasaki&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Golden Checkerboard''''' (1965) is a book by [[Ed Ainsworth]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Edward Maddin Ainsworth worked for 35 years as a columnist, feature writer and editor for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Other books by him include ''Pot Luck'' (1940), ''Eagles Fly West'' (1946), ''California Jubilee'' (1948), ''Bill Magee's Western Barbecue Cookbook'' (1949), ''Death Cues the Pageant'' (1954) New York, Arcadia House {{oclc|3117808}}, ''Painters of the Desert'' (1961), ''Beckoning Desert'' (1962) Prentice-Hall {{oclc|64311285}}, ''The Cowboy in Art'' (1968) New York, World Publishing {{oclc|443225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject matter concerns the mid-20th century economic conditions of the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] of [[Palm Springs, California]], and the history of the 99-year lease law which enabled them to commercially develop tribal owned lands. It focuses on Indio [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]] Judge Hilton McCabe, who is described as "The Little White Father of the Indians of Palm Springs",&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ainsworth|first=Ed |title=Golden Checkerboard|year=1965|publisher=Desert-Southwest|location=Palm Desert, CA|pages=195|lccn=66000811|oclc=4391736 
| asin = B001TC8PMI   }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|2 Intro by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Tom C. Clark|Tom Clark]]}} and recalls the steps taken by McCabe to set up [[conservatorships]] and leases that would give the tribe investment opportunities and economic self-sufficiency. The title of the book refers to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' [[Indian Reservation|reservation]] [[Checkerboarding (land)|checkerboard pattern]], originating from [[Land grants#United States|land grants]] to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] as an incentive to build rail lines through the region,&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|29}} when President Ulysses S. Grant signed an Executive Order granting "San Bernardino Base and Meridian, Township 4 South, Range 4 East, Section 14" to the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|49}}

==Historical context==
Section 14, which included the warm springs at the center of Palm Springs, and other sections surrounding Palm Springs, were "owned" by the Indians, but held "in trust" by the federal government; the Indians charged fees for bathing in the springs and picnicking in the canyon.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Chris|title=African-Americans Shaping the California Desert: Coachella Valley|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/african-americans-shaping-the-california-desert-coachella-valley.html|work=SOCAL Focus|publisher=KCET (Community Television of Southern California)|accessdate=March 19, 2012|date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Congress passed the Allotment Act (39 Stat. 969, 976)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In fact the original General Allotment Act was the [[Dawes Act]], passed in 1887. [http://www.mydesert.com/article/20120319/NEWS06/203190334/Q-Agua-Caliente-Tribal-Chairman-Richard-Milanovich?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFrontpage "Q&amp;A with Agua Caliente Tribal Chairman Richard Milanovich". ''Desert Sun''. March 19, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; which directed the Secretary of the Interior to divide and distribute the Indian land; Harry E. Wadsworth was appointed as the allotting agent.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|65}} In 1927, the Secretary instructed Wadsworth to make a new schedule of allotments, which he did for the 24 members of the Band who made written applications.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|67}} (In fact the allotments were not carried out; Band member Lee Arenas sued the federal government to have the allotments made legal and won his case in the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accmuseum.org/Arenas-Street Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Lee Arenas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arenas v.

Chief Francisco Patencio was active in opposing the allotments and loss of tribal authority, traveling to Washington, D.C., to meet with Office of Indian Affairs Commissioner John Collier. [http://www.accmuseum.org/Patencio-Road Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Francisco Patencio]&lt;/ref&gt;) In December 1944, Secretary of the Interior [[Oscar L. Chapman|Oscar Chapman]], acting on the advice of Commissioner of Indian Affairs [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], disapproved the allotting schedule set up by Wadsworth 17 years earlier.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|86}}

==Conservatorship program==

===Odlum Report===
In January 1953, [[Douglas McKay]] became [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Thereafter McKay asked industrialist [[Floyd B. Odlum]] (former president of Atlas Corp. and husband of [[Jacqueline Cochran]]) to investigate the affairs of the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|124}} The report by Odlum's committee was completed in April 1955 and put into final form in April 1956. Among other things, Odlum's report determined: that the Band consisted of 83 persons, the majority of whom were minors; the value of the Indian land, allotted and unallotted, totaled as much as $12,000,000; and the value of the land could increase with proper development. Odlum also discussed the legal problems related to unequal allotments, taxes on non-productive real estate, the inability to lease land because of a 5-year limit, and conflicting claims of the allottees.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|127–8}} The report recommended that the Indian land be placed in a private corporation or trusteeship rather than existing wardship.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|129–30}} Odlum's recommendations were not implemented because newly elected Congressman [[Dalip Singh Saund]], who ran against Cochran in a bitter election campaign, blocked proposed legislation.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|132}} In the meantime, Congress passed Public Law No. 255 in August 1955, which allowed for leases of 50 years.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|138}}

===1959 legislation===&lt;!--subject to more editing. McCabe's papers (which are referenced below) are not readily available. Ainsworth's book is poorly organized, lacking an index or TOC. The "landmark decision" is probably related to the Equalization Act.--&gt;
In 1959, a landmark decision by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] equalized allotted Indian lands, thereby setting the stage for development of Indian lands within the city of Palm Springs. This same legislation, however, recognizing the potential value of Indian lands within the boundaries of a world-famous resort, also called for the appointment of conservators and guardians to "protect" Indians and their estates from "artful and designing persons"&lt;ref name="LandProblems"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/finding_aids/records/finding_aid.php?fa=0018 USC Libraries; Archival Collections: Judge Hilton McCabe Collection on the Agua Caliente Indians] containing unpublished manuscript of ''Land Problems and Solutions of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians'' (1961), Hilton McCabe, Indio Superior Court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/usc_dml_rare_books_and_manuscripts USC Doheny Memorial Library: Rare Books and Manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; who might otherwise cheat them out of their properties, which could now be legally sold by the individual tribal members who owned them. By declaring Indians as "incompetent" (both as children and adults) court-appointed conservators and guardians took control of a majority of Indian estates. A major oversight of the program was the appointment of judges, lawyers, and business people as Indian conservators and guardians—the very people the program sought to protect Indians and their estates from. The program was administered by the Indio Superior Court's Judge Hilton McCabe, subject of ''Golden Checkerboard''. McCabe concurrently acted as a conservator to a number of tribal members and an [[executor]], in addition to his administrative and legal roles.&lt;ref name="CoxReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Administration of Guardianships and Conservatorships Established for Members of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, California|date=March 1968|publisher=Department of the Interior|location=Washington, DC|pages=56|url=|author=Palm Springs Task Force (Cox Report)|oclc=8536472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As a result of the conservatorship program the Band was able to lease land to businesses. The Spa Hotel opened in November 1962, with Eileen Miguel, head of the Band, U.S. Grant IV, great-grandson of President Grant, and McCabe at the opening ceremony. In 1961, 41 members of the Band signed a petition to McCabe thanking him for his efforts. {{Cite book

{{History of Spain}}
The '''Granada War''' ({{lang-es|Guerra de Granada}}) was a series of military campaigns between 1482 and 1491, during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] (''los Reyes Católicos'') [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], against the [[Nasrid dynasty]]'s [[Emirate of Granada]]. It ended with the defeat of Granada and its annexation by Castile, ending all Islamic rule on the Iberian peninsula ([[al-Andalus]]).

The ten-year war was not a continuous effort but a series of seasonal campaigns launched in spring and broken off in winter. The Granadans were crippled by internal conflict and civil war, while the Christians were generally unified. The Granadans were also bled economically by Castile, with the tribute (Spanish: ''paria'') they had to pay to avoid being attacked and conquered. The war also saw the effective use of artillery by the Christians to rapidly conquer towns that would otherwise have required a long siege.  On January 2, 1492, [[Muhammad XII of Granada]] (King Boabdil) surrendered the Emirate of Granada, the city of [[Granada]], and the [[Alhambra]] palace to the Castilian forces.

The war was a joint project between Isabella's [[Crown of Castile]] and Ferdinand's [[Crown of Aragon]]. The bulk of the troops and funds for the war came from Castile, and Granada was annexed into Castile's lands. The Crown of Aragon was less important: apart from the presence of King Ferdinand himself, Aragon provided naval collaboration, guns, and some financial loans. Aristocrats were offered the allure of new lands, while Ferdinand and Isabella centralized and consolidated power. The aftermath of the war ended ''convivencia'' ("live and let live") between religions In the Iberian peninsula: the Jews [[Alhambra Decree|were forced to convert to Christianity or be exiled]] in 1492, and by 1501, all of Granada's Muslims were [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|obliged to convert to Christianity]], become slaves, or be exiled; by 1526 this prohibition spread to the rest of Spain. "New Christians" (''[[conversos]]'') came to be accused of [[crypto-Islam]] and [[crypto-Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=L. P. |year=2005 |title=Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614  |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31963-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain would go on to model its national aspirations as the guardian of Christianity and Catholicism. The fall of the Alhambra is still celebrated every year by the City Council of Granada, and the Granada War is considered in traditional Spanish historiography as the final war of the [[Reconquista]]. At the same time, and uniquely in the "Reconquista", the Granada War is not called "the reconquest of Granada" but rather "the conquest of Granada". Granada in its current form had not been Christian before the Reconquista;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg, "No hubo una Edad 'Media' española", ''Propuestas teorico-metodológicas para el estudio de la literatura hispanica medieval'', ed. Lillian van der Walde, Mexico City: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México-Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, 2003, pp. 511-520, {{ISBN|9703207774}}, https://web.archive.org/web/20160312023250/http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/other_hispanic_topics/nohuboun.htm, retrieved March 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; however the corresponding region was held by the Christian [[Visigothic Kingdom]] prior to the 8th century [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].

==Iberia and Al-Andalus in the late 15th century==
{{See also|Reconquista}}

The [[Emirate of Granada]] had been the last Muslim state in Iberia for more than two centuries by the time of the Granada War. The other remnant [[al-Andalus]] states (the ''[[taifa]]s'') of the once powerful [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] had long been conquered by the Christians. Pessimism for Granada's future existed before its ultimate fall; in 1400, [[Ibn Hudayl]] wrote "Is [[Granada]] not enclosed between a violent sea and an enemy terrible in arms, both of which press on its people day and night?"&lt;ref name="hil367"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Granada was wealthy and powerful, and the Christian kingdoms were divided and fought amongst themselves. Granada's problems began to worsen after [[Yusuf III, Sultan of Granada|Emir Yusuf III]]'s death in 1417. Succession struggles ensured that Granada was in an almost constant low-level civil war. Clan loyalties were stronger than allegiance to the [[Emir]], making consolidation of power difficult. Often, the only territory the Emir really controlled was the [[Granada|city of Granada]]. At times, the emir did not even control all the city, but rather one rival emir would control the [[Alhambra]], and another the [[Albayzín]], the most important district of Granada.&lt;ref name="hil368"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

This internal fighting greatly weakened the state. The economy declined, with Granada's once world-famous porcelain manufacture disrupted and challenged by the Christian town of [[Manises]] near Valencia, in Aragon. Despite the weakening economy, taxes were still imposed at their earlier high rates to support Granada's extensive defenses and large army. Ordinary Granadans paid triple the taxes of (non-tax-exempt) Castilians.&lt;ref name="hil368" /&gt; The heavy taxes that Emir [[Abu-l-Hasan Ali]] imposed contributed greatly to his unpopularity. These taxes did at least support a respected army; Hasan was successful in putting down Christian revolts in his lands, and some observers estimated he could muster as many as 7,000 horsemen.&lt;ref name="hil369"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontier between Granada and the Castilian lands of Andalusia was in a constant state of flux, "neither in peace nor in war."&lt;ref name="hil369" /&gt; Raids across the border were common, as were intermixing alliances between local nobles on both sides of the frontier. Relations were governed by occasional truces and demands for tribute should one side have been seen to overstep their bounds. Neither country's central government intervened or controlled the warfare much.&lt;ref name="hil369" /&gt;

[[Henry IV of Castile|King Henry IV of Castile]] died in December 1474, setting off the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] between Henry's daughter [[Joanna la Beltraneja]] and Henry's half-sister [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]]. The war raged from 1475–1479, setting Isabella's supporters and the [[Crown of Aragon]] against Joanna's supporters, [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and [[Ancien Regime in France|France]]. During this time, the frontier with Granada was practically ignored; the Castilians did not even bother to ask for or obtain reparation for a raid in 1477. Truces were agreed upon in 1475, 1476, and 1478. In 1479, the Succession War concluded with Isabella victorious. As Isabella had married [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] in 1469, this meant that the two powerful kingdoms of Castile and Aragon would stand united, free from inter-Christian war which had helped Granada survive.&lt;ref name="hil370"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==

===Provocations and responses===
[[Image:IsabellaofCastile03.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Isabella's marriage with Ferdinand of Aragon ensured a united front of Castile and Aragon against Granada.]]
The truce of 1478 was still theoretically in effect when Granada launched a surprise attack against [[Zahara de la Sierra|Zahara]] in December 1481, as part of a reprisal for a Christian raid.&lt;ref name="hil370" /&gt;  The town fell, and the population was enslaved. This attack proved to be a great provocation, and factions in favor of war in Andalusia used it to rally support for a counterstrike, quickly moving to take credit for it, and backed a wider war.  The seizure of [[Alhama de Granada|Alhama]] and its subsequent royal endorsement is usually said to be the formal beginning of the Granada War.&lt;ref name="hil370" /&gt; Abu Hasan attempted to retake Alhama by siege in March but was unsuccessful. Reinforcements from the rest of Castile and Aragon averted the possibility of retaking Alhama in April 1482; King Ferdinand formally took command at Alhama on May 14, 1482.

The Christians next tried to besiege [[Loja, Granada|Loja]] but failed to take the town. This setback was balanced by a twist that would prove to aid them greatly: on the same day that Loja was relieved, Abu Hasan's son, Abu Abdallah or Boabdil, rebelled and styled himself [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Emir Muhammad XII]].&lt;ref name="hil381"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The war continued into 1483. Abu Hasan's brother, al-Zagal, defeated a large Christian raiding force in the hills of the [[Axarquia]] east of [[Málaga]]. However, at [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]] the Christians were able to defeat and capture King Boabdil. Ferdinand and Isabella had previously not been intent on conquering all of Granada. With the capture of King Boabdil, however, Ferdinand decided to use him to conquer Granada entirely. In a letter written in August 1483, Ferdinand wrote "To put Granada in division and destroy it We have decided to free him.... He [Boabdil] has to make war on his father."&lt;ref name="hil381" /&gt; With Boabdil's release as a pseudo-Christian ally, the Granadan civil war continued. A Granadan chronicler commented that Boabdil's capture was "the cause of the fatherland's destruction."&lt;ref name="hil381" /&gt;

In 1485, the fortunes of the Granadan internal conflict shifted yet again. Boabdil was expelled from the Albayzín, his base of power, by Hasan's brother al-Zagal. Al-Zagal also took command of the nation, dethroning his aging brother, who died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="hil382"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Boabdil was obliged to flee to Ferdinand and Isabella's protection. The continuing division within the Muslim ranks and the cunning of the Marquis of Cádiz allowed the western reaches of Granada to be seized with unusual speed in 1485. [[Ronda]] fell to him after fifteen days, thanks to his negotiations with the city's leaders. Ronda's fall allowed [[Marbella]], a base of the Granadan fleet, to come into Christian hands next.&lt;ref name="hil382" /&gt;

Boabdil was soon released from Christian protection to resume his bid for control of Granada. For the next three years, he acted as one of Ferdinand and Isabella's vassals.&lt;ref name="hil382" /&gt; He offered the promise of limited independence for Granada and peace with the Christians to the citizenry; from the Catholic Monarchs, he extracted the title of Duke for whatever cities he could control.&lt;ref name="hil383"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 383–384.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siege of Málaga===
{{main|Siege of Málaga (1487)}}
Málaga, the chief seaport of Granada, was the main objective of the Castilian forces in 1487. Emir al-Zagal was slow to march to attempt to relieve the siege and was unable to harass the Christian armies safely because of the ongoing civil war; even after he left the city to come to the aid of Málaga, he was forced to leave troops in the Alhambra to defend against Boabdil and his followers.&lt;ref name="hil383" /&gt;

The first main city to be attacked, [[Vélez-Málaga]], capitulated on 27 April 1487, with local supporters of Boabdil directly aiding the Christian besiegers.&lt;ref name="hil383" /&gt;  Málaga held out during an extended siege that lasted from 7 May 1487 until 18 August 1487; its commander preferred death to surrender, and the African garrison and Christian renegades (converts to Islam) fought tenaciously, fearing the consequences of defeat.  Near the end, the notables of Málaga finally offered a surrender, but Ferdindad refused, as generous terms had already been offered twice.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the city finally fell, Ferdinand punished almost all the inhabitants for their stubborn resistance with slavery, while renegades were burned alive or pierced by reeds. The Jews of Malaga, however, were spared, as Castilian Jews ransomed them from slavery.&lt;ref name="hil383" /&gt;

Historian William Prescott considered the fall of Málaga the most important part of the war; as the chief port of Granada, Granada could not reasonably continue on as an independent state without it.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siege of Baza===
Al-Zagal lost prestige from the fall of Málaga, and Boabdil took over all of the city of Granada in 1487; he additionally controlled the northeast of the country with [[Vélez-Rubio]], [[Vélez-Blanco]], and Vera. Al-Zagal still controlled Baza, Guadix, and Almería. Boabdil took no action as the Christian forces took some of his land, perhaps assuming it would shortly be returned to him.&lt;ref name="hil383" /&gt;

In 1489, the Christian forces began a painfully long siege of [[Baza, Granada|Baza]], the most important stronghold remaining to al-Zagal. Baza was highly defensible as it required the Christians to split their armies, and artillery was of little use against it. Supplying the army caused a huge budget shortfall for the Castilians. Occasional threats of deprivation of office were necessary to keep the army in the field, and Isabella came personally to the siege to help maintain the morale of both the nobles and the soldiers. After six months, al-Zagal surrendered, despite his garrison still being largely unharmed; he had become convinced that the Christians were serious about maintaining the siege as long as it would take, and further resistance was useless without the hope of relief, of which there was no sign.&lt;ref name="hil383" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Baza was granted generous surrender terms, unlike Málaga.

===Last stand at Granada===
[[Image:Alhambradesdegeneralife.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Alhambra]].]]
With the fall of Baza and the capture of al-Zagal in 1490, it seemed as if the war was over; Ferdinand and Isabella believed this was the case.&lt;ref name="hil385" /&gt;  However, Boabdil was unhappy with the rewards for his alliance with Ferdinand and Isabella, possibly because lands that had been promised to him were being administered by Castile. He broke off his vassalage and rebelled against the Catholic Monarchs, despite holding only the city of Granada and the [[Alpujarras]] Mountains.&lt;ref name="hil385"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear that such a position was untenable in the long term, so Boabdil sent out desperate requests for external aid. The [[Sultan of Egypt]] mildly rebuked Ferdinand for the Granada War, but the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] that ruled Egypt were in a near constant war with the [[Ottoman Turks]]. As Castile and Aragon were fellow enemies of the Turks, the Sultan had no desire to break their alliance against the Turks.  Boabdil also requested aid from the [[Kingdom of Fez]] (modern [[Morocco]]), but no reply is recorded by history.&lt;ref name="hil386"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;  North Africa continued to sell Castile wheat throughout the war and valued maintaining good trade relations. In any case, the Granadans no longer controlled any coastline from where to receive overseas aid. No help would be forthcoming for Granada.&lt;ref name="hil386" /&gt;

[[File:Salida de la familia de Boabdil de la Alhambra.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting depicting Muhammad XII's family in the [[Alhambra]] moments after the fall of Granada]]
An eight-month siege of Granada began in April 1491. The situation for the defenders grew progressively dire, as their forces for interfering with the siege dwindled and advisers schemed against each other. Bribery of important officials was rampant, and at least one of the chief advisers to Boabdil seems to have been working for Castile the entire time.&lt;ref name="hil386" /&gt; After the Battle of Granada a provisional surrender, the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)|Treaty of Granada]], was signed on November 25, 1491, which granted two months to the city.&lt;ref name="Prescott1904"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prescott|first=William Hickling|editor=Munro, Wilford Harold|title=History of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAZpAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=23 November 2015|volume=II|year=1904|publisher=J. B. Lippincott Company|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the long delay was not so much intransigence on either side, but rather the inability of the Granadan government to coordinate amongst itself in the midst of the disorder and tumult that gripped the city. After the terms, which proved rather generous to the Muslims,  were negotiated, the city capitulated on January 2, 1492. The besieging Christians sneaked troops into the Alhambra that day in case resistance materialized, which it did not.&lt;ref name="hil373"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;  Granada's resistance had come to its end.

==Tactics and technology==
{{See also|Medieval warfare|Early Modern warfare}}

The most notable facet of the Granada War was the power of [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] and [[cannon]]s to greatly shorten the many [[siege]]s of the war.&lt;ref name="hil376"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Castilians and Aragonese started the war with only a few artillery pieces, but Ferdinand had access to French and Burgundian experts from his recent wars, and the Christians aggressively increased their artillery forces.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Muslims, however, lagged far behind in their use of artillery, generally only using the occasional captured Christian piece.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian Weston F. Cook Jr. wrote "Gunpowder firepower and artillery siege operations won the Granadan war, and other factors in the Spanish victory were actually secondary and derivative."&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1495, Castile and Aragon controlled 179 pieces of artillery total, a vast increase from the paltry numbers seen in the War of the Castilian Succession.&lt;ref name="hil377"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive [[arquebus]]es also saw use in the war, though only to a small degree.&lt;ref name="hil377" /&gt; Heavy cavalry knights were a much smaller factor in the Granada War than seen in earlier warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Light cavalry [[jinete]]s took on a more prominent role instead.  The open-field battles in which cavalry were the most important were rare; the Granadans, badly outnumbered, generally avoided such battles.&lt;ref name="hil374"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Castilians also employed a large number of supporting men; a huge force of workers were mustered in 1483 to destroy crops and pillage the countryside rather than engage directly in battle.&lt;ref name="hil376" /&gt;  Coordination and logistics was difficult given the mountainous terrain, but the Christians diligently built a series of roads through the mountains to deliver food and supplies to their troops.

Politically, many nobles insisted on controlling their own forces, but Ferdinand and Isabella were still able to exercise a large degree of control in directing the army as a whole. The Granadans, meanwhile, were beset with civil war, preventing the establishment of a unified command.&lt;ref name="hil377" /&gt; The Christian army was almost completely Castilian; Aragonese and foreign mercenary participation was minimal.&lt;ref name="hil378"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Castilian army, Andalusia contributed far more troops than the other territories, with much of its population conscripted into the war. The nobility provided the majority of the expensive cavalry.&lt;ref name="hil378" /&gt;

==Strength of the armies involved==

Concerning the real strength of the armies involved, according to original sources the Castilian armies reached between 50,000 and 70,000 soldiers the years of the greatest military effort (1482, 83, 86, 87, 89 and 91), or 10,000 to 29,000 in the quieter ones (1484, 85, 88 and 90), strength which is accepted by modern scholars as Ladero Quesada.&lt;ref&gt;Ladero, Granada, p. 100 and 108, and Irving.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, according to García de Gabiola, to keep, pay and feed armies of such strength were beyond the resources of the recently birthed modern states. For the campaigns in Italy (1494–1503) the Spanish armies were of 5,000, 9,000 or 15,000 men maximum, so it is rather surprising the numbers recorded 5–10 years before for Granada. If we take into account the revenues of Castile during the period (130 to some 200 millions of maravedies per year) it is hardly difficult that Castile could have organized more than 8,000 to 20,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Amounts calculated by García de Gabiola, p. 63, from revenues registered by Ladero, Granada, p. 121-127, and Ladero, Hermandad, p. 52-58, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ladero Quesada register the number of grain loads contracted by Castile in several years and García de Gabiola has calculated the number of soldiers that could have been fed through these grain loads, and his conclusions are 12,000 men for 1482 (siege of Loja); 8,000 men for 1483 and 1484 (Granada fields sacking); 10,000 men in 1485 (Ronda siege); 10–12,000 soldiers in 1486 (2nd Loja siege); 12,000 for 1487 (Malaga siege); 10–12,000 in 1488 (1st Baza siege); 20,000 soldiers in 1489 (2nd Baza siege, the greatest grain loads contracted, that also coincides with the largest revenue of Castile during the campaign, some 200 millions); and 10–12,000 men for 1490–91 (final siege of Granada). A 20% of them should be cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Amounts calculated by García de Gabiola, pp. 63–69, from grain loads registered by Ladero Quesada.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to Muslim armies, according to García de Gabiola,&lt;ref&gt;García de Gabiola, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; the strengths mentioned by the sources (15,000 to 50,000 infantry, or 4,500–7,000 cavalry) should also be discarded. More plausible strengths mentuioned are the 3,000 horses (1482), 1,000 to 1,500 (1483, 1485 and 1487) or even 3-400 riders (1489 and 1491). Concerning the infantry, De Miguel Mora states that a Muslim soldier captured by the Castilians during the siege of Baza confessed that the real infantry strength of the garrison  was 4,000 men and not 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;De Miguel Mora, p. 12 and 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  So, the Muslim armies could not exceed some 4,000 infantry. At the end of the war the ratio was 2 or 3-to-1 in favor of the Castilian armies.

The Granada War would prove to be valuable training for the [[Italian Wars]], where the Castilian armies and tactics such as the ''[[tercio]]'' would acquit themselves well.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
[[File:Capitulação de Granada - Vicente Barneto y Vazquez.png|thumb|left|The Surrender of Granada, by Vicente Barneto y Vazquez]]
The surrender of Granada was seen as a great blow to Islam and a triumph of Christianity. Other Christian states offered their sincere congratulations to Ferdinand and Isabella, while Islamic writers reacted with despair. In Castile and Aragon, celebrations and bullfights were held. People rejoiced in the streets.&lt;ref name="hil388"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty's terms for Granada's surrender were quite generous to the Muslims, considering how little they had left to bargain with.&lt;ref name="hil387"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; They were similar to the terms offered to towns which surrendered earlier, when the outcome of the war was in doubt. For three years, Muslims could emigrate and return freely. They were allowed to keep weapons, though not firearms, a provision that however was to be annulled a month later. No one would be forced to change religion, not even former Christians who had converted to Islam. Boabdil was offered money and the rulership of a small principality in the mountainous [[Alpujarras]], an area that would have been difficult to control in any case.&lt;ref name="hil387" /&gt; At first, most of conquered Granada was treated respectfully and was therefore predominantly stable for seven years, though the [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492 expelled the Jews that were not [[converso]] [[Marrano]]s.

King Boabdil soon found his position intolerable. He left for Morocco in October 1493, where he would die some forty years later.&lt;ref name="hil390"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Castile started to revoke some of the more tolerant attributes of the treaty. This initiative was led by [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Archbishop Cisneros]], who ordered mass conversions, the burning of valuable Arabic manuscripts and other measures detrimental to the Muslims (and Jews).&lt;ref name="hil390" /&gt;

This sparked [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499–1501)|a revolt]] that ended in many Muslims being forced to choose between baptism, exile, or execution. Tensions from then onward would remain high, and Castile was obliged to maintain a large military force in Granada to deter future revolts. Isabella also strengthened the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and Ferdinand brought the Inquisition to Aragon where previously it had not held power.

Castile was the main beneficiary of the war, as it had also spent by far the majority of the money and manpower to prosecute it, and completely annexed Granada. The conquest of Granada meant little for Aragon's strategic position, but it did help secure Castilian support in Italy and France, where Aragon's interests lay.&lt;ref name="hil393"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing oppression of the Moors—now known as [[Moriscos]] or "New Christians"—led to the [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–71)]]. After the defeat of the Moors, which was not easy, almost all the Moriscos of the former Kingdom of Granada were exiled to other parts of Spain.

==Cultural influence==
An entire genre, ''romances fronterizos'', developed around stories of the war and the battles on the Granadan frontier which reached their culmination in Granada's fall. [[Ginés Pérez de Hita]] wrote an early example of [[historical fiction]], ''Guerras civiles de Granada'', a romantic account of the war that emphasized chivalry and heroism on both sides. A number of stories and songs appear to have been sponsored by the royal government to help steel morale for the long struggle; ''Sobre Baza'' was a poem written in 1479 encouraging persistence in the long siege. The song "''Setenil, ay Setenil''", written in 1484, hoped that Ferdinand would conquer "as far as Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="hil371"&gt;Hillgarth, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The song "''Una sañosa porfía''" by [[Juan del Encina]] puts the depiction of the war in the lips of King Boabdil himself.  English playwright [[John Dryden]] wrote a [[heroic drama]] ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'', published in 1672, which focuses on a romantic love triangle and clashing loyalties in two feuding Granadan factions, leaving the besieging Castilians in the background.

The [[Día de la Toma de Granada]] is a civic and religious festival held each year in Granada on the anniversary of the city's conquest, January 2.

The '''Ultra 94 Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge Canada by Yokohama''' is a [[One-Design|one-make racing]] series based in [[Canada]] utilizing [[Porsche 911 GT3]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNaughton |first=Derek |date=May 10, 2011|url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/beijing2008/story.html?id=4758004|title=Calabogie debut for Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge Canada|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|location=Montreal|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ultra 94 GT3 Cup Challenge Canada by Yokohama features semi-professional drivers racing head to head in one of the largest single-make series in North America. The multi-class structure of the series teaches drivers essential skills for an eventual career in Porsche [[Supercup]] or the [[American Le Mans Series]].

The series is divided into two classes; the Platinum Cup, featuring the more powerful Porsche 911 GT3 Cup 991.2 cars, and the Gold Cup, which includes the older 991.1 model. Both classes race on [[Yokohama]] racing tires.

The series is sanctioned by the [[International Motor Sports Association]], and is a development series to the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]. [[Randy Hembrey]] was the Race Director from 2013-2014, followed by Kyle Novak. Starting in 2018, the series Race Director is John Maesky.

'''John Francis Colburn''' (September 30, 1859 – March 16, 1920) was a businessman and politician of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He served as the last [[Ministry of the Interior (Hawaii)|Minister of the Interior]] of Queen [[Liliuokalani]]. Even though he was part Hawaiian ancestry on his maternal side, Colburn was a key figure in the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy]] and was a proponent of annexation to the United States. Colburn was the treasurer of the estate of [[Queen Kapiolani]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Honolulu]], the youngest of three children of auctioneer and local fire warden John F.

Publisher and philanthropist [[Thurston Twigg-Smith]], the grandson of annexation leader [[Lorrin A.

Kuykendall noted in 1961 that most Hawaiians were supportive of a strong monarchy, and resented the [[Bayonet Constitution]] they felt had been forced upon King [[Kalākaua]]. When Liliuokalani was elected upon his death, her ability to govern was limited by a fractured legislature and the terms of the Bayonet Constitution.  Her proposed new constitution was similar to the 1864 constitution in effect prior to the forced Bayonet Constitution. {{harvnb|Kuykendall|Day|1961|pp=171–177}}; Thurston Twigg-Smith was strongly opposed to Hawaiian Sovereignty. His perspective of the queen's proposed new constitution was that it would weaken the power of the legislature and be a move back to an absolute monarchy. {{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pp=xv, 10}}}} but Colburn and the rest of the cabinet were either opposed to or reluctant to sign the new constitution. Their opposition was one of the causes which ultimately led to her [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pp=64–67, 95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] was being formed on January 14 and was in the process of drawing up a petition for 700–800 gathered opposition participants, when Colburn and Peterson arrived, joined at some point by Cornwell and Parker. Speaking before the large crowd, Colburn revealed the details of a meeting the ministers had just had with the queen to discuss the proposed constitution, rousing the crowd to prepare for action. After an hours-long meeting to digest the information presented by Colburn, the Committee of Safety headed by Thurston joined with the ministers in defying the plans for a new constitution, believing there was no alternative but to remove her from power. The cabinet ministers were all present during the overnight session and fully briefed on the committee's plan of action by the following morning, January 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pp=64–67, 95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1893, Colburn wrote a letter to his uncle-in-law J. H.

The '''Little Ships of Dunkirk''' were about 850 private boats&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/dunkirk_evacuation | title = BBC History - Britain retreats from France }}&lt;/ref&gt; that sailed from [[Ramsgate]] in England to [[Dunkirk]] in France between 26 May and 4 June 1940 as part of [[Operation Dynamo]], helping to rescue more than 336,000 British and French soldiers who were [[Battle of Dunkirk|trapped on the beaches at Dunkirk]] during the [[Second World War]].

==Overview==

The situation of the troops, who had been cut off from their advance into France by a pincer movement from the German army, was regarded by the British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] as the greatest military defeat for centuries; it appeared likely to cost Britain the war, as the majority of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] was trapped, leaving the country vulnerable to invasion by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].&lt;ref name=Birkett&gt;Birkett, Peter. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/once-more-unto-the-beach-for-ships-that-saved-an-army-715466.html "Once more unto the beach for ships that saved an army"], ''The Independent'', 3 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.adls.org.uk/ "History"], The Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, Retrieved 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William. ''Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2004, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the shallow waters, British destroyers were unable to approach the beaches, and soldiers were having to wade out to the boats, many of them waiting hours shoulder deep in water.

On 27 May, the small-craft section of the British [[Minister of Shipping|Ministry of Shipping]] telephoned boat builders around the coast, asking them to collect all boats with "shallow [[Draft (hull)|draft]]" that could navigate the shallow waters. Attention was directed to the pleasure boats, private yachts and launches moored on the [[River Thames]] and along the south and east coasts. Some of them were taken with the owners' permission – and with the owners insisting they would sail them – while others were requisitioned by the government with no time for the owners to be contacted. The boats were checked to make sure they were seaworthy, fuelled, and taken to [[Ramsgate]] to set sail for Dunkirk. They were manned by Naval Officers, [[Naval rating|Ratings]] and experienced volunteers. Very few owners manned their own vessels, apart from fishermen and one or two others.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

When they reached France, some of the boats acted as shuttles between the beaches and the destroyers, ferrying soldiers to the warships. Others carried hundreds of soldiers each back to Ramsgate, protected by the [[Royal Air Force]] from the attacks of the [[Luftwaffe]].

According to the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, the term "Little Ship" applies to all craft that were originally privately owned and includes commercial vessels such as barges, fishing vessels and pleasure steamers; the Association does include some ex-Service vessels, which are now privately owned, and ex-lifeboats.

==Notable boats==
*''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|Royal Daffodil II]]'' – not to be confused with the smaller River Mersey ferry which did not go to Dunkirk, this vessel owned by the [[General Steam Navigation Company]] of London evacuated 7,461 service personnel from Dunkirk in five trips between 28 May and 2 June, among them the French historian [[Marc Bloch]],&lt;ref name="bloch"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marc Bloch: A Life in History |last=Fink |first=Carole |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-40671-4 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as a French army captain in the campaign. This was the largest number evacuated by a single passenger vessel in the operation.{{cn|date=February 2018}} On 2 June, she was attacked by six German aircraft. A bomb dropped by one of them penetrated two of her decks and blew a hole below the water line, but she managed to limp back to port. 
*''[[Medway Queen]]'' – the [[paddle steamer]] made the most round trips – seven – rescuing 7,000 men and earning herself the nickname "Heroine of Dunkirk". Restored and rededicated in 2013, she can now be visited at the [[Fort Gillingham|Gillingham Pier]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref name="GMB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmb.org.uk/newsroom/rebuilt-medway-queen-journey-to-kent|title=Rebuilt Medway Queen Journey To Kent|date=21 October 2013|publisher=GMB Newsroom|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit and Contact |url=https://www.medwayqueen.co.uk/visit-and-contact.html|work=The Medway Queen Preservation Society|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Massey Shaw]]'' – the London-based [[fireboat]] initially went to Dunkirk to help fight fires, however it ended up making three trips across the channel rescuing over 500 troops, including 30 troops from the ''Emil de Champ'' which had hit a mine in the Channel. 
*''[[Sundowner (yacht)|Sundowner]]'' – [[Motor yacht]] owned by [[Charles Lightoller]], former second officer of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]],'' was requisitioned by the Admiralty on 30 May. Lightoller insisted that, if anyone was going to take her to Dunkirk, it would be him and his eldest son, Roger, together with [[Sea Scout]] Gerald Ashcroft. The men transported 130 soldiers back to [[Ramsgate]], reportedly packed together like sardines, almost capsizing when they reached the shore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adls.org.uk/shipinfo.cfm?id=63&amp;RestTrust=0 "Sundowner."] ''The Association of Dunkirk Little Ships.'' Retrieved 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is a [[museum ship]] at the [[Ramsgate Maritime Museum]].
*''[[Bluebird of Chelsea]]'' – the yacht made two round trips to [[Kent]], carrying hundreds of men.&lt;ref name=Birkett/&gt;
*''[[Tamzine]]'' – a fishing boat less than {{convert|15|ft|m}} in length; the smallest boat to take part in the evacuation and now preserved by the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adls.org.uk/t1/node/582 |title=Tamzine |author=Association of Dunkirk Little Ships |date=2009–2010 |work=adls.org.uk |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marchioness'' – built in 1923, in 1989 she was involved in a [[Marchioness disaster|collision with ''Bowbelle'']] on the River Thames with the loss of 51 lives.
*{{SS|Clan MacAlister|1930|6}} – a 6,900-ton cargo ship from [[Glasgow]]. It was the largest merchant vessel used during the evacuation, and was sunk off the beach on 29 May. As it sank, it happened to settle evenly to the bottom in shallow water with the decks above water, and thereafter served as an unintentional decoy target for German Stuka dive-bombers. The British Admiralty later estimated the ''Clan MacAlister'' saved over a million pounds (sterling) worth of shipping.

===Isle of Man Steam Packet Company===
[[File:Dunkirk 1940 HU1145.jpg|thumb|Isle of Man Steam Packet Company vessel ''Mona's Queen,'' pictured as she struck a mine on the approach to Dunkirk, 29 May 1940.]]
At the outbreak of war, 10 of the 16 vessels in the fleet of the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] were requisitioned. Four were lost.

Eight of the company's ships took part in the Dunkirk evacuation. [[Mona's Isle (1905)|''Mona’s Isle'']] was the first to leave Dover, and the first vessel to complete a round trip. By the end of operations, the fleet had rescued a total of 24,699, 1 in 14 of those evacuated from Dunkirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steam-packet.com/en/AboutUs/|title=About Us|publisher=Steam Packet|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the evacuation is widely regarded as the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's ''"finest hour"'', it also saw its blackest day. Three of its ships were lost in one day, 29 May 1940.
* [[Mona's Queen (1934)|''Mona's Queen'']], mined off Dunkirk;
* [[SS Fenella (1936)|''Fenella'']], sunk by air attack whilst berthed alongside the East Pier;
* [[King Orry (1913)|''King Orry'']] sustained heavy damage in several air attacks on 29 May, and consequently sank off the beaches in the early hours of 30 May.

===Dutch coasters===
Thirty-nine Dutch [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]] had escaped the occupation of the [[Netherlands]] by the Germans on 10 May 1940 and were asked by the Dutch shipping bureau in London or by the Royal Navy to assist. The Dutch coasters, able to approach the beaches very closely due to their flat bottoms, rescued 22,698 men in total.

The {{MV|Rian}}, a {{convert|35|m|ft|adj=on}} ship of 300 tons dwt built in 1934 in the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], saved 2,542 men between 28 and 31 May 1940 under Captain D. Buining, the most men saved amongst the Dutch coasters. The vessel had already saved the crew of the British coaster {{SS|Highwave}} on 30 January 1940. Other Dutch coasters that saved more than 1,000 men each were:
* {{MV|Hondsrug}}: 1,455
* {{MV|Patria}}: 1,400
* {{MV|Hilda}}: 1,200
* {{MV|Doggersbank}}: 1,200
* {{MV|Horst}}: 1,150
* {{MV|Twente}}: 1,139
* {{MV|Friso}}: 1,002

Of these ships, seven were lost at Dunkirk or during the evacuation nearer the British coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wivonet.nl/operatiedynamo.htm|title=Operation Dynamo|publisher=wivonet.nl|accessdate=27 May 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgian ships===
The [[Belgian Army]], commanded by [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]], had surrendered to the Germans on 28 May. However, numerous ships from the fishing fleet and small ''[[Belgian Navy|Corps de Marine]]'' were involved in Operation Dynamo. In total, 65 Belgian ships participated, including 54 fishing boats, 4 ''Corps de Marine'' units, 4 tugs and 2 patrol vessels.&lt;ref name=KLMMRA1&gt;{{cite web|title=Dunkerque|publisher=[[KLM-MRA]] Séction Marine|url=http://www.marine-mra-klm.be/dunkerque_044.htm|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian fishing fleet itself transported 4,300 British and French soldiers to the English coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Navy Section Belge|url=http://www.marine-mra-klm.be/royal_navy_section_belge_047.htm|publisher=[[KLM-MRA]]|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the notable Belgian ships to participate in the evacuation were:

*{{ship|Z25|De Ruyter||}}
*[[Belgian ship H75]]

===Irish Marine and Coastwatching Ship===
An Irish Marine and Coastwatching Service [[Motor Torpedo Boat]] (MTB) made two separate trips to rescue allied soldiers during the Dunkirk evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressreader.com/ireland/the-irish-mail-on-sunday/20170716/282239485673782|title=Irish Navy sailors and Dunkirk|work=[[The Irish Mail on Sunday]]|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
In nine days, 192,226 British and 139,000 French soldiers – more than 331,000 total – were rescued by the 700 little ships and around 220 warships. The rescue operation turned a military disaster into a story of heroism which served to raise the morale of the British.

It was in describing the success of the operation to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 4 June 1940 that Churchill made his famous "[[we shall fight on the beaches]]" speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender ...&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston.

==Discovery==
MACS 1423-z7p64 was discovered through [[gravitational lensing]] by [[MACS J1423.8+2404]] (z = 0.545), a cluster that magnified its brightness by a factor of 10. To identify the galaxy, the astronomers used the slitless [[grism]] [[spectrograph]] of the [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], and to determine its distance the [[W. M. Keck Observatory#Instruments|Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE)]] detector of the [[Keck Observatory]].&lt;ref name="2017-04-10_Nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017-04-11_ABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-04-11/faintest-galaxy-from-early-universe-ever-detected/8428846|title=Astronomers detect ultra-faint galaxy from the very early universe]author=Weule, Genelle|publisher=[[ABC News Online]]|date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Nature received the paper on 27 October 2016.)&lt;ref name="2017-04-10_Nature" /&gt;
 
==Importance==
With a redshift z = 7.640 ± 0.001, and being an [[order of magnitude]] lower in intensity than the four other Lyman-α emitters currently known at z &gt; 7.5, it is probably the most distant representative source of reionization found to date.&lt;ref name="2017-04-10_Nature" /&gt; This is from a time when the universe was around 700 million years old.&lt;ref name="2017-04-11_ABC" /&gt;

The '''Nansen International Office for Refugees''' (''{{lang-fr|Office International Nansen pour les Réfugiés}}'') was an organization established in 1930 by the [[League of Nations]] and named after [[Fridtjof Nansen]], soon after his death, which was internationally in charge of [[refugee]]s from war areas between 1930 and 1939. It is noted for developing the [[Nansen passport]] which allowed [[statelessness|stateless]] people to travel between countries. It received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1938/nansen/history/ |title=Nansen International Office for Refugees - History|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkivverket.no/eng/content/view/full/6927 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194955/http://www.arkivverket.no/eng/content/view/full/6927 |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dupuis-Nansen-Carle-Savio-Quisling.jpg|thumb|right|The Armenia commission of the League of Nations. From left, on the first row are [[Georges Carle]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and C.E. Dupuis. In the background are [[Vidkun Quisling]] (left) and [[Pio Le Savio]] (right).]]

The ''Office International Nansen pour les Réfugiés'' was established in 1930 by the League of Nations, shortly after the death of its name patron Fridtjof Nansen to continue his successful work in international aid for refugee. It thus continued the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Nansen in 1921.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"/&gt; The League also provided the administrative expenses for the Nansen Office though only for fees charged for the Nansen passport since its revenues for welfare and relief were obtained from private contributions. 

The organization was to supply material and political support to refugees. For refugees from the [[Third Reich]] or from the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]-torn [[Spanish State|Spain]], the Nansen aid was not applicable, though many countries refused to accept the refugees. 

In spite of such problems, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization in 1938 for its work, but due to its dissolution shortly afterwards, the prize money was received by a newly founded refugee organization of the League of Nations. The office was dissolved at the same time as the League dissolved the High Commission (established in 1933) because of the problems surrounding German refugees after the dissolution of the Third Reich.

==Accomplishments==
The Nansen Office accomplished numerous tasks while it existed. 

The Office was responsible for the adoption by fourteen countries of the 1933 Refugee Convention which was a modest charter of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article/11/4/597/1546767|title=Britain and the 1933 Refugee Convention: National or State Sovereignty?|first=RobertJ|last=Beck|date=20 October 1999|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Refugee Law|volume=11|issue=4|pages=597–624|via=ijrl.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/ijrl/11.4.597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3dd8cf374.html|title=Refworld - Convention Relating to the International Status of Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11580/|title=Convention on the International Status of Refugees|date=28 October 1933|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Jaeger, “[https://www.icrc.org/ara/assets/files/other/727_738_jaeger.pdf On the History of the International Protection of Refugees],” International Review of the Red Cross (Revue Internationale de la Croix-Rouge), vol. 83, no. 843 (September 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nansen Office was instrumental in finding shelter in specially constructed houses in villages in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] for 40,000 [[Armenians]], after the resettlement of another 10,000 in [[Yerevan]]. 

The Nansen International Office for Refugees was responsible for the successful settlement of the Saar refugees in [[Paraguay]] after 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1938/nansen-history.html|title=Nansen International Office for Refugees - History|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newington Butts Theatre''' was one of the earliest [[Elizabethan theatre]]s, possibly predating even [[The Theatre]] of 1576 and the [[Curtain Theatre]], which are usually regarded as the first dedicated playhouses in London. William Ingram believes it was probably the first of the three to begin construction, and may have been the first completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London | first=William | last=Ingram | publisher = Cornell University Press | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-8014-2671-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0PqSqgTWVEC&amp;pg=PA150 | page= 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and in 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city.&lt;ref name=Ordish&gt;{{citation |title= Early London Theatres: In the Fields | year=1899 | first= Thomas | last=Fairman Ordish | publisher = Elliot Stock | location=London | page= 30 | url=https://archive.org/details/earlylondonthea02ordigoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell (in Shoreditch) and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at Newington near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields.&lt;ref name=Ordish /&gt; The Newington theatre was located not on Newington Butts but on the east side of Walworth Road near the junction with New Kent Road.&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;{{citation | title=Survey of London Volume 25 – St George's Fields, the Parishes of St. George the Martyr Southwark and St. Mary, Newington | first=Ida | last=Darlington | publisher=London County Council | year=1955 | url=https://archive.org/details/surveyoflondon25londuoft | pages= 83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The playhouse stood less than an acre of land in Lurklane, occupying {{convert|48|yards}} of frontage on what became Walworth Road and bounded to the south by a drainage ditch (or "sewer" in the language of the time).&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 157–158 Ingram has a general map on page  151 and a more detailed map on p 161&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram uses Commissions of Sewers records of 1576–1578 to deduce that the actor Jerome Savage lived adjacent to the sewer and thus the playhouse was in the northern part of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; The Reliance Building used to occupy the site;&lt;ref name=Survey /&gt; it is now under the southern roundabout of the Elephant and Castle junction.

Lurklane was {{convert|10|acre}} out of {{convert|35|acre}} leased in 1566 from the [[Dean of Canterbury|Dean and Chapter]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by Richard Hick(e)s. Hicks was a [[Worshipful Company of Grocers|grocer]] and member of the royal retinue, sometimes described as a "yeoman of the guard".&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 153–157 discusses Hicks in detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks sublet Lurklane to Jerome Savage on or about Lady Day (25 March) 1576, some three weeks before the lease was signed for [[The Theatre]] in [[Shoreditch]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) p 164&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon after the 1576 lease was signed, Hicks and his son-in-law Peter Hunningborne tried to rescind it. They failed to do so through the courts, but used trickery to make Savage default on his rent on Lady Day 1577.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Savage appears to have stayed on the premises, and in turn sought the protection of the law as Hunningborne sought to move into Savage's residence.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; Hunningborne described Savage as "a verrie lewed fealowe" who "liveth by noe other trade than playinge of staige plaies and Interlevdes".&lt;ref name=Ingram168&gt;Ingram (1992) p 168&lt;/ref&gt; However the sewer assessments indicate that Savage remained on the premises, so the lawsuit may have been withdrawn or settled out of court.&lt;ref name=Ingram168 /&gt;

Wickham ''et al'' interpret these documents to mean that Hicks constructed a 'house or tenement' that someone (presumably the actor Savage) converted into a playhouse.&lt;ref name=Wickham321&gt;{{citation | title= English professional theatre, 1530–1660 | first1=Glynne William | last1=Gladstone Wickham| first2=Herbert | last2=Berry | first3=William | last3=Ingram | publisher= Cambridge University Press | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-23012-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y82YJ1P5gksC&amp;pg=PA321 | page= 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was clearly established by Lady Day 1577 and like the Theatre may have been in use before the winter of 1576/77,&lt;ref name=Ingram170&gt;Ingram (1992) p 170&lt;/ref&gt; or even in 1575.&lt;ref name=Wickham320&gt;Wickham ''et al'' (2000) p 320&lt;/ref&gt; Savage may have built the theatre under the patronage of the [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] whose company of actors first performed at court on 14 February 1575.&lt;ref name=Wickham320/&gt; Warwick had been appointed to the Privy Council in the autumn of 1573, and the more powerful privy councillors – the earls of [[Sussex's Men|Sussex]], [[Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Arundel]] and his younger brother [[Leicester's Men|Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] – were all patrons of playing companies.&lt;ref name=Ingram172&gt;Ingram (1992) p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Warwick's company appears to have flourished for around five years,&lt;ref name=Ingram172 /&gt; before ill-health forced him to retire to his home in Herfordshire. On 13 May 1580 the Privy Council wrote to the Surrey justices about an unknown company playing at Newington Butts despite a ban on theatre.&lt;ref name=Ingram174&gt;Ingram (1992) p 174&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that John and Lawrence Dutton led members of Warwick's company to reform as the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]'s players by April 1580, and Ingram speculates that it was they who were playing at their old home.&lt;ref name=Ingram174 /&gt;  Oxford was sent to the [[Tower of London]] in 1581, banished from court until 1 June 1583&lt;ref&gt;Historical Manuscripts Commission, The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland, i, p.  150&lt;/ref&gt; and went off to war in Flanders in 1585. John Dutton left for the newly formed [[Queen's Men]] in 1583 but Oxford's Men survived the loss of their leader, being recorded in each year 1584–1587 and leaving traces of activity thereafter.&lt;ref name=Ingram175&gt;Ingram (1992) p 175&lt;/ref&gt;

A sewer record of 26 February 1591 refers to Hunningborne and the playhouse.&lt;ref name=Ingram176&gt;Ingram (1992) p 176&lt;/ref&gt; By that time it seems to have been in decline, as more theatres sprung up closer to London. Some time in the early 1590s (and definitely before September 1593) [[Lord Strange's Men]] played three days there, but the undated Privy Council document comments on the inconvenience of its location and "of longe tyme plaies haue not there bene vsed on working daies".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Elizabethan stage |year=1923 | first=Edmund Kerchever | last=Chambers | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethanstage04chamuoft | pages= 312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plague closed down London's theatres for most of the period between 22 June 1592 and 14 May 1594.&lt;ref name=Wickham328&gt;Wickham ''et al'' (2000) p 328&lt;/ref&gt; The impresario [[Philip Henslowe]] took the opportunity to remodel his [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], but for some reason the Privy Council kept it closed from 16 May to 15 June 1594.&lt;ref name=Wickham328 /&gt;

Accordingly Henslowe promoted a series of plays at Newington Butts from 3–13 June 1594 with the [[Admiral's Men]] and [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], the two companies that had emerged from Lord Strange's men during the layoff.&lt;ref name=Wickham328 /&gt; The nature of Henslowe's relationship with Newington Butts is uncertain, Vickers among others has suggested Henslowe owned it by this time&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | first=Brian | last= Vickers | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwpUt5qY8sEC&amp;pg=PA149 | page= 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Wickham ''et al'' speculate that the poor profits he recorded for the season were in part due to the cost of renting the theatre.&lt;ref name=Wickham328 /&gt; The ownership theory might be bolstered by Winifred Frazer's suggestion that the enigmatic abbreviation 'ne' used by Henslowe in his records of certain plays, conventionally taken to mean a new play, applies to a performance at Newington.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Henslowe's 'ne' | first=Winifred | last=Frazer | journal=Notes &amp; Queries | volume=38 | year=1991 | pages= 34–35 | doi=10.1093/nq/38.1.34 | url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/1/34.full.pdf+html | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This season of plays in June 1594 is well documented, as Henslowe kept assiduous records in his "Diary".&lt;ref&gt;The June 1594 season was as follows : 3rd ''Hester and [[Ahasuerus]]'', 4th ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'', 5th ''[[Titus Andronicus|Andronicus]]'', 6th ''Cutlack'' (since lost), 7th (no show), 8th ''Bellendon'' (since lost), 9th ''[[Hamlet]]'', 10th ''Hester'', 11th ''[[The Taming of a Shrew]]'', 12th ''Andronicus'', 13th ''The Jew''&lt;/ref&gt; These include some of the earliest known performances of familiar names such as ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[The Taming of a Shrew]]''&lt;!--note, not "The" Shrew --&gt; but in each case the exact relationship between the 1594 plays and those we know as [[Shakespeare]]'s is uncertain and controversial among scholars. Rutter regards the ''Titus'' put on by Henslowe at the Rose in January 1594 as "almost certainly Shakespeare's",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Documents of the Rose Playhouse |first=Carol Chillington | last= Rutter | publisher = Manchester University Press | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-7190-5801-1 | page= 78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGzoae4J55sC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is very early for the ''Hamlet'' of the [[Second Quarto]] and [[First Folio]], which is ascribed to around 1600.&lt;ref name=Tronch-Perez&gt;{{citation | title=A synoptic Hamlet: a critical-synoptic edition of the second quarto and first folio texts of Hamlet | first=Jesús | last=Tronch-Pérez | publisher=Universitat de València | year=2002  | isbn=978-84-370-5381-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlKm5SqMCD0C&amp;pg=PA26 | page= 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other evidence has led to the theory that the 1600 text is based on an earlier play, the so-called "''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''", which was written by either Thomas Kyd, Shakespeare, or someone else.&lt;ref name=Tronch-Perez /&gt; This performance is the first one on record of Ur-Hamlet,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Oral traditions and gender in early modern literary texts | first1=Mary Ellen | last1=Lamb | first2=Karen | last2=Bamford | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7546-5538-1 |page= 133 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmqsi_wRK34C&amp;pg=PA133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it appears to have existed since at least 1589.&lt;ref name=Tronch-Perez /&gt;

On 6 July 1594 the Dean and Chapter let the playhouse site to Paul Buck, on condition that he convert the playhouse to other uses and that no more plays were performed after [[Michaelmas]] (29 September).&lt;ref name=Ingram176 /&gt; Buck seems to have complied – there is no mention of the playhouse in the renewal of his lease on 5 April 1595, and on 5 October 1599 the Sewer Commission refers to "the houses where the old playe house did stand att Newington".&lt;ref name=Ingram176 /&gt; The theatrical links lingered after the theatre was gone; a bad pun is referred to as a "Newington conceit" in a play of 1612&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (1923) vol 2 p 405, referring to [[Nathan Field|Field]]'s ''[[A Woman is a Weathercock]]'' III. iii. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and the playwright [[Thomas Middleton]] died there and was buried at Newington Butts church on 4 July 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Cambridge History of English Literature 6, Part 2: The Drama to 1642, Volume 6 | first1= Alfred Rayney | last1=Waller | first2=Adolphus William | last2=Ward | publisher = CUP Archive | year=1920 | isbn=978-0-521-04520-9 | page= 58 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTc8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuremberg principles''' were a set of guidelines for determining what constitutes a [[war crime]]. The document was created by the [[International Law Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] to [[Codification (law)|codify]] the legal principles underlying the [[Nuremberg Trials]] of [[Nazism|Nazi]] party members following [[World War II]].

== The principles ==
=== Principle I ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person who commits an act which constitutes a [[international criminal law|crime under international law]] is responsible therefor&lt;!-- "therefor", with no final "e", is not the same word as "therefore", with a final "e".  These are two different words that mean two different things.  This one should have NO final "e". --&gt; and liable to punishment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle II ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that [[internal law]] does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under [[international law]] does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle III ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law, acted as [[Head of State]] or [[responsible government]] [[official]], does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle IV ===
{{Main|Superior orders}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This principle could be paraphrased as follows: "It is not an acceptable excuse to say 'I was just following my superior's orders'".

Previous to the time of the [[Nuremberg Trials]], this excuse was known in common parlance as "[[Superior Orders]]". After the prominent, high-profile event of the Nuremberg Trials, that excuse is now referred to by many as the "[[Nuremberg Defense]]".  In recent times, a third term, "[[lawful orders]]" has become common parlance for some people. All three terms are in use today, and they all have slightly different nuances of meaning, depending on the context in which they are used.

Nuremberg Principle IV is legally supported by the [[jurisprudence]] found in [[Conscientious objector#Universal Declaration of Human Rights|certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which deal indirectly with conscientious objection]]. It is also supported by [[Conscientious objector#Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status|the principles found in paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status]] which was issued by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). Those principles deal with the conditions under which [[conscientious objector]]s can apply for refugee status in another country if they face persecution in their own country for refusing to participate in an illegal war.

=== Principle V ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person charged with a crime under international law has the [[right to a fair trial]] on the facts and law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle VI ===

{{quote|The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:

:(a) '''[[Crimes against peace and humanity]]''':

::(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or a plan of a [[war of aggression]] or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;

::(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).

:(b) '''[[War crimes]]''':

:Violations of the [[laws or customs of war]] which include, but are not limited to, [[murder]], ill-treatment or [[deportation]] to [[slave labor]] or for any other purpose of [[civilian]] [[population]] of or in [[occupied territory]]; murder or ill-treatment of [[prisoners of war]] or [[shipwreck|persons on the Seas]], killing of [[hostage]]s, [[plunder]] of [[Public property|public]] or [[private property]], wanton destruction of [[cities]], [[town]]s, or [[villages]], or devastation not justified by [[military necessity]].

:(c) '''[[Crimes against humanity]]''':

:Murder, extermination, enslavement, [[deportation]] and other inhumane acts done against any civilian population, or [[persecutions]] on political, racial, or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime.}}

=== Principle VII ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Principles' power or lack of power==

{{see also|Sources of international law|International legal theory}}

In the period just prior to the June 26, 1945 signing of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[governments]] participating in its drafting were opposed to conferring on the [[United Nations]] [[legislative power]] to enact binding [[procedural law|rules]] of [[international law]]. As a corollary, they also rejected proposals to confer on the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] the power to impose certain general conventions on states by some form of majority vote. There was, however, strong support for conferring on the General Assembly the more limited powers of study and recommendation, which led to the adoption of Article 13 in [[Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter#Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16|Chapter IV of the Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Nuremberg Principles were developed by UN organs under that limited mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/ilc/ Drafting and implementation of Article 13, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike treaty law, [[customary international law]] is not written. To prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the [[international community]] that such practice is required as a matter of law. (For example, the [[Nuremberg Trials]] were a "practice" of the "international law" of the Nuremberg Principles; and that "practice" was supported by the international community.) In this context, "practice" relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible. If this contrary practice is condemned by other states then the rule is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) [http://www.icrc.org/eng/customary-law Customary international humanitarian law]&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Sources of international law]])

In 1947, under [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 177 (II), paragraph (a), the [[International Law Commission]] was directed to "formulate the principles of international law recognized in the Charter of the [[Nuremberg Tribunal]] and in the judgment of the Tribunal." In the course of the consideration of this subject, the question arose as to whether or not the Commission should ascertain to what extent the principles contained in the Charter and judgment constituted principles of international law. The conclusion was that since the Nuremberg Principles had been affirmed by the General Assembly, the task entrusted to the Commission was not to express any appreciation of these principles as principles of international law but merely to formulate them. The text above was adopted by the Commission at its second session. The Report of the Commission also contains commentaries on the principles (see Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, Vol. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;374–378).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) [[#References|References]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/390?OpenDocument Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nüremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of the principles supported and not supported==

{{for|examples relating to Principle IV (from before, during, and after the Nuremberg Trials)|Superior Orders}}

=== The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ===

Concerning Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual's responsibility, it could be argued that a version of the [[Superior Orders]] defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]]. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.)  Article 33, titled "Superior Orders and prescription of law,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Part 3: General Principles of Criminal Law; Article 33: Superior orders and prescription of law|author= Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|date=10 November 1998 and 12 July 1999 |work= |publisher=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
states:

{{quote|1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless:

*(a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;
*(b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and
*(c) The order was not manifestly unlawful.}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two interpretations of this Article:

*This formulation, especially (1)(a), whilst effectively prohibiting the use of the Nuremberg Defense in relation to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, does however, appear to allow the Nuremberg Defense to be used as a protection against charges of war crimes, provided the relevant criteria are met.
*Nevertheless, this interpretation of ICC Article 33 is open to debate: For example, Article 33 (1)(c) protects the defendant only if "the order was not manifestly unlawful." The "order" could be considered "unlawful" if we consider [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]] to be the applicable "law"  in this case.  If so, then the defendant is not protected.  Discussion as to whether or not Nuremberg Principle IV is the applicable law in this case is found in [[Nuremberg Principles#The Principles.27 power or lack of power|a discussion of the Nuremberg Principles' power or lack of power]].

===Canada===
{{main|Jeremy Hinzman}}

Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual's responsibility, was also at issue in [[Canada]] in the case of ''Hinzman v. Canada.'' [[Jeremy Hinzman]] was a [[U.S. Army]] [[deserter]] who claimed [[refugee]] status in Canada as a [[conscientious objector]], one of [[List of Iraq War resisters#Objectors who fled to Canada|many Iraq War resisters]]. Hinzman's lawyer, [[Jeffry House]], had previously raised the issue of the [[legality of the Iraq War]] as having a bearing on their case. The [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2006-05-18/news_story5.php|title=AWOL GIs Dealt Legal Blow|date=2006-05-18|author=Mernagh, M.|publisher=Toronto's Now Magazine|accessdate=2008-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324194828/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2006-05-18/news_story5.php|archivedate=2007-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://reports.fja.gc.ca/eng/2006/2006fc420/2006fc420.html|title=Hinzman v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2383">An '''official function''' is either an event, such as a [[convention (meeting)|convention]], that has an official purpose for one's employment, vocation or profession-whether run by a person, institution or governmental agency-or an official duty.

Attending events with official purposes is one of the duties of many persons in many organizations.  Attending such events fall into categories of [[social network|networking]], [[etiquette|protocol]], information gathering, among others. Networking may involve an economic network, an [[entrepreneurial network]], an [[old boy network]], a [[social network]], and a [[value network]]. Protocol deals with etiquette and other forms of [[intercultural competence]] that should be followed to show respect for those with whom one is networking. Information may be gained as a message, a pattern, or an input.

Attending events with official purposes helps one build an [[augmented social network]], a  [[community of practice]], and a [[network of practice]]. Such attendance increases occupational [[Skill|competence]] and achievement.

Official duties are those performed to facilitate the achievement of one's assignments as an employee.  They may include duties that are performed in a routine manner and duties whose performance demonstrates innovation and leadership. They may include duties that are commonly performed, and duties that must be performed because of new circumstances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4625">'''Otto Witte''' (October 16, 1872 – August 13, 1958) was a [[Germans|German]] circus acrobat and fantasist who said that he managed to be crowned [[King of Albania]].

[[File:Otto Witte Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Otto Witte's grave in Ohlsdorf Cemetery, Hamburg]]

In 1913, when [[Albania]] broke away from the [[Ottoman Empire]], some [[Islam in Albania|Albanian Muslims]] invited Halim Eddine, a nephew of the [[Sultan]], to come and be crowned king.  Noticing his own resemblance to Halim Eddine, Witte said, he traveled to [[Durrës]] with a friend, the [[sword swallowing|sword-swallower]] Max Schlepsig.  He claimed that he had succeeded in being crowned king by the local troops on 13 August 1913. He also claimed that, over the next five days, he enjoyed a [[harem]] and declared war on [[Montenegro]] before his ruse was discovered.  His claims also include that he took a substantial portion of the kingdom's treasury,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Bellemare (dir.), ''Les Génies de l'arnaque'', Albin Michel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and along with Schlepsig he managed to escape the palace with the aid of the harem, and eventually made their way out of the country.

Most parts of his story were found to be impossible. There was no Halim Eddine and the Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s son Burhan Eddine, who was offered the throne in 1914, never came; he may be the model for this story.  Originally he claimed this escapade happened in February 1913, when Albania was still under [[Serbia]]n occupation, so he changed the date to August 1913.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} There is no local evidence to support his claims. Nevertheless, he became famous in Germany for his public appearance. The [[Berlin]] police later allowed his official [[identity card]] to bear the artistic [[pseudonym]] ''ehemaliger König von Albanien'' ("former King of Albania"). For the rest of his life he insisted on being greeted with that title, and it was put on his tombstone at [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]], Hamburg (Parzelle Q 9, 430–433).

He may have suffered from [[pseudologia fantastica]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}; for example, he claimed to have founded a [[political party]].  He said he was a candidate for the [[president of Germany|German presidency]] in 1925, gaining 25,000 to 230,000 votes in the first round but resigning in favour of [[Paul von Hindenburg]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The voting records do not support this either. 

Interest in Albania was high in the German-speaking world because the [[Great Powers]] had chosen a German prince to sit on the throne.  [[William, Prince of Albania|William of Wied]] was approached for the job in 1913 and ruled for six months in 1914.&lt;ref name =Heaton-Armstrong&gt;{{cite book| last =Heaton-Armstrong| first =Duncan| title =The Six Month Kingdom: Albania 1914| publisher =I.B.Tauris| year =2005| isbn =1-85043-761-0| nopp =true }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The similarity in name between Wied and Witte may have inspired Witte to make up the story.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Adaptions==

Otto Witte's story was adapted by [[Harry Turtledove]] for his [[fantasy novel]] ''[[Every Inch a King]]''.  Witte's story bears a strong resemblance to the best-selling [[adventure novel]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894), of which the first [[film adaptation]] was released in 1913.  The central concept of ''Zenda'' is a commoner being mistaken for a king, and assuming his place. Another adaption of Otto Witte's story is in the 2012 novel "If you're reading this I'm already dead" by [[Andrew Nicoll]].

Various newspapers and magazines took Otto's story as fact and repeated it, including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which published an article about his tale in 1958.

==Early life==
Van Helsum was born on 22 April 1992 to Doreen and Johan van Helsum. Van Helsum's parents divorced shortly after he was born, and his mother emigrated to Portugal taking him and his older brother. As a child, he was rebellious towards his father&lt;ref name=vanhelsum&gt;{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Damien|title=Forest boy 'inspired by 'Zeitgeist' movie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9337209/Forest-boy-inspired-by-Zeitgeist-movement.html#|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to be shy and rarely socialised. He is reportedly a fan of American cartoons [[South Park]] and [[Family Guy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest boy 'was in adolescent crisis'|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20120617-43201.html|publisher=The Local|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Helsum's father Johan fought and won a custody case against his ex-wife and moved his sons back to the Netherlands upon their return to his legal guardianship. His father was known by his coworkers to be a dedicated father and brought up the children on a strict routine. Van Helsum had become traumatised as his mother attempted to contact her son by sending him gifts with van Helsum showing no interest.&lt;ref name=child&gt;{{cite web|last=Goessl|first=Leigh|title=Mystery surrounding Germany's 'Forest Boy' continues to unfold|url=http://digitaljournal.com/article/327023|publisher=Digital Journal|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the ROC van Twente College to study Media and Communications.

One week before his trek into Germany, van Helsum posted a message on the internet stating the need for housing for a long period of time to share with a roommate.&lt;ref name=vanderwyk /&gt;

==Disappearance==
Van Helsum made a five-day trek into Germany from his residence in [[Hengelo]], [[Netherlands]] with a friend named Lex.&lt;ref name=vanhelsum /&gt; The pair hiked with the help of a map and compass, and both stayed in tents overnight.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez |first=Michael |title=German police seek help identifying teen who lived in woods |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-13/world/germany-forest-boy_1_german-police-german-authorities-berlin-police?_s=PM:EUROPE |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709002814/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-13/world/germany-forest-boy_1_german-police-german-authorities-berlin-police?_s=PM%3AEUROPE |archivedate= 9 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed up at [[Berlin City Hall]] on 5 September 2011.&lt;ref name="mysterious"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mcullen|first=Troy|title=Mysterious 'Forest Boy' Identified by German Police|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/mysterious-forest-boy-identified-german-police/story?id=16574288|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke to the office workers saying; "I'm all alone in the world, I don't know who I am.

===In care===
Believed to be a minor and an orphan, van Helsum was provided shelter in social care housing in western Berlin by the Berlin [[Jugendamt]] (Youth Office). During his time in care, he was around other teenagers but had spoken little, having little knowledge of the German language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chuck|first=Elizabeth|title=Caregiver: Forest boy 'like a normal teenager' |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44599344/ns/world_news-europe/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Helsum shared a room with another boy, showing the ability to eat with a knife and fork and went bowling with fellow residents.

===Identification===
[[Bild]] newspaper published a blurred photograph head and shoulders portrait of van Helsum. The photograph was blurred as the authorities suspected him of being a minor.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; In November 2011, van Helsum's [[DNA]] was taken to a local police data bank after he initially refused to give a sample.

With the attempts at identification of "Forest boy Ray" having failed, the Berlin police released a photograph in early June 2012, requesting identification.&lt;ref name="mysterious"/&gt; Van Helsum was then identified by a former girlfriend, whereupon he admitted having made up his story.&lt;ref name="Rising20120615"/&gt; After he was identified, he phoned his stepmother asking her if he could return to her home for rest.&lt;ref name=stepmother&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Allan|title=Fake 'Forest Boy' who claimed to have lost his memory disappears AGAIN (just as police prepared to sue him for £20,000 for cost of his care)|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2205587/Dutch-20-year-old-posed-Forest-Boy-disappears-German-police-sue-20-000-cost-care.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]] ([[Daily Mail and General Trust]])|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
The Nutrien Fringe is held in July / August annually in Saskatoon. The festival features independent theatre from around the world, Canada, and Saskatchewan in a schedule of 200+ shows. Additional attractions include Saskatoon's only ten-day street festival with craft vendors, food vendors and professional buskers. 50,000 people attend the event annually and the ticketed theatre audience is 11,000.

The show schedule typically features thirty-three (33) theatre groups with the slots equally allocated to Saskatchewan artists, national artists and international artists. The selection process is a lottery system. The artist call opens in September annually. Information and registration forms are available online at www.yxefringe.com.

==History==

The Saskatoon Fringe Festival was first launched and produced by 25th Street Theatre Artistic Director Tom Bentley. The first (mini) Fringe was held in the summer of 1989 in the Duchess Street theatre venue in Saskatoon, as touring Fringe theatre artists between Winnipeg and Edmonton's Fringe sought performance opportunities in Saskatoon. In 1990, the Fringe moved to its regular Broadway Avenue venues to great success with a 6000 seat audience in its first full offering of theatre.

Saskatoon now proudly hosts one of the top ten Fringes in North America by artist earnings and has garnered a reputation as one of the favorites on the Canadian Fringe tour.

A '''secret identity''' is a person's alter ego which is not known to the general populace, most often used in fiction. Brought into popular culture by [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] in 1903, the concept is particularly prevalent in the [[American comic book]] genre, and is a more genre-specific version of the broader [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[Masquerade (trope)|masquerade]].

In American comic books, a character typically has dual identities, with one identity being the [[superhero]] persona and the other being the secret identity. The secret identity is typically the superhero's civilian persona when they are not assuming the superhero persona. It is kept hidden from their enemies and the general public to protect themselves from legal ramifications, pressure, or public scrutiny, as well as to protect their friends and loved ones from harm secondary to their actions as superheroes.

The secret identity commonly consists of the superhero's given birth name and may involve an occupation they had before becoming a superhero. This is in contrast to the superhero identity, which often utilizes a [[pseudonym]] and sometimes a mask to complete a costume to conceal the superhero's secret identity. To help further preserve the anonymity of secret identities, characters may use eyeglasses, particular clothing, or display a different set of personal characteristics when assuming the secret identity persona. For example, the superhero [[Batman]]'s secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire who is known to the public for his affluent playboy lifestyle. Another example is [[Superman]], who does not wear a mask when he is in costume, but wears eyeglasses and appears mild-mannered when he assumes his secret identity of Clark Kent.

Types of characters that may have secret identities include heroes, [[superhero]]es, [[thief|thieves]], [[villain]]s, [[supervillain]]s, [[vigilante]]s, [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, and "[[monster]]s". A character may have several secret identities simultaneously, such as adopted names or [[undercover]] identities.

==History==

Myth and legend is filled with stories of gods or heroes who took on other identities for various purposes.  A significant precursor to the 20th century concept of a secret identity in fiction is ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1844) by [[Alexandre Dumas]], a huguely popular story which was frequently dramatized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In this story, the protagonist Edmund Dantes takes on the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo in order to carry out his plan of revenge against the men who were responsible for his downfall and imprisonment.

Art by [[Brian Bolland]].]]
The modern popular culture use of secret identities begins in the early 20th century with characters such as [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (1903), [[Jimmie_Dale|Jimmie Dale, the Gray Seal]] (1914), [[Zorro]] (1919), and the [[Lone Ranger]] (1933). A line in the novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' reads, "Because the Scarlet Pimpernel works in the dark, and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orczy|first1=Baroness|title=the Scarlet Pimpernel - CHAPTER IV THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL|date=2005|publisher=Hodder|location=London|isbn=0340894989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scarlet Pimpernel is the name of a chivalrous Englishman, Sir Percy Blakeney, who exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] at each of his interventions).&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=A Brief History of Superheroes: From Superman to the Avengers, the Evolution of Comic Book Legends|date=2014|publisher=Hatchet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; By drawing attention to his alter ego Blakeney he hides behind his public face as a slow thinking foppish playboy (like [[Bruce Wayne]]), and he also establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aid his endeavours.&lt;ref name="Robb"/&gt;

Starting in the 1930s, the concept of crime-fighters, [[superhero]]es, and [[vigilante]]s (and their adversaries) adopting secret identities became more widespread in [[dime novel]]s, [[pulp magazine]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[old-time radio|old-time]] [[radio drama]]s, [[Serial (film)|movie serials]], and other [[popular fiction]] and such characters remain popular to this day.  Superman appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' in 1938 as one of the forerunners amongst a [[list of superhero debuts]].

==Purpose==

The artistic purpose of the secret identity on the part of the writers is that it allows the characters to have ordinary lives, which can allow for human drama as well as create [[suspense|tension]] with the effort needed to preserve the secret.  This can include challenges such as throwing off the suspicions of associates who suspect, and the need to quickly improvise means to get out of sight to change identities.  And [[superhuman]] characters may benefit from an [[everyman]] aspect through having a secret identity, giving them a [[sympathy|sympathetic]] link to their audience.  For example, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s secret identity is a boy named Billy Batson - a deliberate attempt to play on the daydreams of a young readership.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Some common [[motivation]]s for a character to keep a secret identity include:
*Allowing the character to live a "normal life" when not fighting crime.
*Preventing the hero's enemies from seeking revenge on others the hero may care about.
*Giving the hero an advantage in crime fighting (e.g. Batman or [[The Shadow]] striking fear into criminals).
*Gaining timely information on incidents as they happen, often through their occupation or that of their associates (e.g. a [[reporter]] or a [[newscaster]] would likely be more informed about incidents that a hero might be able to help with).
*Gaining information on criminal investigations or on crimes being planned (e.g., in his early days as Batman, Bruce Wayne would learn about ongoing investigations from [[Commissioner Jim Gordon|Commissioner Gordon]], while [[Plastic Man]]'s alter ego, criminal Eel O'Brien, would go along on other crimes, only to capture his cohorts as Plastic Man).
*[[Fictional extraterrestrials|Aliens]], upon coming to Earth, may choose to set up one or more secret identities as a ''learning tool''. By pretending to be humans, they can explore the different roles and lives that a regular human is expected to have in his/her life and using their deeper understanding of human condition to help others.
*To avoid legal ramifications or public scrutiny due to accountability with the collateral damage superheroes are often involved with, which carries the risk of imprisonment or becoming a public [[Outcast (person)|pariah]] such as from being branded as a [[vigilante]]. Villains such as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] also use this reason to hide their unlawful actions to protect their social standing.
*To allow the public to admire their super alter-ego as its own entity, not weakened by the mortality of their "normal" counterpart.

==The question of genuine identity==

Sometimes the distinction as to which persona is the "real one" may be blurred or confused, as has sometimes been the case with [[Clark Kent]] and [[Superman]]. In the earliest Superman comics, Clark's primary purpose was to fulfill the perceived requirement that a superhero cannot remain on full duty all the time and Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Superman's activities.  In the television series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', after [[Lois Lane]] learns that Superman is Clark Kent, he discusses his dual identity with her. "Clark Kent is not a disguise. Clark is who I am, while Superman is what I do."  

The compromises that Clark still needed to make to secure his alter-egos were limited as the [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Pa Kent]] of the ''Man of Steel'' comics enthusiastically explains: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;"SEE MA? WITH HIS HAIR ALL SLICKERED BACK AND AN OLD PAIR OF MY SPECTACLES, HIS WHOLE FACE SEEMS TO CHANGE.  ALL HE NEEDS TO DO IS '''''STOOP''''' A TAD AND HE LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MAN.  AND SO LONG AS HE'S CAREFUL NEVER TO LET ON THAT HE '''''HAS''''' TWO SEPARATE IDENTITIES, HE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE FREELY LIKE ORDINARY FOLKS!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man of Steel #1, Chapter2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beyond stooping, Clark develops a tendency of avoiding conflict.  Sometimes this is in order to allow him to change into his alter ego. while at other times it is to maintain a consistently non-Superman type image. In either case, it opens the "mild mannered" reporter to the [[Social stigma|stigma]] of cowardice and weakness. Superman's face remains uncovered on the justification that he wants to be trusted by people while [[Batman]] wears a mask partly because he wants to be feared by criminals.  It has also been suggested that [[Bruce Wayne]] is "the mask" that Batman wears, meaning that Batman is the true persona, hidden by his public image.

Heroes in this type of situation are known to find their love interests developing interests in and even infatuations for their heroic personas, as a dual identity can have an influence on romantic attraction. Lois Lane found herself attracted to Superman but is fairly indifferent towards Clark Kent and for years bore some resentment towards him. Similarly, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] was madly in love with [[Spider-Man]] but was utterly replused by his revelation as Peter Parker, which eventually led to their break-up. Following a reset that [[Mindwipe|erased her memory]] of his secret identity, Black Cat and Spider-Man have a strictly "masks-on" relationship whenever they engage in [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again]] romance.

Characters who experience an actual transformation when changing from one persona may have two relatively genuine identities, albeit with additional possibilities of inner conflict.  An example of this is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner who needs to seek genuine calmness in order to prevent transforming into the genuinely raging [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Other characters have abilities that help them conceal their identities such as: [[shapeshifting]] or [[mind control]].  For instance Marvel's [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] has an unaltered form with features including blue skin and yellow eyes and yet she has shape shifting and vocal mimicry abilities give her the potential to fit into any required situation. At another extreme characters like [[He-Man]] manage to maintain their secret identities with a change of clothes and a [[Sun Tanning|tan]].

Some characters initially maintain secret identities but discard of them over time. [[Tony Stark]] at first told the news media and general public that [[Iron Man]] is his personal [[Bodyguard|bodyguard]] and corporate [[Mascot|mascot]] before he eventually publicly reveals his dual identity. Other characters miss the opportunity to conceal their identities or choose to be public from the very beginning. For instance, the [[Fantastic Four]], who would have always had difficulties concealing [[The Thing (comics)|the Thing]], have typically maintained a public appearance from the [[Manhattan]] based [[Baxter Building]]. Much like Iron Man, the members of the Fantastic Four have few surviving civilian relatives and most of their friends and loved ones have [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]] they can use to protect themselves from harm.

==Keeping the secret==

Unless an identity is itself well known, its discovery may not jeopardize the person's safety. For example, the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Great Brain Robbery" features [[Lex Luthor]] temporarily [[body swap]]ping with the Flash ([[Wally West]]). When Luthor tries to learn the hero's secret identity by taking off his mask and looking in a mirror, he realizes that he has "no idea who this is".&lt;ref name="sava20150112"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/justice-league-unlimited-great-brain-robbery-213725 | title=Justice League Unlimited: “The Great Brain Robbery” | publisher=AV Club | date=2015-01-12 | accessdate=20 April 2016 | author=Sava, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; If secret identities are to remain secret then others must fail to recognize and subsequently publicize that personas of a character belong to the same person.  Identities may be kept secret in a number of ways including: 
*[[Shapeshifting|actual physical change]]&lt;ref name="hulk"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide|last1=DeFalco|first1=Tom|date=5 May 2003|publisher=DK Publishing|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The application of elements of [[disguise]] on the various personas of the character 
*Becoming or remaining less visible due to: [[camouflage]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], [[invisibility]] or [[vibration]] 
*the adoption of different mannerisms and vocal characteristics by the various personas of the character
*[[Toxicology|Chemical influences]], [[hypnosis]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]]/psychic influences
*The causation of [[Wound|physical damage]] with the result of [[Mental disorder|impaired mental ability]], [[Communication|impaired communicative ability]] or [[death]].
*Public appearances of both identities in the same area with the cooperation of a friend in disguise, or an [[android (robot)|android]] made to take that appearance, by some form of illusion or by such means as time travel.
*Does not display any of their special skills in public. (ex. Bruce Wayne not displaying his martial arts skills in public to protect his secret identity as Batman&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 2) #2 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Has special abilities that help prevent from being observed changing identities, such as [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense, that senses when he is in danger, which registers unwanted observers at such moments as a threat.

[[File:India disputed areas map.svg|thumb|240px|Map showing [[List of disputed territories of India|disputed territories of India]]]]
[[Sovereignty]] over two separated pieces of territory have been contested between China and India. [[Aksai Chin]] is located either in the Indian province of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], or the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]], in the west. It is a virtually uninhabited high-altitude wasteland crossed by the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway. The other disputed territory lies south of the [[McMahon Line]]. It was formerly referred to as the [[North East Frontier Agency]], and is now called [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The McMahon Line was part of the 1914 [[Simla Convention]] between British India and Tibet, an agreement rejected by China.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

The 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]] was fought in both of these areas. An agreement to resolve the dispute was concluded in 1996, including "confidence-building measures" and a mutually agreed [[Line of Actual Control]]. In 2006, the Chinese ambassador to India claimed that all of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is Chinese territory&lt;ref name=Rediff&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/14china.htm "Arunachal Pradesh is our territory": Chinese envoy] ''Rediff India Abroad,'' 14 November 2006. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108041416/http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/14china.htm |date=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; amidst a military buildup.&lt;ref&gt;Subir Bhaumik, "[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11818840 India to deploy 36,000 extra troops on Chinese border]", ''BBC'', 23 November 2010. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102000047/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11818840 |date=2 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, both countries claimed incursions as much as a kilometre at the northern tip of [[Sikkim]].&lt;ref name="Sudha"&gt;Sudha Ramachandran, "[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JF27Df01.html China toys with India's border]", ''Asia Times Online'', 27 June 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20091122200123/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JF27Df01.html |date=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, India announced it would deploy additional military forces along the border.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{citation |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124578881101543463.html |title=The China-India Border Brawl |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=24 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923151949/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124578881101543463.html |archivedate=23 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, India proposed China should acknowledge "One India" policy to resolve the border dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/201406120234-1.aspx|title=外長會  印向陸提一個印度政策|last=何|first=宏儒|date=2014-06-12|work=中央通訊社|location=新德里|accessdate=2017-02-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233221/http://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/201406120234-1.aspx|archivedate=27 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/world/2014/09/140908_india_china|title=印度外長敦促中國重申「一個印度」政策|accessdate=2017-02-27|work=BBC 中文网|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227231948/http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/world/2014/09/140908_india_china|archivedate=27 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Aksai Chin===
{{main|Aksai Chin}}
[[File:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|right|The western portion of the disputed boundary.]]

From the area's lowest point (on the [[Karakash River]] at about {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to the glaciated peaks up to {{convert|22500|ft|m}} above sea level, this is a desolate, largely uninhabited area. It covers an area of about {{convert|37244|km2|sqmi}}. The desolation of Aksai Chin meant that it had no significant human importance other than ancient trade routes crossing it, providing brief passage during summer for caravans of yaks from Xinjiang and Tibet.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"&gt;{{harvp|Maxwell, India's China War|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest treaties regarding the boundaries in the western sector was issued in 1842. The [[Sikh Empire]] of the [[Punjab region]] had annexed [[Ladakh]] into the state of [[Jammu]] in 1834. In 1841, they invaded Tibet with an army. Chinese forces defeated the Sikh army and in turn entered Ladakh and besieged [[Leh]]. After being checked by the Sikh forces, the Chinese and the Sikhs signed a treaty in September 1842, which stipulated no transgressions or interference in the other country's frontiers.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P. Rubin, The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Jan. 1960), pp. 96–125. {{JSTOR|756256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British defeat of the Sikhs in 1846]] resulted in transfer of sovereignty over Ladakh to the British, and British commissioners attempted to meet with Chinese officials to discuss the border they now shared. However, both sides were sufficiently satisfied that a traditional border was recognised and defined by natural elements, and the border was not demarcated.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; The boundaries at the two extremities, [[Pangong Lake]] and [[Karakoram Pass]], were reasonably well-defined, but the Aksai Chin area in between lay largely undefined.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guruswamy2006"&gt;{{cite book |title= Emerging Trends in India-China Relations |last= Guruswamy |first= Mohan |year=2006 |publisher=Hope India Publications |location=India |isbn=978-81-7871-101-0 |page=222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trAb0KxP_ocC&amp;pg=PA222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Johnson Line ====

[[W. H. Johnson]], a civil servant with the [[Survey of India]] proposed the "Johnson Line" in 1865, which put Aksai Chin in Jammu and Kashmir. This was the time of the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]], when China did not control [[Xinjiang]], so this line was never presented to the Chinese. Johnson presented this line to the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, who then claimed the 18,000 square kilometres contained within his territory&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"&gt;Mohan Guruswamy, Mohan, [http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/20spec.htm "The Great India-China Game"], Rediff, 23 June 2003. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930222001/http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/20spec.htm |date=30 September 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by some accounts{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} he claimed territory further north as far as the [[Sanju Pass]] in the [[Kun Lun Mountains]]. Johnson's work was severely criticised for gross inaccuracies, with description of his boundary as "patently absurd",&lt;ref name="Calvin"&gt;{{cite web

According to [[Francis Younghusband]], who explored the region in the late 1880s, there was only an abandoned fort and not one inhabited house at Shahidulla when he was there – it was just a convenient staging post and a convenient headquarters for the nomadic [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]].&lt;ref&gt;Younghusband, Francis E. (1896). ''The Heart of a Continent''. John Murray, London. Facsimile reprint: (2005) Elbiron Classics, pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; The abandoned fort had apparently been built a few years earlier by the Dogras.&lt;ref&gt;Grenard, Fernand (1904). ''Tibet: The Country and its Inhabitants''. Fernand Grenard. Translated by A. Teixeira de Mattos. Originally published by Hutchison and Co., London. 1904. Reprint: Cosmo Publications. Delhi. 1974, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1878 the Chinese had reconquered Xinjiang, and by 1890 they already had Shahidulla before the issue was decided.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; By 1892, China had erected boundary markers at [[Karakoram Pass]].&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

In 1897 a British military officer, Sir John Ardagh, proposed a boundary line along the crest of the [[Kun Lun Mountains]] north of the [[Yarkand River]].&lt;ref name=himalayanfrontier&gt;{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=101,&amp;nbsp;360–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Britain was concerned at the danger of Russian expansion as China weakened, and Ardagh argued that his line was more defensible. The Ardagh line was effectively a modification of the Johnson line, and became known as the "Johnson-Ardagh Line".

==== The Macartney-Macdonald Line ====
[[File:Hung Ta-Chen's Map.jpg|thumb|right|The map given by Hung Ta-chen to the British consul at Kashgar in 1893. The boundary, marked with a thin dot-dashed line, matches the Johnson line&lt;ref name=HimalayanFrontiers /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:pp. 73,&amp;nbsp;78&lt;/sup&gt;]]
In 1893, Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at [[St. Petersburg]], gave maps of the region to [[George Macartney (British consul)|George Macartney]], the British consul general at Kashgar, which coincided in broad details.&lt;ref name=HimalayanFrontiers&gt;{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=73,&amp;nbsp;78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Britain proposed a revised boundary, initially suggested by Macartney and developed by the Governor General of India [[Lord Elgin]]. This boundary placed the Lingzi Tang plains, which are south of the Laktsang range, in India, and Aksai Chin proper, which is north of the Laktsang range, in China. This border, along the [[Karakoram Mountain]]s, was proposed and supported by British officials for a number of reasons. The Karakoram Mountains formed a natural boundary, which would set the British borders up to the [[Indus River]] [[Water divide|watershed]] while leaving the [[Tarim River]] watershed in Chinese control, and Chinese control of this tract would present a further obstacle to Russian advance in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Noorani"/&gt; The British presented this line, known as the [[Macartney-MacDonald Line]], to the Chinese in 1899 in a note by Sir [[Claude MacDonald]]. The Qing government did not respond to the note, and the British took that as Chinese acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; Although no official boundary had ever been negotiated, China believed that this had been the accepted boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/india-china_conflicts.htm |title=India-China Border Dispute |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215120802/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/india-china_conflicts.htm |archivedate=15 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=middlepath&gt;{{cite journal

Both the Johnson-Ardagh and the Macartney-MacDonald lines were used on British maps of India.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; Until at least 1908, the British took the Macdonald line to be the boundary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1911, the [[Xinhai Revolution]] resulted in the collapse of central power in China, and by the end of [[World War I]], the British officially used the Johnson Line. However they took no steps to establish outposts or assert actual control on the ground. In 1927, the line was adjusted again as the government of British India abandoned the Johnson line in favour of a line along the Karakoram range further south. However, the maps were not updated and still showed the Johnson Line.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;
[[File:Postal Map of China ,1917.jpg|thumb|right|Postal Map of China published by the Government of China in 1917. The boundary in Aksai Chin is as per the Johnson line.]]
From 1917 to 1933, the "Postal Atlas of China", published by the Government of China in Peking had shown the boundary in Aksai Chin as per the Johnson line, which runs along the [[Kunlun mountains]].&lt;ref name=HimalayanFrontiers /&gt;&lt;ref name=middlepath /&gt; The "Peking University Atlas", published in 1925, also put the Aksai Chin in India.&lt;ref name="HimalayanBground" /&gt;{{rp|101}} When British officials learned of Soviet officials surveying the Aksai Chin for [[Sheng Shicai]], warlord of [[Xinjiang]] in 1940–1941, they again advocated the Johnson Line.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; At this point the British had still made no attempts to establish outposts or control over the Aksai Chin, nor was the issue ever discussed with the governments of China or Tibet, and the boundary remained undemarcated at India's independence.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt;

==== Since 1947 ====
Upon independence in 1947, the government of India used the Johnson Line as the basis for its official boundary in the west, encompassing Aksai Chin.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; However, India did not claim the northern areas near [[Shahidulla]] and [[Khotan]], for including which in Indian territory, among other things, Johnson had been criticised. From the Karakoram Pass (which is not under dispute), the Indian claim line extends northeast of the Karakoram Mountains north of the salt flats of the Aksai Chin, to set a boundary at the [[Kunlun Mountains]], and incorporating part of the [[Karakash River]] and [[Yarkand River]] watersheds. From there, it runs east along the Kunlun Mountains, before turning southwest through the Aksai Chin salt flats, through the Karakoram Mountains, and then to [[Pangong Lake]].&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;

On 1 July 1954 Prime Minister [[Nehru]] wrote a memo directing that the maps of India be revised to show definite boundaries on all frontiers. Up to this point, the boundary in the [[Aksai Chin]] sector, based on the Johnson Line, had been described as "undemarcated."&lt;ref name="Noorani"/&gt;

=== Trans Karakoram Tract ===
{{main|Trans Karakoram Tract}}
The Johnson Line is not used west of the [[Karakoram Pass]], where China adjoins Pakistan-administered [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]. On 13 October 1962, China and Pakistan began negotiations over the boundary west of the Karakoram Pass. In 1963, the two countries settled their boundaries largely on the basis of the Macartney-MacDonald Line, which left the [[Trans Karakoram Tract]] 5,800&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 5,180&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in China, although the agreement provided for renegotiation in the event of a settlement of the [[Kashmir dispute]]. India does not recognise that Pakistan and China have a common border, and claims the tract as part of the domains of the pre-1947 state of Kashmir and Jammu. However, India's claim line in that area does not extend as far north of the [[Karakoram]] Mountains as the Johnson Line. China &amp; India still have disputes on these borders.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;

===The McMahon Line===
[[File:China India eastern border 88.jpg|thumb|right|The McMahon Line is the northern border of the red tinted disputed area.]]
{{main|McMahon Line}}

British India and China gained a common border in 1826, with British annexation of [[Assam]] in the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] at the conclusion of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826). Subsequent annexations in further [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]] expanded China's borders with British India eastwards, to include the border with what is now [[Burma]].

In 1913–14, representatives of Britain, China, and [[Tibet]] attended a conference in [[Shimla|Simla]], India and drew up an agreement concerning Tibet's status and borders. The [[McMahon Line]], a proposed boundary between Tibet and India for the eastern sector, was drawn by British negotiator [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]] on a map attached to the agreement. All three representatives initialled the agreement, but Beijing soon objected to the proposed Sino-Tibet boundary and repudiated the agreement, refusing to sign the final, more detailed map. After approving a note which stated that China could not enjoy rights under the agreement unless she ratified it, the British and Tibetan negotiators signed the Simla Convention and more detailed map as a bilateral accord. [[Neville Maxwell]] states that McMahon had been instructed not to sign bilaterally with Tibetans if China refused, but he did so without the Chinese representative present and then kept the declaration secret.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;

V.K. Singh argues that the basis of these boundaries, accepted by British India and Tibet, were that the historical boundaries of India were the [[Himalayas]] and the areas south of the Himalayas were traditionally Indian and associated with India. The high watershed of the Himalayas was proposed as the border between India and its northern neighbours. India's government held the view that the Himalayas were the ancient boundaries of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and thus should be the modern boundaries of [[British India]] and later the [[Republic of India]].&lt;ref name="VKSingh"&gt;V. K. Singh, [http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/562/562-vk-singh.htm Resolving the boundary dispute], india-seminar.com. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018213033/http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/562/562-vk-singh.htm |date=18 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese boundary markers, including one set up by the newly created Chinese Republic, stood near [[Walong]] until January 1914, when T. O'Callaghan, an assistant administrator of [[North East Frontier Agency]] (NEFA)'s eastern sector, relocated them north to locations closer to the McMahon Line (albeit still South of the Line). He then went to Rima, met with Tibetan officials, and saw no Chinese influence in the area.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

By signing the Simla Agreement with Tibet, the British had violated the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]], in which both parties were not to negotiate with Tibet, "except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government", as well as the [[Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906]], which bound the British government "not to annex Tibetan territory."&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;Karunakar Gupta. The McMahon Line 1911–45: The British Legacy, ''The China Quarterly'', No. 47. (Jul. – Sep. 1971), pp. 521–545. {{JSTOR|652324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of doubts concerning the legal status of the accord, the British did not put the McMahon Line on their maps until 1937, nor did they publish the Simla Convention in the treaty record until 1938. Rejecting Tibet's 1913 declaration of independence, China argued that the Simla Convention and McMahon Line were illegal and that Tibetan government was merely a local government without treaty-making powers. In 1947, Tibet requested that India recognise Tibetan authority in the trading town of [[Tawang]], south of the McMahon Line. Tibet did not object to any other portion of the McMahon line. In reply, the Indians asked Tibet to continue the relationship on the basis of the previous British Government.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell" /&gt;

The British records show that the Tibetan government’s acceptance of the new border in 1914 was conditional on China accepting the Simla Convention. Since the British were not able to get an acceptance from China, Tibetans considered the MacMahon line invalid.&lt;ref name="Shakya1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tsering Shakya|title=The Dragon in the Land of Snows: A History of Modern Tibet Since 1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dosnYnxzTD4C&amp;pg=PA279|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11814-9|pages=279–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan officials continued to administer [[Tawang District|Tawang]] and refused to concede territory during negotiations in 1938. The governor of Assam asserted that Tawang was "undoubtedly British" but noted that it was "controlled by Tibet, and none of its inhabitants have any idea that they are not Tibetan." During World War II, with India's east threatened by Japanese troops and with the threat of Chinese expansionism, British troops secured Tawang for extra defence.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

China's claim on areas south of the McMahon Line, encompassed in the NEFA, were based on the traditional boundaries. India believes that the boundaries China proposed in [[Ladakh]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] have no written basis and no documentation of acceptance by anyone apart from China. Indians argue that China claims the territory on the basis that it was under Chinese imperial control in the past,&lt;ref name="VKSingh"/&gt; while Chinese argue that India claims the territory on the basis that it was under British imperial control in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur A. Stahnke. "The Place of International Law in Chinese Strategy and Tactics: The Case of the Sino-Indian Boundary Dispute", ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 30, No. 1, Nov 1970. pg. 95–119&lt;/ref&gt; The last [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] emperor's 1912 edict of abdication authorised its succeeding [[Republic of China (1912–49)|republican government]] to form a union of "five peoples, namely, [[Manchus]], [[Han Chinese]], [[Mongols]], [[Hui people|Muslims]], and [[Tibetans]] ''together with their territory in its integrity''."&lt;ref&gt;Qing Dynasty Edict of Abdication, translated by [[Bertram Lenox Simpson|Bertram Lenox Putnam Weale]], ''The Fight for the Republic in China'', London: Hurst &amp; Blackett, Ltd. Paternoster House, E.C. 1918. – Emphasis added, "Muslims" rendered as "Mohammedans" in original translation&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice that India does not place a claim to the regions which previously had the presence of the [[Mauryan Empire]] and [[Chola Dynasty]], but which were heavily influenced by Indian culture, further complicates the issue.&lt;ref name="VKSingh"/&gt;

India's claim line in the eastern sector follows the McMahon Line. The line drawn by McMahon on the [[Simla Accord (1914)#Maps|detailed 24–25 March 1914 Simla Treaty maps]] clearly starts at 27°45’40"N, a trijunction between Bhutan, China, and India, and from there, extends eastwards.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt; Most of the fighting in the eastern sector before the start of the war would take place immediately north of this line.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noorani2"&gt;A.G. Noorani, "[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2017/stories/20030829001604900.htm Perseverance in peace process]". ''Frontline'', 29 August 2003. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050326174852/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2017/stories/20030829001604900.htm |date=26 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, India claimed that the ''intent'' of the treaty was to follow the main watershed ridge divide of the Himalayas based on memos from McMahon and the fact that over 90% of the McMahon Line does in fact follow the main watershed ridge divide of the Himalayas. They claimed that territory south of the high ridges here near Bhutan (as elsewhere along most of the McMahon Line) should be Indian territory and north of the high ridges should be Chinese territory. In the Indian claim, the two armies would be separated from each other by the highest mountains in the world.

During and after the 1950s, when India began patrolling this area and mapping in greater detail, they confirmed what the 1914 Simla agreement map depicted: six river crossings that interrupted the main Himalayan watershed ridge. At the westernmost location near Bhutan north of Tawang, they modified their maps to extend their claim line northwards to include features such as Thag La ridge, Longju, and Khinzemane as Indian territory.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt; Thus, the Indian version of the McMahon Line moves the Bhutan-China-India trijunction north to 27°51’30"N.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt; India would claim that the treaty map ran along features such as Thag La ridge, though the actual treaty map itself is topographically vague (as the treaty was not accompanied with demarcation) in places, shows a straight line (not a watershed ridge) near Bhutan and near Thag La, and the treaty includes no verbal description of geographic features nor description of the highest ridges.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

During the 1950s, the People's Republic of China built a {{convert|1200|km}} [[China National Highway 219|road]] connecting [[Xinjiang]] and western [[Tibet]], of which {{convert|179|km}} ran south of the Johnson Line through the Aksai Chin region claimed by India.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; Aksai Chin was easily accessible from China, but for the Indians on the south side of the Karakoram, the mountain range proved to be an complication in their access to Aksai Chin.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt; The Indians did not learn of the existence of the road until 1957, which was confirmed when the road was shown in Chinese maps published in 1958.&lt;ref name="Garver"&gt;* {{citation |last=Garver |first=John W. |chapter=China’s Decision for War with India in 1962 |editor=Robert S.

The Indian position, as stated by prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was that the Aksai Chin was "part of the [[Ladakh]] region of India for centuries" and that this northern border was a "firm and definite one which was not open to discussion with anybody".&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;

The Chinese minister, [[Zhou Enlai]] argued that the western border had never been delimited, that the Macartney-MacDonald Line, which left the Aksai Chin within Chinese borders was the only line ever proposed to a Chinese government, and that the Aksai Chin was already under Chinese jurisdiction, and that negotiations should take into account the status quo.&lt;ref name="Neville_Maxwell"/&gt;

In 1960, based on an agreement between Nehru and [[Zhou Enlai]], officials from India and China held discussions in order to settle the boundary dispute.&lt;ref name="HimalayanBground"&gt;{{harvp|Fisher, Rose &amp; Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; China and India disagreed on the major watershed that defined the boundary in the western sector.&lt;ref name="HimalayanBground" /&gt;{{rp|96}} The Chinese statements with respect to their border claims often misrepresented the cited sources.{{sfnp|Fisher, Rose &amp; Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=99}}

=== The Doklam Military Standoff in 2017 ===

In June, [[2017 China–India border standoff|a military standoff occurred between India and China]] in the disputed territory of Doklam, near the Doka La pass. On June 16, 2017, the Chinese brought heavy road building equipment to the Doka La region and began constructing a road in the disputed area.&lt;ref name="cf.orfonline.org"&gt;Manoj Joshi, [http://cf.orfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ORF_SpecialReport_40_Doklam.pdf/ Doklam: To Start at the Very Beginning]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, China had built a dirt road terminating at Doka La where Indian troops were stationed.&lt;ref name="cf.orfonline.org"/&gt; They would conduct foot patrol from this point up till the Royal Bhutanese Army (RBA) post at Jampheri Ridge.&lt;ref name="cf.orfonline.org"/&gt; The dispute that ensued post June 16 stemmed from the fact that the Chinese had begun building a road below Doka La, in what India and Bhutan claim to be disputed territory.&lt;ref name="cf.orfonline.org"/&gt; This resulted in Indian intervention of China’s road construction on June 18, two days after construction began.

==Sikkim==

The [[Nathu La and Cho La clashes]] were a series of military clashes in 1967 between India and China alongside the border of the Himalayan [[Kingdom of Sikkim]], then an Indian [[protectorate]]. The end of the conflicts saw a Chinese military withdrawal from Sikkim.

In 1975, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim|Sikkim monarchy]] held a referendum, in which the Sikkemese voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sikkim (Indien), 14.

'''''Space Cadets''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programme made by Zeppotron (a division of [[Endemol|Endemol UK]]) for [[Channel 4]]. Presented by [[Johnny Vaughan]], it was aired across ten consecutive nights beginning on 7 December 2005, with the final episode aired on the evening of 16 December 2005.

The series was a hoax at the expense of its contestants, who were told they were being trained as cosmonauts at a Russian military base before undergoing a five-day trip into [[low earth orbit]]. In reality, the entire series was filmed in Suffolk, and the contestants did not leave Earth. The series was accompanied by a [[Making-of|behind-the-scenes]] sister show ''Space Cadets: The Satellite Show'', with interviews and phone-ins.

==Premise==
The series described itself as the most elaborate [[hoax]] perpetrated in television history. The title is a reference to the [[slang]] phrase ''space cadet'', meaning a person out of touch with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/space-cadet|title=the definition of space cadet|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not clear if the contestants were aware of the show's title, although a whiteboard in the 'barracks' had "Space Cadettes" [''[[Sic (Latin)|sic]]''] written on it during one of the parties organised in the facility.

A group of twelve contestants (who answered an advert looking for "thrill seekers") were selected to become the first British televised [[space tourist]]s, including going to Russia to train as cosmonauts at the "Space Tourist Agency of Russia" (STAR) [[military base]], with the series culminating in a group of four embarking on a five-day space mission in [[low Earth orbit]]. The show and space mission contained aspects of [[reality TV]], including hidden cameras, soundproofed '[[video diary]]' rooms and group [[dormitory|dormitories]].

However, the show was in fact an elaborate [[practical joke]], described by Commissioning Editor Angela Jain as "''[[Candid Camera]]'' live in space" and claimed by Channel 4 to have cost roughly £5million. Unknown to the "space cadets", they were not in Russia at all, but at Bentwaters Parks (formerly [[RAF Bentwaters]], a [[USAF]] airfield from 1951 to 1993) in [[Suffolk]] staffed by costumed [[actor]]s, and the "space trip" was entirely fake, complete with a wooden "shuttle" and actor "pilots". The production crew went so far as to replace light switches and electrical outlets in the barracks with Russian standard, and smokers amongst the production crew were given Russian [[cigarette]]s to smoke in case any of the cadets discovered the butts. In addition, three of the Cadets were actors, included to misdirect any suspicious Cadets and to help reinforce the illusion.

Channel 4 had contingency plans if the contestants realised the hoax; Johnny Vaughan repeatedly suggested they would have to play old rerun episodes of ''[[Jamie's School Dinners]]'', and after the "launch" some unchosen Cadets would have been used as a backup crew.

The show was originated by comedy writers Ben Caudell and [[Richard Osman]].

==Participants==
*Andrew Carter, 19, a student from [[London]].
*Sarah-Jane Cass, 19, a [[media studies]] student from [[Kent]].
*Cheryl Dearie, 23, a [[housing association]] assistant (receptionist) from [[Glasgow]].
*Paul French, 26, a [[plasterer]] from [[Bristol]].
*Keri Hassett, 25, a college administrator from [[Birmingham]].
*Billy Jackson, 25, a [[recruitment consultant]] from [[Kent]].
*Ryan McBride, 28, an [[electrician]] living in [[London]].
*Louise Nisbet, 23, a [[teacher]] from [[Whitstable]].
*Astrid Roberts, 19, a [[call centre]] worker from [[Glamorgan]].

French, Hassett and Jackson were chosen for the fake flight.

===Actors===
The three actor Cadets were [[Charlie Skelton]], Ranie Daw and Steve Hester. Hester dropped out on day three after a bout of [[gastroenteritis]] and after Skelton accidentally kicked his toenail off. Skelton, also a comedy writer, was chosen to take part in the flight.

The two pilots were [[improvisation|improvisational actors]], Alex Humes and Drew Leavy, who stayed in character the entire flight, even when alone. Humes, portraying a Russian pilot, became noted for his bizarre and cryptic statements due to his [[method acting]].

===Audition process===
In order for the hoax to stand a realistic chance of succeeding, the Cadets would have to remain unaware of the true nature of the show, even given any production mistakes and implausible explanations.

A strict set of criteria was therefore applied to filter out inappropriate applicants:
* Eliminating anyone who had ever [[military service|served in the armed forces]], or who already had a significant interest in [[Spaceflight|space travel]] or [[science fiction]].
* [[Psychology|Psychological]] tests used to single out the highly suggestible and those who would conform to [[groupthink]]
* [[Physiology|Physiological]] tests to determine [[claustrophobia]], including being in restraining jackets and trapped in a full lift
* Being asked to dance blindfolded, without music, and with others watching, to gauge [[Social inhibition|inhibition]] levels
* Asking the candidates to nominate a friend or relative they trusted implicitly, to make a vital and important decision for them. These friends or relatives were contacted, and fully let in on the hoax, and given the final say of whether or not the Cadet should be included

The intention was to obtain a group of Cadets who were highly gullible, conformist, and ignorant about the show's subject matter; and also ideally suited to appearing in a reality TV show (e.g. uninhibited [[extrovert]]s, "wacky personalities", or characters otherwise able to capture the public's attention).

===Prize===
All nine contestants won a genuine trip to Russia, including a trip to [[Star City, Moscow|Star City]] (a small town to the north-west of Moscow which is the home to a Cosmonaut training facility); and a ride on a [[Parabola|parabolic flight]] to experience [[weightlessness]] (known as a [[Vomit Comet]]) for around 25 seconds. In addition, each Cadet won a cash prize of £5,000 each.  The three Cadets who went into 'space' won a cash prize of £25,000 each (£5,000 per "day in space").

==Comedic elements==
The show contained moderate amounts of bizarre, [[Surrealism|surreal]], or subversive show elements, in a manner similar to other Zeppotron-related productions (for example, ''[[TVGoHome]]''.) Examples include:

* Cadet lectures that were "about 80% true", the rest being ludicrous rubbish; many of these lectures were of little practical use to cosmonauts (e.g. memory tests of the planets in the [[solar system]])
* Stereotyped characters, including a slow-talking [[Royal Air Force]] [[Squadron Leader]] with a luxuriant [[handlebar moustache]]
* Stupid training exercises (e.g. communications training involving reporting ever more implausible emergencies, ending with monkeys rampaging through the spacecraft, and [[John Rambo|Rambo]] giving [[The Fonz]] a high five)
* Nonsense Russian (e.g. having the Cadets salute a 'Russian Poem' which was actually the recipe for [[toad in the hole]] or having the Russian pilot wear makeup, place plastic spoons in his hair and insist the Cadets act out ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'')
* Nonsensical [[:Category:Space science experiments|space experiments]], including tests to make [[balloon animal]]s
* The motto of the establishment ''S.T.A.R.'' is 'Это не ракетостроение'. The mission commander claimed this means 'We, the adventurers', but it actually means 'It's not rocket science', a phrase meaning that something is very easy, here taking on a double meaning.
* During the training lectures, the cadets were told that Russia's first cosmonaut to successfully orbit and return to earth was a monkey called Minsky (who is supposedly stuffed and kept on display at ''S.T.A.R.''), and that the city of [[Minsk]] is named in her honour.
* According to one of the "pilots", if the shuttle was unable to land at the ''S.T.A.R.'' base in Russia, one of the back-up sites was at [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge, UK]]. This is an in-joke as, unknown to the cadets, [[RAF Woodbridge]] was the 'twin' airbase to RAF Bentwaters. Woodbridge is also the nearest town to the actual ''Space Cadets'' production site in Suffolk.
* The cadets were also told the segments of Mission Control, referred to by acronyms, some of which are made up – CAPCOM, FlDO, LIDO, DIDO, NACAS and MUMI (only [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] and [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO or FIDO)|FlDO]] are genuine positions).

===Resolution===
The show's ending occurred on the last day as planned. The Cadets had started to gain suspicions due to increasingly ludicrous set pieces (notably the [[space burial|space funeral]] of a fictional celebrity dog "Mr. Bimby", whose ashes were spilt and had to be vacuumed up). The Cadets were prepared for a [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]], but once in the module Vaughan showed them a montage of their suspicions, finishing with an outside shot of the simulator, which was the moment when the "cadets" knew they had not left the Earth. The module door was opened onto the studio set, complete with friends, family and the actors. Soon after, they were told they were in England, and had not actually even left the country.

===Viewer reaction===
Initial viewing figures were 2.6 million (11% share), dropping to 2 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/tv/s/191/191600_space_cadets_viewing_figures_nosedive.html |accessdate=15 December 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217143517/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/tv/s/191/191600_space_cadets_viewing_figures_nosedive.html |archivedate=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Channel 4 was reported as being 'not disappointed' and the figures were in line with that time slot, and 42% of the viewers were the crucial 16- to 34-year-old segment.

Early viewer reaction to the show contained disbelief that such an apparently outlandish joke could be pulled off (the show claimed that [[Neil Armstrong]] had offered to eat his astronaut [[helmet]] if the show was successful).

Particularly questioned was how [[weightlessness]], which would be present in a real space flight, would be handled on a ground-based set. The Cadets were told that they would be in "near space" (as opposed to "outer space"), causing only a 30% loss of gravity; which was compensated by "gravity generators" built into the ship. Due to the Cadet-choosing criteria, this profoundly absurd explanation was believed (any object in [[orbit]] of another [[astronomical object]] will experience [[free-fall]], and thus weightlessness).

==Location==
The Space Cadets were initially assembled at [[RAF Biggin Hill|Biggin Hill]] airfield, [[London]], before being flown to [[Lydd]] on the south east coast of England. This air-hop would normally take just 15 minutes, but thanks to a specially convoluted flight plan over the [[North Sea]] it lasted four hours. Upon arrival at Lydd the cadets were told they had reached [[Volgograd]]. The Cadets had been relieved of their watches prior to the flight to prevent them noticing the absent time difference. They were then transferred by helicopter to [[RAF Bentwaters]], [[Suffolk]], which they had been led to believe was the Space Tourism Academy of Russia (STAR) facility in the town of [[Krymsk]].

===Training location===
During the four-week period the Cadets were living on-site; their barracks and the academy building where they received their training are situated within the wooded dispersal area, which is on the south west of the airbase.

===Simulator===
The shuttle simulator was assembled in a [[Soundproofing|soundproofed]] [[hangar]] which was constructed within [[RAF Bentwaters]], c. 1991. The shuttle was given the name of Earth Orbiter 1 which was used as the [[spacecraft]]'s [[call sign]]. The simulator was a wooden replica built for the film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', and also subsequently featured in ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[Space Cowboys]]''. As the Cadets spent five days inside the simulator, there was considerable attention and budget given to its plausibility, including extensive [[surround sound]], [[pneumatic]] cushions, and a custom-built projector screen to display [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI graphics]] of the Earth's surface.

The hangar, called Hush House, is formed from insulated [[stainless steel]] walls and features an elaborate exhaust facility that enables the engines of [[jet aircraft]] such as the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] to be tested with minimal interruption to local residents and livestock. Hush House is situated south of the runway, towards the eastern edge of the site.

==Cost==
In total, the two programmes are together rumoured to have cost around £4.5M GBP to produce, including prize payouts, the 6-month audition process, set making, staff salaries, and profits for Zeppotron. The high cost fuelled speculation and rumours about further shows and the possibility of the producers performing a double-bluff in the future ([[Virgin Galactic]] is likely to offer initial space tourist flights for £100,000).

==Psychological aspect==
The show consistently raised the issue of how an immersive [[illusion]] can convince average people over a period of time, especially when reinforced as part of a group of believers – especially when this includes men in white coats and other authority figures. Outsiders (in this case, the viewers) see the hoax as laughable, yet 'inside' the Cadets have been slowly lulled into (as Vaughan stated) ''"what is, in effect, an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universe]]."'' The actor Cadet on the 'mission' stated that it was easier to let himself believe the experience was genuine;  trying to consciously remind himself of the hoax left him disorientated and "30% convinced, despite everything I know, that I am actually in space".

Parallels can be drawn to the supposed 'group experiment' element of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' which ''Space Cadets'' draws on, and in wider terms [[propaganda]], [[subliminal advertising]], and the [[consensus reality|consensus nature of reality]]. See also: [[Asch conformity experiments]], [[Milgram experiment]] and the [[Stanford prison experiment]].

Several episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible (TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]''{{Which|date=March 2015}} staged similar "false journeys," which attempted to convince gullible victims of some of the [[Confidence trick|confidence games]] around which the methods of accomplishing the missions were centred that they were supposedly in transit when, in reality, they were actually not moving or going anywhere at all.

=='Double hoax' theory==
As the attention to detail in the hoaxed environment became clear, some viewers expressed suspicions – in particular on Channel 4's message board for the programme – that the entire show, including the apparent gullibility and abject ignorance of the Cadets, was in fact a [[double bluff]]; all the Cadets were actors and that the real target of "the biggest prank in television history" was the "gullible" viewing public. The theories were lent considerable credibility when Ryan McBride was sighted in a TV advert for blood donation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/media/article/532555/space-cadets-fools-viewers-contestant-revealed-actor/&lt;/ref&gt; although he later explained he was recruited as an extra on-location and was not a professional actor. Variations on this "[[conspiracy theory]]" included the actor Cadets being unaware of the hoax; that each Cadet believed themself to be the only actor; or that the actors/Cadets believed the ''viewers'' thought the space mission was genuine. One conspiracy theory even went as far as to suggest a real trip into space could be awarded to one of the unsuspecting actor Cadets, possibly using a company like [[Virgin Galactic]] or [[Space Adventures]] for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.channel4.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/3490031163/m/6980070563 |accessdate=10 December 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527031724/http://community.channel4.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/3490031163/m/6980070563 |archivedate=27 May 2007 }}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the programme reached its end these suspicions proved to be unfounded.

'''Spring equinox in Teotihuacán''' is an annual event which takes place around the [[equinox|20th and 21st of March]] at the pre-Hispanic site of [[Teotihuacán]], [[Mexico]]. This event is mirrored by other similar events in other pre-Hispanic sites such as [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Malinalco, Mexico State]].&lt;ref name="rmorante"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/3005-Equinoccio-en-Teotihuacan.-Un-palacio-calend%E1rico-en-la-ciudad-de-los-dioses-%28Estado-de-M%E9xico%29 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221020636/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/3005-Equinoccio-en-Teotihuacan.-Un-palacio-calend%E1rico-en-la-ciudad-de-los-dioses-(Estado-de-M%E9xico) |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |title=Equinoccio en Teotihuacan.

==Observances==
In Teotihuacan, thousands of people visit for the event, many dressed in white with a red scarf or other accessory. Many dance, burn incense and chant but the defining ritual is to stand at the top of the [[Pyramid of the Sun]], with arms outstretched facing the sun in the morning on the eastern horizon.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt;  Most climb this pyramid between 9am and 1pm.&lt;ref name="operativo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=618&amp;Itemid=128 |title=Operativo Equinoccio |date=March 18, 2009 |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Operation Equinox |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002185839/http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=618&amp;Itemid=128 |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, those who arrive early enough can see the sun rise over the Apan Mountains to the east of the Pyramid of the Sun, with its red rays coloring the landscape and the onlookers’ clothing. Chanting and other clamor accompanies this sunrise as participants stand with arms outstretched.&lt;ref name="rmorante"/&gt;

Some come because they believe they are following in the footsteps of their ancestors, in asking the gods for energy and health on this day. Some [[New Age]] sources claim that at the point of the equinox, man is at a unique place in the cosmos, when portals of energy open. Climbing the 360 stairs to the top of the Pyramid of the Sun is claimed to allow participants to be closer to this "energy".&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt;

==Popularity of the event==
It was estimated about more than a million people visited the site during the weekend on which the [[Northward equinox]] fell in 2010.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt; Officially, the equinox occurred on Saturday, but many seemed assured that the energy was still present on Sunday.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt;  Due to the large crowds, access and activity at the site is severely restricted.   The site is opened for the event from 6 am to 5pm, with visitors on this day entering through gates 1, 2 and 5 and leaving through gate 3. Commercial activity is restricted.&lt;ref name="operativo"/&gt;  Special scaffolding and security are placed on the pyramid on that day to assure a regular flow of people. Only the first level of the Pyramid of the Moon is accessible. Other areas such as the Palace of Quetzalcoatl, the Site Museum, the Citadel and others are all closed off, restricting visitors to the open areas of the Avenue of the Dead and the plazas around the two pyramids.

==Archaeoastronomy of the site==
Although some are now closed off during the spring equinox, a number of the buildings at the Teotihuacan site show relationships with astronomy. [[Archaeoastronomy]] research has been undertaken at the site since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="rmorante"/&gt; The Palace of the Butterflies has circles on its walls created with reflective [[mica]], which have been interpreted as representing astronomical bodies.&lt;ref name="rmorante"/&gt;  It is very likely that the Palace of [[Quetzalcoatl]] functioned as a solar observatory. On the spring equinox, from between 7:15 and 7:45am when the sun rises, a shadow travels upwards along figures etched and painted red onto a battlement-like structure on the west wall. Some of the figures depicted are owls, a bird associated with darkness as well as rays of light. The symbolism is that of balance between light and dark. Birds also symbolize the stars. This structure is called an ''unxicalcoliuhqui'', a type of [[fretwork]] that can also been seen at Chichén Itzá. As with the Butterfly Palace, there are circles on the walls created with reflective mica.&lt;ref name="rmorante"/&gt;

The first rays of the sun that stream across the landscape on the day of the spring equinox are broken on their way to Teotihuacan by an elevation called the Cerro Colorado Grande. Some believe that this point was used by the ancient people of Teotihuacan to mark the equinox. However, this would most likely have required the placement of the Pyramid of the Sun in a more northerly position, or that the Pyramid of the Moon played a more prominent role in spring equinox celebrations.&lt;ref name="rmorante"/&gt;

'''Teresa Carr Deni''' was a [[Philadelphia Municipal Court]] [[judge]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], until she resigned to run for Philadelphia District Attorney in December, 2016.&lt;ref name="DA primary"/&gt;

Deni served on the Board of Revision of Taxes and the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development.  She won a retention vote on November 5, 2013, and will serve a 6-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=17&amp;ElectionID=26&amp;OfficeID=15 "2007 Municipal Election, Tuesday, November 06, 2007, Judge of the Municipal Court: Judicial Retention, 1st Judicial District (Philadelphia County)"], ''Pennsylvania Department of State: Elections Information'' (website). Accessed November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jill Porter. [http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20071107_Jill_Porter___Hooker_Judge_is_not_denied__but_justice_is______.html  "'Hooker Judge' is not denied... but justice is"], ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=retention13&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Bob|title=Phila. elects 10 Dems to bench - including 4 'not recommended'|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-11-06/news/43734160_1_sierra-thomas-street-common-pleas-court-philadelphia-bar-association|accessdate=7 November 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 Deni announced that she would be challenging [[District Attorney]] of [[Philadelphia]] [[R. Seth Williams]] in the 2017 Democratic Primary.&lt;ref name="DA primary"&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20161203_Judge_prepares_to_challenge_DA_Seth_Williams_in_primary.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A 2007 case before Deni involved a 20-year-old prostitute who alleged that she was sexually assaulted by Dominique Gindraw and at least 4 other men.  She agreed to have protected sex with Gindraw for $150 after contacting him through [[Craigslist]].

Upon meeting him, he asked her to also have protected sex with his friend for an additional $100.  She reported that when the other man arrived, he threatened her with a gun and demanded that she have unprotected sex with at least 3 additional men.
&lt;ref name="porter-10-12"&gt;{{cite news

 |author=Jill Porter
 |publisher=''Philadelphia Daily News''
 |date=2007-10-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a police report was filed, four men were arrested and charged with rape and assault.  Deni dismissed all of the sex and assault charges and instead charged them with [[armed robbery]] and [[theft of services]].  She justified her decision by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She consented and she didn't get paid . . . I thought it was a robbery."  And that a case like this "minimizes true rape cases and demeans women who are really raped.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same defendant was charged with a similar crime 4 days later.  However, assistant [[district attorney]] Rich DeSipio refused to present the case before Judge Deni owing to her earlier ruling, arguing that "I wouldn't demean her [the victim] that way."&lt;ref name="porter-10-12" /&gt;  Judge Deni threw out the second case for failure to prosecute.

DeSipio has vowed to appeal both rulings.

On October 12, 2007 Deni filed a complaint about DeSipio with the state disciplinary committee.  She claimed that it was improper for him to initiate press coverage of the case.  Both DeSipio and the reporter he spoke with, Jill Porter, claim that Porter was the one who initiated contact about the case.&lt;ref name="porter-10-24"&gt;{{cite news

 |author=Jill Porter

 |date=2007-10-24
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Dalton subsequently denounced Deni for her "unforgivable miscarriage of justice" and "clear disregard of the legal definition of rape and the rule of law."
Chancellor Jane Dalton commented, "I have personally reviewed the transcript from the defendant's preliminary hearing in this case. Based on my reading, the transcript clearly reflects that the victim decided she was not going to engage in sex with any of the men present, and that she was forced to do so at gunpoint. No one has denied or contradicted this.
Judge Deni's belief that because the victim had originally intended to have sex for money and decided not to because she didn't get paid posits that a woman cannot change her mind about having sex, or withdraw her consent to do so, regardless of the circumstances. [...] As Chancellor, a lawyer, and a human being, I am personally offended by this unforgivable miscarriage of justice. The victim has been brutalized twice in this case: first by the assailants, and now by the court."

The '''USS ''Stark'' incident''' occurred during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] on 17 May 1987, when an Iraqi jet aircraft fired missiles at the American [[frigate]] {{USS|Stark|FFG-31|6}}. Thirty-seven [[United States Navy]] personnel were killed and 21 were injured.

==Incident==
[[File:USS Stark - external damage by exocet.jpg|left|thumb|Damage to {{USS|Stark|FFG-31|6}}{{'}}s hull and superstructure]]
{{USS|Stark|FFG-31|6}} was part of the Middle East Task Force assigned to patrol off  the Saudi Arabian coast near the Iran–Iraq War exclusion boundary. An Iraqi pilot attacked USS Stark in a [[Dassault Falcon 50]] modified business jet armed with two [[Exocet]] missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://warisboring.com/in-1987-a-secret-iraqi-warplane-struck-an-american-frigate-and-killed-37-sailors-b341a948fa21?source=latest|title=In 1987, a Secret Iraqi Warplane Struck an American Frigate and Killed 37 Sailors|first=|last=War Is Boring|date=27 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Intelligence was convinced the attack was made with a [[Dassault Mirage F1]], even though the Mirage did not have the capability at the time.&lt;ref name="DoD_report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20STARK%20BASIC.pdf|title=Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Attack of the USS Stark (FFG-31) on 17 May 1987|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S.Department of Defense|access-date=|volume=1|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcon took off from the [[airbase]] of [[Shaibah]] at 20:00 and headed south into the [[Persian Gulf]] also along the coast. When it came within view just before 22:00, the attacker was off ''Stark''{{'}}s port side beam.

Initially not alarmed, at 22:09 Captain [[Glenn R. Brindel]] ordered a [[radioman]] to send the message: "''Unknown aircraft, this is U.S. Navy warship on your 078 (degrees) for twelve miles. Request you identify yourself.''" The Iraqi Falcon pilot did not respond to the message. The ship's captain ordered a second message sent, to which there was no reply. At 22:10 hrs Captain Brindel was informed the Iraqi aircraft had targeted his ship, locking his Cyrano-IV [[fire-control radar]] onto ''Stark''. The Falcon 50 then fired the first Exocet missile {{convert|22|mi}} from the ship, and the second Exocet from {{convert|15|mi}}. The pilot then banked left and began to withdraw.

''Stark''{{'}}s search radar and [[Electronic Surveillance Measures|ESM]] systems failed to detect the incoming missiles. The first Exocet missile struck the [[port side]] of the ship near the bridge. Although it failed to detonate, rocket fuel ignited and caused a large fire that quickly spread throughout the ship's post office, storeroom, and the critical combat operations center (where the ship's weapons are controlled).

The second Exocet also struck the port side. This missile detonated, leaving a {{convert|10|by|15|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} hole in the frigate's left side. Electronics for ''Stark''{{'}}s [[Standard Missile]] defense went out and Captain Brindel could not order his men to return fire. The AWACS plane was still in the area and just after witnessing the attack, radioed a nearby Saudi airbase to send aircraft for an interception, but the [[air traffic controller|ground controller]]s did not have the authority to order a [[sortie]] and the Iraqi jet left unharmed. The USN [[rules of engagement]] applicable at the time allowed ''Stark ''to defend herself after sufficiently warning the hostile aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed|first=Lt Col Robert M|editor-last=Owen|editor-first=Col. Robert C|year=2000|title=Deliberate force a case study in effective air campaigning|chapter=Chapter 14—Chariots of fire: Rules of engagement in Operation Deliberate Force|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JNEnk8k96l8C|accessdate=29 August 2012|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 37 crew were killed in the attack, 29 from the initial explosion and fire, including two lost at sea. Eight would later die from their injuries. Twenty-one others survived their wounds.

Captain Brindel ordered the starboard side flooded to keep the hole on the hull's port side above water. This helped prevent the Stark from sinking. Brindel quickly dispatched a distress call after the first missile hit. It was received by {{USS|Waddell|DDG-24|6}}, which was in the area, and ''Conyngham'' with {{frac|2|3}} of its crew on liberty in Bahrain. ''Waddell'' and ''Conyngham'' arrived to provide damage control and relief to ''Stark''{{'}}s crew.

==Aftermath==
''Stark'' arrived at [[Bahrain]] the following day, 18 May 1987. There she was temporarily repaired by the [[destroyer tender]] {{USS|Acadia|AD-42|6}} before setting a course for [[Mayport Naval Station]], [[Florida]], the ship's home port. A court of inquiry under [[Rear Admiral]] Grant Sharp was formed to investigate the incident and later Captain Brindel was recommended for [[court-martial]] but was ultimately only reprimanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cushman |first1=John H, Jr. |title=Navy Forgoes Courts-Martial for Officers of Stark |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/28/world/navy-forgoes-courts-martial-for-officers-of-stark.html |accessdate=5 November 2018 |publisher=The New York Times |date=28 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that ''Stark'' was {{convert|2|mi}} outside the exclusion zone and had not violated neutrality as the Iraqis claimed.&lt;ref name=Fisk /&gt; Iraq apologized,&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1987/may/19/iraq.davidhirst|title=US navy ordered to hit back after Exocet kills 28|first1=Alex|last1=Brummer|first2=David|last2=Hirst|date=19 May 1987|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saddam Hussein]] said that the pilot mistook ''Stark'' for an Iranian [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]. American officials claimed that the Iraqi jet's pilot was not acting under orders from his government and that he was later executed. This has been disputed, as an [[Iraqi Air Force]] officer later stated that the pilot was not punished and that he was still alive.&lt;ref name=Fisk&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisk|first=Robert|title=The Great War For Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East|year=2005|publisher=Knopf Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian Prime Minister [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]] called it a "divine blessing" and reiterated the standard Iranian view that the Persian Gulf "is not a safe place for the superpowers and it is in their interest not to enter this quicksand". Iraq Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iraq would never intentionally attack any target in the Gulf unless it was Iranian, and laid the blame on Iran.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

Washington used the incident to pressure Iran, which it later blamed for the whole situation. President [[Reagan]] said "We've never considered them [Iraq's military] hostile at all", and "the villain in the piece is Iran".&lt;ref&gt;Doug Rossinow, ''The Reagan Era: A History of the 1980s'', Columbia University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9780231538657}}, page 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a051787ussstark#a051787ussstark|title=Context of 'May 17, 1987 and After: USS ‘Stark’ Attacked by Iraqi Warplane, 37 Sailors Die; US Holds Iran Responsible'|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8Y8bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=51EEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7165,2262720|publisher=The Dispatch|location=Lexington, NC|date=May 20, 1987|p=6|title=Reagan: Iran Is 'Villain' In Persian Gulf Incident}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pentagon said that an Iranian helicopter had joined a Saudi Arabian vessel in rescue operations.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;  Furthermore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff investigation into the incident recommended that Iraq be held accountable, a finding the government of Iraq eventually complied with.

Captain Brindel was relieved of duty and retired for not defending his ship and [[Tactical Action Officer]] Lieutenant Basil E. Moncrief resigned.

===Claims===
On 21 June 2011, an agreement was reached between the governments of the United States and Iraq regarding claims of United States citizens against the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The Iraqi government established a fund of $400 million to compensate prisoners of war and hostages in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], and those killed or injured in the 1987 attack on ''Stark''. The U.S. Department of State is establishing a mechanism to process applications for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq Claims|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/3200.htm|accessdate=18 January 2015|newspaper=US State Department Press Release|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claims Settlement Agreement Between the Government of The United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Iraq |url=http://www.asil.org/ilib110714.cfm#r1 |date=2 September 2010 |publisher=American Society of International Law |accessdate=18 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506024027/http://www.asil.org/ilib110714.cfm |archivedate=6 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:USS Stark (FFG-31) memorial in Mayport.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The memorial plaque for the killed American sailors at [[Mayport, Florida]]]]

==Early life and his career==
He joined [[Mumbai police]] as a sub inspector in 1983. ''India Today'' reports Salaskar's first lethal encounter occurred during his first year of appointment, when he shot dead Raja Shahabuddin, known to police on several counts.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21179&amp;issueid=81|title=Vijay Salaskar: Life and death by the gun|date=28 November 2008|work=India Today|accessdate=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Salaskar, who was reportedly sidelined for the last two years for unearthing the gutka-underworld nexus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mumbai Terror attack encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar surrender AK-47 assault rifle |publisher= Mid-day.com | url =http://www.mid-day.com/news/2008/dec/291208-Mumbai-Terror-attack-encounter-specialist-Vijay-Salaskar-surrender-AK-47-assault-rifle.htm| accessdate = 25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recently attached to the crime branch, where he headed the anti-extortion cell. An officer of the 1983 batch, Salaskar in his 24 years of service had eliminated many criminals. According to sources, the police officer had once even gone hunting for former don Arun Gawli. "But Gawli fled from the scene, forcing Salaskar to return empty-handed. However, Salaskar got even by killing his two trusted men, Sada Pawle and Vijay Tandel, in 1997, triggering allegations that the encounters were fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = I'm shaking with fear, says Arun Gawli |work = The Indian Express | url = http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=30802| accessdate = 25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Gawli was so scared that during the 2005 elections, he complained to the government that Salaskar was trying to kill him and requested that he be transferred,'’ sources said.

This is what Salaskar said in 2004 about Gawli." Gawli may have become an MLA. But for me, he continues to remain a former Mumbai don and I have to keep tabs on his activities. If I get any information of his group's involvement in a crime or learn about any shady activity going on at Dagdi Chawl, I will not hesitate to raid his Byculla residence. If I have to arrest him, I will not refrain from doing so. Now that Gawli is an MLA, arresting him will involve certain procedures. I will not bow to any political pressure. I will only take orders from the police commissioner, who is my supreme commander. It was embarrassing that khaki-clad policemen would be deployed to protect Gawli. In the past, we refused him police protection on several occasions. At that time, I had gunned down several of his top henchmen and so he was scared of me. But if Gawli is really reformed, he should not be afraid of me or any other policeman. We do not target innocent persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Arun Gawli shoots down encounter fears |work = The Times of India | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Arun-Gawli-shoots-down-encounter-fears/articleshow/890559.cms| accessdate = 25 October 2010 | date=19 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Vijay Salaskar was [[killed in action]] by terrorists during the Mumbai attacks, on 27 November 2008.

''India Express'' quotes statements by Constable Arun Jadhav, who was with the officers Vijay Salaskar, [[Ashok Kamte]] and [[Hemant Karkare]] when they died.&lt;ref name=IndiaExpress29-11&gt;
"[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/witness-account-of-karkare-kamte-and-salaskars-death/392181/ Witness account of Karkare, Kamte and Salaskar's death]", ''India Express'', 29 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The three officers and four constables had received information that [[Sadanand Date]] had been wounded while resisting hostile terrorist action at the [[Cama Hospital|Cama and Albless Hospital]] for women and children.
Currently located at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] (CST), a ten-minute drive from the hospital,&lt;ref name=IndiaExpress29-11 /&gt; they took a [[Toyota Qualis]] and proceeded in that direction. Salaskar was driving, [[Ashok Kamte]] in the passenger seat, [[Hemant Karkare]] in the second row, and the four Constables, including Jadhav, were in the back row of seating. According to Jadhav, five minutes later two terrorists stepped out from behind a tree and opened fire with [[AK-47]] automatic rifles. The six policemen, other than Jadhav, were all killed quickly in the gunfire. The wounded Jadhav had no opportunity to render assistance. The two terrorists approached the vehicle, dumped the bodies of the three officers on the road and, leaving the constables for dead, proceeded to Metro Junction. Upon arrival, they aimed three bursts of automatic fire at police and journalist vehicles drawn up at that location, then drove off towards the government offices ([[Vidhan Sabha|Vidhan Bhawan]]) in South Mumbai. Here again they fired several times. While attempting to leave the area, one of the tyres of the vehicle burst, so the terrorists departed to obtain another. At this point, Jadhav was able to contact headquarters. The bodies of the dead were promptly recovered and taken to [[St George Hospital, Mumbai|St George Hospital]].

== History ==
The company was founded in Dalian, Liaoning, in 1988 as a residential real estate company by businessman [[Wang Jianlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanda.cn/English/About/Column/show_1.shtml |title=Wanda Group threw 5 billion yuan for rock-bottom price bargains, and Wang Jianlin predicted a complete shuffle for the real estate industry - Column of Wang Jianlin - About Wanda |publisher=Dalian Wanda Group |date=November 29, 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210192153/http://www.wanda.cn/English/About/Column/show_1.shtml |archivedate=February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporated in 1992, the company was "one of the first shareholding companies in the PRC" after the [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]].&lt;ref name=dealbook/&gt; The company started to use the name "Wanda" since then. "Wàn" ({{zh|c=万|links=no}}) means ten thousand, and "Dá" ({{zh|c=达|links=no}}) means to reach or attain. In combination, the company's name is a slogan claiming to be able to reach everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wanda-group.com/2016/videos_0524/31.html|title=Wanda’s Globalized "Logo"-Wanda Group|website=www.wanda-group.com|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversification push===
Since 2005,&lt;ref name="update 2013"/&gt; recent years [[Real estate in China|Chinese property]] developers like Dalian Wanda and [[Evergrande Group|Evergrande]] have made forays into "alternative, income-generating businesses away from the property market". The ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that Dalian Wanda was the "most aggressive" in pursuing this strategy, pointing to its 2012 acquisition of U.S. cinema chain [[AMC Theatres]] and 2013 purchase of British yachtmaker [[Sunseeker]]. It noted that it was also "building theme parks across China, and has a joint venture with [[Tencent]] and [[Baidu]] to set up an [[ecommerce|e-commerce]] platform".&lt;ref name=wildau&gt;{{cite news |author1 =Josh Noble |author2 =Gabriel Wildau| title = Dalian Wanda changes property strategy after IPO | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cda49dc0-9c98-11e4-a730-00144feabdc0.html  | work= Financial Times| date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalian Wanda acquired the U.S.-based cinema operator [[AMC Theatres]] in May 2012 for $2.6 billion, the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= | first=|url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-05/D9UTDHIG0.htm |title=News Summary: AMC theater chain to be sold |work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date= May 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition went through successfully in August 2012, making Wanda Cinemas the world’s largest cinema operator.&lt;ref name=ShihMcGee&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shih |first=Willy |authorlink= |author2=McGee, Henry |date=December 2015 |title=Hollywood on the Yellow Sea |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |publisher= |volume=316 |issue=5 |pages=44–51 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/hollywood-on-the-yellow-sea/413185/ |accessdate=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, Wanda owns approximately 6% of all commercial movie screens in China, and about 13% in the U.S.&lt;ref name=ShihMcGee/&gt; The company made major changes in AMC theater design and layout, including generously sized reclining seats, waiter service, and expanded food and drink offerings. Ticket sales at AMC nearly doubled in the 18 months following the acquisition, and by the end of 2014 Wanda had reaped a reported profit of about US$900 million.&lt;ref name=ShihMcGee/&gt; AMC also co-owns of [[Open Road Films]] and [[Fathom Events]].

In June 2013, Dalian Wanda planned to invest $1.1 billion to develop a new five-star hotel in [[London]] next to the [[Thames River]] in [[Vauxhall]], South London, as part of the [[Nine Elms]] regeneration.&lt;ref name="update 2013"/&gt; [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] welcomed this move.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; It is building "Western Europe’s tallest residential building".&lt;ref name=dealbook/&gt; Plans were scrapped in 2015,

In June 2013, Dalian Wanda acquired Sunseeker International, a UK-based maker of luxury yachts used in the [[James Bond]] movies, for $500 million.&lt;ref name="update 2013"/&gt; This acquisition gave them a 92% stake in the company.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title= China's Dalian Wanda to buy UK yacht maker and hotel |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22963760 | work =BBC |date =June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Dalian Wanda purchased an office building in [[Sydney, Australia]], from [[Blackstone Group]] for around $327 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/26/us-blackstone-group-dalianwanda-idUSKBN0KZ03V20150126 "Blackstone to sell prime Sydney property to Dalian Wanda for $327 million"], [[Reuters]], 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The company is "aggressively expanding overseas to move away from China's property market, which has been hit by a slowing economy".&lt;ref name=wildau/&gt;

In June 2015, Wanda Cinemas announced that it had acquired Australian cinema chain [[Hoyts]].&lt;ref name=hoyts /&gt;

In November 2015, it was announced that a [[holding company]], Wanda Film Holdings, will group all film-related assets.&lt;ref name=Frater&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/biz/asia/chinas-wanda-establishes-global-film-unit-1201631841/|title= China’s Wanda Establishes Global Film Division|author= Patrick Frater|date= November 2, 2015|accessdate= November 7, 2015|work= [[variety.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalian Wanda plans for a skyscraper in Chicago to be called [[Wanda Vista]], designed by Chicago architect [[Jeanne Gang]] and will become the city's third-tallest building. If completed, it will become the tallest building in the world designed by a woman, passing Chicago's [[Aqua Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamin|first1=Blair|title=Proposed skyscraper could be third-tallest -- or fifth-tallest -- in Chicago|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-wanda-vista-skyscraper-met-0414-20150413-column.html|accessdate=May 30, 2016|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=Apr 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2016, Wanda Group acquired [[Legendary Entertainment]] for $3.5 billion. The acquisition of Legendary made Wanda Film Holdings the highest revenue-generating film company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Patrick |last=Brzeski |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/official-chinas-wanda-acquires-legendary-854827 |title=It's Official: China's Wanda Acquires Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 Billion |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2016-01-11 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Wanda announced a major partnership with [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], in which it will take minority investments in a number of upcoming releases.

The '''World Universities Debating Championship in Spanish''' or '''Campeonato Mundial Universitario de Debate en Español''' (CMUDE) is the world's largest and most important [[debate|debating]] tournament in Spanish.

It is a [[parliamentary debate|parliamentary debating]] event, held using the [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary Debate]] format. The tournament the winners of the open competition are acknowledged as the "World Champions" of debating in Spanish.

The 2016 tournament was held at [[Universidad de Córdoba]] in [[Spain]]. The 2017 edition will be held at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in [[Guatemala]].

==Format==
The Championship is held in the Northern Hemisphere summer.

The competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become ''power-paired'' as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the ''government'' (''proposition'' in the UK and North America) and two the ''opposition'' in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as ''tabbing''. The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return ''ballots'' with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies.

The nine preliminary rounds are followed by a ''break'' at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. In the current tournament format, 32 teams proceed to the quarter-finals, with the best 2 from each debate qualifying for the semi-finals, and the best 2 of each semi-final subsequently proceed to the Grand Final.

In addition, a public speaking competition is also open to all participants in CMUDE. Since edition held in México in 2014 a Nation's World Cup and a Spanish As a Second Language tournament were introduced.

==Particularities==

There are some differences with the [[World Universities Debating Championships|English-speaking version of the tournament]]. One of them is that there is no limit on the number of teams that a university may register to the tournament as long as they fulfill the "n-1" rule, where "n" represents the number of teams they bring to the tournament and "n-1" is the number of judges they need to provide.

Since the edition in México 2014 a Nation's World Cup has been held. While in Worlds this competition is not taken on a serious manner, the debating formats change year after year and anyone can represent any country or even fictional countries, in the Spanish-speaking version just one team per nation is allowed and the debaters must represent a nation from which they are a national, with the team being formally registered by the representatives of each nation at the tournament.

Another difference is that composite teams can only exist when it is impossible that those debaters could represent their country due to lack of representation.

The "language status" tournament also has a key difference with Worlds. While Worlds' "ESL" and "EFL" tournaments are only for the teams that were not able to break into the main tournament, the "Español como Segunda Lengua" (Spanish As Second Language) competition features a break of all teams eligible due to their language condition regardless of their performance on the main break, thus crowning the outright "Spanish As a Second Language" world champions and not the best of the teams that didn't break.

Finally, since the 2014 edition, a new focus was given to social service, where a full day was dedicated to teach debate to local students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debatecem.org/cmude2014.html&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first debate tournament in the world that includes events of direct social impact as part of its agenda.

==Chile 2012 controversies==

The first criticism of Chile 2012 targeted the motions. Many debaters alleged that some motions were ridicule and hard to debate without tautological definitions, such as "the devil knows better for devil than for old".

During the tournament many observers and teams suspected that the local teams from Universidad Andrés Bello already knew the motions since their arguments had specific information and facts for special cases deemed impossible to know under a 15-minute preparation without the chance to use devices. As well, in the final round many people said the motion wasn't good as a thesis for the great final, nevertheless, all teams from the hosting university, separately, gave the same approach on how they would have addressed the motion and define the concepts of the thesis given after the debate.

As well, there were some discrepancies between the rulings and the actions of certain judges, especially regarding the participation of swing teams in the absence of any team, where the judges applied different criteria in different cases, which represented an injustice to certain universities, considered those cases by the organizers as "the margin of error". In addition to these reviews, there was controversy over cases not covered in the rules, justified as positivised in the operating rules and procedures by the organizers, which later turned out not to be specified in the regulations manual. Moreover, the competition did not follow a "Power matching" format but rather randomized pairings.

The editions held in Spain and Mexico have been exempt from such controversies.

The rebels continued to apply pressure on the weakened government until, after his presidential palace and private residence came under attack from the militant group, Hadi resigned along with his ministers in January 2015. The following month, the Houthis [[2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|declared themselves in control of the government]], dissolving [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|Parliament]] and installing an interim [[Revolutionary Committee (Yemen)|Revolutionary Committee]] led by [[Mohammed Ali al-Houthi]], a cousin of Houthi leader [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]].&lt;ref name="takeover"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2015/feb/06/yemen-shiite-rebels-takeover-country/|agency=The Columbian|title=Yemen's Shiite rebels announce takeover of country|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=6 February 2015|first=Ahmed|last=al-Haj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="installs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/houthi-militia-installs-presidential-council-run-yemen-1600545027|agency=Middle East Eye|title=Houthi militia installs 'presidential council' to run Yemen|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hadi escaped to [[Aden]], where he declared that he remains Yemen's legitimate president, proclaimed the country's temporary capital, and called on loyal government officials and members of the military to rally to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/481862--yemens-hadi-denies-aden-secession|agency=Anadolu Agency|title=Yemen's Hadi denies Aden secession|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e0340c8c-bd9f-11e4-8cf3-00144feab7de.html#axzz3V8LWgg3o|agency=Financial Times|title=UN and Gulf back Yemeni president Hadi amid fears of civil war|date=26 February 2015|accessdate=22 March 2015|first=Simeon|last=Kerr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 2015, [[BBC]] reported that Hadi had "fled rebel forces in the city of Aden" and subsequently "arrived in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh" as "Saudi authorities began air strikes in Yemen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32078817|agency=BBC|title=President Hadi leaves Yemen as Saudi-led raids continue|date=27 March 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yemeni Civil War (2015-present)|Civil War]] subsequently erupted between Hadi's government and the Houthis. Since 2017 the separatist [[Southern Transitional Council]] (STC) has also fought against the government.

==Background==
The wave of protests known as the [[Arab Spring]] did not take long to arrive in Yemen after the [[Tunisian Revolution]]. Yemen was a poor country with a government widely acknowledged to be corrupt, with a large amount of weapons in private hands. By 2011, the country was already facing challenges from [[al Qaeda]]-linked militants and [[Southern Movement|separatists]] in the south and [[Zaydi]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] rebels in the north. Yemen had only been unified since 1990, and deep divisions persisted between the [[North Yemen|north]] and [[South Yemen|south]].

===Ecological Crisis===
Yemen's political instability has been compounded and partly caused by the severe ecological crisis in the country. The average Yemeni has access to only 140 cubic meters of water per year for all uses, (101 gallons per day) while the Middle Eastern average is 1000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr, and the internationally defined threshold for water stress is 1700 cubic meters per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm|title=Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability|publisher=|accessdate=25 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113733/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm|archive-date=26 June 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water supply and sanitation in Yemen|Yemen's groundwater]] is the main source of water in the country but the water tables have dropped severely leaving the country without a viable source of water. For example, in [[Sana'a]], the water table was 30 meters below surface in the 1970s but had dropped to 1200 meters below surface by 2012. The groundwater has not been regulated by Yemen's governments.&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;{{cite news|title=YEMEN: Time running out for solution to water crisis|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/96093/yemen-time-running-out-for-solution-to-water-crisis|accessdate=17 April 2015|agency=[[IRIN]]|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the revolution, Yemen's water situation had been described as increasingly dire by experts who worried that Yemen would be the "first country to run out of water".&lt;ref name="Time Ecocentric"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mahr|first1=Krista|title=What If Yemen Is the First Country to Run Out of Water?|url=http://science.time.com/2010/12/14/what-if-yemen-is-first-country-to-run-out-of-water/|accessdate=17 April 2015|agency=[[TIME Magazine]]|date=Dec 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture in Yemen takes up about 90% of water in Yemen even though it only generates 6% of GDP - however a large portion of Yemenis are dependent on small-scale subsistence agriculture. Half of agricultural water in Yemen is used to grow [[khat]], a narcotic that most Yemenis chew. This means that in such a water-scarce country as Yemen, where half the population is food-insecure, 45% of the water withdrawn from the ever-depleting aquifers is used to grow a crop that feeds nobody.&lt;ref name = "IRIN"/&gt;

This water insecurity has a direct impact on political stability. Outsiders hear most about the [[proxy war]] between factions supported by other countries, but according to the Yemeni newspaper [[Al-Thawra (Yemen)|Al-Thawra]], 70% to 80% of conflicts in the country's rural regions are water-related. The country's Interior Ministry has estimated that across the country, water and land related disputes kill 4,000 people a year - more than terrorism.&lt;ref name=Heffez&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffez|first1=Adam|title=How Yemen Chewed Itself Dry|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139596/adam-heffez/how-yemen-chewed-itself-dry|accessdate=17 April 2015|agency=Foreign Affairs|date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Al-Jawf Governorate]], a dispute over a well's placement has led to a blood feud that has continued for more than 30 years&lt;ref name = "IRIN"/&gt; In 2007, Yemen's minister of Water and Natural Resources suggested that the Sana'a might have to be evacuated if it runs out of water.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Alex:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm "Yemen's khat habit soaks up water."] BBC News, Sana’a, 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government was unable to move the capital in an orderly and peaceful way, the war and political crisis has rendered Sana'a and most of Yemen into a battleground that people have been forced to flee.

Additional environmental catastrophes have battered Yemen as the war has progressed. In late 2015, [[2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season#Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Chapala|two historic cyclones]] struck the country. The first of these, [[Cyclone Chapala]], struck the island of [[Socotra]] before hitting the port of [[Mukalla]] on Yemen's south coast, where it caused catastrophic flash flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fritz|first1=Angela|title=Historic Cyclone Chapala ravages coastal Yemen with catastrophic flash flooding|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/11/03/historic-cyclone-chapala-ravages-coastal-yemen-with-catastrophic-flash-flooding/|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=Washington Post|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This storm, combined with the following [[Cyclone Megh]], left enough moisture in the soil for [[locusts]] to breed. These locusts can fly 100 miles in a day and destroy any crop they encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oakford|first1=Samuel|title=Battered By Civil War and Historic Cyclones, Yemen Now Faces Swarms of Locusts|url=https://news.vice.com/article/battered-by-civil-war-and-historic-cyclones-yemen-now-faces-swarms-of-locusts|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=[[Vice News]]|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Revolution (2011–12)===
Yemen's political crisis began in 2011, amid the [[Arab Spring]] and the ongoing [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen|Houthi insurgency]].

====Protests against Saleh====
[[File:Yemeni Protests 4-Apr-2011 P01.JPG|thumbnail|upright=1.1364|Protesters in [[Sana'a]] on 4 April 2011, during the early stages of the [[Yemeni Revolution]].]]
{{Main|Yemeni Revolution}}
Popular protests broke out in early 2011, led by both secular and [[Islamism|Islamist]] opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28yemen.html|agency=The New York Times|title=Thousands in Yemen Protest Against the Government|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime rebel groups like the [[Houthis]] and the [[Southern Movement]] also participated in the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0211/As-Mubarak-resigns-Yemenis-call-for-a-revolution-of-their-own|agency=Christian Science Monitor|title=As Mubarak resigns, Yemenis call for a revolution of their own|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/02/27/yemens-houthi-movement-and-the-revolution/|agency=Foreign Policy|date=27 February 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015|title=Yemen’s Houthi movement and the revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleh responded with a violent crackdown, and the country nearly disintegrated into an all-out civil war as several army elements broke with the government and joined the protesters, beginning in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011320180579476.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Top army commanders defect in Yemen|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/yemens-crackdown-on-protesters-escalates-to-air-strikes-risking-war/239054/|agency=The Atlantic|title=Yemen's Crackdown on Protesters Escalates to Air Strikes, Risking War|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saleh was almost killed when a bomb went off in a mosque where he and other top government officials were praying on 3 June, apparently in an assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/26/uk-yemen-president-idUKTRE75P0NO20110626|agency=Reuters|title=Yemen's Saleh injured by planted bomb – source|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13892502|agency=BBC News|accessdate=8 February 2015|title=Yemen: President Saleh 'was injured by palace bomb'|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his condition initially appeared grave, Saleh recovered and returned to work on 23 September after several months of medical treatment in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/yemeni-president-ali-abdullah-saleh-returns-from-saudi-arabia/2011/09/23/gIQAdfrhpK_story.html|agency=The Washington Post|title=Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh makes unexpected return from Saudi Arabia|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Vice President Hadi in charge during his absence. As acting president, Hadi met with the opposition and reportedly expressed openness to political reforms. However, he rejected the idea of forcing Saleh from power without the president's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/yemens-opposition-meets-with-acting-president/2011/06/13/AGrPblTH_story.html|agency=The Washington Post|title=Yemen’s opposition meets with acting president|date=13 June 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015|first=Sudarsan|last=Raghavan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deal brokered====
The [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] applied no small amount of pressure on Saleh to negotiate an end to the uprising by stepping down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/gcc-expects-end-to-yemen-crisis-as-pressure-builds-on-saleh-to-depart|agency=The National|title=GCC ‘expects end to Yemen crisis’ as pressure builds on Saleh to depart|first=Mohammed|last=Al Qadhi|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks after returning from Saudi Arabia, Saleh finally agreed on 23 November to resign in exchange for immunity. As part of the deal, the opposition agreed to allow Hadi to stand unopposed for the presidency in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/report-torture-excessive-force-used-in-bahrain-crackdown-but-no-iranian-links/2011/11/23/gIQAOOgtoN_story.html|agency=The Washington Post|title=Yemen president Saleh to step down; Bahrain acknowledges that crackdown used torture, excessive force|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siege of Dammaj====
{{Main|Siege of Dammaj}}
Meanwhile, the [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen|insurgent]] [[Houthis]] in northern Yemen laid siege to a [[Salafi]] town in [[Saada Governorate]], [[Dammaj]]. Fighting was worst in November and December. The Yemeni military was unable to restore order due to the crisis elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/100214/yemen-shia-militia-sunni-madrassa |agency=The New Republic|title=A Militia, a Madrassa, and the Story Behind a Siege in Yemen|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional period (2012–14)===
The [[Yemeni Revolution]] came to an apparently successful conclusion in 2012 for the opposition, as Saleh left office. However, unrest continued in both northern and southern Yemen.

====Election of Hadi====
[[File:Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi 2013.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|[[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], the second [[President of Yemen]].]]
{{Main|Yemeni presidential election, 2012}}
Hadi's election on 24 February 2012 peacefully introduced a new government in Yemen, with only a small percentage of voters spoiling their ballots in the single-candidate contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/world/middleeast/yemen-to-get-a-new-president-abed-rabu-mansour-hadi.html?_r=0|agency=The New York Times|title=Yemen Gets New Leader as Struggle Ends Calmly|accessdate=8 February 2015|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadi, a southerner, especially enjoyed support in former South Yemen, quieting the murmurs of separatism,&lt;ref name="dialogue"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/20/us-yemen-south-dialogue-idUSBRE8BJ0HT20121220|agency=Reuters|title=Some Yemeni separatists to join national dialogue|first=Mohammed|last=Mukhashaf|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Southern Movement]] boycotted the presidential election, as did the Houthis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1542/news/246/Houthis-and-Southern-Movement-to-boycott-February-election.htm|agency=Yemen Times|title=Houthis and Southern Movement to boycott February election |date=30 January 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadi did not give the restive Houthis any seats in his cabinet.&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt;

====Dammaj clashes continue====
The [[siege of Dammaj|conflict]] in Dammaj was renewed in April when fighting broke out between Houthi tribesmen and Salafi students. Both sides accused the other of breaking a truce agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1566/news/745/Houthi-Salafi-confrontations-renewed-in-Sa%E2%80%99ada.htm|agency=Yemen Times|title=Houthi-Salafi confrontations renewed in Sa'ada|date=22 April 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hadi makes inroads====
National reconciliation talks were held with the participation of many separatist elements, as well as the Houthis.&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dialogue"/&gt;

Nine years after the death of [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]], the Yemeni government turned over the remains of the Houthi patriarch to his family and he was buried in northern Yemen in June 2013, with a representative of the Hadi administration in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/06/2013669532870100.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Yemen's Houthi rebel leader laid to rest|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadi visited the [[United States]], a key overseas ally, in July 2013. The U.S. also lifted a ban on transferring detainees from its [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]] to Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/obama-yemeni-president_n_3654380.html|agency=The Huffington Post|title=Obama To Host Yemeni President Abdo Rabby Mansour Hadi At White House|first=Jim|last=Kuhnhenn|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Saudi Arabia]] deported as many as 300,000 to 400,000 Yemeni migrant workers to their home country during 2013, causing an influx of poor, landless Yemenis into northern Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/pomegranate/2013/12/deported-yemeni-migrant-workers|title=Down and out|date=10 December 2013|accessdate=8 February 2015|agency=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renewed clashes====
The conflict between Houthis and Salafis in [[Saada Governorate]] was renewed in October and November. Saada government officials accused Houthi fighters of attacking a Salafi mosque in [[Dammaj]] in an attempt to drive the [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] out, while the Houthis accused the Salafis of using the religious institute as a staging ground for foreign Sunni fighters. The government attempted to intervene to stop the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/meast/yemen-violence/|agency=CNN|title=Yemen: Sectarian fighting kills dozens|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sectarian fighting in [[Al Jawf Governorate]] lasted throughout the year. [[Dhamar Governorate]] also saw clashes between the Houthis and Salafis toward the end of the year.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1813/report/4294/The-Houthis-From-a-local-group-to-a-national-power.htm|title=THE HOUTHIS: FROM A LOCAL GROUP TO A NATIONAL POWER|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=8 February 2015|agency=Yemen Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Houthi rebellion (2014–15)===
In a dramatic turn of events, the rebel Houthis took broad control of northern Yemen, including the capital of Sana'a itself, in 2014.

====Shia–Sunni conflict spreads====
{{Main|Battle of Amran}}
Clashes in Dammaj spread to the [[Amran Governorate]] by January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Jan-05/243146-clashes-kill-at-least-23-in-north-yemen.ashx#axzz2oNa3sbT8|agency=The Daily Star|title=Clashes kill at least 23 in north Yemen|date=5 January 2014|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houthis achieved victory in Saada when the Yemeni government brokered a deal under which Salafi fighters and their families were evacuated to the neighboring [[Al Hudaydah Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/837244.shtml#.UtU6aNJDvAk|title=Yemeni gov't evacuates Salafis from northern conflicts|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports, the Houthis then blocked government troops from fully deploying throughout the territory, in spite of a signed agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/salafis-forced-flee-dammaj-government-forces-unable-protect-them-they-say|agency=ReliefWeb|title=Salafis forced to flee Dammaj, government forces unable to protect them, they say|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting in the Amran Governorate intensified during the year, with clashes between Houthis and supporters of the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Islah Party]] eventually leading to a Houthi takeover of the entire governorate. The conflict spread to the [[Sana'a Governorate]] by July.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

====Houthis take Sana'a====
{{Main|Battle of Sana'a (2014)}}
The [[Houthis]] began protesting against Hadi's government to demand concessions in order to resolve a years-long [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen|insurgency]] they had been waging against the Yemeni state in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1813/news/4284/Houthis-block-roads-in-Sana%E2%80%99a.htm|title=Houthis block roads in Sana'a |date=4 September 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising escalated dramatically as Houthi fighters swept into [[Sana'a]], the capital, and effectively seized control of the city from the Yemeni military within a couple of days in September.

The Houthis and the government agreed on 21 September to form a "unity government" within one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/21/us-yemen-security-idUSKBN0HG04T20140921|agency=Reuters|title=Houthi rebels sign deal with Yemen parties to form new government|first=Mohammed|last=Ghobari|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Houthis rejected Hadi's original choice of prime minister, [[Ahmad Awad bin Mubarak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29530635|agency=BBC News|title=Yemen's Houthi rebels reject Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak as PM|date=7 October 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oil Minister [[Khaled Bahah]] was appointed instead with the armed group's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/new-yemeni-prime-minister-appointed-20141013112111586298.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Yemen appoints new PM to end crisis|date=13 October 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houthis and the [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] led by Saleh announced abruptly on 8 November that they would not participate in the unity government, claiming it was unacceptable to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2407344&amp;Language=en|agency=KUNA|title=Yemen's GPC, Houthis oppose new gov't|date=11 October 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott prompted sanctions against Saleh and senior Houthi leaders from the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saleh-and-houthis-boycott-new-yemen-government-1190152028|agency=Middle East Eye|title=US blacklists Yemen ex-president Saleh, Houthi commanders|date=9 November 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War in Yemen (2015–present)===
Yemen was riven in 2015, with the Houthis establishing a new government in Sana'a and Hadi retreating with his supporters to Aden, and later Saudi Arabia. The Arab League, led by the Saudis, began a bombing campaign and mobilization of various armed forces in the region for a possible invasion.

====Houthis consolidate power====

{{Main|2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état}}
The Houthis stepped up their pressure on Hadi's weakened government, seizing the presidential palace and strategic military installations in [[Sana'a]] and shelling the president's private residence on 20 January. The following day, they took control of Hadi's home, stationing armed guards outside to keep him under virtual house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/20/yemen-crisis-negotiations.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Yemen rebels seize presidential palace|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadi, Prime Minister [[Khaled Bahah]], and the cabinet resigned the following day, saying they could not continue to work under the conditions the Houthis had imposed. The rebel group welcomed Hadi's resignation, but continued to keep him under house arrest. The news prompted four southern governorates to announce they would disregard all orders from Sana'a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/01/22/Yemen-government-offers-resignation.html|agency=Al Arabiya|title=Yemeni President Hadi resigns from office|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|House of Representatives]] was to meet on 25 January to discuss whether to accept or reject Hadi's resignation under the [[Constitution of Yemen|Yemeni constitution]], but the session was cancelled after the Houthis took control of the parliament building. The [[United Nations]] stepped in to attempt a negotiated resolution to what many in Yemen regarded as a Houthi coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/yemen-parliament-session-canceled-1422199790|agency=Wall Street Journal|title=Protests in Yemen Support President as Factions Negotiate His Future|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN negotiations were fruitless, and a Houthi ultimatum to Yemen's political factions to find a solution was not met. On 6 February, the Houthis declared themselves in total control of the Yemeni government, dissolving parliament and installing a [[Revolutionary Committee (Yemen)|Revolutionary Committee]] led by [[Mohammed Ali al-Houthi]] to lead the state in an interim capacity. The announcement sparked protests in Sana'a and other cities, especially in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/yemen-s-shiite-rebels-say-they-re-in-charge-now-1.2224147|agency=CTV News|title=Yemen's Shiite rebels say they're in charge now|first=Ahmed|last=al-Haj|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/thousands-protest-houthi-coup-yemen-150207082035654.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Thousands protest against Houthi coup in Yemen|date=7 February 2015|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-coup developments====
{{Main|Aftermath of the 2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état}}
Reactions to the Houthi takeover were broadly negative, with the [[Arab League]], [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], [[United Nations]], and [[United States]] refusing to recognise the "constitutional declaration" and several [[governorates of Yemen|governorates]] rejecting the Houthis' authority. With most political parties criticising the coup, [[Jamal Benomar]], the UN envoy to Yemen, announced a resumption of [[National Dialogue Conference|national talks]] over the future of Yemen on 8 February. Benomar said the Houthis had agreed to participate in the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ahmed|last=al-Haj|agency=ABC News|date=8 February 2015|accessdate=8 February 2015|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/envoy-back-yemen-crisis-deepens-28809093|title=UN Envoy Says Yemen National Talks Will Resume Amid Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called for Hadi to be reinstated as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/un-calls-for-yemen-president-hadi-s-reinstatement-1.1453472|agency=Gulfnews.com|title=UN calls for Yemen President Hadi’s reinstatement|date=8 February 2015|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Houthis and other factions reached a tentative agreement, announced on 20 February, to keep the [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|House of Representatives]] in place despite the "constitutional declaration" dissolving it two weeks prior. The agreement also stipulated that a "people's transitional council" would be established to represent southerners, women, youth, and other political minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/yemen-parties-agree-transitional-council-says-united-nations-envoy-1424424249|agency=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015|title=Yemen Parties Agree to Transitional Council, U.N. Envoy Says}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Hadi traveled to [[Aden]], where he said all Houthi-directed actions since 21 September 2014 were invalid, and condemned the coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/yemen-leader-hadi-leaves-sanaa-weeks-house-arrest-150221090018174.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Yemen's Hadi says Houthis decisions unconstitutional|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/2015/02/22/Yemens-ousted-president-Hadi-calls-for-Houthis-to-quit-capital/|agency=The Star Online|title=Yemen's ousted president Hadi calls for Houthis to quit capital|date=22 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil war erupts====
{{Main|Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)}}
[[Battle of Aden (2015)|Fighting broke out]] over [[Aden International Airport]] on 19 March, with special forces loyal to ex-president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] attempting to seize the airport before they were defeated by troops and militiamen under orders from the Hadi administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/world/middleeast/yemen-aden-airport-battle.html?_r=0|agency=The New York Times|title=Battle for Aden Airport Stokes Fears of Wider Conflict in Yemen|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, in an apparently unrelated incident, four suicide bombers [[2015 Sana'a mosque bombings|detonated themselves in Sana'a mosques]] packed with Houthi congregants, killing at least 142. The [[Sunni Islam]]ist group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's]] [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Yemen Province|Yemen branch]] claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/two-mosques-yemen-attacked-suicide-bombers-during-friday-prayers-many-injured-671470|agency=Albawaba News|title=BREAKING: Death toll hits 137 from suicide bomb attacks in Yemen mosques|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/03/20/Yemen-mosque-attacks-kill-35-during-Friday-prayers.html|agency=Al Arabiya|title=Death toll in Yemen bombing rises to 142|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadi declared Aden to be Yemen's temporary capital on 21 March while Sana'a remains under Houthi control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/yemens-president-hadi-declares-new-temporary-capital/a-18332197|agency=Deutsche Welle|title=Yemen's President Hadi declares new 'temporary capital'|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Houthi forces advanced toward Aden, capturing key parts of Yemen's third city of [[Taiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/middleeast/houthi-rebels-taiz-yemen.html?_r=0|agency=The New York Times|title=Rebels Seize Key Parts of Yemen’s Third-Largest City, Taiz|date=22 March 2015|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consolidated their grip on much of the south and [[Battle of Aden (2015)|seized much of Aden itself]] by early April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3771848/yemen-houthis-fighting-saudi-arabia-air-strikes/|agency=TIME|title=The Crisis in Yemen Intensifies as Houthi Fighters Push Deeper Into Aden|date=6 April 2015|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen=====
{{Main|Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen}}
{{see also|Human rights violations during the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)}}
On 26 March, [[Saudi Arabia]] and several other countries announced that they had begun military operations in Yemen against Houthi rebels. [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] issued a statement along with Saudi Arabia saying their goal is to "repel Houthi aggression" in Yemen. [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], and [[Sudan]] are also members of the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32061632|title=Saudi Arabia launches military operation in Yemen - envoy|date=26 March 2015|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to airstrikes against targets throughout Yemen, which the General People's Congress blamed for causing dozens of civilian casualties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/26/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-airstrikes/|agency=CNN|title=Saudi-led coalition strikes rebels in Yemen, inflaming tensions in region|date=26 March 2015|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian warships reportedly shelled a Houthi column as it advanced toward Aden on 30 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/126506/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-warships-shell-Houthis-outside-Yemeni-cit.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=1 April 2015|title=Egyptian warships shell Houthis outside Yemeni city of Aden: Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saudi and Houthi forces traded artillery and rocket fire across the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yemen-crisis-saudi-arabia-forces-houthi-rebels-clash-border-yemen-calls-ground-troops-1865976|agency=International Business Times|title=Yemen Crisis: Saudi Arabia Forces, Houthi Rebels Clash On Border As Yemen Calls For Ground Troops|first=Kukil|last=Bora|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8 October 2016 attack by the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi Arabian-led coalition]] killed at least 140 people and injured more than 600  in [[Sana'a]]. This was one of the single worst death tolls in the two-year war.  Saudi Arabia and its allies accepted the internal review's finding, by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), that the coalition's bombardment of this funeral ceremony was based on faulty information, i.e., that this was a gathering of armed Houthi leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37613440 Yemen conflict: 'Saudi-led coalition plane' hit funeral (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/998181/middle-east |title=JIAT: Yemen funeral targeted based on wrong information; Coalition accepts findings |date=15 October 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |publisher=Arab News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cholera epidemic====

A severe [[cholera]] epidemic has begun in Yemen during the civil war. In July 2017, the [[United Nations]] Humanitarian Relief coordinator said that over 320,000 cases had been reported.&lt;ref name="Yemenis die" /&gt; He also blamed the epidemic on the war and on international forces supporting the combatants.&lt;ref name="Yemenis die"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, it was described as already the worst cholera outbreak in recorded history, with over 800,000 cases.&lt;ref&gt;
