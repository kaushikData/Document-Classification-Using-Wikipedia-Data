      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9372">The '''2018 U.S. Prison Strike''' is an ongoing series of [[Work stoppage|work stoppages]] and [[Hunger strike|hunger strikes]]&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/640493211/inmates-plan-to-hold-two-week-strike-at-prisons-across-u-s|title=Inmates Plan To Hold Weeks-Long Strike At Prisons Across U.S.|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in prisons across the United States that began on August 21 and is set to end on September 9.&lt;ref name=Vox&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17721874/national-prison-strike-2018-13th-amendment-attica|title=Why the 2018 prison strike could be "one of the largest" in US history|work=Vox|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strike is being conducted at least in part in response to the April 2018 prison riot at [[Lee Correctional Institution]], which killed seven inmates and was the deadliest prison riot in the U.S. in the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

The start and end dates of the strike have symbolic meaning as they were planned to coincide with the 47th anniversary of the death of [[George_Jackson_(activist)#Death|George Jackson]], who was shot in an escape attempt on August 21, 1971, and the [[Attica Prison riot]], which occurred on September 9, 1971.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

== Organizers ==
The prison strike was called for and is being organized primarily by [[Jailhouse Lawyers Speak]]&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; and [[Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee]], which is a prisoner-lead section of [[Industrial Workers of the World]].&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; [[Millions for Prisoners]], and [[The People's Consortium]]&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; are some of the other groups involved.

== Demands ==
The following are the demands of the Prison Strike according to the official page:&lt;ref name =official&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://incarceratedworkers.org/campaigns/prison-strike-2018|title=Prison Strike 2018|date=2018-06-19|work=Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Immediate improvements to the conditions of prisons and prison policies that recognize the humanity of imprisoned men and women.
# An immediate end to [[Penal labour|prison slavery]]. All persons imprisoned in any place of detention under United States jurisdiction must be paid the [[prevailing wage]] in their state or territory for their labor.
# The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] must be rescinded, allowing imprisoned humans a proper channel to address grievances and violations of their rights.
# The [[Truth in sentencing|Truth in Sentencing Act]] and the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] must be rescinded so that imprisoned humans have a possibility of rehabilitation and parole. No human shall be sentenced to Death by Incarceration or serve any sentence without the possibility of parole.
# An immediate end to the [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|racial overcharging, over-sentencing, and parole denials]] of Black and brown humans. Black humans shall no longer be denied parole because the victim of the crime was white, which is a particular problem in southern states.
# An immediate end to racist [[Gang injunction#Racial profiling|gang enhancement laws]] targeting Black and brown humans.
# No imprisoned human shall be denied access to [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation programs]] at their place of detention because of their label as a violent offender.
# State prisons must be funded specifically to offer more rehabilitation services.
# [[Pell Grant|Pell grants]] must be reinstated in all US states and territories.
# The [[Felony disenfranchisement|voting rights]] of all confined citizens serving prison sentences, pretrial detainees, and so-called “ex-felons” must be counted. Representation is demanded. All voices count.

== Timeline == 

=== Pre-Emptive Censorship &amp; Repression (June - July 2018)===
 
In late June Ronald Brooks, is transferred from [[Angola Prison]] to the [[David Wade Correctional Center]] after he makes a pro-strike video.

In late July [[Siddique Hassan]] is reported for five violations of prison rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Imam Hasan conduct report July 27, 2018 |url=https://incarceratedworkers.org/resources/imam-hasan-conduct-report-july-27-2018 |website=Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including “Rioting, or encouraging others to riot”, most likely as a way to prevent him from speaking to the media during the strike, as he had in the [[2016 Prison Strike]].

=== Strike Activity Begins Early (August 2018)===

On August 9th, the first confirmed strike activity begins at the GEO Group prison in response to administration cutting family visits, harassing families, strip searching elder family members, and STIU targeting, harassing, and abusing inmates. 3 housing units joined in the work stoppage. In response, New Mexico prison officials put all state prisons on lockdown on August 20th as a preemptive measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cantú |first1=Aaron |title=NM prison bosses lift statewide lockdown as activists claim protests by inmates |url=https://www.sfreporter.com/news/2018/08/27/nm-prison-bosses-lift-statewide-lockdown-as-activists-claim-protests-by-inmates/ |accessdate=9 September 2018 |agency=Santa Fe Reporter |date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19th, prisoners in the [[Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility|Burnside jail]] in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada hold a protest and release a statement in support of the strike and with their own list of demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=El |title=The prisoners at the Burnside jail are engaged in a non-violent protest; here is their statement |url=https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/province-house/the-prisoners-at-the-burnside-jail-are-engaged-in-a-non-violent-protest-here-is-their-statement/ |accessdate=9 September 2018 |agency=Halifax Examiner |date=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strike Begins===
While most news on strike activity didn't reach the outside on the first day, the strike received widespread attention from numerous news outlets including USA Today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Dalvin |title=Prisoners nationwide go on strike to protest 'modern-day slavery' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/21/prisoners-strike-protest-attica-lee-correctional/1045008002/ |accessdate=9 September 2018 |agency=USA Today |date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsweek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Da Silva |first1=Chantal |title=U.S. Inmates Launching Nationwide Strike to 'End Prison Slavery' |url=https://www.newsweek.com/us-inmates-launching-nationwide-prison-strike-end-prison-slavery-1082034 |accessdate=9 September 2018 |agency=Newsweek |date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and National Public Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Corley |first1=Cheryl |title=U.S. Inmates Plan Nationwide Prison Strike To Protest Labor Conditions |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/640630606/u-s-inmates-plan-nationwide-prison-strike-to-protest-labor-conditions |accessdate=9 September 2018 |agency=National Public Radio |date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 200 detained immigrants at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, WA engaged in a hunger strike and/or work stoppage, releasing a statement stating that they are,
"acting with solidarity for all those people who are being detained wrongfully, and stand together to help support all those women who have been separated from their children, and to stop all the family separations happening today for a lot of us are also being separated and we have U.S. citizen children.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Detainee Speaks Out from Hunger Strike in Northwest Detention Center |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/8/27/headlines/listen_to_detainee_on_hunger_strike_in_northwest_detention_center |accessdate=9 September 2018 |agency=Democracy Now! |date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heriberto Sharky Garcia, incarcerated in Repressa, California declares a hunger strike.&lt;ref name="With US Prison Strike on Third Day, Reports of Hunger Strikes and Work Stoppages Nationwide"&gt;{{cite web |title=With US Prison Strike on Third Day, Reports of Hunger Strikes and Work Stoppages Nationwide |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/08/23/us-prison-strike-third-day-reports-hunger-strikes-and-work-stoppages-nationwide |website=Common Dreams |accessdate=10 September 2018 |language=en |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also unconfirmed reports of 11 out of 143 prisons in Florida being affected, although the Florida Department of Corrections denied that they had any stoppages, protests, or lockdowns related to the strike.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pilkington |first1=Ed |title=Major prison strike spreads across US and Canada as inmates refuse food |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/prison-strike-us-canada-forced-labor-protest-activism |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2042">'''Artcirq''' is an [[Inuit]] [[circus]] performance collective based in [[Igloolik]], [[Nunavut]], Canada.  It was co-founded in 1998 by [[Guillaume Saladin]] and several circus artists from Montreal and youth from Igloolik, with the financial support of [[Igloolik Isuma Productions]], Canada's first Inuit independent production company and [[Cirque Éloize]]. Its activities provide Inuit youth with a vehicle for creative expression that maintains strong links to Inuit traditions and performance styles.

Artcirq members blend techniques of modern circus arts such as [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], and [[clowning]] with traditional Inuit cultural practices including [[Inuit traditional games]], [[Inuit throat singing|throat singing]], and [[Inuit music|drum dancing]] to create meaningful and original work through performing arts, music, and video.

Artcirq has been invited to perform across the globe from Mexico to Greece to Timbuktu, including the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games Opening Ceremony and Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee pageant in Windsor Castle. The collective has produced numerous short films as well as three albums: ''Artcirq Jam'', ''Made In Igloolik'', and ''Kikkukia''. The documentary film ''Circus Without Borders'', produced by Northern Light Productions, features Artcirq's story.

Most recently, Artcirq members have been coordinating an extra-curricular community arts program for youth at its Black Box studio in Igloolik. It is through these projects that Artcirq enables Inuit artists to express and redefine themselves together in their changing world.

'''Billy Brown of London Town''' was a cartoon character, drawn by [[David Langdon (cartoonist)|David Langdon]],&lt;ref name="british-cartoon-archive-david-langdon"&gt;[http://opal.kent.ac.uk/cartoonx-cgi/artist.py?id=103 Langdon, David] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718145532/http://opal.kent.ac.uk/cartoonx-cgi/artist.py?id=103 |date=18 July 2007 }}, [[British Cartoon Archive]], [[University of Kent]]&lt;/ref&gt; who featured on [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] posters during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="british-cartoon-archive-david-langdon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-doris-poynter"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/83/a6976083.shtml BBC - WW2 People's War - BILLY BROWN OF LONDON TOWN], [[BBC]], retrieved 2 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's appearance was that of a [[City of London]] businessman of the time, wearing a [[bowler hat]] and [[pinstripe suit]], and carrying an umbrella.&lt;ref name="bbc-doris-poynter"/&gt;

==Posters==
One example of a London Underground poster showed a passenger peeling back tape placed on train windows:&lt;ref name="bbc-doris-poynter"/&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em"&gt;
On the train a fellow sits
And pulls the window net to bits
Because the view is somewhat dim,
A fact which seems to bother him.
As Billy cannot bear the sight,
He says, "My man, this isn't right.
I trust you'll pardon my correction,
That stuff is there for your protection."
&lt;/poem&gt;
One commuter replied by writing&lt;ref name="bbc-doris-poynter"/&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em"&gt;
I thank you for the information but I can’t see my bloody station.
&lt;/poem&gt;

An example of a bus poster had him saying "Kindly pass along the bus and so make room for all of us" because passengers clustered around doors.&lt;ref name="bbc-doris-poynter"/&gt; A graffiti reply read "That's alright without a doubt, but how the H–ll do we get out".&lt;ref name="bbc-doris-poynter"/&gt;

Another example of a bus poster had him waving a white object:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wheels of London|author=Marshall, Prince|page=119|publisher=The Sunday Times Magazine|date=1972|ISBN=0-7230-0068-9}} Retrieved 15 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em"&gt;
Billy Brown's own highway Code
For blackouts is "Stay off the Road".
He'll never step out and begin
To meet a bus that's pulling in.
He doesn't wave his torch at night,
But "flags" his bus with something white.
He never jostles in a queue,
But waits and takes his turn. Do you?
&lt;/poem&gt;

Billy Brown was also a mascot on sorties over [[Berlin]] during the war, with the advice "I trust it suffers no deflection, this stuff is for the Hun's correction" (i.e. [[Adolf Hitler]].).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wheels of London|author=Marshall, Prince|pages=79|publisher=The Sunday Times Magazine|date=1972|ISBN=0-7230-0068-9}} Retrieved 15 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em"&gt;
To-day's Good Deed
When you travel to and fro
On a line you really know,
Remember those who aren't so sure,
And haven't been that way before.
Do your good deed for the day
Tell them the stations on the way.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Billy Brown's good deeds were not always welcomed by some. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' later quoted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Halliday, Stephen|title=Amazing and Extraordinary London Underground Facts|publisher=David and Charles|page=91|ISBN=978-0-7153-3277-1}} Retrieved 9 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em"&gt;
Some day pretty soon, by heck,
Billy Brown, I'll wring your neck.
&lt;/poem&gt;

[[File:Nascimento Caboclo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Statues showing the birth of a Caboclo.]]

A '''caboclo''' ({{IPA-pt|kɐˈboklu}}, also pronounced "caboco"; from [[Brazilian Portuguese]], perhaps ultimately from [[Tupi language|Tupi]] ''kaa'boc'', means a "person having copper-coloured skin"&lt;ref name=WordReference.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Caboclo|url=http://www.wordreference.com/definition/caboclo|work=WordReference|publisher=WordReference.com|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (English: cabloke) is a person of [[Multiracial|mixed]] [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous Brazilian]] and [[White people|European]] ancestry (the first, most common use), or a culturally assimilated person of full Amerindian descent. In Brazil, a ''caboclo'' generally refers to this specific type of ''[[mestico|mestiço]]''. A person of mixed Indigenous Brazilian and sub-Saharan black ancestry is known as a "''[[cafuzo]]''".

In the 1872 and 1890 censuses, 3.90% and 9.04% of the population self-identified as caboclos, respectively. Since then, caboclos are counted as [[pardo]]s, along with [[mulattoes]] (mixed Black-White) and [[zambos|cafuzos]] (mixed Amerindian-Black).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicacoes.fcc.org.br/ojs/index.php/cp/article/view/1262/1266 |title= A classificação de "cor" nas pesquisas do IBGE|last=Araújo |first=Tereza Cristina N. |page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey performed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] showed that 14% of Whites and 6% of Pardos reported a mixed Amerindian and White ancestry.&lt;ref name=Telles&gt;{{cite book|pages=81–84|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|author=Edward Eric Telles|chapter=Racial Classification|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11866-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mexican researcher Lizcano, based on a non genetic based estimation, caboclos (''mestizos'') would be 12% of Brazilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI|last=Lizcano |first=Francisco |page= 225|publisher= Centro de Investigación en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades, UAEM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''caboclo'' (which in the Amazon Basin and in [[Candomblé]] is usually pronounced without the ''l'', as ''caboco'') is said to come from the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] word ''kari'boka'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} meaning "deriving from the white". Its primary meaning is ''mestizo'', "a person of part Amerindian and part European descent." But it may also be used to refer to any Indigenous Brazilian who is assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;Wafer, James William. ''The Taste of Blood: Spirit Possession in Brazilian Candomblé''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Indian should not be confused with people originating from India in South Asia.

The king of Portugal, D. Joseph I, encouraged marriages between European colonists and Indians in the 18th century; this enabled the European men to settle into families, and resulted in the birth of the first ''caboclo'' children. Similarly, in the 19th century during the time of [[rubber soldier]]s, the government recruited young, primarily white and ''mestiço'' Brazilian men from [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] and transported them into the Amazonian interior to harvest [[rubber]]. The men were never granted permission to leave, and married local native women, fathering more generations of mestiços.

The ''caboclo'' populations in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] region of Brazil are noted as voracious eaters of the ''[[açaí]]'' palm fruit, which is basic to the traditional diet of the natives. In one study, ''açaí'' palm was described as the most important plant species because the fruit makes up such a major component of diet (up to 42% of the total food intake by weight) and is economically valuable in the region (Murrieta et al., 1999).

The term ''caboco'' is also used as an alternate term for the ''[[Orisha]]s'' of the [[Candomblé]] religion. The caboclo is also an Orisha.

==Days celebrating racial groups in Brazil== 
*In Brazil, the "Day of the Caboclo" (''Dia do Caboclo''), observed annually on June 24, in celebration of the contributions and identity of the [[mameluco|original caboclos]] and their descendants. This date is an official public holiday in the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|State of Amazonas]].
*"[[Mixed Race Day]]" (''Dia do [[Mestiço]]'') is observed annually on June 27, three days after the [[Day of the Caboclo]], in celebration of all [[mixed-race Brazilian]]s, including the caboclos. The date is an official public holiday in three [[Brazilian states]].
*"[[Indian Day (Brazil)|Indian Day]]" (''Dia do Índio''), observed annually on April 19, recognizes and honours the [[indigenous peoples of Brazil]].
*"[[Black Awareness Day]]" (''Dia da Consciência Negra'') is observed annually on November 20 as a day "to celebrate a regained awareness by the [[Afro-Brazilians|black community]] about their great worth and contribution to the country". The date is an official public holiday in five Brazilian states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12975">The origins of the '''Château de l'Hers''', in [[Châteauneuf-du-Pape]] on the banks of the [[Rhône]], go back to the beginning of the 10th century. Until the [[French Revolution]] it was an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] of [[Languedoc]] in the [[Comtat Venaissin]]. Protected as a historic monument since 1973, it has given its name to a [[winery]].

== From prehistory to late antiquity ==
Various elements of the château de l'Hers attest to the occupation of this strategically important location as a control point for river traffic, since late Antiquity at the latest. Several tombs with [[saddleback roof]]s form a small 6th-7th [[necropolis]] not far from the first known chapel of the château, dedicated to [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]]. An excavation of this ruined church found [[lithic stage|lithic]] [[Industry (archaeology)|industries]], and [[sherd]]s from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Iron Age]], fragments of [[imbrex and tegula|Tegula]] tiles and a [[cipolin]] [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] probably dating to Antiquity were re-used in the [[masonry]]. A large number of weapons, coins and medals were found in the area. The tollgate on the Rhône was put in place in 79 AD under [[Vespasian]], according to V. Millet (1864).

There must have been a Roman ''[[castra|castrum]]'', probably destroyed in the [[great invasions]].&lt;ref name="chateau"&gt;[http://www.avignon-et-provence.com/vins-chateauneuf-du-pape/chateau-mont-redon/histoire-chateauneuf-du-pape.htm#.UU5IbRfvjVo Histoire de Châteauneuf-du-Pape sur le site avignon-et-provence.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This appeared under the name of ''castellum de Leri'' in a 913 [[charter]].&lt;ref&gt;Jules Courtet, ''op. cit.'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed by [[Louis the Blind]] and ceded it to Foulques, Bishop of Avignon.

== The old château of Châteauneuf-du-Pape ==
[[File:Châteauneuf_du_Pape_Château_de_l'Hers.jpg|left|thumb|The old château of Châteauneuf-du-Pape]]
In 1077, his successor Rostaing granted the fief to Pierre d'Albaron, who built a keep there.&lt;ref name="RB154"/&gt; The first mention of a ''Castro Novo'' (new fortified village), which led to the name Châteauneuf-du-Pape, does not appear until 1094&lt;ref&gt;Alain Dugas, ''Château La Nerthe'', 2009 [http://www.chateaulanerthe.fr/iefr/charte2009.pdf en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the château de l'Hers after it was expanded in the 12th century and then was renovated for the first time during the 13th century.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"&gt;[http://patrimoine-de-france.com/vaucluse/chateauneuf-du-pape/chateau-de-l-hers-ou-de-l-airs-ruines-3.php Le château de l'Hers sur le site patrimoine-de-france.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain historians have said that the [[Knights Templar]] used it at the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="chateau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JC147"&gt;Jules Courtet, ''op.&amp;nbsp;cit.'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; This legend was disproven by the historians in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bailly, opere citato, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Hers (or Lair, or Lers), become an enclave of [[Languedoc]] on the right bank of the [[Rhône]], the château and its village were in ruins during the 12th century. Historical texts say that the parish had two places of worship, the parish church named Sainte-Marie and the château's chapel dedicated to [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]]&lt;ref name="RB155"&gt;Robert Bailly, ''op.&amp;nbsp;cit.'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques d'Euze, formerly bishop of Avignon, was elected pope in 1316 and took the name [[Pope John XXII|John XXII]]. Châteauneuf fell directly under his authority. Barely pope for three months, he had construction undertaken at l'Hers. The accounts of the [[Apostolic Camera]] say that he allocated &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;3,000&amp;nbsp;[[florin]]s&lt;/span&gt; to the restoration of the old 12-century château.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Saltarelli, ''op.&amp;nbsp;cit.'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhône tollgate and watch tower ==
[[File:HT_Châteauneuf-du-Pape(84)_Vue_dep.la_rive_D.du_Rhône_08.11.09a.jpg|left|thumb|Le château seen from Roquemaure]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], the old château was a watch post and toll station on the [[Rhône]] which passed to different families allied to the Albaron&lt;ref name="RB154"/&gt; family.

The Albaron kept their [[fief]] until 1360, when it was transferred to the {{Interlanguage link multi|de Roquefeuil|fr|3=Famille de Roquefeuil}} family as a [[dowry]]. Around 1400, it came back to the [[House of Baux|Albaron de Laudin des Baux]] family, who kept it until the 1420s. The last heiress of this family brought it as a [[dowry]] to an Allemand. That family then took the name Allemand de Laudun Albaron. During the 16th century its toll rights fell in turn to the Arpajon Cardaillac, Monteynard and [[House of Montmorency|Montmorency]] families, then to the [[Duke of Ventadour|Duke of Lévis Ventadour]].&lt;ref name="RB154"/&gt; [[Hercule Mériadec, Duke of Rohan-Rohan|Hercule de Rohan]], [[prince of Soubise]], inherited it and his family still owned it when the [[French Revolution]] broke out.

The tolls were abolished with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Abrogation (French law)|lt=abrogation|fr|3=Abrogation en droit français}} of aristocratic privileges during the [[French Revolution]], and the enclave of l'Hers was attached to the new department of [[Vaucluse]].&lt;ref name="RB155"/&gt;

== The château in our days ==
Today the château is private property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveller.provenceguide.com/FR/index.php?post/2012/07/13/Le-Ch%C3%A2teau-de-l%E2%80%99Hers-%C3%A0-Ch%C3%A2teauneuf-du-Pape-%3A-un-domaine-viticole%2C-un-h%C3%A9bergement%2C-un-espace-de-r%C3%A9ception Le Château de l’Hers à Châteauneuf-du-Pape : un domaine viticole]&lt;/ref&gt; At the winery that takes its name, Marcel Georges elaborates a red Châteauneuf-du-pape with a base of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Muscardin, Counoise, Cinsault, Grenache, Vaccarese and Terret, and a white Châteauneuf-du-pape which blends Picardan, Roussanne, Clairette, Picpoul and white Grenache. With an area of 14 ''hectares'', it's one of the rare wineries allowed to use the name, which is an [[appellation d'origine controllée]], to offer the full array of the thirteen Châteauneuf-du-Pape varieties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcelgeorgeschateauneuf.com/chateauneuf-du-pape/le-vignoble.php Château de l'Hers, vignobles Marcel Georges]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the winery kept the name of the château it does not include the name in its business since the château lies outside the [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]] [[terroir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41653">The '''coloniality of gender''' is a  concept developed by feminist philosopher [[Maria Lugones|María Lugones]], which she defines as "the analysis of [[racialized]], [[capitalist]], gender oppression", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as "decolonial feminism".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"&gt;Lugones, María. Toward a Decolonial Feminism. Hypatia vol. 25, no. 4 (Fall 2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|747}} Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] occupy an oppositional consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[[Chela Sandoval|Sandoval, Chela]]. US Third World Feminism: the Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World. pp. 1-24. Genders, no. 10, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.

Colonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of  sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being "Two Spirited"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transhealth.phsa.ca/trans-101/two-spirit|title=Two-Spirit - Transgender Health Information Program|work=Transgender Health Information Program|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior.

== In relation to race, land, and sovereignty ==

According to [[Glen Sean Coulthard]] in his essay ''For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination'', Indigenous resistances against "capitalist imperialism" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the "relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"&gt;Coulthard, Glen Sean. "For the Land: The Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination." Red Skin White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Coulthard defines this system of relationality as "grounded normativity"&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} stating, "the late Lakota philosopher [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western [[metaphysics]] revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous "philosophies of nonoppression" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies'&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|754, 749}} in her essay ''Toward a Decolonial Feminism'', where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] on Indigenous communities.

According to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as "the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human",&lt;ref name=Foot01/&gt; summarized by Lugones' use of the term "colonial difference".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to "Western man".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as "a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women," which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of "bourgeois European women" as passive reproductive servants of "white bourgeois" male colonizers.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the "colonial difference", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book ''Local Histories/Global Designs''.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|751}}

Logones has stated that colonial notions of [[femininity]] as inversions of [[masculinity]] did not grant human status, but rather established a [[gender dimorphism]] of [[hypersexuality]] and sexual passivity that rendered colonized "men" and "women" as non-human gendered entities.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Through the performance of colonial [[anthropocentrism]] and the disruption of Indigenous [[cosmologies]] of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Lugones writes that through murder and rape,&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}} Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

Within Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is "not an affair of the past";&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752}} as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752–753}} [[Rey Chow]] terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as "the ascendancy of whiteness",&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"&gt;Arvin, Maile; Tuck, Eve; and Morrill, Angie. Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and [[Heteropatriarchy]]. Feminist Formations, vol. 25 No. 1 (Spring 2013). pp. 8-34. Print. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial "settling process" to dispossess "'other-ed' peoples globally".&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt; Instead, Lugones proposes a "feminist border thinking" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|753}} This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as "the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics."&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|755}}

In this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, "Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms."&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt;

== Colonialism of gender in Canada ==
Some researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Cindy|last2=Regina|first2=University of|date=2016|title=Gender, Justice, and the Indian Residential School Claims Process|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/iipj/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.18584/iipj.2016.7.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trafficking of Aboriginal Women and Girls|last=Boyer|first=Yvonne|last2=Kampouris, Peggy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-100-23756-5|location=Canada|pages=5–7 &amp; 31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what  European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be "[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|title=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Stage Three: Displacement and Assimilation|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada.|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071124124236/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|archive-date=November 24, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|title=Report-Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples-Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6 of the ''Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples''|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071115053257/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|archive-date=November 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in 1847 contributed to the [[systemic racism]], violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]] has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourgeois|first=Robyn|date=2015|title=Colonial exploitation: The Canadian state and the trafficking of Indigenous women and girls in Canada.|url=|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=62 |issue=6|pages=1426–1463|via=Hein Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination towards Indigenous ==
The impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that  61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood.&lt;ref name="Trovato"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-demography/|title=Demography of Indigenous People|last=Trovato|first=Frank|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 and 1980, the ''Indian Act'' created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status.&lt;ref name="Trovato"/&gt; Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-womens-issues/|title=Indigenous Women's Issues|last=McNab|first=Miriam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225  unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-national-operational-overview#sec3|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-colonial Indigenous idea of gender ==
Not only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

This drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family. European societies were placed power onto the men and families were patrilinal rather than matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/patrilineal-vs-matrilineal-succession-3529192|title=Patrilineal vs. Matrilineal Succession|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonized societies, men often are the head of the family which allows them to make important decisions while the women are often seen more submissive and plays a supportive role for the men. This contrasted with the Indigenous way of life as Cree women were believed to be the center of life and Iroquois women were given spiritual roles and control over food for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Darcy|date=2009-04-01|title=Colonialism, Gender and the Family in North America: For a Gendered Analysis of Indigenous Struggles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x/abstract|journal=Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=70–88|doi=10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x|issn=1754-9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German philosopher Immanuel Kant comments on the different gender power the Indigenous communities has compared to those who are colonized, as he says "'Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada.

== Colonialism of Gender in Asian ==
===Indonesia===

==== Westernised roles of women ====
Prior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WOMEN IN INDONESIA: Gender, Equity and Development.|last=Robinson &amp; Bessell|first=|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Employment =====
According to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Megawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached. She served as president until 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim women of power gender, politics, and culture in Islam|last=Bennett|first=C|publisher=Continuun|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

===== Education =====
According to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/#section=list-of-countries&amp;ol=info|title=The Global Gender Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters of a Javanese princess|last=Kartini and Symmers|first=Raden Ajeng and A.L.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Economy =====
Women’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

The younger generation are more focused on gender equality, preventing sexual assault and empowerment. A few organisations include National Commission on Violence Against Women, Hollaback!

Under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children. While for Hong Kong, due to the emergence of western culture during the british colonial period, westernization leads to a mix of traditional chinese thoughts and western culture and a significant different women roles in Hong Kong were found. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Sangwha|date=1999|title=The Patriarchy in China: An Investigation of Public and Private Spheres.|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=5(1)|pages=9-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

===== Employment =====
The labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.

===== Economy =====
According to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.gov.hk/download/research/HK_Women2015_e.pdf|title=Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
According to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youth.gov.hk/en/info-centre/education/education-policy.htm|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====
In the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkfw.org/chi/index.php|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
For both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.

===== Community =====
There are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993.  Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/gender-roles-women-modern-japan|title=Gender Roles of Women in Modern Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Japan===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Through modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/643486/japan-female-employment-rate/|title=Female employment rate in Japan from 2007 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

==== Employment ====
The government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fewjapan.com/|title=FEW: For Empowering Women in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
Women participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan  illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors.  The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Japanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.

===== Education =====
In the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students  in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
In the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home
Thus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.

===== Community =====
There are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.”  FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually.

[[File:Tantia bhil dacoit.jpg|thumbnail|A (Tantia Bhil) dacoit with gun]]
'''Dacoity''' is a term used for "[[banditry]]" in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi|Odiya, Hindi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Urdu]]. The spelling is the [[anglicise|anglicized]] version of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word and as a colloquial [[Indian English]] word with this meaning, it appears in the [[Hobson-Jobson|''Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases'']] (1903)&lt;ref&gt;Here, "Anglo-Indian" refers to the language, or linguistic usage. See Yule, Henry and Burnell, Arthur Coke (1886) ''[[Hobson-Jobson|Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive]]'' J. Murry, London; reprinted 1903; see page [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Z5iAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 page 290] of the 1903 edition for "dacoit".&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Bandit#Banditry|Banditry]] is criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The [[East India Company]] established the [[Thuggee and Dacoity Department]] in 1830, and the [[Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848]] were enacted in [[British India]] under [[Company rule in India|East India Company rule]]. Areas with ravines or forests, such as [[Chambal division|Chambal]] and [[Chilapata Forests]], were once known for dacoits.

==Etymology==
The word "dacoity", the [[anglicise|anglicized]] version of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''ḍakaitī'' (historically spelled ''dakaitee'', [[Hindi]] डकैती or [[Urdu]] ڈکیتی or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ডাকাতি, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି ), comes from ''ḍākū'' (historically spelled ''dakoo'', [[Hindi]]: डाकू, [[Urdu]]: ڈاکو, meaning "armed robber") or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ''ḍakat'' (ডাকাত, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି).

In [[Urdu language|Urdu]], ''ḍākū'' ڈاکو is [[Singular number|singular]] and ''ḍakait'' ڈکیت [[plural]] for [[bandit]]s. The crime of banditry is known as ''dakaitee'' ڈکیتی.

In [[Hindi]], ''dacoity'' ([[Hindi]]: डकैती ''ḍakaitī'', [[Urdu]]: ڈکیتی ''ḍakaitī'', [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ডাকাতি ''ḍakati'', or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means "armed [[robbery]]".

The term '''dacoit''' ([[Hindi]]: डकैत ''ḍakait'', [[Urdu]]: ڈکیت ''ḍakait'', [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ডাকাত ''ḍākāt'', or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means "a [[bandit]]", according to the ''[[OED]]'' ("A member of a class of robbers in India and [[Mynamar|Burma]], who plunder in armed bands").

==History==
The dacoity have had a large impact in the Morena and [[Chambal Division|Chambal]] regions in [[Madhya Pradesh]] in north-central India.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The emergence of dacoity in the Chambal valley has been a popular theme (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Most explanations have simply suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people of this region to take to arms. However, the fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal valley.

The term is also applied, according to the ''[[OED]]'', to "pirates who formerly infested the [[Ganges]] between [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Baharampur|Burhampore]]".

Dacoits existed in Burma as well – [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in "[[The Taking of Lungtungpen]]". [[Sax Rohmer]]'s criminal mastermind [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]] also employed Burmese dacoits as his [[henchmen]]. 

Indian police forces use "Known Dacoit" (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.

==Notable Dacoits==

==Protection measures==
In Madhya Pradesh, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity. The chief minister of the state, [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]], recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnaboutguns.com/2008/05/27/indian-women-granted-gun-permits-to-fend-off-armed-robbers/ "Indian Women Granted Gun Permits to Fend Off Armed Robbers"] LearnAboutGuns.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
===Dacoit films===
As the dacoits flourished through the 1940s–1970s, they were the subject of various [[Hindi films]] made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in [[Bollywood]]. The genre began with [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aurat (1940 film)|Aurat]]'' (1940), which he remade as ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957). ''Mother India'' received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with [[Dilip Kumar]]'s ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' (1961).&lt;ref name="Teo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teo|first=Stephen|title=Eastern Westerns: Film and Genre Outside and Inside Hollywood|date=2017|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=9781317592266|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi8lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular films in this genre included [[Raj Kapoor]]’s ''[[Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai]]'' (1961) and [[Moni Bhattacharjee]]'s ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE REAL LIFE HERO|url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/THE-REAL-LIFE-HERO/318575/ |date=Jun 6, 2008|publisher=[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani actor [[Akmal Khan]] had two dacoit films, ''[[Malangi]]'' (1965) and ''[[Imam Din Gohavia]]'' (1967). Other films in this genre included ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973), ''[[Mera Gaon Mera Desh]]'' (1971), and ''[[Kuchhe Dhaage]]'' (1973) both by [[Raj Khosla]].

The most famous dacoit film is ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), written by [[Salim-Javed]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], and with its dacoit character [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]] played by [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]]. It was a [[masala film]] that combined the dacoit film conventions of ''Mother India'' and ''Gunga Jumna'' with that of [[Spaghetti Western]]s, spawning the [[Curry Western|Dacoit Western]] genre,&lt;ref name="Teo"/&gt; often known as the "[[Curry Western]]" genre. ''Sholay'' became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including ''[[Ganga Ki Saugandh]]'' (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.

Punjabi biopic ''[[Jatt Jeona Morh (1991 film)|Jatt Jeona Morh]]'' about the noted dacoit Jatt Jeona Morh, was made in 1991; also in that same year came ''[[Jagga Daku (1991 film)|Jagga Daku]]'', based on a noted outlaw and dacoit during the British Raj, Jagga Daku.

An internationally acclaimed example of the genre is ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994).

Tamil movie, Karthi starrer ''[[Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru]]'' (2017) deals elaborately about Bandits. The film reveals the real dacoity incidents which held in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2005. Director [[H. Vinoth|Vinoth]] did a 2 year research about Bandits to develop the script.

A related genre of crime films are [[Mumbai underworld films]].

===Other media===
A Hindi novel पैंसठ लाख की डकैती (Painstth Lakh ki Dacoity, 1977) was written by [[Surender Mohan Pathak]]; it was translated as ''[[The 65 Lakh Heist]]''.

Dacoits armed with pistols and swords appear in ''[[Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties]]''.

They frequently appeared in the French language ''[[Bob Morane]]'' series of novels by [[Henri Vernes]], principally as the main thugs or assassins of the hero's recurring villain, Mr. Ming.

'''Family policy in the [[United Kingdom]]''' has experienced numerous shifts throughout the nation’s history.  Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the UK had one of the most liberal family planning regimes in [[Europe]], with little state involvement.  However, this began to shift during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and especially during the post-war years and the [[New Labour]] era.  The post-recession [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] era has initiated reforms to the comparatively broad family provisions.

== History ==
Historically, the United Kingdom has had a limited approach towards family planning, primarily because of policymakers’ belief on a “classic liberal” conception of the welfare state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perfar.eu/policy/family-children/uk|title=Family Policies: United Kingdom (2014)|last=Coast, Floridi, Sigle-Rushton|first=Ernestina, Ginevra, Wendy|date=2014|website=Population Europe Resource Finder &amp; Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implied a reliance on free-market solutions and a state reluctant to fund welfare provisions for families. Laws passed in the 17th and 18th centuries regarding families were rare and generally aimed at fixing “inefficiencies” in the system or addressing the most serious societal issues stemming from marriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;For example, in 1753, English law mandated that minors under the age of 21 could only marry if provided consent by their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/806511262|title=Happy families? : history and family policy|last=Pat.|first=Thane,|date=2011|publisher=British Academy|others=British Academy.|isbn=9780856725906|edition= Rev.|location=London|oclc=806511262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Scotland]] resisted this law and maintained its comparatively loose marriage laws; for a long time, [[Gretna Green]], the first village in Scotland on the London-Edinburgh route, was a popular place for runaway lovers who wanted to marry. Overall, the UK’s laws were far more liberal than other states in Europe.&amp;nbsp;It was only during the Industrial Revolution that these views began to change, and the Welfare State in the UK began to emerge; with it, family policy changed considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701778|title=The evolution of the British Welfare State; a history of social policy since the Industrial Revolution.|last=Derek.|first=Fraser,|date=1973|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=0333111826|location=London,|pages=1|oclc=701778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shift in Family Policy ==
The post-war conditions in UK led to numerous momentous changes in family policy. One of the most important trends was the shift in the historical conception of the male as the breadwinner and the female as the homemaker. Divorce was made easier to obtain.&amp;nbsp;In 1969, Parliament passed the Divorce Reform Act, which established the no-fault divorce; the effect of these and other change was the increase of divorce from 2.1 out of 1000 in 1961 to 12.7 in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38955880|title=Family change and family policies in Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States|last=|first=|date=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|others=Kamerman, Sheila B., Kahn, Alfred J. (Alfred Joseph), 1919-|year=|isbn=019829025X|location=Oxford [England]|pages=41|oclc=38955880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The UK state hit its peak when it comes to family policy during the New Labour era, which came to power in 1997. New and wide-ranging initiatives that centered on the family were established. These included “children’s early education and care, services to stabilise and improve the quality of family relations especially in low-income sectors of the population, parental employment and greater flexibility in work and family life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Mary|date=December 2010|title=Shifts in Family Policy in the UK under New Labour|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0958928710380480|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|volume=20|pages=433–443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these proposals were heavily controversial, since the New Labour’s emphasis on “Strengthening marriages.”&amp;nbsp;Many skeptics viewed this as the state promoting “desirable family forms” at the expense of newer methods in today’s diverse family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49905625|title=Evaluating New Labour's welfare reforms|last=Powell|first=Martin|date=2002|publisher=Policy Press|others=|year=|isbn=1861343361|location=Bristol, UK|pages=100|oclc=49905625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservative austerity ==
The post-recession environment though has led policymakers to implement austerity measures on what became a relatively vast welfare state regarding families.&amp;nbsp; [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in Parliament have been influenced by a policy of “smaller state, bigger society,” i.e. a lesser role for the government and a greater one for civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/802000499|title=Social policy review. 24, Analysis and debate in social policy, 2012|last=Kilkey, Ramia, Farnsworth|first=Majella, Gaby, Kevin|date=2012|publisher=Policy Press|others=|year=|isbn=9781447304487|location=Bristol|pages=3|oclc=802000499}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the UK budget in 2015 announced the end of tax credits for families for their third or subsequent child.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget-2015-live-emergency-uk-benefits-to-be-cut-for-families-with-more-than-two-children-10376015.html|title=Families with more than two children are to have their benefits cut|last=Grice|first=Andrew|date=2015-07-08|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Treasury officials denied that this move was an attempt to influence families on how many children they should have, critics labeled it a de facto “two-child policy”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;However, indications point to the Conservative government limiting austerity-driven proposals, as Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] has introduced 30 hours of free child care for three and four year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto|title=The Conservative Party Manifesto 2017|work=Conservatives.com|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">'''The Fraud (Trials Without a Jury) Bill 2007''' was a proposed [[Act of Parliament]] introduced by the [[United Kingdom]] government. Its intention was to abolish [[Jury trial|trials by jury]] in complex fraud cases in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] by amending  section 43 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/006/07006.i-5.html Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was given its [[First Reading]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 16 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Hansard'', [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061116/debtext/61116-0003.htm#06111632000007 Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill, 1st Commons Reading], 16 Nov Mar 2006 : Column 144
&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly unusual move it was blocked by the [[House of Lords]] using a delaying tactic in March 2007. [[Christopher Prout, Baron Kingsland|Lord Kingsland]] said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the substance of the matter, as your Lordships are well aware, jury trial has been a central component in the conduct of all serious criminal trials for about the past 700 years. Its contribution to the preservation of the liberty of the individual, and to the legitimacy of Government, is quite incalculable.&lt;ref&gt;''Hansard'', [https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=kingsland&amp;ALL=&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=Kingsland&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=70320-0003.htm_spnew10&amp;URL=/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70320-0003.htm#70320-0003.htm_spnew10 Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill, 2nd Lords Reading], 20 Mar 2007 : Column 1152

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5627">The [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]] (USGCRP) develops and curates the [http://data.globalchange.gov Global Change Information System (GCIS)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.globalchange.gov|title=Global Change Information System - GCIS|website=data.globalchange.gov|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish "data interfaces and interoperable repositories of climate and global change data which can be easily and efficiently accessed, integrated with other data sets, maintained and expanded over time."&lt;ref name="strategy 12-21"&gt;[http://downloads.globalchange.gov/strategic-plan/2012/usgcrp-strategic-plan-2012.pdf US Global Change Research Program, 2012. The National Global Change Research Plan 2012–2021: A Strategic Plan for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, 132 pp.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial focus of GCIS is to support the United States Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3), which is to publish reports that enhance the transparency and ability of decision-makers to understand the conclusions and use of the underlying data for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.globalchange.gov/about About the Global Change Information System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nclimate2141 | volume=4 | title=Capturing provenance of global change information | year=2014 | journal=Nature Climate Change | pages=409–413 | last1 = Ma | first1 = Xiaogang | last2 = Fox | first2 = Peter | last3 = Tilmes | first3 = Curt | last4 = Jacobs | first4 = Katharine | last5 = Waple | first5 = Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of work==
The project scope includes analyzing alterations in climate, land use and land cover, natural resources including water, agriculture and biodiversity, atmospheric composition, chemical composition and ecological systems that may alter the Earth's capacity to sustain life.

Global change research includes activities aimed at describing and understanding the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the [[Earth system]]; the unique environment that the Earth provides for life; changes that are occurring in the Earth system; and the manner in which such systems, environments and changes are influenced by human actions.&lt;ref name="strategy 12-21" /&gt;

==Provenance and semantics==
GCIS has developed information models and [[ontology]] to represent the content structure of the NCA3 and its associated [[provenance]] information and has been extending its models to incorporate more global change information. Records of objects and relationships within the GCIS are represented in a database for the [[Semantic Web]], which can be queried using the [[SPARQL]] language. GCIS assigns globally unique persistent identifiers to all of the entities, activities, and agents relevant to provenance. Each identifier is mapped to a uniform resource identifier (URI) in the GCIS namespace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Change Information System - GCIS|url = http://data.globalchange.gov/|website = data.globalchange.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing use of those identifiers for the Semantic Web and other [[linked data]] systems. By categorizing, annotating, and linking provenance information, the GCIS becomes capable of answering provenance-tracking questions about global change research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TGRS.2013.2262179 | volume=51 | title=Provenance Representation for the National Climate Assessment in the Global Change Information System | year=2013 | journal=IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing | pages=5160–5168 | last1 = Tilmes | first1 = Curt | last2 = Fox | first2 = Peter | last3 = Ma | first3 = Xiaogang | last4 = McGuinness | first4 = Deborah L. | last5 = Pinheiro Privette | first5 = Ana | last6 = Smith | first6 = Aaron | last7 = Waple | first7 = Anne | last8 = Zednik | first8 = Stephan | last9 = Guang Zheng | first9 = Jin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.08.002 | volume=61 | title=Ontology engineering in provenance enablement for the National Climate Assessment | year=2014 | journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software | pages=191–205 | last1 = Ma | first1 = Xiaogang | last2 = Guang Zheng | first2 = Jin | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = Justin C. | last4 = Zednik | first4 = Stephan | last5 = Fu | first5 = Linyun | last6 = Duggan | first6 = Brian | last7 = Aulenbach | first7 = Steven M. | last8 = West | first8 = Patrick | last9 = Tilmes | first9 = Curt | last10 = Fox | first10 = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)}}
The '''Internal conflict in Azawad''' has been a two-year-long insurgency in Northern Mali between a pro-independence ultra Nationalist group, the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|MNLA]] and a coalition of Islamists terror groups. The conflict began when Northern Mali declared itself independent from the government creating the un-recognized state of Azawad. Both the Islamists and MNLA formed an alliance in combatting the Malian government. An internal conflict sprung up over the imposing of sharia law in the new state and the MNLA distancing itself from the coalition to a democratic state. Islamists gained popularity amongst anti-Tuareg tribes that helped it overthrow MNLA authority in Gao. Both sides clashed repeatedly leading to the [[Battle of Gao]] where the MNLA were driven from the North's two main cities, [[Gao]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The MNLA soon lost all of its strongholds in the North in a matter of months. They went into hiding secretly gaining support and strength. The beginning of 2013 led the start of the French intervention in Mali that ousted the Islamists from the North's cities and brought back Malian authority. The MNLA supported the French and Chadian forces in military operations against Islamists sanctuaries in the mountains. The MNLA recaptured several important towns in the Kidal Region but refused to dis-arm or hand them over to the Malian government. A series of Islamists sponsored terror attacks plagued MNLA forces for siding with the French. Checkpoints and bases were targeted with suicide bombings that targeted MNLA members. A peace deal was reached with the Malian army in June that let the army transverse freely in MNLA occupied zones that were under Malian jurisdiction. Ethnic violence sprung over the murder of a Tuareg Government officers family. The MNLA responded by harassing and murdering Fulani civilians who create a majority of Islamists rebels. The Islamists stepped up their attacks in one such instance massacring 30 [[Tuareg]] merchants. The MNLA has since been battling Islamists.

==Prelude - Conflict==
Since its Independence in April 2012, the MNLA has been skeptical of Islamist influence over their new state's future and the implementation of sharia law. Various countries including France have denounced the MNLA's cooperation with terror groups and refused to recognize its new status due to various incidents in its fight against the Malian government which included a massacre that killed 93 Malian soldiers allegedly carried out by Islamists. Two main incidents occurred on the streets of Gao that caused confusion when civilians waving the Malian flag were fired upon by MNLA members which was denied by the MNLA itself, blamed on Islamists. Many did not support the new state of Azawad and Tuareg dominance over their land. Islamists popularity and influence grew in numbers eventually outnumbering MNLA defenders in Gao. The city was taken on June 27, over an argument that escalated into a full-scale battle. The MNLA Secretary General Bilal Ag Acherif was wounded in the battle that also killed four colonels. The MNLA's headquarters and any government building was looted along with the Azawad flag being replaced with sharia. Timbuktu was evacuated by the MNLA a day later after an ultimatum to leave. Resistance grew against Islamic rule in MNLA supported towns but never posed a great threat.  On 16 November, the MNLA launched an offensive attack to reclaim their former city base of Gao from Islamists. They did not make it far before their army routed and was chased across the Niger border. Nine MNLA members were wounded, including one seriously. Islamists casualties were 13 dead. Four days later the Islamists launched their own offensive against towns with MNLA presence. The town of [[Ménaka]]'s defenders were capitulated in a two-day siege that killed one MNLA member and seven pro-MNLA selfdefense volunteers including a prominent political leader Alwabegat Ag Salakatou. Its disputed how many Islamists were killed. The MNLA hoped to establish Ménaka as a central base from which to launch counter-attacks. In December, the now displaced MNLA began peace talks with the Malian government and relinquished its previous goal for Independence in favor of self-rule in Northern Mali. Almost half of the MNLA's combatants deserted for better pay in Islamists factions since the declaration of Independence in April 2012. At this time the MNLA controlled no big localities and was only strong in rural desert areas in the North, having been driven off from its proposed state cities in the South. Troop build ups in the MNLA ranks were reportedly preparing for another offensive.

At the start of 2013, the MNLA retook its key town of Kidal after it was abandoned by French air-strikes. The Azawad flag was raised in every town they took each one without a fight. Islamists guerrillas operating the [[Adrar des Ifoghas]] mountains launched an offensive of their own terrorizing MNLA dominated towns with suicide bombings. The first hit the town of [[Battle of Khalil|Khalil]] on 22 February, after an explosion ripped at an MNLA checkpoint killing three members. The second in that week killed seven members at another checkpoint in [[Kidal]]. Fighting resumed the next month leading to the [[Battle of In Arab]]. Five members were killed in a day long battle with an elite terrorist brigade led by Mokhtar belMokhtar, the Signatories of Blood. In June 2013, the MNLA agreed on a cease-fire with the Malian army allowing them to have authority over MNLA occupied towns, granting autonomy for Tuareg civilians, and dis-arming the MNLA with an exception for self-defense purposes into a political organization. The MNLA also agreed upon taking back its claim for Independence instead for greater autonomy. The peace-deal lasted over three months before both sides claimed it was breached. In November, the Islamists suspected murder of members of a Tuareg Malian army general's family led to an ethnic conflict between MNLA [[Tuareg]] and Islamists dominated [[Fulani]]. The situation escalated in February 2014, when 30-35 Tuareg merchants were massacred at the hands of Fulani Islamists. Reprisal attacks targeting Fulani Islamists resumed into an armed confrontation that killed a MNLA member.

[[File:Dżygit.jpg|thumb|Modern horse and rider]]
'''Jigit''', in some [[Turkic languages]] also spelled as '''yigit''', '''zhigit''' or '''igid''', is a word of Turkic origin&lt;ref name="Джигитовка"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]. [https://archive.is/20070906153524/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/026/081.htm Джигитовка]&lt;/ref&gt;  which is used in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]] to describe a skillful and brave [[Eurasian nomads|equestrian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ushakov/788222 Толковый словарь русского языка Ушакова]&lt;/ref&gt; or a brave person in general.

The derived term '''jigitovka''' (or jigiting) means the special style of [[trick riding]], which originated in the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic cultures]] of Caucasus and Central Asia, and is also popular with Russian [[Cossacks]], who adopted it from the people of Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]. [http://gatchina3000.ru/brockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary/035/35472.htm Джигит]&lt;/ref&gt; When performing dzhigitovka, the riders at full [[Horse gait|gallop]] stand up, jump to the ground and back to the [[saddle]], pick up objects from the ground (such as coins, hats, etc.), shoot targets with various weapons, ride hanging on the side or under the belly of the horse and do other [[acrobatic]] feats.&lt;ref name="Джигитовка"/&gt;

Since the early 19th century jigitovka has been demonstrated in the [[circus]]es and horse sport competitions, and made its way to the popular [[Western culture]], for instance Russian Cossacks (actually Georgian horsemen from western part of Georgia, Guria) demonstrated jigitovka as part of [[Buffalo Bill|''Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2001-05/wildwest.html |title=Thomas M. Barrett. All the World's a Frontier: How Cossacks Became Cowboys |publisher=Neh.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jigitovka was also used in training of cavalry forces in the [[Russian Empire]] and [[USSR]]. Modern jigitovka as a circus performance includes complex [[stunt]]s usually performed by a group of riders.

== Equestrian Jigitovka ==
Recently, a sport known as equestrian jigitovka was developed in [[Russia]].  It became an officially certified discipline in the Russian Equestrian Federation in 2016;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsetimes.ru/posts/news/dzhigitovka_ofitsialno_stala_vidom_sporta/|title=Equestrian Jigitovka has Become an Official Sport (Russian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; world championships in the sport have been held since the same year.  This sport is performed on a horse cantering along a track 150-300&amp;nbsp;m long and at least 4&amp;nbsp;m wide, with two 40&amp;nbsp;m "chutes" for trick performance. The sport has multiple phases and includes both the performance of traditional acrobatic tricks and the use of weapons on horseback.

The weapons section of an equestrian jigitovka competition includes five types of weapon.  Generally, it is carried out in two rounds; during the first, the rider must carry four types of weapon and use them all on a course with various targets.  During the first round, the rider first demonstrates different spear strikes, then tosses the spear through a hoop and moves on to other weapons: pistol (an air pistol), throwing knife, and sword.  The sword is a traditional [[Cossacks|Cossack]] [[shashka]], which is slightly curved.  Sword targets can include branches, bottles, and rope.  During the second round, the rider uses only a bow and arrow, and must hit three targets with different shots: forward, sideways, and backward.

The trick section of an equestrian jigitovka competition involves the performance of six tricks.  According to Russian rules, these tricks are to be performed in one round over three laps of the track.  The international rules specify three rounds, each consisting of two tricks performed over one lap of the track.  The exercises can be static or active, and are divided into four groups according to their complexity.  Static exercises must be held between two flags on the track, about 10&amp;nbsp;m apart.  Active exercises involve constant motion, for example, jumping off and on the horse (vaulting).  If a rider successfully performs an exercise, they receive a score from 1 to 10 points, which is multiplied by the trick's coefficient; the number of each difficulty level is the coefficient for those tricks.  For example, a "Cossack hang"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZreoyM2rKo|title=Cossack Hang Lesson Video (Russian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; off the saddle is a first level trick, that is, an easy one, so its coefficient is one; a shoulder stand is a difficult, fourth level trick, so its coefficient is four.

'''Koryo-saram''' ({{lang-ru|Корё сарам}}; {{lang-ko|고려사람}}) or '''Koryoin''' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=고려인|hanja=高麗人}}) is the name which [[Korean people|ethnic Koreans]] in the [[post-Soviet states]] use to refer to themselves. The term is composed of two constituents: "''[[Names of Korea#Goryeo|Koryo]]''", which is one of the names of Korea, and "''saram''", meaning either "person/people".{{efn|Nouns in Korean do not inflect for number unless it is needed to avoid ambiguity, therefore "''saram''" translates as either "''person''" or "''people''" depending on context.}}  Approximately 500,000 ethnic Koreans reside in the former [[Soviet Union]], primarily in the now-independent states of [[Central Asia]]. There are also large Korean communities in southern [[Russia]] (around [[Volgograd]]), the [[Caucasus]], and southern [[Ukraine]]. These communities can be traced back to the Koreans who were living in the [[Russian Far East]] during the late 19th century.

There is also a separate ethnic Korean community on the island of [[Sakhalin]], typically referred to as [[Sakhalin Koreans]]. Some may identify as Koryo-saram, but many do not. Unlike the communities on the Russian mainland, which consist mostly of immigrants from the late 19th century and early 20th century, the ancestors of the Sakhalin Koreans came as immigrants from [[Gyeongsang]] and [[Jeolla]] provinces in the late 1930s and early 1940s, forced into service by the Japanese government to work in coal mines in Sakhalin (then known as [[Karafuto Prefecture]]) in order to fill labour shortages caused by [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Byong&gt;{{cite news|last=Ban|first=Byung-yool|title=Koreans in Russia: Historical Perspective|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200409/kt2004092218583111950.htm|newspaper=Korea Times|date=22 September 2004|accessdate=20 November 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318164348/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200409/kt2004092218583111950.htm|archivedate=18 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Koryo" in "Koryo-saram" originated from the name of the [[Goryeo|Goryeo (Koryŏ) Dynasty]] from which "Korea" was derived. The name ''Soviet Korean'' was also used, more frequently before the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russians may also lump Koryo-saram under the general label ''koreytsy'' ({{lang|ru|корейцы}}); however, this usage makes no distinctions between ethnic Koreans of the local nationality and the Korean nationals (citizens of North Korea or South Korea).

In Standard Korean, the term "Koryo-saram" is typically used to refer to historical figures from the Goryeo dynasty;&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the [[:ko:분류:고려 사람|Koryo-saram category on the Korean wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid ambiguity, Korean speakers use a word ''Goryeoin'' ({{lang-ko|고려인}}; [[Hanja]]: 高麗人, meaning the same as "Koryo-saram") to refer to ethnic Koreans in the post-Soviet states.&lt;ref name=Byong/&gt; However, the [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] morpheme "-in" (인) is not [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] in [[Koryo-mal]], the dialect spoken by Koryo-saram, and as a result, only a few (mainly those who have studied Standard Korean) refer to themselves by this name; instead, Koryo-saram has come to be the preferred term.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{citation|format=DOC|last=King|first=Ross|last2=Kim|first2=German N.|title=Introduction|url=http://www.koryosaram.freenet.kz/update1/east-rock-intro.doc|publisher=East Rock Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031030073148/http://www.koryosaram.freenet.kz/update1/east-rock-intro.doc|archivedate=30 October 2003|accessdate=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Immigration to the Russian Far East and Siberia===
The 19th century saw the decline of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] of Korea.  A small population of wealthy elite owned the farmlands in the country, and poor peasants found it difficult to survive. Koreans leaving the country in this period were obliged to move toward Russia, as the border with China was sealed by the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="lee7"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first Koreans in the Russian Empire, 761 families totalling 5,310 people, had actually migrated to Qing territory; the land they had settled on was ceded to Russia by the [[Convention of Peking]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many peasants considered [[Siberia]] to be a land where they could lead better lives, and so they subsequently migrated there. As early as 1863, 13 Korean households were recorded near [[Novukorut Bay]]. These numbers rose dramatically, and by 1869 Koreans composed 20% of the population of the [[Primorsky Krai|Maritime Province]].&lt;ref name="lee7"/&gt; Prior to the completion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], Koreans outnumbered Russians in the [[Russian Far East]]; the local governors encouraged them to naturalize.&lt;ref name="lee8"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of [[Blagoslovennoe]] was founded in 1870 by Korean migrants.&lt;ref name="Pohl10"&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1897 [[Russian Empire Census]] found 26,005 Korean speakers (16,225 men and 9,780 women) in the whole of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russian Census|1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, both Russia and Korea came into conflict with Japan. Following the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1907, Russia enacted an anti-Korean law at the behest of Japan, under which the land of Korean farmers was confiscated and Korean labourers were laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Korean migration to Russia continued to grow; 1914 figures showed 64,309 Koreans (among whom 20,109 were Russian citizens). Even the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] did nothing to slow migration; in fact, after the repression of the 1919 [[March 1st Movement]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-colonised Korea]], migration actually intensified.&lt;ref name="Pohl10"/&gt; Koreans leaders in [[Vladivostok]]'s [[Sinhanchon]] (literally, "New Korean Village") neighbourhood also provided support to the independence movement, making it a centre for nationalist activities, including arms supply; the Japanese attacked it on April 4, 1920, leaving hundreds dead.&lt;ref name="lee15"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1923, the Korean population in the Soviet Union had grown to 106,817. The following year, the Soviets began taking measures to control Korean population movement to their territory; however, they were not completely successful until 1931; after that date, they halted all migration from Korea and required existing migrants to naturalise as Soviet citizens.&lt;ref name="Pohl10"/&gt;

The Soviet policy of ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' (indigenisation) resulted in the creation of 105 Korean village [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s (councils) in mixed-nationality ''raion'', as well as an entire ''raion'' for the Korean nationality, the Pos'et Korean National Raion; these conducted their activities entirely in the [[Korean language]]. The Soviet Koreans had a large number of their own official institutions, including 380 Korean schools, two teachers' colleges, one pedagogical school, three hospitals, a theatre, six journals, and seven newspapers (the largest of which, ''Vanguard'', had a circulation of 10,000). The [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 Census]] showed 168,259 Koreans in the Soviet Union. However, officials in the Russian Far East viewed the Koreans' ethnic and family ties to the Japanese Empire with suspicion, which would soon set the stage for the deportation of the whole population.&lt;ref name="Pohl10"/&gt;

===Deportation to Central Asia===
{{main|Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union}}

In 1937, facing reports from the NKVD that the Japanese had infiltrated the Russian Far East by means of ethnic Korean spies, [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] signed Resolution 1428-326 ss, "On the Exile of the Korean Population from border ''Raions'' of the Far East Kray", on 21 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report of [[Nikolai Yezhov]], 36,442 Korean families totalling 171,781 persons were deported by 25 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deported Koreans faced difficult conditions in Central Asia: monetary assistance promised by the government never materialised, and furthermore, most of the deported were rice farmers and fishermen, who had difficulty adapting to the arid climate of their new home. Estimates based on population statistics suggest that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 for these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deportees cooperated to build irrigation works and start rice farms; within three years, they had recovered their original standard of living.&lt;ref name="lee141"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The events of this period led to the formation of a cohesive identity among the Korean deportees.&lt;ref name="lee141"/&gt;  However, in schools for Soviet Korean children, the government switched Korean language from being the [[medium of instruction]] to being taught merely as a second language in 1939, and from 1945 stopped it from being taught entirely; furthermore, the only publication in the Korean language was the ''Lenin Kichi''. As a result, subsequent generations lost the use of the Korean language, which J. Otto Pohl described as "emasculat[ing] the expression of Korean culture in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the era of [[glasnost]], it was not permitted to speak openly of the deportations.&lt;ref name=Byong/&gt;
&lt;!-- To do here:  Deportation and it's effect on Koryo-saram's attitudes towards Korean culture. Koryo-saram became highly assimilationist, achieved high education levels and one of the best command of Russian among the minority nationalities. Analogous to Japanese internment? (Especially with regards to confiscation of property). Obviously more severe (executions of community leaders, etc.), but similar effects. --&gt;

==Post-deportation==
Scholars estimated that {{As of|2002|lc=on}}, roughly 470,000 Koryo-saram were living in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], including 198,000 in [[Uzbekistan]], 125,000 in [[Russia]], 105,000 in [[Kazakhstan]], 19,000 in [[Kyrgyzstan]], 13,000 in [[Ukraine]], 6,000 in [[Tajikistan]], 3,000 in [[Turkmenistan]], 1,000 in [[Belarus]], 500 in [[Moldova]] and 3,500 in other constituent republics.&lt;ref name="KSKi"/&gt;

===Russia===
The [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 census]] gave a population of 148,556 Koreans in Russia, of which 75,835 were male and 72,721 female.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russian Census|2002|loc=Table 4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fourth reside in [[Siberia]] and the [[Russian Far East]]; the Korean population there trace their roots back to a variety of sources. Aside from roughly 33,000 [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nationals, mostly migrants retracing in reverse the 1937 deportation of their ancestors, between 4,000 and 12,000 [[North Koreans in Russia|North Korean migrant labourers]] can be found in the region. Smaller numbers of [[South Korea]]ns and [[ethnic Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans from China]] have also come to the region to settle, invest, and/or engage in cross-border trade.&lt;ref name="JYLee"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
[[File:Oleksandr Sin.JPG|thumb|[[Oleksandr Sin]], a mayor of [[Zaporizhia]]]]
In the [[2001 census of Ukraine|2001 census]] in [[Ukraine]] 12,711 people defined themselves as ethnic Koreans, up from 8,669 in 1989. Of these only 17.5% gave Korean as their first language. The majority (76%) stated their mother tongue was [[Russian language|Russian]], while 5.5% stated [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/nationality_population/nationality_popul1/select_5/?botton=cens_db&amp;box=5.1W&amp;k_t=00&amp;p=50&amp;rz=1_1&amp;rz_b=2_1%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;n_page=3|script-title=uk:Всеукраїнський перепис населення 2001 - Результати - Національний склад населення, мовні ознаки, громадянство - Розподіл населення за національністю та рідною мовою - корейці|trans-title=Population census 2001 - Results - National composition of population, language attributes, nationality - of the population distribution by nationality and native language - Koreans|language=uk|work=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine|date=2003|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest concentrations can be found in [[Kharkiv]], [[Kiev]], [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv]], [[Cherkasy]], [[Lviv]], [[Luhansk]], [[Donetsk]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Zaporizhia]], and [[Crimea]]. The largest ethnic representative body, the Association of Koreans in Ukraine, is located in Kharkiv, where roughly 150 Korean families reside; the first [[Korean language]] school was opened in 1996 under their direction.&lt;ref name="KSKi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavlenko|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous Korean-Ukrainians is [[Oleksandr Sin]], former mayor of [[Zaporizhzhia]].

===Central Asia===
[[File:Samarqand Afrasiab cemetery2.jpg|thumb|Cemetery in Samarkand, Uzbekistan]]
The majority of Koryo-saram in Central Asia reside in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. Korean culture in Kazakhstan is centered in [[Almaty]], the former capital. For much of the 20th century, this was the only place in Central Asia where a Korean language newspaper (the ''[[Koryo Shinmun]]'') and [[Korean Theatre of Kazakhstan|Korean language theater]] were in operation.&lt;ref name="lee122"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The censuses of Kazakhstan recorded 96,500 Koryo-saram in 1939, 74,000 in 1959, 81,600 in 1970, 92,000 in 1979, 100,700 in 1989, and 99,700 in 1999.{{sfn|Alekseenko|2000}}

In Kyrgyzstan, the population has remained roughly stable over the past three censuses: 18,355 (1989), 19,784 (1999), and 17,299 (2009).&lt;ref name="NewCensus"&gt;{{citation|format=PDF|script-title=ru:Перепись населения и жилищного фонда Кыргызской Республики 2009.

South Korea never had any programme to promote return migration of their diaspora in Central Asia, unlike Germany. However, they have established organisations to promote Korean language and culture, such as the Korean Centre of Education which opened in Bishkek in 2001. South Korean Christian missionaries are also active in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sparling|first=Evan|title=Kyrgyzstan: Ethnic Minority Expands Ties to South Korea|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav102209a.shtml|publisher=eurasianet.org|date=21 October 2009|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population in Uzbekistan is largely scattered in rural areas. This population has suffered in recent years from linguistic handicaps, as the Koryo-saram there spoke [[Russian language|Russian]] but not [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]. After the independence of [[Uzbekistan]], many lost their jobs due to being unable to speak the national language. Some emigrated to the [[Russian Far East]], but found life difficult there as well.&lt;ref name="lee143"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also a small Korean community in [[Tajikistan]]. Mass settlement of Koreans in the country began during the late 1950s and early 1960s, after the loosening of restrictions on their freedom of movement which had previously kept them confined to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Pull factors for migration included rich natural resources and a relatively mild climate. Their population grew to 2,400 in 1959, 11,000 in 1979, and 13,000 in 1989; most lived in the capital [[Dushanbe]], with smaller concentrations in [[Qurghonteppa]] and [[Khujand]]. Like Koreans in other parts of Central Asia, they generally possessed higher incomes compared to members of other ethnic groups. However, with the May 1992 onset of [[civil war in Tajikistan]], many fled the country entirely; by 1996, their population had fallen by over half to 6,300 people.{{sfn|Back|2004}} Most are engaged in agriculture and retail business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choe |first=Yeong-ha |url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/moeum?n=dstory$i_21&amp;a=v&amp;l=2&amp;id=199812130104 |script-title=ko:타지키스탄 내전과 한국교민 |trans-title=Civil War in Tajikistan and Korean Ethnics |language=ko |periodical=Donga Ilbo |date=13 December 1998 |accessdate=26 March 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040626182149/http://www.donga.com/fbin/moeum?n=dstory%24i_21&amp;a=v&amp;l=2&amp;id=199812130104 |archivedate=26 June 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence continued even after the end of the civil war; in 2000, suspected [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] members exploded a bomb in a Korean Christian church in Dushanbe, killing 9 and wounding 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dong|Su|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return migration to Korea===
[[File:Gwanghui-dong, Seoul Russian-speaking church and Kyrgyz restaurant.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Gwanghui-dong]], [[Seoul]], a Russian-speaking church of Koryo-saram members occupies the floor upstairs from a restaurant serving [[Kyrgyz cuisine]]]]
There was some minor return migration of Soviet Koreans to Korea in the first half of the 20th century. They formed 4 main groups: those sent for intelligence work during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial period]], the Red Army personnel who arrived in 1945&amp;ndash;1946, civilian advisors and teachers who arrived in the northern half of the peninsula in 1946&amp;ndash;1948, and individuals who repatriated from the Soviet Union to North Korea for personal reasons.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=112}} Though it was common in most of the newly socialist countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] to receive Soviet-educated personnel who were from the country or had ancestral ethnic connections there, in North Korea such returned members of national diaspora played a more important role than in other countries.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=111}}

Later, labour migration to South Korea would grow to a large size. {{Asof|2005}}, as many as 10,000 Uzbekistani nationals worked in South Korea, with most of them being ethnic Koreans. It is estimated that [[remittances]] from South Korea to Uzbekistan exceed $100 million annually.&lt;ref name="Baek"&gt;{{citation|last=Baek|first=Il-hyun|title=Scattered Koreans turn homeward|date=2005-09-14|periodical=Joongang Daily|accessdate=2006-11-27|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200509/14/200509142129404979900091009101.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051127093846/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200509/14/200509142129404979900091009101.html |archivedate = 2005-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
After their arrival in Central Asia, the Koryo-saram quickly established a way of life different from that of neighbouring peoples. They set up irrigation works and became known throughout the region as rice farmers.&lt;ref name="lee141"/&gt;  They interacted little with the nomadic peoples around them, and focused on education. Although they soon ceased to wear [[traditional Korean clothing]], they adapted Western-style dress rather than the clothing worn by the Central Asian peoples.&lt;ref name="lee40"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual life of the Koryo-saram community has changed in various respects.  Marriages have taken on the Russian style.&lt;ref name="lee249"/&gt; At [[Korean traditional funeral]]s, the coffin is taken out of the house either through the window or a single door threshold; however, if there is more than one door threshold on the way out (e.g. in modern multi-stories buildings), three notches are made on each threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korea.narod.ru/content/korea/25/25.html|script-title=ru:Похоронные обряды|trans-title=Funeral rites|language=ru|publisher=korea.narod.ru|date=18 January 2006|accessdate=29 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419190244/http://korea.narod.ru/content/korea/25/25.html|archivedate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Min|first=L.

On the other hand, the rituals for the first birthday and sixtieth anniversary have been preserved in their traditional form.&lt;ref name="lee250"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Korean-style carrot.jpg|thumb|[[Korean carrot salad]]]]
Koryo-saram have preserved the [[Korean cuisine]] particularly well. The cuisine of the Koryo-saram is closest to that of the [[Hamgyong]] provinces in North Korea, and is dominated by meat soups and salty side dishes.&lt;ref name="lee249"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2000|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses similar cooking techniques but is adapted to local ingredients, which resulted in invention of new dishes. One well-known example is spicy [[carrot salad]], known throughout the Soviet Union as [[Korean-style carrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/18/dining/the-silk-road-leads-to-queens.html|title=The Silk Road Leads to Queens|periodical=The New York Times|last=Moskin|first=Julia|date=18 January 2006|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|author-link=Andrei Lankov|url=http://via.sawd.ch/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL3JidGguYXNpYS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDEyLzA4LzIxL2tvcmVhbl9jYXJyb3RfMTY0MDUuaHRtbA%3D%3D|title=Korean carrot|publisher=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=22 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928142343/http://via.sawd.ch/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL3JidGguYXNpYS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDEyLzA4LzIxL2tvcmVhbl9jYXJyb3RfMTY0MDUuaHRtbA%3D%3D|archivedate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Koryo-saram invention and was unknown in South Korea until recently. However, it has gained an international following, being served in most cafeterias throughout the CIS, sold in all supermarkets, and featured regularly as a side dish on dinner tables and in holiday feasts set by all ethnicities of the former Soviet Union. On the other hand, some South Korean dishes such as [[bulgogi]], [[bibimbap]], and [[samgyeopsal]] were relatively unknown to Koryo-saram until recently. Dishes traditionally popular among Koryo-saram include [[pigodi]], [[kuksi|kuksu]] (Korean:국수), [[timpeni]], [[khe (food)|khe]], [[chartagi]], [[kadi che]] (Korean:가지채), [[kosari che]] (Korean:고사리채), [[chirgym che]], [[Banchan|panchan]], [[schirak tyamuri]], [[kadyuri]].

===Personal and family names===
{{Korean names in Russian}}

{{See also|List of Korean family names|Cyrillization of Korean}}

Many Korean surnames, when Cyrillized, are spelled and pronounced slightly differently from the romanisations used in the U.S. and the resulting common pronunciations, as can be seen in the table at right. Some surnames of Koryo-saram have a particle "gai" added to them, such as Kogai or Nogai. The origin of this is unclear.&lt;ref name="Kim 2003 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The introduction of international passports by newly independent CIS countries, resulted in further differences in pronunciation as Korean surnames had to be transliterated from Cyrillic into Latin. In addition to a surname, Koreans also use clan names (known as [[Bon-gwan]] in Korea and pronounced as пой among koryo saram) denoting the place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Yong-un|url=http://www.arirang.ru/bons/bons.htm|script-title=ru:Корейские боны (пои)|trans-title=Korean bons (poi)|language=ru|periodical=Ariran|issue=2|date=June 2001|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Korean name|Korean naming practices]] and [[Names in Russian Empire, Soviet Union and CIS countries|Russian naming practices]] are different - koryo saram use Russian name practices, but Korean surnames, and sometimes Korean names. But most often Christian names are used from the saints of the Russian Orthodox Church, typical for Russians.

====Patronymics====
Legislation of the Russian Empire in issuing documents required the father's name.

Koreans began to use patronymic, but formed from the Korean names of their fathers. Over time, the proportion of Christians increased, they were given, in accordance with the tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church, names from the general list of revered saints. And at the moment 80% koryo saram have a record of those educated from such names.
This differs from the pattern typical in the US, where [[Korean-American|Korean American]] parents often register their children with a Korean given name as their legal middle name (e.g. [[Daniel Dae Kim]], [[Harold Hongju Koh]]).

====Surnames of married women====
{{see also|Married and maiden names#Russia and some Slavic countries}}

In Korea, until the 20th century, women had no names. Women were called by the surname of their father if there was one. Noble nobles received as a pseudo-name the name of the estate in which they lived. And this did not change when getting married.

The preservation of his wife's name has been preserved as a tradition among modern Koreans, after women began to give names.

The Koreans began to migrate to the Russian Empire in 1864 long before women were allowed to give names in modern Korean tradition in Korea.

Legislation of the Russian Empire required the mandatory presence of the surname of the name and patronymic name for everyone. Including poor serf wives.
When they were married they were given the surname of the husband, a patronymic formed on behalf of the father and given a name from the Sviatcy (List of names of saints of the Orthodox Church).

====Declining for gender====
The Russians have declined (depending on masculinum and femminile) and not inclined surnames. The surnames of Koreans are not inclined.&lt;!--??????--&gt;

====Generation names====
In Korea, it is common for siblings and cousins of the same generation to have one [[hanja]] syllable in common among all of their names; this is known as ''[[Generation name|dollimja]]''. Russians have no equivalent practice, although they do have [[patronym]]s which the Koryo-saram have for the most part adopted. Therefore, Koryo-saram does not use generation of names of this type. They use, depending on religion, either a name from Sviatcy or a name arbitrarily chosen from the hieroglyphs hanja used in Korea to form names. Beautiful in sound and meaning.

Due to deportation and the continuing urbanization of the population after 1952, the command of Korean among the Koryo-saram has continued to fall. This contrasts with other more rural minority groups such as the [[Dungan people|Dungan]], who have maintained a higher level of proficiency in their ethnic language. In 1989, the most recent year for which data are available, the number of Russian mother tongue speakers among the Koryo-saram population overtook that of Korean mother tongue speakers.

===Relations with Korean expatriates===
The 2005 [[Cinema of Korea|South Korean film]] ''[[Wedding Campaign]]'', directed by Hwang Byung-kook, portrays two aging bachelor farmers from rural villages who hope to find wives. Having no romantic prospects in South Korea, they opt to go through an international [[mail-order bride]] agency, which sends them to Uzbekistan and tries to match them with Korean women there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Tae-jong|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/200508/kt2005082120230411710.htm |title=Farmer Looks for Love in Upcoming 'Wedding Campaign'|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=21 August 2005|accessdate=16 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128063758/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/200508/kt2005082120230411710.htm|archivedate=28 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">There are many languages spoken on the [[Caribbean]] [[island]] of [[Aruba]]. The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Papiamento]], although schools require students to learn [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and to a lesser extent, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] which is also spoken on the island. According to the Government of Aruba the [[First language|mother tongue and primary vernacular]] of almost all Arubans is a local [[language]] known as [[Papiamento]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aruba.com/ExploreAruba/Culture/language.aspx "Language" - Government of Aruba (official site) - 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Portuguese Creole|Afro-Portuguese Creole]] language spoken since the 16th century. The language, however, was not widespread in Aruba till the 18th and 19th centuries when most materials on the island and even Roman Catholic schoolbooks were written in Papiamento.

'''Dutch''' has been one of the official languages of the island for years as the island is a part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. However, Dutch is the sole language for all administrative and legal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcaribbeanlegalportal.com/about-us/the-dutch-caribbean |title=About Us |website=DutchCaribbeanLegalPortal.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aruba has recognized '''English''' as an international language, and has required that children learn English as early as the 4th grade. Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British took Curaçao, Aruba and [[Bonaire]]; when Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials noted the already widespread use of the language.&lt;ref name=Putte&gt;Dede pikiña ku su bisiña: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd. van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers&lt;/ref&gt;. Since May 2003, Papiamento has also been an official language, alongside Dutch.  Aruba's location off the coast of [[South America]] has also made '''Spanish''' extremely important. Students begin learning this as early as 5th grade. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;Dede pikiña ku su bisiña: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd. van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[Venezuela]]n TV networks are received, and the fact that Aruba has Venezuelan and Colombian residents. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papiamento is a [[language]] with roots mainly from Portuguese, and to a lesser extent, from Dutch, Spanish and English. It originated in the 16th century as a pidgin language for communication among slaves and slave drivers.

Papiamento was not considered important on Aruba until 1995. It was officially included in the school curriculum in 1998 and 1999. Since then, the island has embraced this native language. A Papiamento dictionary and fairy tales written in Papiamento are now readily available on the island.

Aruba is a [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] society. Most of Aruba's population is able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and Spanish.

==Australia==
Fraternities or lodges were an important part of Australian society in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. After the Second World War, they were gradually replaced by "[[service club]]s", such as [[Lions Clubs International|Lions]], [[Apex Clubs of Australia|Apex]] and [[Rotary International|Rotary]]. By the end of the 20th century, most fraternities had been wound up except for the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and a few lodges of the [[Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes|Buffaloes]]. Many fraternities also offered insurance to their members and as membership declined, these operations were either combined with other non profit insurance companies or sold with the proceeds being distributed to charitable causes.

The reasons for their decline probably have something to do with their male only membership, generational change and bemusement at secretive rites and rituals. All fraternities had different rules and rites, but they all appear to have been complex. The service clubs that succeeded the fraternities also operated as social networks and did fairly similar charitable work. No general history has been written, but some of the many lodges that operated in the state of Victoria were:

* [[Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes]]
* [[Ancient Order of Druids]]
* [[Foresters Friendly Society]]
* [[Freemasons]], including  [[United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory]]
* [[Knights of the Southern Cross]] An order of religious Roman Catholics
* [[Independent_Order_of_Rechabites#Australia|Rechabites]] A fraternity especially for tee-total abstainers from alcohol
* [[Odd Fellows]] (Independent Order of Odd Fellows or IOOF)

Of course in those sectarian times, there had to be two different lodges for those of Irish ancestry:
* [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] for Irish Catholics
* [[Loyal Orange Lodge]] for Protestants

==Canada==
* [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]]
* [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]]
* [[Canadian Fraternal Association]]

* [[Fraternal Forestry|Canadian Order for Home Circles]]
* [[International Order of Alhambra]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">The '''MIT Center for Collective Intelligence'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cci.mit.edu MIT Center for Collective Intelligence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ('''CCI''') is a research center at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], headed by Professor [[Thomas W. Malone]], that focuses on the study of [[collective intelligence]].  

The Center for Collective Intelligence brings together faculty from across MIT to conduct research on how new communications technologies are changing the way people work together. It involves people from many diverse organizations across MIT including; the [[MIT Media Lab]], the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], and the Dalai Lama Center for 21st Century Ethics and Transformative Values.  

== History and mission ==
CCI was founded in 2006 by professor [[Thomas W. Malone]]. To a great extent, this is a continuation of the research Malone and his colleagues have conducted at the Center for Coordination Science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/8836 MIT looks to give 'group think' a good name&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as within initiatives such as "Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century".

The center's mission is to find novel answers to one basic research motif: "How can people and computers be connected so that—collectively—they act more intelligently than any individuals, groups, or computers have ever done before?'"

In order to answer this question, the researchers conduct three types of research: 
# Collecting examples and case studies of collective intelligence applications.
# Creating new examples and tools that harness the collective intelligence of people
# Systematic studies and experiments

Finally, they also work on developing theories to explain the phenomena of collective-intelligence.

The center is sponsored by several corporates and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://cci.mit.edu/about/sponsors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
Professor [[Thomas W. Malone]] is the founder and director of CCI. In addition to Malone, the faculty steering committee includes: 
Professor [[Randall Davis]] (Research Director, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), [[Alex (Sandy) Pentland]] (Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Science and Director, Human Dynamics Group at the Media Laboratory), and [[Josh Tenenbaum]] - Paul E. Newton Associate Professor and Head, Computational Cognitive Science Group (Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences).

The advisory board includes [[Tim Berners-Lee]], [[Jimmy Wales]] and Alpheus Bingham (former CEO of [[Innocentive|Innocentive, Inc.]]).
The center also has an active community of research scientists, students, scholars and other affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611041615/http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MaryHays-FemaleBiography.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Female Biography, or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women'' (first American edition, 1807)]]

'''Mary Hays'''  (1759–1843) was an autodidact intellectual who published essays, poetry, novels, and several works on famous (and infamous) women.  She is remembered for her early feminism, and her close relations to dissenting and radical thinkers of her time including Robert Robinson, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and William Frend.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite web | last=Walker | first=Gina Luria | title=Mary Hays | publisher=Project Continua | date=2014 | accessdate=28 August 2014 | url=http://www.projectcontinua.org/mary-hays/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in 1759, into a family of Protestant dissenters who rejected the practices of the Church of England (the established church). Hays was described by those who disliked her as 'the baldest disciple of [Mary] Wollstonecraft' by ''The Anti Jacobin Magazine'', attacked as an 'unsex'd female' by clergyman Robert Polwhele, and provoked controversy through her long life with her rebellious writings. When Hays's fiancé John Eccles died on the eve of their marriage, Hays expected to die of grief herself.  But this apparent tragedy meant that she escaped an ordinary future as wife and mother, remaining unmarried. She seized the chance to make a career for herself in the larger world as a writer.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

Hays was influenced by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]], and after writing admiringly to her, the two women became friends.  The backlash following Wollstonecraft's death and posthumous publication of her [[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]] impacted Hays' later work, which some scholars have called more conservative.&lt;ref name="web.wlu.ca"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ty|first=Eleanor|title=Mary Hays: Critical Biography|url=http://web.wlu.ca/english/ety/biography.html|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these later productions is the six-volume compendium ''[[Female Biography: or Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women of All Ages and Countries]]'', in which Wollstonecraft is not mentioned, although Hays had written an extensive obituary for ''The Annual Necrology'' shortly after Godwin's controversial ''Memoirs''.  If Wollstonecraft was neglected through the nineteenth century, Hays and her writing received even less critical evaluation or academic attention until the twentieth-century's emerging [[feminist movement]].

== Early years ==
Mary Hays was born in London 13 October 1759, the daughter of [[English Dissenters|Rational Dissenters]] John and Elizabeth Hays.

In 1777 she met and fell in love with John Eccles. Their parents initially opposed the match but they met secretly and exchanged over 100 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Elma|title=Mary Hays|url=http://www.chawtonhouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Mary-Hays.pdf|work=Biographies of Women Writers|publisher=Chawton House Library|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were eventually engaged, but in August 1780, Eccles died of a fever.  Hays wrote: "All my pleasures – and every opening prospect are buried with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Love-Letters of Mary Hays|year=1925|publisher=Methuen|location=London|page=80|editor=A. F. Wedd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spurred her to take up writing. For the next ten years she wrote essays and poems. A short story, "Hermit: an Oriental Tale," was published in 1786 in ''Universal Magazine''. It was a [[picturesque]] tale that warned against feeling too much passion. She exchanged letters with [[Robert Robinson (hymnist)|Robert Robinson]], a minister who campaigned [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|against the slave trade]]. She attended the [[New College at Hackney|dissenting academy in Hackney]] in the late 1780s.

== Success in writing ==
In 1791 she replied to [[Gilbert Wakefield]]'s critique of communal worship with a pamphlet called ''Cursory Remarks on An Enquiry into the Expediency and Propriety of Public or Social Worship'', using the nom-de-plume Eusebia.&lt;ref name="web.wlu.ca"/&gt; The Cambridge mathematician [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]] wrote to her enthusiastically about it. This blossomed into a brief romance.

In 1792 Hays was given a copy of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], and it made a deep impression on her.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt; Hays contacted the publisher of the book, [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], which led to her friendship with Wollstonecraft and involvement with London's [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] intellectual circle. Hays next wrote a book ''Letters and Essays'' (1793) and invited Mary Wollstonecraft to comment on it before publication. Although the reviews were mixed Hays decided to leave home and to try to support herself by writing. She moved to [[Hatton Garden]]. She did not have enough money to buy ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' by [[William Godwin]]. Boldly she wrote to the author and asked to borrow it. This turned into a friendship, in which Godwin became a guide and teacher. She acted on Wollstonecraft's demand that women take charge of their lives and moved out of her mother's home to live as an independent woman in London. This was an extraordinary and unaccustomed act for a single woman in Hays's time: Hays’s mother was horrified, and Hays’s friends condemned her. Although Hays’s family were outsiders from mainstream British culture, Hays’s mother still disapproved of her daughter’s social rebellion.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

== ''Emma Courtney'' ==
Her next work, ''[[Memoirs of Emma Courtney]]'' (1796) is probably her best-known. Hays's experiment with 'the idea of being free', and her romantic heartbreak over the Frend affair, were its subjects.

The novel draws on love letters to William Frend (who was ultimately unreceptive) and includes material taken also from her more philosophical letters in which she debated with William Godwin. The heroine, Emma, falls in love with Augustus Harley, who is the son of a dear friend, but lacking an income. Recognizing that he cannot afford marriage, she offers to live with him as his wife without getting married. Emma tells the Frend figure that her desire for him trumps every other consideration: reputation, status, and even chastity. In the most notorious statement in the book, Emma plays on Frend’s name: ‘My friend’, she cries, ‘I would give myself to you – the gift is not worthless’.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt; In real life and in the novel, Frend rejected Hays.

Readers were shocked at her inclusion of real letters she had exchanged with Godwin and Frend. Hays's disgrace was juicy gossip in the close-knit group of London publishing.  In 1800 Scottish writer [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]] published ''[[Memoirs of Modern Philosophers]]'', a novel that satirised Hays as a sex-hungry man-chaser, and Hays became a laughingstock throughout Britain.

== Later years ==
Hays and Godwin fell out, and she turned her attention to other writers, including [[Robert Southey]] and unfortunately Charles Lloyd. There is no known portrait of her in later life, but [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] referred to her  as "a thing ugly and petticoated" (although his real complaint was her arguing theology with him). Her next novel ''[[The Victim of Prejudice]]'' (1799) is more emphatically feminist in its focus on women's secondary status and criticism of class hierarchies. Hays was considered too radical and her book did not sell well. In 1803 Hays demonstrated her continuing concern with women's lives and work, publishing ''[[List of women in Female Biography|Female Biography]]'', a book in six volumes, containing the lives of 294 women from ancient figures to near contemporaries. Some scholars have argued that by this stage Hays realised that it was dangerous to praise Mary Wollstonecraft, and so omitted her from the book. Others have argued that Hays had little to lose and did not include Wollstonecraft for other reasons—her stated reason that she was too recently dead, and because she had already written and published a full obituary that should perhaps be considered part of ''Female Biography''.

Moving to [[Camberwell]] in 1804 thanks to the income from ''Female Biography'', Hays became known to more literary figures of the time, including [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles]] and [[Mary Lamb]] and [[William Blake]]. The last 20 years of her life were difficult, with little income and only moderate praise for her work. During this period, she published ''Memoirs of Queens, Illustrious and Celebrated '' (1821). In 1824 Hays returned to London where she died in 1843. She is buried at [[Abney Park Cemetery]], [[Stoke Newington Church Street|Church Street]], [[Stoke Newington]], London.

== Legacy ==
Mary Hays is memorialised in the [[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]] of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', near the place setting for [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Hays|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/mary_hays.php|work=The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her letters are held at the [[New York Public Library]], Astor and Tilden Foundation thanks to the work of Dr. [[Gina Luria Walker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7219">The measurement of '''economic worth over time''' is the problem of relating past prices, costs, values and proportions of social production to current ones.  For a number of reasons, relating any past indicator to a current indicator of worth is theoretically and practically difficult for [[economist]]s, [[historian]]s, and [[political economist]]s.  This has led to some questioning of the idea of time series of worth having any meaning.  However, the popular demand for measurements of social worth over time have caused the production of a number of series.

==The need to measure worth over time==
People often seek a comparison between the price of an item in the past, and the price of an item today.  Over short periods of time, like months, [[inflation]] may measure the role an object and its cost played in an economy: the price of fuel may rise or fall over a month.  The [[price of money]] itself changes over time, as does the availability of goods and services as they move into or out of production.  What people choose to consume changes over time.  Finally, concepts such as [[money|cash money]] economies may not exist in past periods, nor ideas like [[wage labour]] or [[capital investment]].  Comparing what someone paid for a good, how much they had to work for that money, what the money was worth, how scarce a particular good was, what role it played in someone's standard of living, what its proportion was as part of social income, and what proportion it was as part of possible social production is a difficult task.  This task is made more difficult by conflicting theoretical concepts of worth.

==Theoretical problems==
{{main article|Value (economics)}}

One chief problem is the competition between different fundamental conceptions of the division of [[social product]] into measurable or theorisable concepts.  Marxist and political economic [[Labor theory of value|value]], neoclassical [[marginalist]], and other ideas regarding proportion of social product not measured in money terms have arisen.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H. Williamson, "Measures of Worth," MeasuringWorth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical problems==
Official measures by governments have a limited depth of the time series, mainly originating in the 20th century.  Even within these series, changes in parameters such as consumption bundles, or measures of GDP fundamentally affect the worth of a series.

Historical series computed from statistical data sets, or estimated from archival records have a number of other problems, including changing consumption bundles, consumption bundles not representing standard measures, and changes to the structure of social worth itself such as the move to [[wage labour]] and [[market economies]].

==Different series and their use==
A different time series should be used depending on what kind of economic object is being compared over time:
;Consumer Price Indexes and Wage-Price series : Used to compare the price of a basket of standard consumer goods for an "average" individual (often defined as non-agricultural workers, based on survey data), or to assess the ability of individuals to acquire these baskets. For example, used to answer the question, "Has the money price of goods purchased by a typical household risen over time?" or used to make adjustments in international comparisons of standards of living.

;Share of GDP : Used to measure income distribution in society or social power of individuals, and the equivalent power of capital. For example can be used to ask "Has the share of annual production that has gone to workers in the form of income decreased or increased over time?" or "Over the long run do the shares of labor's and capital's income constant over time or do they exhibit trends?"

;GDP per capita : Used to compare wage or income relativities over time, for example, used to answer the question, "If in 1870 a grocer earnt $40 a week in profit, what would that profit be worth today in terms of social status and economic impact?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/indicator.html Choosing the Best Indicator to Measure Relative Worth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wage price series==

A '''wage price series''' is a set of data claiming to indicate the real wages and real prices of goods over a span of time, and their relationship to each other through the [[price]] of [[money]] at the time they were compared.  Wage price series are currently collected and computed by major governments.  Wage price series are also computed historically by economic historians and non-government organisations.  Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working-class people.

==Contemporary wage price series==
Contemporary wage price series are the result of the normal operation of government economic statistics units, and are often produced as part of the [[National income accounts]].

==Historical wage price series==
Computing a historical wage price series requires discovering government or non government data, determining if the measures of wage or price are appropriate, and then manipulating the data.  Some of these series have been criticised for failing to deal with a number of significant data and theoretical problems.

===Historical wage price series of the United Kingdom===
Due to the survival of literary records of economic life from the 13th century in the South of England, extensive attempts have been made to produce long run wage price series regarding Southern England, England in General, or the United Kingdom in the British Isles.  Officer's production of a series from 1264 is reliant on a number of assumptions which he readily admits produce questions about his series' representation of reality.  Officer is reliant on subseries compiled using different criteria, and these series are reliant upon primary sources that describe different earnings and expenses bundles.  The assumption of universal [[wage labour]] and a [[retail goods]] market, the assumption of money rents, the inability to compute non-market earnings such as obligatory benefits received from masters or the right to squat, all impact on the quality and representative nature of Officer's sources and series.

The '''Moken''' (also '''''Mawken''''' or '''''Morgan'''''; {{Lang-my|ဆလုံ လူမျိုး}}; {{lang-th|ชาวเล|lit=sea people|translit=chao le}}) are an [[Austronesian people]] of the [[Mergui Archipelago]], a group of approximately 800 islands claimed by both Burma and Thailand. Most of the 2,000 to 3,000 Moken live a semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle heavily based on the sea, though this is increasingly under threat.

The Moken identify in a common culture, and speak the [[Moken language]], a distinct [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]]. Attempts by both Burma and Thailand to assimilate the Moken into the wider regional culture have met with very limited success. However, the Moken face an uncertain future as their population decreases and their nomadic lifestyle and unsettled legal status leaves them marginalized by modern property and immigration laws, maritime conservation and development programs, and tightening border policies.&lt;ref&gt;Some classifications do not include Moken under the Malayan languages, or even under the Aboriginal Malay group of languages. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mwt "Ethnologue report for Moken/Moklen" ''Ethnologue'']. Moken is considered part of, but isolated within the (Nuclear) Malayo-Polynesian family, displaying no particular affinities to any other (Nuclear) Malayo-Polynesian language. Moreover, it has undergone strong areal influence from neighbouring Mon–Khmer languages, comparable to, but apparently independently from the [[Chamic languages]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/galleries/moken-sea-gypsies |title='The ocean is our universe' - Survival International |publisher=Survivalinternational |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/06/25/stateless-sea/moken-burma-and-thailand |title=The Moken of Burma and Thailand |publisher=Human Rights Watch  |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projectmoken.com/the-moken/ |title=The Moken |publisher=Projectmoken.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The people refer to themselves as Moken. The name is used for all of the Austronesian speaking tribes who inhabit the coast and islands in the [[Andaman Sea]] on the west coast of [[Thailand]], the provinces of [[Satun Province|Satun]], [[Trang Province|Trang]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi]], [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]], and [[Ranong Province|Ranong]], up through the [[Mergui Archipelago]] of Myanmar. The group includes the Moken proper, the Moklen (Moklem), the Orang Sireh (Betel-leaf People), and the Orang Lanta. The last, the Orang Lanta, are a hybridized group formed when the Malay people settled the Lanta islands where the proto-Malay Orang Sireh had been living.

The [[Burmese language|Burmese]] call the Moken "selung", "salone", or "chalome".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John (1890). ''The Selungs of the Mergui Archipelago''. London: Trübner &amp; Co. pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thailand]] they are called "chao le" ("people of the sea") or "chao nam" ("people of the water"), although these terms are also used loosely to include the [[Urak Lawoi]] and even the [[Orang Laut]]. In Thailand, acculturated Moken are called "Thai mai" ("new Thais").

The Moken are also called sea gypsies, a generic term that applies to a number of peoples in [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Urak Lawoi]] are sometimes classified with the Moken, but they are linguistically and ethnologically distinct, being much more closely related to the Malay people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=urk Classification of Urak Lawoi language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/themes/ceesp/WAMIP/Urak%20Lawoi%20pamphlet.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628213628/http://iucn.org/themes/ceesp/WAMIP/Urak%20Lawoi%20pamphlet.doc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-06-28 |title=Urak Lawoi of the Adang Archipelago, Tarutao National Marine Park, Satun Province, Thailand |author=Dr. Supin Wongbusarakum |date=December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Way of life==
[[File:Moken boat.jpg|thumb|A Moken boat]]
Their knowledge of the sea enables them to live off its [[fauna]] and [[flora]] by using simple tools such as nets and spears to forage for food.  What is not consumed is dried atop their boats, then used to [[barter]] for other necessities at local markets.  During the [[monsoon]] season, they build additional boats while occupying temporary huts.

Moken children have been found to see better than European children [[underwater vision|underwater]] due to [[Pupillary reflex|constriction]] of their [[pupil]]s and [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] of their [[Focus (optics)|visual focus]].&lt;ref name="Gislén2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Gislén|first1= A.|last2= Dacke|first2= M.|last3= Kröger|first3= R.H.H|last4= Abrahamsson|first4= M.|last5= Nilsson|first5= D.-E.|last6= Warrant|first6= E.J.|title= Superior Underwater Vision in a Human Population of Sea Gypsies|journal= Current Biology|volume= 13|issue= 10|year= 2003|pages= 833–836|doi= 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Travis2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Travis |first= J. |title= Children of Sea See Clearly Underwater | journal= [[Science News]] | volume= 163 | issue= 20 | pages= 308–309 |date= 2003-05-17 |url= http://www.projectmaje.org/gypsies.htm#18 |access-date= 2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these differences are due to conditioning from frequent diving or genetic differences possibly arising from selection was not investigated.&lt;ref name="Gislén2003" /&gt; Members of another "sea gypsy" group, the [[Sama-Bajau]], appear to have a number of [[Sama-Bajau#Free-diving adaptations|genetic adaptations]] to facilitate a lifestyle involving extensive [[freediving]].&lt;ref name="Ilardo2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ilardo|first1=M.

Some of the Burmese Moken are still nomadic people who roam the sea most of their lives in small hand-crafted wooden boats called ''kabang,'' which serve not just as transportation, but also as kitchen, bedroom, and living area. However, much of their traditional life, which is built on the premise of life as outsiders, is under threat.{{CN|date=February 2017}}

Aside from [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]], the Moken have no religion.&lt;ref name="BP-20170212"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Na Thalang|first1=Jeerawat|title=Sea gypsies turning the tide|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1197265/sea-gypsies-turning-the-tide|accessdate=12 February 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental control==
The [[Burma|Burmese]] and [[Thailand|Thai]] governments have made attempts at assimilating the people into their own culture, but these efforts have met with limited success.  Thai Moken have been permanently settled in villages located in the [[Surin Island]]s ([[Mu Ko Surin National Park]]),&lt;ref name="settings"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/csi/pub/papers2/surin7.htm Environmental, social and cultural settings of the Surin Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/attraction.asp "Mu Ko Surin National Park" National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department, Bangkok, Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140627232306/http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/attraction.asp |date=2014-06-27 }};&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Phuket Province]], on the northwestern coast of Phuket Island, and on the nearby [[Phi Phi]] Islands of [[Krabi Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauerlein, Monika (November 2005) "Sea change: they outsmarted the tsunami, but Thailand's ''sea gypsies'' could be swept away by an even greater force" ''Mother Jones'' 30(6): pp. 56–61;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Andaman Sea]] off the [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] coast was the subject of keen scrutiny from Burma's regime during the 1990s due to offshore [[petroleum]] discoveries by [[multinational corporation]]s including [[Unocal]], [[Petronas]] and others. Reports from the late-1990s told of forced relocation by Burma's [[military regime]] of the sea gypsies to mainland sites. It was claimed most of the Salone had been relocated by 1997, which is consistent with a pervasive pattern of forced relocation of suspect ethnic, economic and political groups, conducted throughout Burma during the 1990s.

In Thailand, the Moken have been the target of land grabs by developers contesting their ownership of ancestral lands. Although sea gypsies have resided in Thailand's Andaman coastal provinces for several centuries, they have historically neglected to register official ownership of the land due to their ignorance of legal protocol.&lt;ref name="BP-20170212" /&gt;

==History==

==2004 Indian Ocean tsunami==
The islands the Moken inhabit received much media attention in 2005 during the recovery from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]. As they are keenly attuned to the ocean, the Moken in some areas knew the tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004 was coming and managed to preserve many lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/18/60minutes/main681558.shtml|title=Sea Gypsies See Signs In The Waves|author=Leung,Rebecca |work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|date=25 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the coastal villages of [[Phang Nga Province]], like [[Tap Tawan]], the Moken suffered severe devastation to housing and fishing boats in common with other Moken communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/photogallery/THfisherfolk.htm|author=Jones, Mark|date=6 May 2005| title=Thailand's fisherfolk rebuild after tsunami|agency=''Reuters''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo3|"second generation"|二世|'''Nisei'''}} is a [[Japanese language]] term used in countries in [[North America]] and [[South America]] to specify the children born in the new country to Japanese-born immigrants (who are called {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Issei]]}}). The {{lang|ja-Latn|Nisei}} are considered the second generation and the grandchildren of the Japanese-born immigrants are called {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sansei]]}} or third generation. ({{lang|ja-Latn|Ichi, ni, san}} are Japanese for "one, two, three"; ''see'' [[Japanese numerals]].)

==History==
[[File:Japanese Immigrants in Immigrant´s public lodge.jpg|thumb|right|The children of these Japanese-Brazilian (''Nipo-brasileiros'') immigrants would be called ''Nisei''.]]

Although the earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants left Japan centuries ago, and a later group settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897,&lt;ref name="mofa-Mexico"&gt;Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html "Japan-Mexico Relations"]; retrieved 2011-05-17&lt;/ref&gt; the four largest populations of Japanese immigrants and their descendants live in [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Peru]], and the [[United States]].

===American ''Nisei''===
{{Main|Japanese Americans}}

Some US ''Nisei'' were born after the end of [[World War II]] during the [[baby boom]]. Most ''Nisei'', however, who were living in the western United States during World War II, were forcibly [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned]] with their parents (''Issei'') after [[Executive Order 9066]] was promulgated to exclude everyone of Japanese descent from large parts of the Western states. It has been argued that some ''Nisei'' feel caught in a dilemma between their Nisei parents and other Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Miyoshi, Nobu. (1978). [http://www.momomedia.com/CLPEF/sansei/identity.htm "Identity Crisis of the Sansei and the Concentration Camp"], NIMH Grant No. 1 R13 MH25655-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nisei of [[Hawaii]] had a somewhat different experience.

In the United States, two representative ''Nisei'' were [[Daniel Inouye]] and [[Fred Korematsu]]. Hawaiian-born {{nihongo|Daniel Ken Inouye|井上 建|''Inoue Ken''|extra=|born 7 September 1924}} was one of many young Nisei men who volunteered to fight in the nation's military when restrictions against Japanese-American enlistment were removed in 1943. Inouye later went on to become a U.S. Senator from Hawaii after it achieved statehood.

{{nihongo|Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu|是松 豊三郎|''Korematsu Toyosaburō''|extra=|1919-2005}} was one of many Japanese-American citizens living on the West Coast who resisted [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] during World War II. In 1944, Korematsu lost a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] challenge to the wartime internment of Japanese Americans but gained vindication decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Neil A. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2D91F30F93AA35752C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= "President Names 15 for Nation's Top Civilian Honor"], ''[[New York Times]]''. January 9, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honor in the United States, was awarded to Korematsu in 1998. At the White House award ceremonies, President [[Bill Clinton]] explained, "In the long history of our country's constant search for justice, some names of ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls. [[Homer Plessy|Plessy]], [[Oliver Brown (civil rights)|Brown]], [[Rosa Parks|Parks]] ... to that distinguished list, today we add the name of Fred Korematsu."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/national/01korematsu.html  Fred Korematsu, 86, Dies; Lost Key Suit on Internment], ''New York Times.'' April 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of Japanese Americans had reacted to the internment by acquiescing to the government's order, hoping to prove their loyalty as Americans. To them, Korematsu's opposition was treacherous to both his country and his community. Across the span of decades, he was seen as a traitor, a test case, an embarrassment and, finally, a hero.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, Matt.

===Canadian ''Nisei''===
{{Main|Japanese Canadians}}

Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different sociocultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"&gt;McLellan, Janet. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1EQmqCE1EZFEjUEgEZgsajRaUlTQ  ''Many Petals of the Lotus: Five Asian Buddhist Communities in Toronto,'' p. 36.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikawa, Fumiko.

===Peruvian ''Nisei''===
{{Main|Japanese Peruvians}}

Among the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the ''Nisei'' Japanese Peruvians comprise the largest element.  Former Peruvian President [[Alberto Fujimori]] was the ''Nisei'' son of ''Issei'' emigrants from [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1065667.stm  "Fujimori Secures Japanese Haven,"] BBC News.

== Cultural profile ==
===  Generations ===
Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numbers]] corresponding to the [[generation]] with the Japanese word for generation (''sei'' 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei,'' and ''Sansei'' which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (四世) and the fifth is called  ''Gosei'' (五世).  The ''Issei,'' ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, and religious belief and practice, and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA59,M1  p. 59.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment is the single, most significant factor which explains these variations in their experiences, attitudes and behaviour patterns.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ "What is Nikkei?"] Japanese American National Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left.  These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA37,M1  p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

|}

In North America since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred.  The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves as individuals of Japanese descent in their respective nations of Canada, the United States and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA68,M1  p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese community in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in [[London]]; but unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]] terms used centered from Japan to distinguish the distance from Japanese nationality elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as ''Issei,'' ''Nisei,'' or ''Sansei.''&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBijCPLvWyUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=keiko+itoh++united+kingdom&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1  p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation of immigrants, born in Canada or the United States to parents &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; born in Canada or the United States, is called ''Nisei'' (二世).  The ''Nisei'' have become part of the general immigrant experience in the United States and Canada to become part of the greater "melting pot" of Americans and Canadians.  Some ''Nisei'' have resisted being absorbed into the majority society, largely because of their tendency to maintain Japanese interpersonal styles of relationships. &lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto, S. Frank. [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ363032&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ363032  "Problems of Interpersonal Style among the Nisei,"] ''Amerasia Journal.'' v13 n2 p29-45 (1986-87).&lt;/ref&gt; -- 

Most ''Nisei'' were educated in Canadian or American school systems where they were taught Canadian or American national values as national citizens of those countries of individualism and citizenship.  When these were taken away in the early 1940s, the ''Nisei'' confronted great difficulty in accepting or coming to terms with internment and forced resettlement. Older ''Nisei'' tended to identify more closely with the ''Issei,'' sharing similar economic and social characteristics.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;  Older ''Nisei'' who had been employed in small businesses, in farming, in fishing or in semi-skilled occupations, tended to remain in blue-collar work.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA36,M1  pp. 36-37.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the younger ''Nisei'' attended university and college and entered various professions and white-collar employment after the war.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"/&gt;  This sharp division in post-war experiences and opportunities exacerbated the gaps between these ''Nisei.''

====Aging====
The ''[[kanreki]]'' (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the ''Issei'' and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of ''Nisei.'' Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this  Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Mary L. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/mm006n8332478691/  "A Transformation of Ritual: The Nisei 60th Birthday."] ''Journal	Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology.'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (April, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;
Aging is affecting the demographics of the Nisei. According to a 2011 columnist in ''The Rafu Shimpo'' of Los Angeles, the obituaries showing the number of Japanese Americans in their 80s and 90s — Nisei, in a word — who are passing is staggering"&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, George Toshio. [http://rafu.com/news/2011/02/itns-ja-newspapers/  "Into the Next Stage: Japanese American Newspapers: Over and Out?"] ''Rafu Shimpo'' (US). February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
The Japanese-born ''Issei'' learned Japanese as their mother tongue, and their success in learning English as a second language was varied.  Most ''Nisei'' speak Japanese to some extent, learned from ''Issei'' parents, Japanese school, and living in a Japanese community or in the internment camps.  A majority of English-speaking ''Nisei'' have retained knowledge of the Japanese language, at least in its spoken form.  Most ''Sansei'' speak English as their first language and most marry people of non-Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"/&gt;

===Education===

An illustrative point-of-view, as revealed in the poetry of an ''Issei'' woman:
:::By ''Meiji'' parents
:::Emigrants to Canada
:::The ''Nisei'' were raised to be
:::Canadian citizens
:::Of whom they could be proud.
::::-- Kinori Oka, Kisaragi Poem Study Group, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA64,M1  p. 64.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermarriage===
There was relatively little inter-marriage during the Nisei generation, mainly because the relocation and the war intervened
exactly at a time when the group was of marrying age. Identification of them with the enemy by the American public, made them
unpopular and unlikely candidates for inter-racial marriage.  Beside this, they were thrown, en masse, into camps with others of
the same ethnicity, causing the majority of Nisei to marry other Nisei.  This is why third generation Sansei are mostly still of
the same racial appearance as the Issei, who first immigrated to the U.S.  
The Sansei generation has widely inter-married in the post WWII years, with estimates of such unions at over 60 percent.

====Japanese American redress====
In 1978, the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] actively began demanding  be taken as redress for harms endured by Japanese Americans during World War II.

In 1980, Congress established the [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]] ([[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians|CWRIC]])  The commission report, ''Personal Justice Denied,'' condemned the internment as "unjust and motivated by racism rather than real military necessity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/personal_justice_denied/intro.htm Personal Justice Denied, ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], which provided for a formal apology and payments of $20,000 for each survivor. The legislation stated that government actions were based on "race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership".&lt;ref&gt;100th Congress, S. 1009, [http://www.internmentarchives.com/showdoc.php?docid=00055&amp;search_id=19269&amp;pagenum=4 reproduced at] internmentarchives.com].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Civil Liberties Act Amendments of 1992]], appropriating an additional $400 million in order to ensure that all remaining internees received their $20,000 redress payments, was signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]], who also issued another formal apology from the U.S. government.

Japanese and Japanese Americans who were relocated during WWII were compensated for direct property losses in 1948. These payments were awarded to 82,210 Japanese Americans or their heirs at a cost of $1.6 billion; the program's final disbursement occurred in 1999.&lt;ref name = "democracynow"&gt;DemocracyNow: [http://www.democracynow.org/1999/2/18/wwii_reparations_japanese_american_internees WWII Reparations: Japanese-American Internees]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese Canadian redress====
In 1983, the [[National Association of Japanese Canadians]] ([[National Association of Japanese Canadians|NAJC]]) mounted a campaign demanding redress for injustices during the war years.&lt;ref name="r-m"&gt;[http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12837/14056 Establishing Recognition of Past Injustices: Uses of Archival Records in Documenting the Experience of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War]. Roberts-Moore, Judith. Archivaria: The Journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, 53 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  NAJC hired [[Price Waterhouse]] to estimate the economic losses to Japanese Canadians resulting from property confiscations and loss of wages due to internment. On the basis of detailed records maintained by the [[Custodian of Alien Property]],&lt;ref&gt;Order-in-Council, P.C. 1665: Yesaki, Mitsuo. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_cxp_BgPmwC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Canada+custody+of+alien+property+1942&amp;source=web&amp;ots=90WJfFiW02&amp;sig=y6K_MnSrdWodL7RHgYytrtKPvxc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result  ''Sutebusuton: A Japanese Village on the British Columbia Coast,'' p. 111.]&lt;/ref&gt;  it was determined that the total loss totalled $443 million (in 1986 dollars).&lt;ref name="r-m"/&gt;

In 1988, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] gave that long-awaited formal apology and the Canadian government began to make good on a compensation package—including $21,000 to all surviving internees, and the re-instatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan.&lt;ref name="CBC-9"&gt;[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-71-568-2924/conflict_war/internment/clip9 Apology and compensation], CBC Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christianity and gender}}
The '''ordination of women''' to [[Minister of religion|ministerial]] or [[priest]]ly office is an increasingly common practice among some [[major religious groups]] of the present time, as it was of several pagan religions of antiquity and, some scholars argue, in early Christian practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

It remains a controversial issue in certain Christian denominations where "[[ordination]]" (the process by which a person is understood to be [[Consecration|consecrated]] and set apart by God for the administration of various religious [[rites]]) has for almost 2,000 years been limited only to men.

In some cases women have been permitted to be ordained, but not to hold higher positions, such as (until July 2014) that of [[bishop]] in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news | title =Women bishops vote: Church of England 'resembles sect' | newspaper =BBC News - UK Politics | publisher =BBC | date =2012-11-22 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20443718 | accessdate = 2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where laws prohibit [[Anti-discrimination law|sex discrimination in employment]], exceptions are often made for clergy (for example, in the United States).

In [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], [[God's Wife of Amun]] was the highest ranking [[priest]]ess; this title was held by a daughter of the [[High Priest]] of [[Amun]], during the reign of [[Hatshepsut]], while the capital of [[Egypt]] was in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]] during the second millennium BC (circa 2160 BC).

Later, [[Divine Adoratrice of Amun]] was a title created for the chief priestess of [[Amun]]. During the first millennium BC, when the holder of this office exercised her largest measure of influence, her position was an important appointment facilitating the transfer of power from one [[pharaoh]] to the next, when his daughter was ''adopted'' to fill it by the incumbent office holder. The Divine Adoratrice ruled over the extensive temple duties and domains, controlling a significant part of the ancient Egyptian economy.

In [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]], some important observances, such as the [[Thesmophoria]], were made by women. Priestesses played a major role in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. The [[Gerarai]] were priestesses of [[Dionysus]] who presided over festivals and rituals associated with the god. A body of priestesses might also maintain the cult at a particular holy site, such as the [[Peleiades]] at the oracle of [[Dodona]]. The ''[[Arrephoros|Arrephoroi]]'' were young girls ages seven to twelve who worked as [[servants]] of [[Athena Polias]] on the [[Athenian Acropolis]] and were charged with conducting unique rituals.

At several sites women priestesses served as [[oracle]]s , the most famous of which is the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. The priestess of the Temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]] was the [[Pythia]], credited throughout the [[Greco-Roman world]] for her [[prophecy|prophecies]], which gave her a prominence unusual for a woman in male-dominated [[ancient Greece]]. The [[Phrygian Sibyl]] presided over an oracle of Apollo in [[Anatolia]]n [[Phrygia]]. The inspired speech of divining women, however, was interpreted by male priests; a woman might be a mantic ''(mantis)'' who became the mouthpiece of a deity through possession, but the "prophecy of interpretation" required specialized knowledge and was considered a rational process suited only to a male '"prophet" ''(prophētēs)''.&lt;ref name="Hovenden2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Hovenden|title=Speaking in Tongues: The New Testament Evidence in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43mDfVbZvdQC|accessdate=2013-10-18|date=2002-12-31|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-84127-306-8|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GrabbeHaak2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lester L.

=== Ancient Rome ===

[[File:Chief Vestal.jpg|thumb|The ''Virgo Vestalis Maxima'', the highest-ranking of the Vestal Virgins]]

The Latin word ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]]'', "priest," is the same for both the [[grammatical gender]]s. In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman state religion]], the priesthood of the [[Vestals]] was responsible for the continuance and security of Rome as embodied by the sacred fire that they could not allow to go out. The Vestals were a [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|college]] of six ''sacerdotes'' (plural) devoted to [[Vesta (god)|Vesta]], [[goddess]] of the hearth, both the focus of a private home ''([[domus]])'' and the [[sacred fire of Vesta|state hearth that was the center of communal religion]]. Freed of the usual social obligations to marry and rear children, the Vestals took a vow of [[chastity]] in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were off-limits to the male colleges of priests.&lt;ref name="Staples1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariadne Staples|title=From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRS3E3u3HuAC|accessdate=2013-10-18|date=January 1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-13233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They retained their religious authority until the Christian emperor [[Gratian]] confiscated their revenues&lt;ref name="Jones1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|title=The Later Roman Empire, 284-602: A Social Economic and Administrative Survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IiLtO4ZvTdEC|accessdate=2013-10-18|year=1986|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-3353-3|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his successor [[Theodosius I]] closed the [[Temple of Vesta]] permanently.&lt;ref name="jr1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Richardson, jr|title=A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC|accessdate=2013-10-18|date=1992-10-01|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-4300-6|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans also had at least two priesthoods that were each held jointly by a married couple, the ''[[rex sacrorum|rex]]'' and ''[[regina sacrorum]]'', and the ''[[flamen Dialis|flamen]]'' and ''[[flaminica Dialis]]''. The ''regina sacrorum'' ("queen of the sacred rites") and the ''flaminica Dialis'' (high priestess of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]) each had her own distinct duties and presided over public sacrifices, the ''regina'' on the [[Kalends|first day of every month]], and the ''flaminica'' every [[nundinal cycle]] (the Roman equivalent of a week). The highly public nature of these sacrifices, like the role of the Vestals, indicates that women's religious activities in ancient Rome were not restricted to the private or domestic sphere.&lt;ref name="Schultz2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Celia E. Schultz|title=Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFxdmWJDTsoC|accessdate=2013-10-18|date=2006-12-08|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-7725-8|pages=70–71; 79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; So essential was the gender complement to these priesthoods that if the wife died, the husband had  to give up his office.  This is true of the flaminate, and probably true of the ''rex'' and ''regina''.&lt;ref name="Schultz2006"/&gt;

The title ''sacerdos'' was often specified in relation to a deity or temple,&lt;ref name="Schultz2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarveySchultz2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lesley E. Lundeen|others=Paul B.

This form of worship had spread from Sicily under Greek influence, and the [[Aventine Triad|Aventine cult]] of Ceres in Rome was headed by male priests.&lt;ref name="Spaeth, pp. 4-5"&gt;Spaeth, ''The Roman Goddess Ceres'', pp. 4-5, 9, 20 (historical overview and Aventine priesthoods), 84 - 89 (functions of plebeian aediles), 104 - 106 (women as priestesses): citing among others [[Cicero]], ''In Verres'', 2.4.108; [[Valerius Maximus]], 1.1.1; [[Plutarch]], ''De Mulierum Virtutibus'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Only women celebrated the rites of the [[Bona Dea]] ("Good Goddess"), for whom ''sacerdotes'' are recorded.&lt;ref name="Hendrik H.J. Brouwer 1989 pp. 371, 377"&gt;Hendrik H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' (Brill, 1989), pp. 371, 377. One title for a ''sacerdos'' of the Bona Dea was ''damiatrix'', presumably from ''Damia'', one of the names of [[Demeter]] and associated also with the Bona Dea.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inscription in D. Diogo de Sousa Museum (15).JPG|thumb|left|Latin dedication to the goddess [[Isis]] [[List of Roman deities#Augustus and Augusta|Augusta]] by Lucretia Fida, a ''sacerdos'' (priest), from [[Gallaecia|Roman Iberia]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' II. 2416: ''Isidi Aug(ustae) sacrum/ Lucretia Fida sacerd(os) perp(etua)/ Rom(ae) et Aug(usti)/ conventu{u}s Bracar(a)aug(ustani) d(edit)'' ("Lucretia Fida, the priest-for-life of [[Roma (goddess)|Roma]] and [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], from [[Conventus Bracarensis]], [[Braga]], has given a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacrum]]'' to Isis Augusta"), from the D. Diogo de Sousa Museum, Braga, Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
From the [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274–148 BC)|Mid Republic]] onward, religious diversity became increasingly characteristic of the city of Rome. Many religions that were not part of Rome's earliest state religion offered leadership roles as priests for women, among them the imported [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Isis#Greco-Roman world|Isis]] and of the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Magna Mater|Magna Mater]]'' ("Great Mother", or [[Cybele]]). An [[epitaph]] preserves the title ''sacerdos maxima'' for a woman who held the highest priesthood of the Magna Mater's temple near the current site of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name="Dyson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen L. Dyson|title=Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfN5dd5wbWgC|accessdate=2013-10-18|date=2010-08-01|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0101-0|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Inscriptions]] for the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] record priestesses of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno Populona]] and of [[Imperial cult|deified women of the Imperial household]].&lt;ref name="Schultz2006" /&gt;

Under some circumstances, when cults such as [[mystery religions]] were introduced to Romans, it was preferred that they be maintained by women. Although it was Roman practice to incorporate other religions instead of trying to eradicate them,&lt;ref name="Rome 2007 p. 4"&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the secrecy of some mystery cults was regarded with suspicion. In 189 BCE, the [[Roman senate|senate]] attempted to suppress the [[Bacchanalia|Bacchanals]], claiming the secret rites corrupted morality and were a hotbed of political conspiracy. One provision of the [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|senatorial decree]] was that only women should serve as priests of the [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysian religion]], perhaps to guard against the [[wikt:politicize|politicizing]] of the cult,&lt;ref name="Jean MacIntosh Turfa 2006 p. 48"&gt;Jean MacIntosh Turfa, "Etruscan Religion at the Watershed: Before and After the Fourth Century BCE," in ''Religion in Republican Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; since even [[Women in ancient Rome|Roman women]] who were citizens lacked the right to vote or hold political office. Priestesses of [[Liber]], the [[List of Roman deities|Roman god]] [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] [[Dionysus]], are mentioned by the 1st-century BC scholar [[Varro]], as well as indicated by epigraphic evidence.&lt;ref name="Schultz2006"/&gt;

Other religious titles for Roman women include ''magistra'', a high priestess, female expert or teacher; and ''ministra'', a female assistant, particularly one in service to a deity. A ''magistra'' or ''ministra'' would have been responsible for the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified in terms of her marital status.&lt;ref name="Schultz2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarveySchultz2006"/&gt;

The tradition of the ordained monastic community in Buddhism (the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]) began with the Buddha, who established an order of monks.&lt;ref name="Macmillan page 352"&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One), page 352&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scriptures,&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;''Book of the Discipline'', [[Pali Text Society]], volume V, Chapter X&lt;/ref&gt; later, after an initial reluctance, he also established an order of nuns.

However, the bhikkhuni ordination once existing in the countries where [[Theravada]] is more widespread died out around the 10th century, and novice ordination has also disappeared in those countries. Therefore, women who wish to live as nuns in those countries must do so by taking eight or ten precepts.  Neither laywomen nor formally ordained, these women do not receive the recognition, education, financial support or status enjoyed by Buddhist men in their countries.  These "precept-holders" live in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. In particular, the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. However, in 2003, Saccavadi and Gunasari were ordained as bhikkhunis in [[Sri Lanka]], thus becoming the first female Burmese novices in modern times to receive higher ordination in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sujato.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/saccavadis-story/|title=Saccavadi’s story|work=Sujato’s Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tricycle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/awake-world/story-one-burmese-nun|title=The Story of One Burmese Nun - Tricycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan is a special case as, although it has neither the bhikkhuni nor novice ordinations, the precept-holding nuns who live there do enjoy a higher status and better education than their precept-holder sisters elsewhere, and can even become Zen priests.&lt;ref name="Resources on Women's Ordination"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lhamo.tripod.com/4ordin.htm |title=Resources on Women's Ordination |publisher=Lhamo.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tibet there is currently no bhikkhuni ordination, but the [[Dalai Lama]] has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.

== Christianity ==
{{Christianity and gender|theology}}

In the liturgical traditions of [[Christianity]], including the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]], the term ordination refers more narrowly to the means by which a person is included in one of the orders of [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s or [[deacon]]s. This is distinguished from the process of consecration to [[religious order]]s, namely [[nun]]s and [[monk]]s, which are open to women and men. Some Protestant denominations understand ordination more generally as the acceptance of a person for pastoral work.

Historians Gary Macy, Kevin Madigan and Carolyn Osiek claim to have identified documented instances of ordained women in the [[Early Church]].&lt;ref name="Macy 2008 14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macy|first=Gary|title=The hidden history of women's ordination: female clergy in the medieval West|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195189704|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osiek 2005 186"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osiek|first=ed. and transl. by Kevin Madigan and Carolyn|title=Ordained women in the early church: a documentary history|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ.

{{Quote|text= I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae.|author=Rom 16:1|source=&lt;ref&gt;Rom 16:1, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In AD 494, in response to reports that women were serving at the altar in the south of Italy, [[Pope Gelasius I]] wrote a letter condemning female participation in the celebration of the [[Eucharist]], a role he felt was reserved for men.&lt;ref name="Osiek 2005 186"/&gt;

The Protestant Reformation introduced the dogma that the authority of the Bible exceeds that of Popes and other church figures. Once the Roman Catholic hierarchy was no longer accepted as the sole authority, some denominations allowed women to preach. For example, George Fox founded the [[Quaker]] movement after discovering, in 1646, the "inner light" of Christ living in the believer.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Christian Thought: From the Protestant Reformation to the twentieth century|author=Justo L. González|publisher=Abingdon Press|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the inner light worked in women as well as in men, and said:

{{Quote|text=And some men may say, man must have the power and superiority over the woman, because God says, "The man must rule over his wife [Gen 3:16]; and that man is not of the woman, but the woman is of the man [1 Cor 11:8]." Indeed, after man fell, that command was; but before man fell there was no such command; for they were both meet-helps [Gen 2:18,20], and they were both to have dominion over all that God made [Gen 1:26,28]. And as the apostle saith, "for as the woman is of the man", his next words are, "so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God [1 Cor 11:12]". And so the apostle clears his own words; and so as man and woman are restored again, by Christ up into the image of God [Col 3:10], they both have dominion again in the righteousness and holiness [Eph 4:24], and are helps-meet, as before they fell.|author=George Fox|source=&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esr.earlham.edu/qbi/gfe/e312-315.htm | access-date=September 25, 2016 | author=George Fox | title=Works | volume=7-8 | date=1831}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ordination of women has once again been a controversial issue in more recent years with societal focus on social justice movements.  Still, some Christians{{who|date=June 2018}} believe that, though men and women are equal, they are not identical and, since [[New Testament]] scripture outlays a division between roles of men and women in the church, it would be inappropriate to assign women the role or responsibilities of a pastor in a new testament church. For example, in reference to [[Anglicanism]], some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], while theologically very different, may share opposition to female ordination.&lt;ref name=bbc-womenbishops&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Women bishops vote|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18702908|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christians who place emphasis on the [[Biblical infallibility|infallibility of the Bible]] base their opposition to women's ordination partly upon the writings of [[Paul the Apostle|the Apostle Paul]], such as {{Bibleverse||Ephesians|5:23|KJV}}, and {{Bibleverse|1|Timothy|2:11-15|KJV}}, which appears to demand male leadership in the Church.&lt;ref name="Bromiley"&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z|year=2002|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=9780802837844|edition=Fully rev., [Nachdr.].|editor=Geoffrey W. Bromiley [et al]|page=1095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalist Roman and orthodox Catholics may allude to [[Jesus Christ]]'s choice of disciples as evidence of his intention for an exclusively male [[apostolic succession]], as laid down by early Christian writers such as [[Tertullian]] and reiterated in the 1976 ''[[Inter Insigniores|Vatican Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood]]''.&lt;ref name="Raab 2000 49"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raab|first=Kelley A.|title=When the priest is a woman: a psychoanalytic perspective on the Catholic women's ordination debate|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231113359|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of women's ordination may point to the role of notable female figures in the Bible such as [[Phoebe (Bible)|Phoebe]], [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] (considered an [[apostle]] by Paul) and others in {{Bibleverse||Romans|16:1|KJV}}, the [[female disciples of Jesus]], and the [[women at the crucifixion]] who were the first witnesses to the [[Resurrection of Christ]], as supporting evidence of the importance of women as leaders in the Early Church.

{{Main|Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion}}
In 1917 the Church of England licensed women as lay readers called [[bishop's messenger]]s, many of whom ran churches, but did not go as far as to ordain them.

From 1930 to 1978 the [[Anglican Group for the Ordination of Women to the Historic Ministry]] promoted the ordination of women in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb106-5ago "Records of the Anglican Group for the Ordination of Women to the Historic Ministry of the Church"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Anglicanism]] the majority of provinces ordain women as deacons and priests.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/femclrg14.htm |title=Female ordination in the Episcopal Church, USA (ECUSA) |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date=1976-09-16 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three women ordained as priests in the Anglican Communion were in [[Hong Kong]]: [[Li Tim-Oi]] in 1944 and [[Jane Hwang]] and [[Joyce M. Bennett]] in 1971.

On July 29, 1974, Bishops Daniel Corrigan, Robert L. DeWitt, and Edward R. Welles of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|US Episcopal Church]], with Bishop Antonio Ramos of Costa Rica, ordained eleven women as priests in a ceremony that was widely considered "irregular" because the women lacked "recommendation from the standing committee", a canonical prerequisite for ordination. The "[[Philadelphia Eleven]]", as they became known, were Merrill Bittner, [[Alison Cheek]], Alla Bozarth (Campell), [[Emily C. Hewitt]], [[Carter Heyward]], Suzanne R. Hiatt (d. 2002), Marie Moorefield, [[Jeannette Piccard]] (d. 1981), [[Betty Bone Schiess]], Katrina Welles Swanson (d. 2006), and Nancy Hatch Wittig.&lt;ref name="Episcopal Cafe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/women/celebrating_the_philadelphia_e.html |title=Celebrating the Philadelphia Eleven |accessdate=2012-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123020220/http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/women/celebrating_the_philadelphia_e.html |archivedate=2011-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially opposed by the House of Bishops, the ordinations received approval from the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in September 1976. This General Convention approved the ordination of women to both the priesthood and the episcopate.

Reacting to the action of the General Convention, clergy and laypersons opposed to the ordination of women to the priesthood met in convention at the [[Congress of St. Louis]] and attempted to form a rival Anglican church in the US and Canada. Despite the plans for a united North American church, the result was division into several Continuing Anglican churches, which now make up part of the [[Continuing Anglican movement]].

The first woman to become a bishop in the Anglican Communion was [[Barbara Harris (bishop)|Barbara Harris]], who was elected a suffragan bishop in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts]] in 1988 and ordained on February 11, 1989.

=== Community of Christ ===
The [[Community of Christ]] adopted the practice of women's ordination in 1984,&lt;ref name="Web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/rlds.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122190512/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/rlds.html |archivedate=2007-11-22 |title=Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, from the Religious Movements Homepage |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was one of the reasons for the schism between the [[Community of Christ]] and the newly formed [[Restoration Branches]] movement, which was largely composed of members of the Community of Christ church (then known as the RLDS church) who refused to accept this development and other doctrinal changes taking place during this same period. For example, the [[Community of Christ]] also changed the name of one of its priesthood offices from evangelist-patriarch to evangelist, and its associated sacrament, the patriarchal blessing, to the evangelist's blessing. In 1998, [[Gail E. Mengel]] and [[Linda L. Booth]] became the first two women apostles in the [[Community of Christ]].&lt;ref name = deseretnews&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/619962/RLDS-Church-calls-2-women-to-serve-among-12-apostles.html "RLDS Church calls 2 women to serve among 12 apostles"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 1998-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2007 World Conference of the church, [[Becky L.

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] consider [[Baptism#Jehovah's Witnesses|qualified public baptism]] to represent the baptizand's [[Ordination#Jehovah's Witnesses|ordination]], following which he or she is immediately considered an [[Minister (Christianity)#JW|ordained minister]]. In 1941, the [[Supreme Court of Vermont]] recognized the validity of this ordination for a female Jehovah's Witness minister.&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1981, page 19"&gt;"Women—May They Be "Ministers"?", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1981, page 19, "Several courts in the United States have recognized female Jehovah's Witnesses, in carrying on the door-to-door evangelistic work, as ministers. For example, the Supreme Court of Vermont, in Vermont v. Greaves (1941), stated that Elva Greaves 'is an ordained minister of a sect or class known and designated as "Jehovah’s Witnesses{{"'}}."&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Witnesses actively preaching from door to door are female.&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1968, page 413"&gt;"Letting All Men See Jehovah’s Victory Processions", ''The Watchtower'', July 1, 1968, page 413&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=October 2012}} Women are commonly appointed as full-time ministers, either to evangelize as "[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Pioneer|pioneers]]" or missionaries, or to serve at [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Branch offices|their branch offices]].&lt;ref name="Our Kingdom Ministry 1980, page 6"&gt;"Happy Full-Time Servants", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 1980, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Witness [[Ministerial servant|deacons]] ("[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Ministerial servants|ministerial servants]]") and [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|elders]] must be male, and only a baptized adult male may perform a Jehovah's Witness baptism, [[funeral]], or [[wedding]].&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1964, page 86"&gt;"Applying the General Priesthood Principle", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1964, page 86, "Among the witnesses of Jehovah any adult, dedicated and baptized male Christian who is qualified may serve in such ministerial capacities as giving public Bible discourses and funeral talks, performing marriages and presiding at the Lord’s evening meal or supper. There is no clergy class."&lt;/ref&gt; Within the congregation, a female Witness minister may only lead prayer and teaching when there is a special need, and must do so wearing a [[Christian headcovering#Jehovah's Witnesses|head covering]].&lt;ref name="God's Love page 210-211"&gt;"Head Coverings—When and Why?", ''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', 2008, page 210–211. "Occasionally, though, circumstances may require that a Christian woman be called on to handle a duty normally performed by a qualified baptized male. For instance, she may need to conduct a meeting for field service because a qualified baptized male is not available or present. ... she would wear a head covering to acknowledge that she is handling the duty normally assigned to a male. On the other hand, many aspects of worship do not call for a sister to wear a head covering. For example, she does not need to do so when commenting at Christian meetings, engaging in the door-to-door ministry with her husband or another baptized male, or studying or praying with her unbaptized children."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 2002, page 27"&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 2002, page 27, "There may be other occasions when no baptized males are present at a congregation meeting.

=== Liberal Catholic ===
Of all the churches in the Liberal Catholic movement, only the original church, the [[Liberal Catholic Church]] under Bishop Graham Wale, does not ordain women. The position held by the Liberal Catholic Church is that the Church, even if it wanted to ordain women, does not have the authority to do so and that it would not be possible for a woman to become a priest even if she went through the ordination ceremony. The reasoning behind this belief is that the female body does not effectively channel the masculine energies of Christ, the true minister of all the sacraments. The priest has to be able to channel Christ's energies to validly confect the sacrament; therefore the sex of the priest is a central part of the ceremony hence all priests must be male. When discussing the sacrament of Holy Orders in his book ''Science of the Sacraments''. Second Presiding Bishop Leadbeater also opined that women could not be ordained; he noted that Christ left no indication that women can become priests and that only Christ can change this arrangement.

=== Orthodox ===
The [[Orthodox Church]] follows a line of reasoning similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church with respect to the ordination of bishops and priests, and does not allow women's ordination to those orders.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/femclrg19.htm |title=Ordination of women In Eastern Orthodoxy, mainline &amp; liberal Protestant denominations, &amp; other religions |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox writers regard deaconesses as having been a "lay" ministry. There are strong reasons for rejecting this view. In the Byzantine rite the liturgical office for the laying-on of hands for the deaconess is exactly parallel to that for the deacon; and so on the principle ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]''—the Church's worshipping practice is a sure indication of its faith—it follows that the deaconesses receives, as does the deacon, a genuine sacramental ordination: not just a ''{{lang|grc|χειροθεσια}}'' (chirothesia) but a ''{{lang|grc|χειροτονια}}'' (chirotonia).}}

On October 8, 2004, the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece voted to permit the appointment of monastic deaconesses, that is, women to minister and assist at the liturgy within their own monasteries, but it made clear that the rite was a χειροτονία (appointment), not a χειροθεσία (ordination).&lt;ref name="google327"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KLIFfmipXcoC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=%22Church+of+Greece%22+deaconesses#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Church%20of%20Greece%22%20deaconesses&amp;f=false |title=John Anthony McGuckin, '&amp;#39;The Orthodox Church'&amp;#39; (John Wiley &amp; Sons 2010 ISBN 978-1-44439383-5), p. 327 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2010-12-09|accessdate=2013-11-12|isbn=9781444393835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vifbVIOkmMkC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=%E2%80%9COrdination+or+Appointment+of+Deaconesses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9COrdination%20or%20Appointment%20of%20Deaconesses%22&amp;f=false |title=Gary Macy et al., '&amp;#39;Women Deacons'&amp;#39; (Paulist Press 2011 ISBN 978-1-61643052-8) |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12|isbn=9781616430528|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phyllis Zagano"&gt;{{cite web |author=Phyllis Zagano |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&amp;textID=3997&amp;issueID=517 |title=America &amp;#124; The National Catholic Weekly - 'Grant Her Your Spirit' |publisher=Americamagazine.org |date=2004-10-08 |accessdate=2010-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618022001/http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?textID=3997&amp;articleTypeID=1&amp;issueID=517 |archivedate=2006-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orthodoxwomen1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orthodoxwomen.org/files/SCOBA_Women_Deacons.pdf |title=Toward a Complete Expression of the Diaconate: Discerning the Ministry Women Deacons |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529000348/http://www.orthodoxwomen.org/files/SCOBA_Women_Deacons.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong monastic tradition, pursued by both men and women in the Orthodox Church, where monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives.

A key [[theology|theological]] doctrine for Reformed and most other [[Protestantism|Protestants]] is the [[priesthood of all believers]]—a doctrine considered by them so important that it has been dubbed by some as "a clarion truth of Scripture".&lt;ref name="hagopian"&gt;Hagopian, David.

Accessed 21 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|This doctrine restores true dignity and true integrity to all believers since it teaches that all believers are priests and that as priests, they are to serve God—no matter what legitimate vocation they pursue. Thus, there is no vocation that is more "sacred" than any other. Because Christ is Lord over all areas of life, and because His word applies to all areas of life, nowhere does His Word even remotely suggest that the ministry is "sacred" while all other vocations are "secular". Scripture knows no sacred-secular distinction. All of life belongs to God. All of life is sacred. All believers are priests.|David Hagopian.

Most Protestant denominations require pastors, ministers, deacons, and elders to be formally ordained. The early Protestant reformer [[Martin Bucer]], for instance, cited Ephesians 4{{bibleref2c|Eph.|4:11–13}} and other Pauline letters in support of this.&lt;ref name="google177"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsTMYVTW2-MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=177%20conviction&amp;f=false |first=Willem van't |last=Spijker |authorlink=Willem van 't Spijker |title=The Ecclesiastical Offices in the Thought of Martin Bucer |publisher=BRILL |date=1996 |page=177 |via=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the process of ordination varies among the denominations and the specific church office to be held, it may require preparatory training such as seminary or Bible college, election by the congregation or appointment by a higher authority, and expectations of a lifestyle that requires a higher standard. For example, the ''Good News Translation'' of {{Bibleref2|James|3:1|GNT}} says, "My friends, not many of you should become teachers. As you know, we teachers will be judged with greater strictness than others.&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqQ0m6LH1UYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Williams ME., '&amp;#39;Immersion Bible Studies &amp;#124; James, 1 &amp; 2 Peter, 1, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude'&amp;#39;, Abingdon Press, 2012 Ch.2 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Protestant denominations, such as the [[Free Will Baptists]], are committed to congregational governance and reserve the power to ordain ministers to local congregations. Because of this, if there is no denomination-wide prohibition on ordaining women, congregations may do so while other congregations of the same denomination might not consider doing likewise. One notable female preacher of the Free Will Baptist denomination was  [[Clarissa Danforth]], who became the pastor of the Free Baptist in Burrillville in 1817, after the death of [[John Colby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chepachetfreewill.org/johncolby.htm|title=John Colby, Preacher of the Gospel|author=Jeff Brooke-Stewart|access-date=2016-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170114/http://www.chepachetfreewill.org/johncolby.htm|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last century an increasing number of denominations have begun ordaining women. The [[Church of England]] appointed female lay readers during the First World War.

The Protestant denominations that refuse to ordain women often do so on the basis of New Testament scriptures that they interpret as prohibiting women from fulfilling church roles that require ordination.&lt;ref name="tolerance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ord_bibl1.htm |title=Female leadership in the Christian Scriptures |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An especially important consideration here is the way [[1 Timothy 2:12 ("I suffer not a woman")|1 Timothy 2:12]] is translated and interpreted in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="tolerance"/&gt; Debate on how to best interpret the 1 Timothy verse is intense and ongoing.

The Church of Denmark became the first Lutheran body to ordain women in 1948. Every body of Lutheranism is free to decide.  Of the three major American synods, being the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS), and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), only the ELCA ordains women.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

{{Main|Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women}}
The teaching of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as emphasised by [[Pope John Paul II]] in the apostolic letter ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'', is "that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgement is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful".&lt;ref name="Vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19940522_ordinatio-sacerdotalis.html |title=Apostolic Letter ORDINATIO SACERDOTALIS |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This teaching is embodied in the current [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] 1024&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3P.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (1992), by the canonical statement: "Only a baptized man ([[Latin]]: ''vir'') validly receives sacred ordination."&lt;ref name="Codex Iruis Canonici' 1024"&gt;''Codex Iruis Canonici'' canon 1024, c.f. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 1577&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as priestly and episcopal ordination are concerned, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that this requirement is a matter of divine law; it belongs to the deposit of faith and is unchangeable.&lt;ref name="Inter Insigniores 1976"&gt;"The Catholic Church has never felt that priestly or episcopal ordination can be validly conferred on women", ''Inter Insigniores'', October 15, 1976, section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ewtn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfinsig.htm |title=The Role Of Women In Modern Society And The Church |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In English"&gt;Cf.

An official Papal Commission ordered by [[Pope Francis]] in 2016 is charged with determining whether the ancient practice of having female deacons ([[deaconess]]es) is possible, provided they are non-ordained and that certain reserved functions of ordained male permanent or transitional deacons – proclaiming the Gospel at Mass, giving a homily, and performing non-emergency baptisms – would not be permitted for the discussed female diaconate.

====Mariavites====
Inspired by a mystically inclined nun, [[Feliksa Kozłowska]], the [[Mariavite]] movement originally began as a response to the perceived corruption of the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Russian Partition]] of 19th century Poland. The Mariavites, so named for their devotion to the Virgin Mary, attracted numerous parishes across [[Mazovia]] and the region around [[Łódź]] and at their height numbered some 300,000 people. Fearing a [[schism]], the established church authorities asked for intervention from the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. The Mariavites were eventually excommunicated by [[Papal Bull]] in 1905 and 1906. Their clergy, cut loose from [[apostolic succession]], found sanctuary with the [[Old Catholic Church]] and in 1909 the first Mariavite bishop, [[Jan Maria Michał Kowalski|Michael Kowalski]], was consecrated in Utrecht. Twenty years later, the now constituted [[Mariavite Church]] was riven by policy differences and a leadership struggle. Nevertheless, Archbishop Kowalski ordained the first 12 nuns as priests in 1929. He also introduced priestly marriage. The split in the church took effect, in part, over the place of the feminine in theology and the role of women in the life of the church. By 1935, Kowalski had introduced a "universal priesthood" that extended the priestly office to selected members of the laity. The two Mariavite churches survive to this day. The successors of Kowalski, who are known as the [[Catholic Mariavite Church]] and are based in the town of [[Felicjanów, Płock County|Felicjanów]] in the [[Płock]] region of Poland, are headed by a bishop who is a woman, although their numbers are dwarfed by the adherents of the more conventionally patriarchal Mariavites of Płock.&lt;ref&gt;Peterkiewicz Jerzy, ''The Third Adam'', London 1975, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192121981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1657, [[Mary Howgill]], one of the [[Valiant Sixty]] (an early group of Quaker preachers), rebuked Oliver Cromwell for persecuting Quakers, saying, "When thou givest account of all those actions, which have been acted by thee, ... as my soul lives, these things will be laid to thy charge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perceptions of a Monarchy Without a King: Reactions to Oliver Cromwell's Power|author= Benjamin Woodford|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1704, [[Esther Palmer]] of Flushing, Long Island, and [[Susanna Freeborn]] of Newport, Rhode Island, set out on a 3,230 mile journey across eight colonies of North America, including visits to preach in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.

Other well-known Quaker women preachers were [[Mary Lawson (Quaker)|Mary Lawson]] of Philadelphia, [[Mary Bannister]] of London, England, [[Mary Ellerton]] of York, England, [[Rachel Wilson (Quaker)|Rachel Wilson]] of Virginia, [[Catharine Payton]] of Pennsylvania, [[Ann Moore (Quaker)|Ann Moore]] of New York, [[Susanna Hatton]] of Delaware, and [[Mary Dyer]] of Boston.&lt;ref name="daughters"/&gt;

=== Seventh-day Adventist ===
According to its Working Policy the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] restricts certain positions of service and responsibility to those who have been ordained to the gospel ministry and the General Conference (GC) session, which is the highest decision-making body of the church, has never approved the ordination of women as ministers. Adventists have found no clear mandate or precedent for the practice of ordaining women in Scripture or in the writings of Ellen G. White. In recent years the ordination of women has been the subject of heated debate, especially in North America and Europe. In the Adventist church, candidates for ordination are recommended by local conferences (which usually administer about 50–150 local congregations) and approved by unions (which serve about 6–12 conferences). The church's Fundamental Beliefs and its worldwide practice as set forth in its Church Manual, including the worldwide qualifications for ordination currently restricted to men, can be revised only at the GC session.

In 1990 the GC session voted against a move to establish a worldwide policy permitting the ordination of women.&lt;ref name="astr"&gt;{{cite web | title =GC Session Actions | work =Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research | publisher =General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists | url =http://www.adventistarchives.org/gc-session-actions#.Ul38q1CbNyV | accessdate = 2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 GC delegates voted not to authorize any of the 13 world divisions to establish policies for ordaining women within its territory.&lt;ref name="astr"/&gt; In 2011, the North American Division ignored the GC policy and without GC approval, voted to permit women to serve as conference presidents, a position requiring ordination. In early 2012, the GC responded to the NAD action with an analysis of church history and policy, demonstrating that divisions do not have the authority to establish policy different from GC policy.&lt;ref name="session.adventistfaith.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The GC and its Division|url= http://session.adventistfaith.org|website=session.adventisfaith.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NAD subsequently rescinded its action. But in their analysis the GC indicated that the "final responsibility and authority" for approving candidates for ordination resides at the union level. This led to decisions by several unions to approve ordinations without regard to gender.

On April 23, 2012, the North German Union voted to ordain women as ministers,&lt;ref name="adventist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eud.adventist.org/news/detail/date/2012/05/09/north-german-union-conference-constituency-session-votes-to-ordain-women/ |title=North German Union Conference Constituency Session Votes to Ordain Women: Inter-European Division - Seventh-Day Adventist Church |publisher=Eud.adventist.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by late 2013 had not yet ordained a woman. On July 29, 2012, the Columbia Union Conference voted to "authorize ordination without respect to gender".&lt;ref name="spectrummagazine1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Women's Ordination Approved in CUC, Spectrum Magazine|url=http://spectrummagazine.org/blog/2012/07/29/report-womens-ordination-approved-cuc|publisher=[[Spectrum (magazine)|Spectrum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 2012, the Pacific Union Conference also voted to ordain without regard to gender.&lt;ref name="adventistfaith1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Delegates to the special constituency session vote to approve ordinations without regard to gender|url=http://pacificunionrecorder.adventistfaith.org/issue/68/16/1248|publisher=Pacific Union Recorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both unions began immediately approving ordinations of women.&lt;ref name="adventistfaith2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Executive Committee Approves 14 Women and Two Men for Ordination|publisher=Pacific Union Recorder|url=http://pacificunionrecorder.adventistfaith.org/issue/69/16/1276}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2013, about 25 women had been ordained to the ministry in the Pacific Union Conference, plus several in the Columbia Union. On May 12, 2013, the Danish Union voted to treat men and women ministers the same, and to suspend all ordinations until after the topic is considered at the next GC session in 2015. On May 30, 2013, the Netherlands Union voted to ordain female pastors, recognizing them as equal to their male colleagues.&lt;ref name="adventist2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventist.nl/2013/07/06/netherlands-union-conference-votes-to-ordain-female-pastors/ |title=Netherlands Union Conference Votes to Ordain Female Pastors &amp;#124; Kerkgenootschap der Zevende-dags Adventisten |publisher=Adventist.nl |date=2013-09-22 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2013, a woman was ordained in the Netherlands Union.&lt;ref name="spectrummagazine2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Netherlands Ordains First Woman Pastor in Europe|url=http://spectrummagazine.org/blog/2013/09/22/netherlands-ordains-first-woman-pastor-europe|publisher=[[Spectrum (magazine)|Spectrum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012–2013 the General Conference established the Theology of Ordination Study Committee, which included representatives from each of its 13 world division biblical research committees, to study the issue and make a recommendation to be voted at the 2015 world GC session.&lt;ref name="adventistarchives.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Theology of Ordination Study Committee|url=http://www.adventistarchives.org/about-tosc#.UifKprx6_XY|publisher=General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By a margin of 1,381 to 977, with five abstentions, delegates by secret ballot ended a five-year study process characterized by open, vigorous and sometimes acrimonious debate.&lt;ref name="adventist3"&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/en/all-news/news/go/2015-07-08/delegates-vote-no-on-issue-of-womens-ordination/ "Delegates Vote 'No' on Issue of Women’s Ordination"]. ''Adventist News Network'' (July 8, 2015). Retrieved on July 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the GC vote, dozens of delegates voiced opinions for and against the question: "After your prayerful study on ordination from the Bible, the writings of Ellen G. White, and the reports of the study commissions; and after your careful consideration of what is best for the church and the fulfillment of its mission, is it acceptable for division executive committees, as they may deem it appropriate in their territories, to make provision for the ordination of women to the gospel ministry?"&lt;ref name="adventist3"/&gt;

The vote and discussion, which reflected decades long differences of opinion, came at a General Conference Session which is held to decide major issues.

As Protestant Christians who accept the Bible as their only rule of faith and practice, Seventh-day Adventists have been keen to resolve the issue based on Scripture (e.g. 1 Timothy 2:12 and Galatians 3:28).

{{Main|Women as imams|Women in Islam}}

Although [[Islam|Muslims]] do not formally ordain religious leaders, the [[imam]] serves as a spiritual leader and religious authority. There is a current controversy among Muslims on the circumstances in which [[women]] may act as imams—that is, lead a congregation in [[salat]] (prayer). Three of the four [[Sunni]] schools, as well as many [[Shia]], agree that a woman may lead a congregation consisting of women alone in prayer, although the [[Maliki]] school does not allow this. According to all currently existing traditional schools of [[Islam]], a woman cannot lead a mixed gender congregation in salat (prayer). Some schools make exceptions for [[Tarawih]] (optional [[Ramadan]] prayers) or for a congregation consisting only of close relatives. Certain medieval scholars—including [[Al-Tabari]] (838–932), [[Abu Thawr]] (764–854), [[Al-Muzani]] (791–878), and [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240)—considered the practice permissible at least for optional (nafila) prayers; however, their views are not accepted by any major surviving group. [[Islamic feminist]]s have begun to protest this.

[[Women's mosques]], called nusi, and female imams have existed since the 19th century in China and continue today.&lt;ref name="chinaimams"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/aug/26/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1|title=Women imams of China|author=Bruno Philip|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Amina Wadud]], (an Islamic studies professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, born in the United States), became the first woman in South Africa to deliver the jum'ah khutbah (Friday sermon), which she did at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/first-woman-to-lead-muslim-prayers-angers-traditionalists-964308.html |title=First woman to lead Muslim prayers angers traditionalists |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2010-11-19 |location=London |first=Amol |last=Rajan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 20-year-old Maryam Mirza delivered the second half of the ''[[Eid al-Fitr]]'' khutbah at the Etobicoke mosque in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, run by the [[United Muslim Association]].&lt;ref name="First Muslim woman delivers sermon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041116/world.htm |title=First Muslim woman delivers sermon |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, in Canada, Yasmin Shadeer led the night 'Isha prayer for a mixed-gender (men as well as women praying and hearing the sermon) congregation.&lt;ref name="enc.slider.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Women_as_imams |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202210556/http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Women_as_imams |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-02 |title=Women as imams |publisher=Enc.slider.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first recorded occasion in modern times where a woman led a congregation in prayer in a mosque.&lt;ref name="enc.slider.com"/&gt;

On March 18, 2005, [[Amina Wadud]] gave a sermon and led Friday prayers for a Muslim congregation consisting of men as well as women, with no curtain dividing the men and women.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/19/nyregion/19muslim.html|title=With Women at the Forefront, a Muslim Service Challenges Tradition|date=19 March 2005|work=The New York Times|via=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another woman, Suheyla El-Attar, sounded the call to prayer while not wearing a headscarf at that same event.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; This was done in the Synod House of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York after mosques refused to host the event.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; This was the first known time that a woman had led a mixed-gender Muslim congregation in prayer in American history.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In April 2005, [[Raheel Raza]], born in Pakistan, led Toronto's first woman-led mixed-gender Friday prayer service, delivering the sermon and leading the prayers of the mixed-gender congregation organized by the Muslim Canadian Congress to celebrate Earth Day in the backyard of the downtown Toronto home of activist Tarek Fatah.&lt;ref name="muslimcanadiancongress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/20050423.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231214027/http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/20050423.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-12-31 |title=Woman leads mixed-gender prayers for city Muslims |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2005, Pamela Taylor, a Muslim convert since 1986, became the first woman to lead Friday prayers in a Canadian mosque, and did so for a congregation of both men and women.&lt;ref name="pluralism.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pluralism.org/reports/view/111 |title=The Woman-Led Prayer that Catalyzed Controversy |publisher=Pluralism.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela Taylor is an American convert to Islam and co-chair of the New York-based Progressive Muslim Union.&lt;ref name="pluralism.org"/&gt; In addition to leading the prayers, Taylor also gave a sermon on the importance of equality among people regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation and disability.&lt;ref name="pluralism.org"/&gt;

However, in the fall of 2015 [[Rabbinical Council of America]] passed a resolution which states, "RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution."&lt;ref name="Jta.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/11/01/news-opinion/united-states/rabbinical-council-of-america-officially-bans-ordination-and-hiring-of-women-rabbis |title=Rabbinical Council of America officially bans ordination and hiring of women rabbis &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the fall of 2015 [[Agudath Israel of America]] denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring [[Yeshivat Maharat]], [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], [[Open Orthodoxy]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref name="Hamodia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2015/11/03/moetzes-open-orthodoxy-not-a-form-of-torah-judaism/|title=Moetzes: ‘Open Orthodoxy’ Not a Form of Torah Judaism|work=Hamodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Breach-in-US-Orthodox-Judaism-grows-as-haredi-body-rejects-Open-Orthodoxy-institutions-431929|title=Breach in US Orthodox Judaism grows as haredi body rejects ‘Open Orthodoxy’ institutions|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Josh Nathan-Kazis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323887/agudath-rabbis-declare-war-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Avi Weiss Defends 'Open Orthodoxy' as Agudah Rabbis Declare War|author=Josh Nathan-Kazis|date=3 November 2015|work=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only men can become [[Hazzan|cantors]] (also called hazzans) in Orthodox Judaism, but all other types of Judaism allow and have female cantors.&lt;ref name="The Cantor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml |title=The Cantor |publisher=Myjewishlearning.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955 [[Betty Robbins]], born in Greece, became the world's first female cantor when she was appointed cantor of the Reform congregation of Temple Avodah in Oceanside, New York, in July.&lt;ref name="Betty Robbins 1924–2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/robbins-betty |title=Betty Robbins 1924–2004 |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ryukyuan religion ==
The [[Ryukyuan religion|indigenous religion of the Ryukyuan Islands]] in Japan is led by female priests; this makes it the only known official mainstream religion of a society led by women.&lt;ref name="Susan Sered 1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Susan Sered |coauthors= |title=Women of the Sacred Groves: Divine Priestesses of Okinawa |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote= | url= |isbn=0-19-512486-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shinto ==
[[File:Yasaka-jinja 01.jpg|thumb|[[Shinto]] priest and priestess.]]

In [[Shintoism]], ''[[Saiin (priestess)|Saiin]]'' (斎院, saiin?) were unmarried female relatives of the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]] who served as high priestesses at [[Ise Grand Shrine]] from the late 7th century until the 14th century. Ise Grand Shrine is a Shinto shrine dedicated to the goddess [[Amaterasu|Amaterasu-ōmikami]]. ''Saiin'' priestesses were usually elected from royalty (内親王, ''naishinnō'') such as princesses (女王, ''joō''). In principle, ''Saiin'' remained unmarried, but there were exceptions. Some ''Saiin'' became consorts of the Emperor, called Nyōgo in Japanese. According to the [[Man'yōshū]] (The Anthology of Ten Thousand Leaves), the first ''Saiō'' to serve at Ise Grand Shrine was [[Princess Ōku]], daughter of [[Emperor Tenmu]], during the [[Asuka period]] of Japanese history.

The ordination of women as Shinto priests arose again after the abolition of [[State Shinto]] in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;ref name="Eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=750 |title=Encyclopedia of Shinto—Home : Shrine Rituals : Gyōji sahō |publisher=Eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Miko]].

== Sikhism ==
[[Sikhism]] does not have priests, which were abolished by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], as the guru had seen that institution become corrupt in society during his time. Instead, he appointed the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the Sikh holy book, as his successor as Guru instead of a possibly fallible human. Due to the faith's belief in complete equality, women can participate in any religious function, perform any Sikh ceremony or lead the congregation in prayer.&lt;ref name="Sandeep Singh Brar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhs.org/summary.htm |title=The Sikhism Home Page:Introduction to Sikhism |publisher=Sandeep Singh Brar |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sikh woman has the right to become a ''[[Granthi]]'', ''[[Ragi (Sikhism)|Ragi]]'', and one of the ''[[Panj Piare]]'' (5 beloved) and both men and women are considered capable of reaching the highest levels of spirituality.&lt;ref name="Rights of a Sikh Woman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhwomen.com/equality/womansrights.htm |title=Rights of a Sikh Woman |publisher=SikhWomen.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wicca ==
In [[Wicca]], as many women are ordained as men. Although, many traditions elevate the importance of women than men and are frequently leaders of the coven. Members are typically considered Priests and Priestesses when they are given the rite of Initiation within the coven, though some may choose to undergo additional training to become High Priestess who often has the final say in matters and who may choose who can be her High Priest. Some, who have gone through enough experience, may leave to create their own coven.&lt;ref name="Dianic Wiccan Clergy Priestess"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dianic-wicca.com/dianic-wicca-clergy.html |title=Dianic Wiccan Clergy Priestess |publisher=Dianic-wicca.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126173531/http://dianic-wicca.com/dianic-wicca-clergy.html |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About the Temple of Ara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeofara.org/about.htm |title=About the Temple of Ara |publisher=Templeofara.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819003853/http://www.templeofara.org/about.htm |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Avalonian Tradition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&amp;c=trads&amp;id=4637 |title=The Avalonian Tradition |publisher=Witchvox.com |date=2002-08-23 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Osunshrine.jpg|thumb|left|Yeye Siju Osunyemi being initiated as a priestess of the deity [[Oshun]] in the Osun Shrine in Osogbo, Nigeria.]]

The Yoruba people of western Nigeria practice an [[Yoruba religion|indigenous religion]] with a religious hierarchy of priests and priestesses that dates to 800-1000 CE. [[Ifá]] [[Oracle]] priests and priestesses bear the titles ''[[Babalawo]]''   and ''[[Iyanifa]]'' respectively.&lt;ref name="Kete 335"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kete|first=Molefi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;dq=babalawo+iyanifa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y2g_TJTWBISdlgewzdnBBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE0Q6wEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=babalawo%20iyanifa&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African religion, Volume 1|page=335|isbn= 978-1412936361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priests and priestesses of the varied ''[[Orisa|Orisha]]'', when not already bearing the higher ranked oracular titles mentioned above, are referred to as ''babalorisa'' when male and ''iyalorisa'' when female.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mariko Namba Walter|author2=Eva Jane Neumann Fridman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8waCmzjiD4C&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq=babalorisha+iyalorisha+orisha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hF6sfW1-I6&amp;sig=rYBDMA7-BHnUEzoMxohhoPMg3qA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A2o_TJ-sOYaglAen_7z9Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=babalorisha%20iyalorisha%20orisha&amp;f=false|title=Shamanism: an encyclopedia of world beliefs, practices, and culture, Volume 2|page=451|isbn=978-1576076453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiates are also given an Orisa or Ifá name that signifies under which deity they are initiated; for example a priestess of [[Oshun]] may be named ''Osunyemi'' and a priest of ''Ifá'' may be named ''Ifáyemi''.

The '''Paratharia''' are a gotra of the [[Ahir]] [[caste]] found in the [[Kutch District]] of [[Gujarat]] state in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 56 to 60 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The community is believed to have derived its name from the Parathar region, their original homeland. According to their traditions, they migrated from [[Mathura]] along with [[Krishna]] to the Parathar region of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. The Paratharia then migrated to [[Kutch]] about four to five hundred years ago. They are now distributed in eighty four villages in [[Kutch District]], out of which thirty four are in [[Bhuj]] [[taluka]], twenty four [[Anjar, India|Anjar]] [[talukas]] and twelve villages in Nakathrana. A few are also found in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. The Paratharia Ahir has a distinct [[Dialect]] (Language), Which is more like Hindi and Gujarati. The language is specific to Parathariya Ahir only. Other Ahir like Machoya, Boricha etc. in Gujarati Speaks Gujarati.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 56 to 60 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==
The Paratharia community consist of a number of clans, the main ones being the Batta, Jatiya, Kerasiya, Chad, Chhanga, Gagal, Dheela, Dangar, Mata and Varchand. Each of the clans are of equal status and intermarry. Like neighboring [[Hindu]] communities, the community practice clan exogamy.  The Paratharia are a community of small and medium-sized farmers. Milk selling is an important subsidiary of the community. A small number are now petty businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 61 to 65 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollution''' is the introduction of [[contaminant]]s into the natural environment that cause adverse change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pollution |title=Pollution - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution can take the form of [[chemical substance]]s or [[energy]], such as noise, heat or light. [[Pollutant]]s, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as [[point source pollution|point source]] or [[nonpoint source pollution]].
In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-killed-9-million-people-2015|title=Pollution killed 9 million people in 2015|first=Laura|last=Beil|date=15 November 2017|website=Sciencenews.org|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrington"/&gt;

Major forms of pollution include: [[Air pollution]], [[light pollution]], [[littering]], [[noise pollution]], [[plastic pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[thermal pollution]], [[visual pollution]], [[water pollution]].

==History==
[[Air pollution]] has always accompanied civilizations. Pollution started from [[prehistoric times]], when man created the first fires. According to a 1983 article in the journal ''Science,'' "[[soot]]" found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spengler |first=John D. |last2=Sexton |first2=K. A. |year=1983 |title=Indoor Air Pollution: A Public Health Perspective |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=221 |issue=4605 |pages=9–17 [p. 9] |doi=10.1126/science.6857273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal [[forging]] appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. Core samples of [[List of glaciers in Greenland|glaciers in Greenland]] indicate increases in pollution associated with Greek, Roman, and Chinese metal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hong |first=Sungmin |year=1996 |title=History of Ancient Copper Smelting Pollution During Roman and Medieval Times Recorded in Greenland Ice |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=272 |issue=5259 |pages=246–249 [p. 248] |doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.246 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban pollution==
[[File:DARK CLOUDS OF FACTORY SMOKE OBSCURE CLARK AVENUE BRIDGE - NARA - 550179.jpg|thumb|Air pollution in the US, 1973]]
The burning of coal and wood, and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the primary sources of pollution. The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and [[waste]]s into local streams that served as the water supply. [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] of England banned the burning of [[Sea coal|sea-coal]] by proclamation in [[London]] in 1272, after its smoke became a problem;&lt;ref name="Pea-souper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/londons-historic-pea-soupers|title=London's Historic "Pea-Soupers"|accessdate=2006-08-02|author=David Urbinato|date=Summer 1994|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadly"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/science/smog.html|title=Deadly Smog|accessdate=2006-08-02|authorlink= |date=2003-01-17|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the [[wheelbarrow]].

It was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. London also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of [[water quality]] problems with the [[Great Stink]] on the [[River Thames|Thames]] of 1858, which led to construction of the [[London sewerage system]] soon afterward. Pollution issues escalated as [[population growth]] far exceeded viability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. Reformers began to demand sewer systems and clean water.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Jackson, ''Dirty Old London: The Victorian Fight Against Filth'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the sanitary conditions in [[Berlin]] were among the worst in Europe.  [[August Bebel]] recalled conditions before a modern [[sewerage|sewer]] system was built in the late 1870s:
:"Waste-water from the houses collected in the gutters running alongside the curbs and emitted a truly fearsome smell. There were no public toilets in the streets or squares. Visitors, especially women, often became desperate when nature called. In the public buildings the sanitary facilities were unbelievably primitive....As a metropolis, Berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after 1870."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in David Clay Large, ''Berlin'' (2000) pp 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital, and the [[Imperial Germany|Imperial German]] government brought in its scientists, engineers, and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies, but to forge Berlin as the world's model city.  A British expert in 1906 concluded that Berlin represented "the most complete application of science, order and method of public life," adding "it is a marvel of civic administration, the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nKcLszEKdUC&amp;pg=PA786|year=1910|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 11th edition|page=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal gave rise to unprecedented [[air pollution]] and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. [[Chicago]] and [[Cincinnati]] were the first two American cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881. Pollution became a major issue in the United States in the early twentieth century, as [[Progressive Era|progressive reformers]] took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning, water pollution caused by bad sanitation, and street pollution caused by the 3 million horses who worked in American cities in 1900, generating large quantities of urine and [[manure]]. As historian Martin Melosi notes, The generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as "miracles of cleanliness.".&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt, ''A Climate of Crisis: America in the Age of Environmentalism'' (2014)  p 206&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, however, automobile-caused [[smog]] was a major issue in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffry M. Diefendorf|author2=Kurkpatrick Dorsey|title=City, Country, Empire: Landscapes in Environmental History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeVqitbSP_AC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2009|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh Press]]|pages=44–49|isbn=9780822972778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century, when the short lived Office of Air Pollution was created under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. Extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of Los Angeles and [[Donora, Pennsylvania]] in the late 1940s, serving as another public reminder.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/|title=History of the Clean Air Act|accessdate=2006-02-14|first1=James R. |last1=Fleming|first2=Bethany R.| last2=Knorr |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air pollution would continue to be a problem in England, especially later during the industrial revolution, and extending into the recent past with the [[Great Smog of 1952]]. Awareness of atmospheric  pollution spread widely after World War II, with fears triggered by reports of radioactive fallout from atomic warfare and testing.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt, ''A Climate of Crisis: America in the Age of Environmentalism'' (2014)  pp 15-21&lt;/ref&gt; Then a non-nuclear event—the [[Great Smog]] of 1952 in London—killed at least 4000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/9/newsid_4506000/4506390.stm 1952: London fog clears after days of chaos] (BBC News)&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted some of the first major modern environmental legislation: the [[Clean Air Act 1956|Clean Air Act of 1956]].

Pollution began to draw major public attention in the United States between the mid-1950s and early 1970s, when Congress passed the [[Noise Control Act]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/|title=Environmental Issues|accessdate=2011-12-10|author=John Tarantino|authorlink=|publisher=The Environmental Blog|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111153436/http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/|archivedate=2012-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Air-pollution-taiwan.JPG|thumb|Smog Pollution in [[Taiwan]]]]

Severe incidents of pollution helped increase consciousness. [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] dumping in the [[Hudson River]] resulted in a ban by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] on consumption of its fish in 1974. National news stories in the late 1970s—especially the long-term [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination at [[Love Canal]] starting in 1947 and uncontrolled [[Waste disposal|dumping]] in [[Valley of the Drums]]—led to the [[Superfund (environmental law)|Superfund]] legislation of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Judith A. Layzer, "Love Canal: hazardous waste and politics of fear" in Layzer, ''The Environmental Case'' ([[CQ Press]], 2012) pp: 56-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name [[brownfield]], a term now common in [[city planning]].

The development of nuclear science introduced [[radioactive contamination]], which can remain lethally radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. [[Lake Karachay]]—named by the [[Worldwatch Institute]] as the "most polluted spot" on earth—served as a disposal site for the [[Soviet Union]] throughout the 1950s and 1960s. [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], Russia, is considered the "Most polluted place on the planet".&lt;ref name="Lenssen"&gt;Lenssen, "Nuclear Waste: The Problem that Won't Go Away", Worldwatch Institute, Washington, D.C., 1991: 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear weapons]] continued to be tested in the [[Cold War]], especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by [[radioactivity]] has also been a prohibitive complication associated with [[nuclear power]]. Though extreme care is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] and [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Sharon M. | year = 2011 | title = Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima: An analysis of traditional and new media coverage of nuclear accidents and radiation | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | volume = 67 | issue = 5| pages = 55–65 | doi=10.1177/0096340211421587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread support for [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|test ban treaties]] has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Medalia, ''Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: Background and Current Developments'' (DIANE Publishing, 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt;

International catastrophes such as the wreck of the [[Amoco Cadiz]] oil tanker off the coast of [[Brittany]] in 1978 and the [[Bhopal disaster]] in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of [[global warming]]. Most recently the term [[persistent organic pollutant]] (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as [[PBDE]]s and [[Fluorocarbon|PFCs]] among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and [[bioaccumulation]] after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.

A much more recently discovered problem is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]], a huge concentration of plastics, [[chemical sludge]] and other [[debris]] which has been collected into a large area of the Pacific Ocean by the [[North Pacific Gyre]]. This is a less well known pollution problem than the others described above, but nonetheless has multiple and serious consequences such as increasing wildlife mortality, the spread of invasive species and human ingestion of toxic chemicals. Organizations such as [[5 Gyres]] have researched the pollution and, along with artists like [[Marina DeBris]], are working toward publicizing the issue.

Pollution introduced by light at night is becoming a global problem, more severe in urban centres, but nonetheless contaminating also large territories, far away from towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falchi|first=Fabio|last2=Cinzano|first2=Pierantonio|last3=Duriscoe|first3=Dan|last4=Kyba|first4=Christopher C. M.|last5=Elvidge|first5=Christopher D.|last6=Baugh|first6=Kimberly|last7=Portnov|first7=Boris A.|last8=Rybnikova|first8=Nataliya A.|last9=Furgoni|first9=Riccardo|date=2016-06-01|title=The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377|journal=[[Science Advances]]|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=e1600377|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1600377|issn=2375-2548|pmid=27386582|pmc=4928945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to [[environmentalism]] and the [[environmental movement]], which generally seek to limit [[human impact on the environment]].

==Forms of pollution==
[[File:Canal-pollution.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Lachine Canal]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.]]
[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage.]]

The major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular [[contaminant]] relevant to each of them:
* [[Air pollution]]: the release of chemicals and [[particulates]] into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) and [[nitrogen oxide]]s produced by [[industry]] and motor vehicles. Photochemical [[ozone]] and [[smog]] are created as nitrogen oxides and [[hydrocarbon]]s react to sunlight. [[Atmospheric particulate matter|Particulate matter]], or fine dust is characterized by their [[micrometre]] size PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;.
* [[Light pollution]]: includes light trespass, [[over-illumination]] and [[astronomical]] interference.
* [[Littering]]: the criminal throwing of inappropriate man-made objects, unremoved, onto public and private properties.
* [[Noise pollution]]: which encompasses [[roadway noise]], [[aircraft noise]], [[industrial noise]] as well as high-intensity [[sonar]].
* [[Plastic pollution]]: involves the accumulation of plastic products and [[microplastics]] in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans.
* [[Soil contamination]] occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. Among the most significant [[soil contaminant]]s are [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metals]], [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|MTBE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/mtbe/water.htm#concerns Concerns about MTBE] from [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA]] website&lt;/ref&gt; [[herbicides]], [[pesticides]] and [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]].
* [[Radioactive contamination]], resulting from 20th century activities in [[atomic physics]], such as nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons research, manufacture and deployment. (See [[alpha emitter]]s and [[actinides in the environment]].)
* [[Thermal pollution]], is a [[temperature]] change in natural water bodies caused by human influence, such as use of water as coolant in a power plant.
* [[Visual pollution]], which can refer to the presence of overhead [[electric power transmission|power lines]], motorway [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]], scarred [[landform]]s (as from [[strip mining]]), open storage of trash, [[municipal solid waste]] or [[space debris]].
* {{Anchor|Water pollution}}[[Water pollution]], by the discharge of [[wastewater]] from commercial and [[industrial waste]] (intentionally or through spills) into [[surface water]]s; discharges of untreated domestic [[sewage]], and chemical contaminants, such as [[chlorine]], from treated sewage; release of [[waste]] and contaminants into [[surface runoff]] flowing to surface waters (including [[urban runoff]] and agricultural runoff, which may contain chemical [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]]; also including [[human feces]] from [[open defecation]] - still a major problem in many [[Developing country|developing countries]]); [[groundwater pollution]] from [[waste disposal]] and leaching into the ground, including from [[pit latrine]]s and [[septic tanks]]; [[eutrophication]] and littering.

==Pollutants==
{{Main|Pollutant}}
A pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air, water, or soil. Three factors determine the severity of a pollutant: its chemical nature, the concentration and the persistence.

==Cost of pollution==
Pollution has a cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/01/29/the-staggering-economic-cost-of-air-pollution/ The staggering economic cost of air pollution] By Chelsea Harvey, ''Washington Post'', January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081112124418.htm Freshwater Pollution Costs US At Least $4.3 Billion A Year], ''[[Science Daily]]'', November 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/30/the-human-cost-of-chinas-untold-soil-pollution-problem The human cost of China's untold soil pollution problem], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  Monday 30 June 2014 11.53 EDT&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing activities that cause [[air pollution]] impose health and clean-up costs on the whole of society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own homes. A manufacturing activity that causes air pollution is an example of a negative [[externality]] in production. A negative externality in production occurs “when a firm’s production reduces the well-being of others who are not compensated by the firm."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/819816787|title=Public finance and public policy|last=Jonathan.|first=Gruber,|date=2013|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429278454|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=819816787}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a laundry firm exists near a polluting steel manufacturing firm, there will be increased costs for the laundry firm because of the dirt and smoke produced by the steel manufacturing firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/495996799|title=Environmental economics|last=D.|first=Kolstad, Charles|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0199732647|edition= 2nd|location=New York|oclc=495996799}}&lt;/ref&gt; If external costs exist, such as those created by pollution, the manufacturer will choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the manufacturer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of [[externalization]] is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in [[public safety]], less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others. However, goods and services that involve negative externalities in production, such as those that produce pollution, tend to be over-produced and underpriced since the externality is not being priced into the market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pollution can also create costs for the firms producing the pollution. Sometimes firms choose, or are forced by regulation, to reduce the amount of pollution that they are producing. The associated costs of doing this are called abatement costs, or [[marginal abatement cost]]s if measured by each additional unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/Environmental/pollution-control-revised/Abatement-MAC.html|title=EconPort - Abatement and Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC)|website=www.econport.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 pollution abatement capital expenditures and operating costs in the US amounted to nearly $27 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/pollution-abatement-costs-and-expenditures-2005-survey|title=Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures: 2005 Survey {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OA,OP,NCEE|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socially optimal level of pollution ==
Society derives some indirect [[utility]] from pollution, otherwise there would be no incentive to pollute. This utility comes from the consumption of goods and services that create pollution. Therefore, it is important that policymakers attempt to balance these indirect benefits with the costs of pollution in order to achieve an efficient outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/18-1-maximizing-the-net-benefits-of-pollution/|title=18.1 Maximizing the Net Benefits of Pollution {{!}} Principles of Economics|website=open.lib.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pollution- A Negative Externality in Production.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A visual comparison of the free market and socially optimal outcomes.]]
It is possible to use [[environmental economics]] to determine which level of pollution is deemed the social optimum. For economists, pollution is an “external cost and occurs only when one or more individuals suffer a loss of welfare,” however, there exists a socially optimal level of pollution at which [[welfare]] is maximized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20170416|title=Economics of natural resources and the environment|last=William)|first=Pearce, David W. (David|date=1990|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|others=Turner, R. Kerry.|isbn=9780801839870|location=Baltimore|oclc=20170416}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because consumers derive utility from the good or service manufactured, which will outweigh the [[social cost]] of pollution until a certain point. At this point the damage of one extra unit of pollution to society, the [[marginal cost]] of pollution, is exactly equal to the [[marginal benefit]] of consuming one more unit of the good or service.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/796082268|title=Microeconomics|last=R.|first=Krugman, Paul|date=2013|publisher=Worth Publishers|others=Wells, Robin.|isbn=978-1429283427|edition= 3rd|location=New York, NY|oclc=796082268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In markets with pollution, or other negative externalities in production, the [[free market]] equilibrium will not account for the costs of pollution on society'''.''' If the social costs of pollution are higher than the private costs incurred by the firm, then the true supply curve will be higher. The point at which the social marginal cost and market [[demand]] intersect gives the socially optimal level of pollution. At this point, the quantity will be lower and the price will be higher in comparison to the free market equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the free market outcome could be considered a [[market failure]] because it “does not maximize efficiency”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This model can be used as a basis to evaluate different methods of internalizing the externality. Some examples include [[tariff]]s, a [[carbon tax]] and [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] systems.

==Sources and causes==
[[File:Ship Tracks Reveal Pollution's Effects on Clouds.ogv|thumb|left|Air pollution produced by ships may alter clouds, affecting global temperatures.]]
Air pollution comes from both natural and human-made (anthropogenic) sources. However, globally human-made pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motor vehicle emissions]] are one of the leading causes of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/environment/ems/epr2001/awareness.htm Environmental Performance Report 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112065500/http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/environment/ems/epr2001/awareness.htm |date=2007-11-12 }} (Transport, [[Canada]] website page)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2006/publications/drs/atmosphere/issue/188/index.html State of the Environment, Issue: Air Quality] ([[Australia]]n Government website page)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/pollution.htm|title=Pollution|date=11 April 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411002000/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/pollution.htm|archivedate=11 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air pollution in China|China]], [[Air pollution in the United States|United States]], [[Air pollution in Russia|Russia]], [[Air pollution in India|India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_tp20.html|title=Top 20 Emitting Countries by Total Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions for 2009|first=Oak Ridge National|last=Laboratory|website=Cdiac.ornl.gov|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air pollution in Mexico|Mexico]], and [[Air pollution in Japan|Japan]] are the world leaders in air pollution emissions.

In February 2007, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing the work of 2,500 scientists, economists, and policymakers from more than 120 countries, said that humans have been the primary cause of global warming since 1950. Humans have ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the consequences of global warming, a major climate report concluded. But to change the climate, the transition from fossil fuels like coal and oil needs to occur within decades, according to the final report this year from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070504-global-warming.html |title=Global Warming Can Be Stopped, World Climate Experts Say |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more common [[soil]] contaminants are [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]]s (CFH), [[heavy metals]] (such as [[chromium]], [[cadmium]]–found in rechargeable [[Nickel-cadmium battery|batteries]], and [[lead]]–found in lead [[paint]], [[aviation fuel]] and still in some countries, [[gasoline]]), [[MTBE]], [[zinc]], [[arsenic]] and [[benzene]]. In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called ''[[Fateful Harvest]]'' unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal [[landfill]]s are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]], commonly called ''dioxins'' for simplicity, such as [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, Milton R. |date=January 1987 |title=A data base for dioxin and furan emissions from refuse incinerators |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=29–36 |doi=10.1016/0004-6981(87)90267-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. For example, [[hurricane]]s often involve water contamination from sewage, and [[petrochemical]] spills from ruptured [[boat]]s or [[automobile]]s. Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal [[Oil platform|oil rigs]] or [[Oil refinery|refineries]] are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as [[nuclear power]] plants or [[oil tanker]]s, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.

In the case of [[noise pollution]] the dominant source class is the [[motor vehicle]], producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide.

===Environment===
Pollution has been found to be present widely in the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. There are a number of effects of this:
* [[Biomagnification]] describes situations where toxins (such as [[heavy metals]]) may pass through [[trophic level]]s, becoming exponentially more concentrated in the process.
* [[Carbon dioxide]] emissions cause [[ocean acidification]], the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans as {{co2}} becomes dissolved.
* The emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es leads to [[global warming]] which affects ecosystems in many ways.
* [[Invasive species]] can out compete native species and reduce [[biodiversity]]. Invasive plants can contribute debris and biomolecules ([[allelopathy]]) that can alter soil and chemical compositions of an environment, often reducing native species [[competition (biology)|competitiveness]].
* [[Nitrogen oxide]]s are removed from the air by rain and [[fertiliser|fertilise]] land which can change the species composition of ecosystems.
* [[Smog]] and haze can reduce the amount of sunlight received by plants to carry out [[photosynthesis]] and leads to the production of [[tropospheric ozone]] which damages plants.
* Soil can become infertile and unsuitable for plants. This will affect other [[organism]]s in the [[food web]].
* [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s can cause [[acid rain]] which lowers the [[pH]] value of soil.
* Organic pollution of watercourses can deplete [[oxygen]] levels and reduce species diversity.

==Regulation and monitoring==
{{Main|Regulation and monitoring of pollution}}
To protect the environment from the adverse effects of pollution, many nations worldwide have enacted legislation to regulate various types of pollution as well as to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution.

Pollution control is a term used in [[environmental management]]. It means the control of [[emission standard|emissions]] and [[effluents]] into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the [[waste]] products from [[overconsumption]], heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. In the hierarchy of controls, [[pollution prevention]] and [[waste minimization]] are more desirable than pollution control. In the field of [[land development]], [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] is a similar technique for the prevention of [[urban runoff]].

==Perspectives==
The earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence. The attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of [[natural selection]]. These would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately, species extinction. Processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations. At the extremes, for any form of life, consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival.

For humankind, the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration, both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts. Short of survival, human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards. Since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive, modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable. Common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include [[automobile emissions control]], industrial exposure (e.g. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) [[Permissible exposure limit|PELs]]), [[toxicology]] (e.g. {{LD50}}), and [[medicine]] (e.g. [[medication]] and [[absorbed dose|radiation]] doses).

"The solution to pollution is dilution", is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful.&lt;ref name="Island"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.earthisland.org/eijournal/new_articles.cfm?articleID=299&amp;journalID=49 |title=The 'Solution' to Pollution Is Still 'Dilution' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504004539/http://www.earthisland.org/eijournal/new_articles.cfm?articleID=299&amp;journalID=49 |archivedate=May 4, 2008 |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanocean.org/index_general.asp?menuid=240.010|title=What is required|accessdate=2006-02-14|year=2001|publisher=Clean Ocean Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519184335/http://www.cleanocean.org/index_general.asp?menuid=240.010|archivedate=2006-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well-suited to some other modern, locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and [[hazardous material]] release emergency management. But it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases.

Such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative, human population and densities were lower, technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign. But these are often no longer the case. Furthermore, advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before. The use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency to the principle of probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or infeasible. In addition, consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence.

Yet in the absence of a superseding principle, this older approach predominates practices throughout the world. It is the basis by which to gauge concentrations of effluent for legal release, exceeding which penalties are assessed or restrictions applied.  One such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries, as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non-hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process.&lt;ref name="The"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homer.ornl.gov/sesa/environment/guidance/rcra/mixture.pdf|title=The Mixture Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|accessdate=2012-04-10|year=1999|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Energy|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026114825/http://homer.ornl.gov/sesa/environment/guidance/rcra/mixture.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be confronted by challenging economical and technological barriers.

[[Carbon dioxide]], while vital for [[photosynthesis]], is sometimes referred to as pollution, because raised levels of the gas in the atmosphere are affecting the Earth's climate. Disruption of the environment can also highlight the connection between areas of pollution that would normally be classified separately, such as those of water and air. Recent studies have investigated the potential for long-term rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to cause slight but critical [[ocean acidification|increases in the acidity of ocean waters]], and the possible effects of this on marine ecosystems.

The Qashqai mainly live in the provinces of [[Fars Province|Fars]], [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad]], [[Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province|Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari]], [[Bushehr]], and southern [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], especially around the cities of [[Shiraz]] and [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] in Fars.  The majority of Qashqai people were originally [[nomadic people|nomadic]] [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] and some remain so today. The traditional nomadic Qashqai travelled with their flocks twice yearly to and from the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480&amp;nbsp;km or 300&amp;nbsp;miles south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the [[Persian Gulf]], to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly [[sedentism|sedentary]]. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s.

The Qashqai are made up of five major tribes:  the ''Amale'' (Qashqai) / ''Amaleh'' (Persian), the ''Dere-Shorlu / Darreh-Shuri'', the ''Kashkollu / Kashkuli'', the ''Shishbeyli / Sheshboluki'', and the ''Eymur / Farsimadan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le qashqay: langue turcique d'Iran|last=Dolatkhah|first=Sohrab|publisher=CreateSpace, Independent Publishing Platform.|year=2016|isbn=|location=Online|pages=13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller tribes include the ''Qaracha / Qarache'i'', ''Rahimli / Rahimi'', and ''Safi-Khanli / Safi-Khani''.

Historically, the Turkic languages are believed to have arrived in Iran from Central Asia from the 11th or 12th centuries onwards.

:"To survive, [[nomad]]s have always been obliged to fight. They lead a wandering life and do not accumulate documents and archives.
:But in the evenings, around fires that are burning low, the elders will relate striking events, deeds of valour in which the tribes pride themselves. Thus the epic tale is told from father to son, down through the ages.
:The tribes of Central Asia were forced by wars, strife, upheavals, to abandon their steppes and seek new pasture grounds...so the [[Huns]], the [[Visigoths]], and before them the [[Aryan]]s, had invaded India, Iran, Europe.
:The Turks, forsaking the regions where they had dwelt for centuries, started moving down through the [[Altai Mountains]] and [[Caspian Depression|Caspian]] depressions, establishing themselves eventually on the frontiers of the Iranian Empire and in Asia Minor.
:We are of Turkish language and race; some say that we are descendants of the Turkish [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] Tribe, known for its cruelty and fierceness, and that our name is derived from the Turkish "Kashka" meaning "a horse with a white star on its forehead". Others think this name indicates that we came from [[Kashgar]] in the wake of [[Hulagu]]. Others still that it means "fugitive".
:Though these versions differ, we believe that the arrival of our Tribes in Iran coincided with the conquests of [[Jengis Khan]], in the thirteenth century. Soon after, our ancestors established themselves on the slopes of the Caucasus. We are descendants of the "Tribe of the Ak Koyunlu" the "Tribe of the White Sheep" famed for being the only tribe in history capable of inflicting a defeat on [[Tamerlane]]. For centuries we dwelt on the lands surrounding [[Ardebil]], but, in the first half of the sixteenth century we settled in southern Persia, [[Shah Ismail]] having asked our warriors to defend this part of the country against the intrusions of the Portuguese. Thus, our Tribes came to the Province of [[Fars Province|Fars]], near the Persian Gulf, and are still only separated from it by a ridge of mountains, the [[Makran]].
:The yearly migrations of the Kashkai, seeking fresh pastures, drive them from the south to the north, where they move to their summer quarters "[[Yaylak|Yailaq]]" in the high mountains; and from the north to the south, to their winter quarters, "[[Qishlaq]]".
:In summer, the Kashkai flocks graze on the slopes of the Kuh-è-Dinar; a group of mountains from 12,000 to 15,000 feet, that are part of the [[Zagros]] chain.
:In autumn the Kashkai break camp, and by stages leave the highlands. They winter in the warmer regions near Firuzabad, Kazerun, Jerrè, Farashband, on the banks of the river Mound, till, in April, they start once more on their yearly trek.
:The migration is organised and controlled by the Kashkai Chief. The Tribes carefully avoid villages and towns such as Shiraz and Isfahan, lest their flocks, estimated at seven million head, might cause serious damage. The annual migration is the largest of any Persian tribe.
:It is difficult to give exact statistics, but we believe that the Tribes now number 400,000 men, women and children." Told to Marie-Tèrése Ullens de Schooten by the 'Il Begh' Malek Mansur, brother of the 'Il Khan', Nasser Khan, Chief of the Kashkai Tribes, in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Ullens de Schooten, Marie-Tèrése. (1956). ''Lords of the Mountains: Southern Persia &amp; the Kashkai Tribe''. Chatto and Windus Ltd. Reprint: The Travel Book Club. London, pp. 53–54. See also pp. 114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qashqai were a significant political force in Iran during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During World War I they were influenced by the German consular official [[Wilhelm Wassmuss]] and sided with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Ullens de Schooten, Marie-Tèrése. (1956). ''Lords of the Mountains: Southern Persia &amp; the Kashkai Tribe''. Chatto and Windus Ltd. Reprint: The Travel Book Club. London, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War II the Qashgais attempted to organize resistance against the British and Soviet [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupation forces]] and received some ineffectual help from the Germans in 1943 by the means of Operation ANTON, which (along with Operation FRANZ) proved a complete failure.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, Adrian. (2014) ''Nazi Secret Warfare in Occupied Persia (Iran): The Failure of the German Intelligence Services, 1939–45''&gt;''Nazi Secret Warfare'', pp. 58 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945–1946 there was a major rebellion of a number of tribal confederacies, including the Qashgais, who fought valiantly until the invading Russians were repelled. The Qashgais revolted during 1962–1964 due to the land reforms of the [[White Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division, p.125"&gt;Federal Research Division, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was put down and within a few years many Qashqais had settled.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division, p.125"/&gt; Most of the tribal leaders were sent to exile.  After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 the living leader, Khosrow Khan Qashqai, returned to Iran from exile in the United States and Germany.

== Major Tribes of the Qashqai Tribal Confederation ==
The Qashqai tribal confederation consists of five major tribes, including the Dareshuri, Farsimadan, Sheshboluki, Amaleh, and Kashkuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopaedia Iranica|title=QAŠQĀʾI TRIBAL CONFEDERACY i|website=www.iranicaonline.org/|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amale / Amaleh ===
People of the Amaleh tribe were originally warriors and workmen attached to the household of the Ilkhani, or paramount chief; recruited from all the Qashqai tribes they constituted the Ilkhani’s bodyguard and retinue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tribes of Fars|date=1948|page=71|last1=Magee|first1=G. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1956, the Amaleh tribe comprised as many as 6,000 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Qashqai Nomads of Fars|date=1974|page=223|last1=Pierre|first1=Oberling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dere-Shorlu / Dareshuri / Darehshouri ===
The Dareshuri are said to have joined the Qashqai tribal confederation during the reign of Karim Khan Zand (1163-93/1750-79).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Lois|title=The Qashqai of Iran|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=0300032129|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Persian government statistics, there were about 5,169 Dareshuri families, or 27,396 individuals, in 1360 sh./1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Afshaar-Sistaani|first1=Iraj|title=Eall-ha, Chaadorneshinan va ṭavayef-e ashayeri-e Iran|date=1987|publisher=Iraj Afshaar|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dareshuri were “the greatest horse-breeders and owners among the Qashqai”. The policy of forced sedentarization of the nomadic tribes pursued by Reza Shah Pahlavi (1304–20 SH./1925-41) resulted in the loss of 80–90 percent of the Dareshuri horses, but the tribe made a recovery after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oberling|first1=Pierre|title=The Qashqai Nomads of Fars|date=June 1974|publisher=Walter De Gruyter Inc|isbn=9992263113|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reza Shah Pahlavi also executed Hossein khan Darehshouri the head of Darehshouri family in order to take back the control of the Fars province which was controlled by Darehshouri tribe during Ghajar empire.

=== Kashkollu / Kashkuli ===
During World War I, the Kashkuli khans supported the British in their struggle against Ṣowlat-al-Dowla (Iyl-khan) and the German agent, Wilhelm Wassmuss. After the war, Ṣowlat-al-Dowla punished the Kashkuli. He dismissed the Kashkuli leaders who had opposed him and “deliberately set out to break up and impoverish the Kashkuli tribe”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magee|first1=G. F.|title=The Tribes of Fars|date=1945|location=London|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two sections of the tribe, which consisted of elements which had been loyal to Ṣowlat-al-Dowla, were then separated from the main body of the tribe and given the status of independent tribes, becoming the Kashkuli Kuchak (“Little Kashkuli”) and Qarachahi tribes. The remaining tribe became known as the Kashkuli Bozorg (“Big Kashkuli”) tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kashkuli|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kaskuli-bozorg|website=Encyclopedia Iranica|publisher=Iranica|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kashkuli Bozorg tribe comprised 4,862 households in 1963. As Oliver Garrod observed, the Kashkuli Bozorg are “especially noted for their Jajims, or tartan woolen blankets, and for the fine quality of their rugs and trappings”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oberling|first1=Pierre|title=The Qashqai Nomads of Fars|date=June 1974|publisher=Walter De Gruyter Inc|isbn=9992263113|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eymur / Farsimadan ===
The Farsimadan claim that they are of [[Khalaj people|Ḵhalaj]] origin, and that, before moving to southern Persia, they dwelled in Ḵalajestan, a region southwest of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tribes of Fars|date=1948|page=54|last1=Magee|first1=G. F.|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe was already in Fars by the late 16th century, for it is known that in October 1590 their leader, Abul-Qasem Beyg and some of his followers were punished for having sided with Yaqub Khan the Zul-Qadr governor of Fars, in a revolt against Shah Abbas I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farsimadan|title=FĀRSĪMADĀN|website=Encyclopedia Iranica|publisher=Iranica|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The population of the Farsimadan was estimated by Afshaar-Sistaani at 2,715 families or 12,394 individuals, in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eall-ha, Chaadorneshinan va ṭavayef-e ashayeri-e Iran|location=Tehran|page=628|last1=Afshaar-Sistaani|first1=Iraj|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qashqai carpets and weavings ==
The Qashqai are renowned for their pile carpets and other woven wool products. They are sometimes referred to as "Shiraz" because [[Shiraz]] was the major marketplace for them in the past. The wool produced in the mountains and valleys near Shiraz is exceptionally soft and beautiful and takes a deeper color than wool from other parts of Iran.

:"No wool in all Persia takes such a rich and deep colour as the Shiraz wool. The deep blue and the dark ruby red are equally extraordinary, and that is due to the brilliancy of the wool, which is firmer and, so to say, more transparent than silk, and makes one think of translucent enamel".&lt;ref&gt;Hawley, Walter A. (1913) ''Oriental Rugs Antique &amp; Modern''. Reprint: Dover Publications, New York (1970), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qashqai carpets have been said to be "probably the most famous of all Persian tribal weavings".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Ian (1978) "Later Persian Weaving." In: ''Rugs &amp; Carpets of the World'', edited by Ian Bennett, pp. 241, 243. Ferndale Editions, London, 1978. {{ISBN|0-905746-24-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Qashqai saddlebags, adorned with colorful geometric designs, "are superior to any others made".&lt;ref&gt;Hawley, Walter A. (1913) ''Oriental Rugs Antique &amp; Modern''. Reprint: Dover Publications, New York (1970), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romani cuisine''', '''Romani food''', '''Gypsy cuisine''' or '''Gypsy food''' is the cuisine of the ethnic [[Romani people|Romani/Romany people]]. It is influenced by [[European cuisine]]. Although, Romani people are believed to originate from [[India]], their cookery does not incorporate any Indian or South Asian influence. It is similar to [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Albanian cuisine]], [[Balkan cuisine]] and [[Romanian cuisine]].

==Overview==
Romani dishes are usually made hot and spicy with the use of spices, such as [[paprika]], [[garlic]] and [[bell pepper]]s. [[Potato]]es are also a staple in their diet. A traditional Romani dessert is ''pirogo''. The recipe consists of eggs, raisins, walnuts, pineapple, sugar, butter, egg noodles and cottage cheese.&lt;ref name="Gypsyfood"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JTBSpuCkl9AC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=gypsy+food+cabbage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1U0yVZOuIpfnoAT4voBo&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gypsy%20food%20cabbage&amp;f=false The American Ethnic Cookbook for Students - Page 132]&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional dish cooked by Romani people is ''[[Sarma (food)|sarma]]'', ''salmaia'' or ''sodmay'', which is made from [[cabbage]] stuffed with meat and rice.&lt;ref name="gypsyfood"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwR8fvjCkgEC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=gypsy+food+cabbage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1U0yVZOuIpfnoAT4voBo&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gypsy%20food%20cabbage&amp;f=false Memories of a Gypsy - Page 17]&lt;/ref&gt; Romanis consume dishes consisting of [[stuffed peppers]], such as ''[[ardei umpluți]]'', especially on holidays and special occasions. Romani people also cook ''pufe'' (made from fried flour), ''xaritsa'' (fried cornbread), ''bogacha'' (baked bread) and ''xaimoko'' (a meal consisting of rabbit meat). They serve their meals with ''kafa'' (coffee) and ''chao'' (tea) with sugar and milk or lemon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XYQfAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=gypsy+food+pufe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oEBpVfzWE8KNyASI6ICwBw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gypsy%20food%20pufe&amp;f=false Gypsies: The Hidden Americans - Page 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudy Baker''' (born 1898, date of death unknown), a [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) official, is today best known for his role as head of the CPUSA's underground ''[[History of Soviet espionage in the United States#Secret apparatus|secret apparatus]]''.  He succeeded to the position in 1938, after the removal of [[J. Peters]].

==Background==
Baker was born in 1898 in [[Vukovar]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], probably under the name '''Rudolph Blum'''.  Baker had little formal education, and emigrated to the [[United States]] with his family in 1909.  He joined the Communist Party  of the United States at its founding, in 1919. He went to [[Moscow]] and trained at the International Lenin School from 1927 to 1930. He became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] during that period.

==Identification in VENONA Soviet Cables==
Baker shows up in the [[Venona project]] decryptions of Soviet codes under the cover name ''SON''; he may also be ''RUDI''.  The identification comes from coded correspondence between the [[Comintern]] and the party in Russia's [[RTsKhIDNI]] archive (495-184), which contains dozens of messages from ''BROTHER'' in Moscow to ''FATHER'' and ''SON'' in the United States.  Annotations on these messages identify BROTHER as Dimitrov and FATHER as the party General Secretary [[Earl Browder]].  In these messages, SON is the head of the party's covert arm or ''secret apparatus'', which Baker took over in mid-1938 after the defection of [[Whittaker Chambers]].  Notably, all of the Comintern messages to SON were sent after Baker visited Moscow in January 1939 to brief Comintern officials on the status of the party's ''secret apparatus'' (after Baker took over its operations).

In May 1942, General [[Pavel Fitin]], the head of [[KGB]] foreign intelligence directorate states in a message to Dimitrov found in the Comintern Archives, "We are forwarding a telegram we received from [[New York City|New York]] addressed to you from Rudy"; this telegram is signed ''SON''.

{{South Korean economy}}
The '''Saemaul Undong''', also known as the '''New Community Movement''', '''New Village Movement''', '''Saemaul Movement''' or '''Saema'eul Movement''', was a political initiative launched on April{{nbsp}}22, 1970 by South Korean president [[Park Chung-hee]] to modernize the rural [[South Korean economy]]. The idea was based on the Korean traditional [[communalism]] called ''[[Hyangyak]]'' (향약, 鄕約) and ''[[Doorae]]'' (두레), which provided the rules for [[self-governance]] and cooperation in traditional Korean communities. The movement initially sought to rectify the growing disparity of the [[standard of living]] between the nation's urban centres, which were rapidly industrializing, and the small villages, which continued to be mired in poverty. Diligence, self-help and collaboration were the slogans to encourage community members to participate in the development process. The early stage of the movement focused on improving the basic living conditions and environments whereas later projects concentrated on building rural [[infrastructure]] and increasing community [[income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korea - The Agricultural Crisis of the Late 1980s |url= http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12321.html|publisher= www.countrydata.com |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though hailed as a great success by force in the 1970s, the movement lost momentum during the 1980s due to the unexpected death of Park Chung-hee.

==Overview==
The movement promoted [[self-help]] and [[collaboration]] among the people during its first phase, as the central government provided a fixed amount of [[raw material]]s to each of the participating villages free of charge and entrusted the locals to build whatever they wished with them. The government first selected 33,267 villages and provided 335 sacks of cement. 16,600 villages that demonstrated success were then granted additional resources of 500 sacks of cement and a ton of iron bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.pohang.go.kr/site/eng/introduction/movement/historical/index.html|title=The historical background behind the New Community Movement|last=|first=|date=|work=Pohang Municipal Government|publisher=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Community Movement did much to improve [[infrastructure]] in rural [[South Korea]], bringing modernized facilities such as [[irrigation system]]s, [[bridge]]s and [[road]]s in rural communities. The program also marked the widespread appearance of orange tiled houses throughout the countryside, replacing the traditional [[thatched]] or ''choga-jip'' houses. Encouraged by the success in rural areas, the movement spread through [[factories]] and urban areas as well, and became a nationwide [[modernization]] movement.

However, despite the Saemaul Movement's great success in reducing [[poverty]] and improving [[living conditions]] in rural areas during its first phase, income levels in urban areas were still higher than income levels in rural areas after the rapid [[industrialization]] of South Korea. The government-led movement with its highly [[centralized]] organization proved to be efficient in the 1970s and early 1980s, but it became less effective after South Korea entered into a more [[developed]] and industrialized stage, which diminished the momentum of the movement. The relatively low income levels in rural areas compared to urban areas became a major political issue in the late 1980s – one that no government intervention was able to fully solve during the first phase – and the movement proved ultimately inadequate in addressing the larger problem of [[rural migration|migration from the villages to the cities]] by the country's younger demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Rural Development in South Korea: A Sociopolitical Analysis |last= Boyer |first= William |authorlink= |author2=Byong Man Anh |year= 1991 |publisher= University of Delaware Press |location= London |isbn= |pages= 75–76 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the government-led centralized system caused [[corruption]], such as misuse of funding, and changed South Korea's environment. 

Recognizing these problems, the [[South Korean government]] changed the centralized structure of the movement by empowering [[civil society]] to lead the movement. Since 1998, the Saemaul Movement has entered into the second phase, focusing on new issues such as enhancing voluntary services in the community and international cooperation with [[developing countries]].

== Criticism ==
During the late 1960s and 70's when the policy started being implemented under the regime of President Park, local traditions and beliefs were suppressed, akin to the [[Cultural Revolution]] in communist China which happened at the same time. The movement ''[[Misin tapa undong]]'' ("to defeat the worship of gods"), also described as "movement to destroy superstition") reached its peak during the ''Saemaul Undong'' period. Old [[zelkova]] trees that had stood at village entrances and have traditionally served as guardian figures were cut down in order to erase "superstition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list|title=Koreana : Korean culture &amp; arts|website=www.koreana.or.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of [[Korean shamanism]] were harassed, essentially destroying centuries old Korean traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list|title=Koreana : Korean culture &amp; arts|website=www.koreana.or.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)''' was the indigenous [[Slovenes|Slovene]] population—approximately 327,000 out of a total population of 1.3&lt;ref name="SacroEgoismo2012"&gt;Lipušček, U.

According to the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] in 1920, the former [[Austrian Littoral]] and western part of the former [[Inner Carniola]] were annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Whereas only a few thousand Italians were left in the new South Slavic{{efn-lr|In the beginning called the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.''}} state, a population of half a million Slavs,&lt;ref name="HehnP_Low_Dishonest_Decade"&gt;Hehn, Paul N.

==Italianization==
At the end of the 19th century, [[Trieste]] was the largest Slovene city, with more [[Slovenes|Slovene]] inhabitants than even [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;Plut-Pregelj, Leopoldina, &amp; Carole Rogel. 2007. ''The A to Z of Slovenia.'' Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; After being ceded from multiethnic Austria, the Italian nationalist milieus sought to make Trieste a ''città italianissima'', committing a series of attacks led by [[Black Shirts]] against Slovene shops, libraries, lawyers' offices, and the central place of the rival community in the [[Trieste National Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Graeme; R.

Notable Slovenes affected by Italianization included the poet [[Srečko Kosovel]] and the writer [[Boris Pahor]]. Slovenes that emigrated included the writers [[Vladimir Bartol]] and [[Josip Ribičič]], the legal theorist [[Boris Furlan]], and the architect [[Viktor Sulčič]]. In order to fight the Fascist repression, the [[militant anti-fascist]] organization [[TIGR]] was formed in 1927.

==Today==

The '''Sri Lanka Medical Council''' ('''SLMC''') is a [[statutory body]] which was established in 1998 replacing the former '''Ceylon Medical Council''' which was formed in 1924. It is tasked with the regulation of the medical profession in [[Sri Lanka]]. It is tasked with protecting health care seekers by ensuring the maintenance of academic and professional standards, discipline and ethical practice by health professionals registered with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2003/07/28/featur03.html Sri Lanka Medical Council: Past, Present and the Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of the SLMC is:
:"protecting health care seekers by ensuring the maintenance of academic and professional standards, discipline and ethical practice by health professionals who are registered with it.
What is meant by maintenance of academic and professional standards and discipline and ethical practice by health professionals if there are no means of pursuing or questioning a medical practitioners treatment.


==History==
The SLMC was established as a statutory body by the Medical (Amendment) Act No. 40 of 1998 replacing the Ceylon Medical Council which in tern had been established by the Medical Council Ordinance No. 24 of 1924.

== Functions ==
The SLMC's major functions include:
* the registration of medical practitioners
**[[Physician|Doctors]]
**[[Dentist]]s
**[[Pharmacist]]s 
* the assessment and recognition of overseas qualifications of medical practitioners

== Council Members==
* President - Nominated by the Minister of Health
* Eight members - one member each elected by the teachers of the Faculty of Medicine of each of the Universities established or deemed to be established by the Universities Act
* One member - one member elected by the teachers of the Faculty of Dental Sciences of each of the Universities established or deemed to be established by the Universities Act

==Criticism==
===Independence===
The Sri Lanka Medical Council has been accused of lacking independence in its operations and policy formulation as it is heavily influenced by the [[Government Medical Officers Association]] and the [[Sri Lanka Medical Association]] with many of the SLMC being from these organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/SAITM-beware-of-becoming-a-bite-123596.html SAITM: beware of becoming a bite]&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is spoken by older adults, who are likewise fluent in [[Southern Pashto]].&lt;ref name=e15/&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
Spoken in the [[Nangarhar Province]] of Northeastern [[Afghanistan]], there are about 100 native speakers today, if any. This is mainly due to the majority of the [[Tirahi|Tirahi people]] having assimilated into the dominant [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] culture of [[Afghanistan]]. In its place, Tirahi connects the Dardic languages spoken in [[Dardistan]] with languages which reach down to the mouth of the [[Indus River]], showing Dardic influence. Thus, it could be the missing link connecting a chain of languages between the [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Goa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In possibly being the missing link, Dardic influence can even be found in the Central Indian [[Bhil Languages]] as well as the [[Konkani]] dialect of [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref name="Grierson, G. 1925"&gt;Grierson, G. (1925). On the Tirahi language. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (New Series), 57(03), 405-416.&lt;/ref&gt; Tirahi is also spoken in a couple of villages southeast of the Afghan city of [[Jalalabad]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voegelin|first1=C.F.|last2=Voegelin|first2=F.M.|title=Languages of the World: Indo-European Fascicle One|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|date=1965|volume=7|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Jaba, Mitarani, and Bara-khel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Aurel|title=Notes on Tirahi. The Speakers of Tirahi|journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|date=Jul 1925|volume=3|pages=401–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification and Related Languages ==
Tirahi is a [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] language, along with [[Kalasha-mun|Kalasha,]] [[Gawar-Bati language|Gawar-Bati,]] and [[Pashayi languages]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grierson|first=George|date=March 1925|title=On The Tirahi Language|jstor=25220761|journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|page=408|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Tirahi is part of the sub-group of [[Dardic languages|Kohistani languages]] along with languages such as [[Bateri language|Bateri]], [[Chilisso language|Chilisso]], [[Gowro language|Gowro]], and others. However, Tirahi also shares with languages spoken farther to the east, such as [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a Dardic Language, Tirahi strongly preserves some vocabulary of spoken Sanskrit (cow - dēn in Tirahi,  dhēnuh in Sanskrit, hand - ast in Tirahi, hastah in Sanskrit).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Being a language spoken in Afghanistan, Tirahi shares various words and grammatical constructs with [[Pashto]], a language spoken throughout Afghanistan to which many Tirahi speakers have become accustomed to speaking. Since Tirahi is entirely separated from the other Dardic languages, located south of the [[Kabul River]] and west of the [[Khyber Pass]], rendering it wholly encased by Pashto.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Tirahi also shares some vocabulary with [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] such as the Tirahi ''mala'', for a father, the Kashmiri ''mol'', and the Shina ''malo''.&lt;ref name="Grierson, G. 1925"/&gt;

== Grammar ==

Tirahi shows much influence from [[Pashto]] in phonology, lexicon and even morphology. However, its vocabulary exhibits a connection to Kohistani dialects. Therefore, Tirahi seems to occupy an intermediate position between [[Pashto]] and the [[Kohistani people|Kohistani]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9MPCd6mO6sC|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|last=Jain|first=Dhanesh|last2=Cardona|first2=George|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780700711307|page=857|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenstirne claims that Tirahi is "probably the remnant of a dialect group extending from Tirahi through the [[Peshawar District|Peshawar district]] into [[Swat District|Swat]] and [[Dir District|Dir]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=R. L.|date=1934-01-01|title=Review of Report on a Linguistic Mission to North-Western India|jstor=25201006|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|issue=4|pages=801–803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nouns and Adjectives ===

Tirahi is an [[Inflection|inflected]] language, having 5 cases: [[Nominative]], Oblique, [[Genitive case|Genitive]], [[Dative case|Dative]], and [[Ablative case|Ablative]]. Adjectives, verbs, and nouns usually agree according to gender. Consonant-final nouns add e or a along with their traditional endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9MPCd6mO6sC|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|last=Jain|first=Dhanesh|last2=Cardona|first2=George|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780700711307|pages=857–9, also for all grammatical information below|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be an indefinite article, added to the end of the word as an -ī, similar to [[Farsi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''United National Movement''' ({{lang-ka|ერთიანი ნაციონალური მოძრაობა}}, ''Ertiani Natsionaluri Modzraoba'', ENM) is the main opposition [[political party]] in the nation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

==History==
[[File:Sign of Nato - Rustaveli avenue - Tbilisi (recto side).JPG|thumb|200px|left|A pro-NATO sign edited by UNM, the then-ruling party of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
UNM was founded in October 2001 by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]. It is a reformist party and favors closer ties with [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], as well as the restoration of [[Tbilisi]]'s control over the separatist self-proclaimed states of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]].

Originally a center-left party, it moved its position to center-right since the [[Rose Revolution]], and combines political, economic and cultural liberalism with [[civic nationalism]]. Its main political priorities also include improving social services to the poor, the movement's main base of support; fighting corruption and reducing administrative barriers for doing business.  Leaders of UNM label themselves as liberal-conservative and in September 2007, the party became an observer member of the center-right [[European People's Party]] (EPP).

Saakashvili and other Georgian opposition leaders formed a "United People's Alliance" in November 2003 to bring together the United National Movement, the United Democrats, the Union of National Solidarity and the youth movement "[[Kmara]]" in a loose alliance against the government of President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]].

The United National Movement and its partners in the opposition played a central role in the November 2003 political crisis that ended in the forced [[Eduard Shevardnadze#Political downfall|resignation]] of President Shevardnadze. The opposition parties strongly contested the outcome of the November 2, 2003 parliamentary elections, which local and international observers criticised for numerous irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/24/1069522502833.html Sydney Morning Herald, Shevardnadze quits to avoid bloodshed]&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Shevardnadze, the party joined forces with the United Democrats and the Union of National Solidarity to promote [[Saakashvili]] as the principal opposition candidate in the presidential elections of January 4, 2004, which he won by an overwhelming majority. The United National Movement and the United Democrats amalgamated on February 5, 2004; the UNM retained its name but its parliamentary faction was called the National Movement – Democrats.

In the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary election]], the UNM won 59.1% of the vote. However, in the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 election]] they fell to 40.3%, becoming the second largest party in parliament after [[Georgian Dream]].

After the 2012 elections the UNM suffered several defections of its parliament members to new parties. Including that of the libertarian [[New Political Center — Girchi]] by former UNM member of parliament [[Zurab Japaridze]] and three others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=28803&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe these defections were encouraged by the ruling Georgian Dream Coalition in order to weaken its principal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Georgia: Proposed Reform Could Tilt Electoral Field Toward Incumbents |website= Eurasianet |date= 10 April 2017 |url= http://www.eurasianet.org/node/83171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Party received 27.11% of the vote on [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2016]]. Shortly afterwards, the party split on 12 January 2017, as a result of a conflict between [[Davit Bakradze]], former Mayor of Tbilisi [[Gigi Ugulava]], their supporters, and members of the party loyal to former President of Georgia [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]. Saakashvili had rejected the party's decision to enter parliament after the elections and had furthermore opposed the initiative of party members to appoint a chairman in his place, a position which was officially vacant due to Saakashvili's expatriate status. On the day of the split Ugulava stated ""One person is responsible for dismantling the party – the person, who established the party." A majority of the UNM's electoral list defected to [[European Georgia]], leaving the UNM with six members in parliament.

The '''Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs''' is an interdisciplinary research center at [[Brown University]]. Its mission is to "promote a just and peaceful world through research, teaching, and public engagement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watson.brown.edu/about/ |title=About Watson Institute &amp;#124; Watson Institute |website=Watson.brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the University's campus in Providence, RI, USA, the Institute's research focuses on three main areas: development, security, and governance. Its faculty include anthropologists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and historians, as well as journalists and other practitioners.  The Institute occupies a modern and architecturally distinctive building designed by Uruguayan architect [[Rafael Viñoly]] and is located close to central campus on Thayer Street.

The Institute is directed by Edward Steinfeld, professor in the Department of Political Science, and director of the China Initiative at Brown University.

==History==
[[Image:BrownUniversity-WatsonInstitute.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Watson Institute for International Studies]]
The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs began to fulfill two parallel missions: "to bring international perspective into the life of Brown University, and to promote peace through international relations research and policy." In 1981, with the support and guidance of 1937 Brown alumnus [[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.]], former chairman of [[IBM]] and [[List of United States Ambassadors to Russia|Ambassador to the Soviet Union]],  Brown University founded the Center for Foreign Policy Development. The Center was formed to explore solutions to the major global issues of the day, foremost of which was the possibility of a nuclear encounter between the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union. In 1986, the University created the Institute for International Studies to integrate the Center and Brown's other international programs. In 1991, the Institute was rededicated in Watson's honor. Originally housed in five separate locations on campus, the programs of the Watson Institute moved into its current building, designed by architect [[Rafael Viñoly]], in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watson.brown.edu/about/history |title=Watson Institute History &amp;#124; Watson Institute |website=Watson.brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Institute was renamed the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs to reflect the merger between the Watson Institute and the Taubman Center for Public Policy which had previously been housed in the Department of Political Science.

==Teaching==
Watson houses three undergraduate degree programs - Development Studies, International Relations and Public Policy. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A). The Graduate Program in Development (GPD) is an NSF-funded, interdisciplinary program that trains PhD candidates in anthropology, political science, economics, and sociology.  The Public Policy program is a one-year intensive (summer – fall – spring) full-time degree with a focus on quantitative policy analysis and management. The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming.

==Area studies==
The following area studies centers are based at Watson: the Brazil Initiative, the Africa Initiative, the Center for Contemporary South Asia (CCSA), the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), the China Initiative, and Middle East Studies (MES).

==Professional programs==
Two professional outreach programs are based at the Institute. The Brown International Advanced Research Institutes (BIARI) provides the opportunity for junior scholars and practitioners from all over the world to study together at the Institute. According to Watson's website, BIARI "aims to build transnational scholarly networks while also providing opportunities for professional development. Each summer, BIARI brings promising young faculty from the Global South together with leading scholars in their fields for two-week intensive residential institutes."&lt;ref name="brown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watson.brown.edu/education |title=Education &amp;#124; Watson Institute |website=Watson.brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choices develops and publishes curriculum resources for high school social studies classrooms, and leads seminars for secondary school teachers. The program's mission is "to equip young people with the skills, habits, and knowledge necessary to be engaged citizens who are capable of addressing international issues with thoughtful public discourse and informed decision making."&lt;ref name="brown1"/&gt;

==Publications==
The Watson Institute is the editorial home to two academic journals:
*''[[Brown Journal of World Affairs]]''
*''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/0039-3606 Studies in Comparative International Development]''

Watson also publishes a working paper series, distributed by SSRN:
*''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalbrowse&amp;journal_id=2297573 Watson Working Papers]''

'''Wealth inequality in Latin America''' and the [[Caribbean]] refers to economic discrepancies among people of the region. Wealth inequality remains a serious issue despite strong [[economic growth]] and improved social indicators observed over the past decade.{{when?|reason=Who knows if this was written fifteen years ago?|date=January 2018}} A report release in 2013 by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] entitled ''Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation'', observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market [[regulation]]s and institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the [[income distribution]] disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase [[productivity]], while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=24, Box 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-social-situation-2013.html|title=Report on World Social Situation 2013: Inequality Matters|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2013|isbn=978-92-1-130322-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[ECLAC]], Latin America is the most unequal region in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepal.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/publicaciones/xml/7/42797/P42797.xml&amp;xsl=/dds/tpl/p9f.xsl&amp;base=/ddpe/tpl-i/top-bottom.xslt|title=Protección social inclusiva en América Latina. Una mirada integral, un enfoque de derechos|trans-title=Inclusive social protection in Latin America. An integral look, a focus on rights|work=Resumen|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality is undermining the region's economic potential and the well-being of its population, since it increases poverty and reduces the impact of economic development on poverty reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco H. Ferreira, David de Ferranti et al. An example of the policies introduced to combat the poverty and inequality was the [[import substitution industrialization]] economic policy. This policy sought to grow national industry and offer protection from foreign competition as a means to reduce external dependencies and improve local economies. "Inequality in Latin America:Breaking with History?", The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Children in Latin America are often forced to seek work on the streets when their families can no longer afford to support them, leading to a substantial population of [[Street Children in Latin America|street children in Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Scanlon| first = TJ| title = Street children in Latin America| publisher = BMJ| year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some estimates, there are 40 million street children in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tacon| first = P.| title = Carlinhos: the hard gloss of city polish| publisher = UNICEF news| year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the [[Casta|Latin European racially based Casta system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|page=1096|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=For example, in many parts of Latin America, racial groupings are based less on the biological physical features and more on an intersection between physical features and social features such as economic class, dress, education, and context. Thus, a more fluid treatment allows for the construction of race as an achieved status rather than an ascribed status as is the case in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nutini, Hugo|author2=Barry Isaac|title=Social Stratification in central Mexico 1500–2000|year=2009|page=55|publisher=University of Texas Press|quote=There are basically four operational categories that may be termed ethnic or even racial in Mexico today: (1) güero or blanco (white), denoting European and Near East extraction; (2) criollo (creole), meaning light mestizo in this context but actually of varying complexion; (3) mestizo, an imprecise category that includes many phenotypic variations; and (4) indio, also an imprecise category. These are nominal categories, and neither güero/blanco nor criollo is a widely used term (see Nutini 1997: 230). Nevertheless, there is a popular consensus in Mexico today that these four categories represent major sectors of the nation and that they can be arranged into a rough hierarchy: whites and creoles at the top, a vast population of mestizos in the middle, and Indians (perceived as both a racial and an ethnic component) at the bottom. This popular hierarchy does not constitute a stratificational system or even a set of social classes, however, because its categories are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. While very light skin is indeed characteristic of the country's elite, there is no "white" (güero) class. Rather, the superordinate stratum is divided into four real classes—aristocracy, plutocracy, political class, and the crème of the upper-middle class—or, for some purposes, into ruling, political, and prestige classes (see Chap. 4). Nor is there a mestizo class, as phenotypical mestizos are found in all classes, though only rarely among the aristocracy and very frequently in the middle and lower classes.

Inequality has been reproduced and transmitted through generations because Latin American political systems allow a differentiated access on the influence that social groups have in the decision making process, and it responds in different ways to the least favored groups that have less political representation and capacity of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Fracisco H.

Because inequality in gender and location are near universal, race and ethnicity play a larger, more integral role in the unequal discriminatory practices in Latin America. These differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income, capital and political standing.

In 2008, According to UNICEF, Latin America and the Caribbean region had the highest combined [[income inequality]] in the world with a measured net Gini coefficient of 48.3, an unweighted average which is considerably higher than the world's Gini coefficient average of 39.7. Gini is the statistical measurement used to measure income distribution across entire nations and their populations and their income inequality. The other regional averages were: sub-Saharan Africa (44.2), Asia (40.4), Middle East and North Africa (39.2), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (35.4), and high-income nations (30.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Global Inequality: Beyond the Bottom Billion |publisher=UNICEF|date=April 2011|author1=Isabel Ortiz |author2=Matthew Cummins |page = 26 |url=http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Global_Inequality_REVISED_-_5_July.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the [[World Bank]],the richest decile of the population of Latin America earn&lt;ref&gt;Francisco H. Ferreira et al. Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?, The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 48% of the total income, while the poorest 10% of the population earn only 1.6% of the income. In contrast, in developed countries, the top decile receives 29% of the total income, while the bottom decile earns 2.5%.  The countries with the highest inequality in the region (as measured with the [[Gini index]] in the UN Development Report&lt;ref name="Gini"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2010_EN_Tables.pdf|title=- Human Development Reports|work=undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 2007 were [[Haiti]] (59.5), [[Colombia]] (58.5), [[Bolivia]] (58.2), [[Honduras]] (55.3), Brazil (55.0), and [[Panama]] (54.9), while the countries with the lowest inequality in the region were [[Venezuela]] (43.4), [[Uruguay]] (46.4) and [[Costa Rica]] (47.2).

Many countries in Latin America have responded to high levels of poverty by implementing new, or altering old, [[Welfare#Latin America|social assistance programs]] such as [[conditional cash transfer]]s. These include Mexico's {{Not a typo|Progresa [[Oportunidades]]}}, Brazil's Bolsa Escola and [[Bolsa Familia]], Panama's Red de {{Not a typo|Oportunidades}} and Chile's Chile Solidario.&lt;ref&gt;Barrientos, A. and Claudio Santibanez. (2009). "New Forms of Social Assistance and the Evolution of Social Protection in Latin America". Journal of Latin American Studies. Cambridge University Press 41, 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these programs provide money to poor families under the condition that those transfers are used as an investment on their children's human capital, such as regular school attendance and basic preventive health care. The purpose of these programs is to address the inter-generational transmission of poverty and to foster social inclusion by explicitly targeting the poor, focusing on children, delivering transfers to women, and changing social accountability relationships between beneficiaries, service providers and governments.&lt;ref&gt;Benedicte de la Brière and Laura B. Rawlings, "Examining Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: A Role for Increased Social Inclusion?", Social Safety Net Primary Papers, The World Bank, 2006, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have helped to increase school enrollment and attendance and they also have shown improvements in children's health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idhalc-actuarsobreelfuturo.org/site/descarga.php?archivo=idhalc_engl.pdf|title=Regional Human Development Report for Latin America and the Caribbean 2010|work=Inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=Inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16964039|title=Societies on the move|publisher=The Economist| date=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries e.g. in [[Peru]] [[decentralisation]] is hoped to help address social justice and poverty better.

Park was a former teaching colleague of [[Maurice Halperin]] at the University of Oklahoma.  Both Park and Halperin actively sought out recruitment with Soviet intelligence, or the "Communist East"  through the ''[[New Masses]]'' and [[Jacob Golos]].  Contacts were made with [[Elizabeth Bentley]] through [[Mary Price]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Silt, Colorado]], received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree in anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and finished a year of graduate school also at Berkeley. At Berkeley he met his future wife, Susan Brandenstein (1908–1993), who was also an anthropology student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unr.edu/specoll/mss/96-05.html |title=A Guide to the Field Notes of Willard Z.

Beginning in 1942 Park was the Assistant Chief of the Economic Analysis Section of the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (OCIAA), and later the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].

In 1943 Park was interviewed in connection with a [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] investigation.  Much of Parks FBI file is redacted, including his background material, which usually includes routine items like a date of birth, parentage, education, and personal information.

He died in [[Reno, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year =1966 | month = | title =Willard Z.

The '''Xingu Indigenous Park''' ({{lang-pt|Parque Indígena do Xingu}}, pronounced {{IPA-pt|ʃĩˈɡu|}}) is an [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territory]] of Brazil, first created in 1961 as a [[National park (Brazil)|national park]] in the state of [[Mato Grosso]], [[Brazil]]. Its official purposes are to protect the environment and the several tribes of [[Xingu peoples|Xingu]] indigenous peoples in the area.

==Location==

The Xingu Indigenous Park is in the north east of the state of Mato Grosso, in the south of the [[Amazon biome]].
It covers {{convert|2642003|ha}}, with savannah and drier semi-deciduous forests in the south transitioning to Amazon rain forest in the north. 
There is a rainy season from November to April.
The headwaters of the [[Xingu River]] are in the south of the park.
The area covered by the park was defined in 1961 and covers parts of the municipalities of [[Canarana]], [[Paranatinga]], [[São Félix do Araguaia]], [[São José do Xingu]], [[Gaúcha do Norte]], [[Feliz Natal]], [[Querência]], [[União do Sul]], [[Nova Ubiratã]] and [[Marcelândia]] in the state of Mato Grosso.{{sfn|O Parque – ISA}}

[[File:XinguParks.svg|thumb|The indigenous lands in the Xingu area of Brazil]]

==History==

The national park was created after a campaign by the [[Villas-Bôas brothers]] for protection of the region. 
An account of the exploration of this area by the Villas-Bôas brothers and their efforts to protect the region is documented in the film ''[[Xingu (film)|Xingu]]'' (2012).

The idea of creating a park originated with a round table organized by the vice president of Brazil in 1952, at which a much larger park was proposed. 
However, the state of Mato Grosso began granting land within the proposed area to colonizing companies, so the park that came into existence by decree 50.455 of 14 April 1961 was only a quarter of the proposed size.
Adjustments were made on 31 July 1961, 6 August 1968 and 13 July 1971.
The final demarcation of the perimeter was made in 1978.
The area was given the designation of "National Park" to cover the dual purpose of protecting the environment and the indigenous people, and is subject to both the indigenous agency and the environmental agency.
In 1967 the term "National Park" was replaced by "Indigenous Park" to reflect the primary goal of protecting the social diversity of the indigenous people.{{sfn|O Parque – ISA}}

[[Image:Ift00054vb00.jpg|thumb|300px|Pátio da Aldeia Kamaiurá, Alto-Xingu. Indigenous people playing the ''[[uruá]]'' flute]]
The park began to suffer from the incursion of fishermen and hunters in the 1980s.
By the late 1990s livestock farms to the north east of the park were starting to reach the park, as was deforestation to the west of the park. The effects of human activity outside the park were starting to pollute the waters of the park.
The park remains as an island of forest increasingly threatened by activity outside its perimeter.{{sfn|O Parque – ISA}}

==Peoples==

The tribes occupying territories within the boundaries of the park are the [[Kamayurá people|Kamayurá]] (355), [[Kaiabi]] (745), [[Yudjá]] (248), [[Aweti]] (138), [[Mehinako]] (199), [[Wauja]] (321), [[Yawalapiti]] (208), [[Ikpeng]] (319), [[Kalapalo]] (417), [[Kuikuro]] (415), [[Matipu]] (119), [[Nahukwá]] (105), [[Suyá]] (334) and [[Trumai]] (120), population figures as of 2002. 

The Xingu area is of interest because it was a destination for early-20th century exploration by Europeans, among whom British Captain [[Percy Harrison Fawcett]] was the most notable. He sought a city which Europeans had heard rumor of since their early 16th-century colonial contact, and he disappeared in the jungle in 1925.  

[[David Grann]] wrote an article about his exploration, followed by an expanded book, ''[[The Lost City of Z (book)|The Lost City of Z]]'' (2009) on the same subject and with the same title. It documents those early explorations. It also explores archeological evidence found since the late 20th century of large-scale indigenous civilizations that pre-date Spanish and Portuguese contacts and colonization.
