* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the 18th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Richard Stanford (Kent cricketer)|Richard Stanford]] 124 
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Richard Hosmer]] 7

'''Alessio di Mauro''' (born 9 August 1977) is a former professional tennis player from Italy. During his career, he reached the final of one ATP tournament, the [[2007 ATP Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Eric Weil|title=Monaco Beats Di Mauro for ATP Title|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/25/AR2007022500658.html|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2007 the  left-hander reached his career high ranking of world no. 68.

==Betting scandal==
On 10 November 2007, at a position of world no. 124, di Mauro was the first player to be sanctioned after being embroiled in a betting scandal. Di Mauro received a [[$]]60,000 ([[£]]29,000) fine and 9 months banning from the [[ATP Tour]] for an offense that carried a maximum punishment of three years. Some officials called for a harsher punishment. However, di Mauro was not betting on the outcome of his own matches nor did he attempt to influence the outcomes of matches. He was found to be betting from 2 November 2006 to 12 June 12, 2007, and was caught as a result of an investigation beginning in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Clive White|title=Alessio di Mauro banned by ATP|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/2325479/Alessio-di-Mauro-banned-by-ATP.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baum Stadium at George Cole Field''' is the home venue of the [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball]] team of the [[NCAA]] [[List of NCAA Division I baseball programs|Division I]] [[Southeastern Conference]], located in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="bs@gcf"&gt;"2007 Razorback Baseball Media Guide." [http://www.davevanhorn.com/mediaguide2007.pdf Dave van Horn.com]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The playing field itself is named '''George Cole Field''', in honor of the former Arkansas athletic director.  [[George Cole Field]] was also the name of the Razorbacks' old home stadium, in use from 1975 to March 1996.  Baum Stadium replaced George Cole Field in April 1996.  The stadium is located one-half mile from the main Arkansas campus, which lies across Razorback Road from the stadium.

==History==
[[Image:Baum Stadium infield view.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Baum Stadium, April 2013]]
Baum Stadium officially opened in 1996.  It was designed by [[Populous (architects)|Populous]] (formerly HOK Sport), an architecture firm that has also designed several major league stadiums.&lt;ref name=ardiamonds&gt;{{cite web |title=Baum Stadium |url=http://ballparks.baseballyakker.com/?page_id=186 |work=Arkansas Diamonds: The Ballparks of Arkansas and Their History |accessdate=15 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67g5qo67w?url=http://ballparks.baseballyakker.com/?page_id=186 |archivedate=2012-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first game was a 9-2 Arkansas win over [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]] on April 13, 1996.  The stadium was dedicated prior to a 9-3 Arkansas win over [[Alabama Crimson Tide baseball|Alabama]] on May 3, 1996.

In 1998, Baum Stadium was named the country's number one college baseball facility by [[Baseball America]], and claimed the top spot again in 2018.&lt;ref name="bs@gcf"/&gt;  In 1999, Arkansas won the regular season [[Southeastern Conference]] title and had an average home attendance of 3,780 spectators, the sixth-highest total in Division I college baseball.  That year, the stadium hosted an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] regional.&lt;ref name="bs@gcf"/&gt;

Prior to the 2003 season, 2,600 chairback seats were added (1,300 down each foul line).  In addition, the hitting and pitching cages were enclosed to allow year-round access.&lt;ref name="bs@gcf"/&gt;  During the 2003 and 2004 seasons, renovations took place.  Coaches offices and eight luxury boxes were added above the seating areas.  Also, a new [[scoreboard]] was built in right field.  The scoreboard stands 51 feet high and is 76 feet wide and features four classic brick pillars.&lt;ref name="bs@gcf"/&gt;  Also in 2004, a natural grass surface was added, replacing the [[AstroTurf]] field that had been in place since the stadium opened.  Rye grass was initially used for the 2004 season but was in 2005 replaced by a hybrid [[bermuda grass]].  In November 2006, the stadium underwent its third expansion since the 2003 season.  The expansion includes 20 luxury boxes, 1,500 chairback seats, and a new outfield area to bring the stadium's capacity 10,737 spectators.  The expansions have made the stadium the second biggest, by listed capacity, in the Southeastern Conference.&lt;ref name="bs@gcf"/&gt;

Baum Stadium hosted its first #1 vs. #1 matchup ever on April 7, 2009, [[2009 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team##1 Arizona State|a 7-3 Razorbacks victory]] over the [[Arizona State Sun Devils]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Phil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3335">'''Brighton Cricket Club''' was based at [[Brighton]], [[Sussex]] and was briefly a top-class team, playing four known matches in the 1792 season, at which time it was representative of [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] as a county.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2371_misc.html CricketArchive – matchlist]. Retrieved on 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket in Sussex saw a revival during the [[British Regency|Regency]] period that coincided with the rise of [[Brighton]] as a fashionable resort. The club had been founded by 1790 when it was recorded playing in four minor matches against other town clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140003/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/matches.html Classification of cricket matches from 1697 to 1825]. Retrieved on 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, the Prince of Wales Ground became a first-class venue when Sussex played [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]].

Brighton played at the [[Prince of Wales Ground]] initially. As the towns of Brighton and [[Hove]] developed, the land was sold a few years later and the cricket club moved to a new site in Brighton at Temple Fields, which was where [[Montpelier Crescent]] is now. From July 1814, the club occupied the [[Royal New Ground]] (also known as [[Thomas Box]]'s Ground), another Brighton venue, which was used for 49 major matches until September 1847 and was the county ground of Sussex CCC in its early years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/348_f.html CricketArchive – ground profile]. Retrieved on 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brighton club was often representative of Sussex as a county and it ultimately became one of the main interests in the formation of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] in 1839.

Brighton and Hove Cricket Club maintained close connections to Brighton Cricket Club prior to the later becoming Sussex County Cricket Club.

During the 1970s and 1980s up to the present day a number of cricket professionals having played for Brighton and Hove have gone on to play for Sussex, Middlesex, Surrey and other counties and countries most notably England, Pakistan and South Africa.

The brothers Wells Colin and Alan played for Brighton and Hove Cricket Club before Alan represented England against the West Indies and Colin (Sussex), also brothers Willows Alan represented Sussex and Roly Middlesex during the 1970s and 1980s both played for Brighton and Hove along with Tony Graig (England)and Kepler Wessells(Australia and South Africa)along with Andy Dindar (Middlesex)this trend continues to this day with Sussex and other county players representing Brighton and Hove Cricket Club.

==Past and present==
[[File:אבא אבן בפתיחה.jpg|thumb|Minister Aba Even in the opening of Caesarea's golf course]]

When [[James Armand de Rothschild]] visited the Roman ruins in Caesarea, they reminded him of the golf courses back in [[Scotland]], and as a veteran golfer he decided to build a golf course in Caesarea.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

De Rothschild died before he could realize his vision, and after his death the James de Rothschild Foundation was established to fulfill his dream. The Foundation appointed the British representative of the family, Max Rowe, to turn the dream into reality. He organized a special committee whose members included, among others, the mayor of Jerusalem [[Teddy Kollek]], the Director General of the Ministry of Tourism, Meir de Shalit, and the Foreign Minister at the time, [[Abba Eban]], who headed the committee. The committee commissioned the architect Fred Smith. After design difficulties and efforts to find suitable grass that could withstand the Middle-Eastern climate, the course was built and an irrigation system that included an underground network of pipes was installed.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The committee set out to draft golfers and to promote the sport in Israel and the golf course abroad. The opening ceremony, in January 1961, was attended by prominent politicians.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The “Israel Golf Federation” was established in 1965, four years after the opening of the golf club.

The Club was renovated and upgraded several times over the years, as systems were replaced and modernized, requiring huge financial resources. In 1980, after a new irrigation system was installed at a cost of millions of Israeli [[shekel]]s, the members convened a general meeting to petition Edmond de Rothschild to increase the annual subsidy for the club. He rejected the demand and transferred management of the club to the Caesarea Development Corporation.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Among the visitors to the club have been [[Sean Connery]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Danny Kaye]]. Notable Israeli figures included [[Chaim Herzog]], who were members.{{cn|date=August 2017}} [[Laetitia Beck]] took her first steps as a golfer at the Caesarea Golf Course, and it was in Caesarea that her parents, avid golfers, made their home. In 2008 Laetitia was chosen as one of Israel’s “sportswomen of the decade” as part of the State of Israel’s 60th anniversary celebrations.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

[[File:גומה 7.jpg|thumb|hole no. 7 ]]

The golf course was reopened in 2009, after it was completely redesigned and renovated by architect [[Pete Dye]]. As a passionate supporter of environmentally-friendly golf courses, Dye planned the course based on environmental and landscape preservation values. In 2010 the Caesarea golf course joined the list of the [[Rolex]] World's Top 1000 Golf Courses.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The club now spans 6750 sq/m and has two golf courses: a professional 18-hole course, the only one in Israel that meets international standards, and another 9-hole course used mainly for practice and for learning the game.  Since 1961 the Club hosts the [[Maccabiah Games]] once every four years.

A '''camel spin''', also known in Europe as a '''parallel spin''', is one of the three basic [[figure skating spins]], along with the [[sit spin]] and [[upright spin]]. The basic camel spin position is defined as one in which the free leg is extended backwards with the knee held above hip level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id=482 |title= ISU Communication No. 1445 |access-date= 2008-07-24 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071022215506/http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id=482# |archive-date= 2007-10-22 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Most sources credit the invention of the camel spin to British skater [[Cecilia Colledge]], who first performed it successfully in competition in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;http://figureskating.about.com/od/glossaryofskatingterms/g/camel.htm Jo Ann Schneider Farris - ''Camel Spin'', Accessed on June 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[layback spin]], also invented by Colledge, the camel was originally considered a move for women only.

The origin of the spin's name is disputed. Most authorities believe that the name originated when a skater performed the spin with her upper body and free leg drooping down, giving the illusion of a hunched camel. According to figure skating coach [[Gustave Lussi]], the spin was invented not by Colledge but by an Australian skater named Campbell, thus explaining that "Campbell spin" became [[Linguistic corruption|corrupted]] into "camel spin".

The Grafström spin may predate the invention of the "regular" camel spin. Although it is named after [[Gillis Grafström]], its best practitioner is said to be [[Czechoslovakia]]n skater [[Otto Gold]], who won the silver medal at the 1930 [[European Figure Skating Championships]].

[[Dick Button]] is credited with inventing the flying camel spin in the 1940s. It was originally known as the ''Button camel''.

The "illusion spin" was accidentally invented by [[Jacqueline du Bief]] when she lost control on the entrance to a camel spin.

Several female [[pair skater]]s have suffered head/face injuries after their partners accidentally drifted too close during side-by-side camel spins – [[Elena Berezhnaya]], [[Jessica Dubé]], [[Mandy Wötzel]], and [[Galina Maniachenko]].

==Variations==
* '''Flying''' camel spin – formerly known as a [[Dick Button|Button]] camel, initiated with a jump from a forward outside edge to a back camel spin.
* '''Layover''' – performed by upturning the torso and free leg so that the skater's torso and free foot are pointing toward the ceiling, rather than toward the ice. This spin is frequently seen in [[artistic roller skating]], where it is called a "layback spin" (but is distinct from the [[layback spin]] performed on ice).
** '''Bent-leg layover''' – similar to a layover, except with a bent free leg. [[Josée Chouinard]]&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Smith, ''Figure Skating: A Celebration'', {{ISBN|0-7710-2819-9}}, page 252&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuna Kim]] are among the best-known practitioners of this spin variation. Both have used it as one of their signature moves.
* '''Catch-foot''' camel – performed by the skater grasping the free leg's blade with either hand. The skater's torso remains pointed toward the ice, and the free leg is held upward. A catch-foot camel with free leg extended upwards is sometimes called a ''one-hand [[Biellmann spin|Biellman]]'' or a ''half-[[Biellmann spin|Biellmann]]''—named for Swiss skater [[Denise Biellmann]], who popularized the move in the 1970s and '80s.
** '''Doughnut''' or '''donut''' spin – a catch-foot camel, but the skater's head is pulled toward the free leg's foot so that the skater's head, torso, and free leg form a [[torus|toric]] shape parallel to the ice. [[Oksana Baiul]], [[Yukari Nakano]] frequently perform this spin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071123&amp;content_id=37613&amp;vkey=ice_news Nakano still determined to achieve more on the ice 2007-11-23, Icenetwork.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gillis Grafström|Grafström]]''' spin – camel with a bent skating leg, with the free foot still in the [[Glossary of ballet terms|arabesque]] position.
* '''[[Dorothy Hamill|Hamill]] camel''' – not a true camel per se, but rather a transition from a backwards camel to a backwards sit spin by bending the skating leg and dropping the torso and free leg simultaneously.
* '''Illusion''' spin – performed by the skater keeping their head, torso, and free leg in a straight line, and rhythmically bobbing above and below the position of a standard camel spin. [[Tiffany Chin]] performed this spin frequently as an amateur.
* '''Forward Camel with change of edge''' – this spin starts off as a regular camel spin. Then the skater changes back to a forward outside edge and continues to spin in small forward outside circles and then switches back to a regular camel spin. This move requires a lot of control and power.

It is the home of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] [[Major League Baseball]] team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games.

The stadium frequently hosts the Phillips 66 [[Big 12 Baseball Tournament]] and is slated to host the tournament through 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big 12 Baseball Tournament|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=211367896}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ballpark also often hosts games of the Bedlam Series, in which the [[Oklahoma Sooners baseball|Oklahoma Sooners]] face the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball|Oklahoma State Cowboys]].

The ballpark also hosts numerous other events both during and outside the baseball season. Those events include the Oklahoma High School Baseball Series in March, the snow tubing WinterFest November-January, a variety of community walks and runs, concerts, parties, corporate outings, meetings, seminars and more&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OKC Ballpark Events|url=http://okcballparkevents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Construction==
Oklahoma City voters approved a temporary one-cent sales tax increase in December 1993 to fund the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan]] (MAPS), the city's capital improvement program created to build and upgrade sports, recreation, entertainment, cultural and convention facilities.&lt;ref name="MAPS"&gt;{{cite web |title=MAPS|url=http://www.okc.gov/maps|publisher=City of Oklahoma City|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 66 months the sales tax was in effect, more than $309 million was collected.&lt;ref name="MAPS"/&gt;

The $34 million&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T Bricktown Ballpark"/&gt;  Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark became the first major MAPS structure to be completed, helping spark a revitalization in Bricktown. Architectural Design Group of Oklahoma City served as the ballpark's architect and Oscar J. Boldt Construction Co., was the ballpark's general contractor.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T Bricktown Ballpark"/&gt;

Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on October 10, 1995,&lt;ref name="groundbreaking"/&gt; but actual construction did not begin until August 1996 due to escalating construction costs and the redesign of the ballpark by architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bricktown Ballpark On Deck Construction Firm Pledges Fast Start|first=Charolette|last=Aiken|url=http://newsok.com/article/2548856|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=August 14, 1996|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark opened on April 16, 1998 with the RedHawks falling to the [[Edmonton Trappers]] 6-3 in front of a sellout crowd of 14,066 fans.&lt;ref name="openinggame"/&gt;

==Features==
Statues of legendary baseball players with Oklahoma ties stand before the ballpark's three main gates.

A 7-foot-6 bronze statue of [[Mickey Mantle]] stands on a 3-foot granite base at the third base pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mantle Honored|first=Bob|last=Hersom|url=http://newsok.com/mantle-honored-redhawks-to-unveil-statue-of-yankees-star/article/2607134|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=March 25, 1998|accessdate=December 26, 2013|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantle, the [[New York Yankees]]' switch-hitting star, was born in [[Spavinaw]] and raised in [[Commerce, Oklahoma|Commerce]]. The Baseball Hall of Fame centerfielder's statue was dedicated on the ballpark's opening day April 16, 1998.

Baseball Hall of Fame catcher [[Johnny Bench]] grew up in [[Binger, Oklahoma|Binger]], and a nine-foot statue of the former [[Cincinnati Reds]] star greets fans at the ballpark's home plate gate. The statue was dedicated July 27, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cast in Greatness|first=Bob|last=Hersom|url=http://newsok.com/cast-in-greatness-bench-to-be-honored-with-statue-at-the-brick/article/2749446|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=July 26, 2001|accessdate=December 26, 2013|page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His statue sits outside of the ballpark's right field gate.

Approximately 480,000 bricks make up the exterior of the ballpark, which mixes retro charm with modern accommodations. A 10-foot tall, 185-foot long LED video board was added in left field for the 2011 season.

Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark has continued to undergo numerous improvements and renovations in recent years.

In 2012, the Legends Lounge concourse suite was upgraded and the concession stands overhauled. Ballpark signage was upgraded in 2013 and new stairs installed from the concourse to the club and press levels. Three sections of bleachers in left field were replaced with ballpark seats in 2014, while digital screens and drink rails were also added throughout the concourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OKC Dodgers Media Guide|url=http://www.milb.com/documents/9/0/4/222293904/2017_OKC_Dodgers_Media_Guide_o256bl9k.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Budweiser Deck was constructed and introduced in 2015, replacing the bleacher seating in left field. The ballpark’s playground was relocated and upgraded also for this season. Four 4Topps tables were installed near home plate and the Devon Energy Deck was updated in right field. The Team Store was completely renovated.

The renovations continued in 2017 with the complete overhaul of the Oklahoma Fidelity Bank Club, formerly the Diamond Lounge, on the club level. The space doubled in square footage and included a new bar design, additional seating capacity, 14 TVs as well as upgraded fixtures, flooring and furniture. A new double suite, allowing the addition of a Champions Membership, was created as well. Furniture throughout all of the entertainment suites on the club and press levels was upgraded. Additional audio, landscaping and security improvements were also made throughout the ballpark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OKC Dodgers Media Guide|url=http://www.milb.com/documents/9/0/4/222293904/2017_OKC_Dodgers_Media_Guide_o256bl9k.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The ballpark has received numerous accolades since its opening in 1998, including being named the No. 2 minor league ballpark in the country by ''Baseball America'' the year it opened&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Magazine Praises Bricktown Ballpark|url=http://newsok.com/magazine-praises-bricktown-ballpark/article/2636624|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=December 15, 1998|accessdate=December 26, 2013|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and being hailed as one of the country's top 10 minor league stadiums in the 2013 10Best Readers' Choice Awards, presented by ''USA Today''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Minor League Ballparks|url=http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-minor-league-ballpark/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name changes==
The stadium was to be called "Southwestern Bell Park". When the general public learned that Bricktown wasn't part of the name, there was an uproar.  Due to public pressure, the stadium opened as '''Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark''' (later '''SBC Bricktown Ballpark''' after [[Southwestern Bell]]'s name change). In March 2006, the ballpark was renamed '''AT&amp;T Bricktown Ballpark''' following the merger between SBC and [[Old AT&amp;T]].  After AT&amp;T reevaulated its sports marketing strategy, they gave up naming rights, resulting in the '''RedHawks Field at Bricktown''' designation for 2011.

On April 4, 2012, it was announced that [[Newcastle Gaming Center]] in the nearby suburb of [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] (owned by the [[Chickasaw Nation]]) had purchased naming rights to the ballpark, with the new '''Newcastle Field at Bricktown''' name effective immediately.&lt;ref name="newcastle"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKC RedHawks Introduce 'Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark'|first=J.

One day later on April 5, 2012 (the opening day of the 2012 RedHawks season), Newcastle Gaming Center announced that it would once again rename the ballpark as the '''Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chickasaws Reverse Course on Bricktown Ballpark Name|first=Berry|last=Tramel|url=http://newsok.com/chickasaws-reverse-course-on-bricktown-ballpark-name/article/3663851|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RedHawks, Chickasaw Nation Announce Naming Rights Agreement|url=http://www.koco.com/sports/30842970/detail.html|work=[[KOCO-TV|KOCO]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of ballparks in Oklahoma City==
Amateur teams started playing on makeshift fields shortly after the state's Land Run in 1889 in a centrally located site near where Bricktown sits today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Back Where They Started|first=John|last=Rohde|url=http://newsok.com/back-where-they-started-new-park-is-within-block-of-where-citys-first-amateur-teams-played-in-1800s/article/2609292|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=April 12, 1998|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark sits within a block of the original site.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The city's first ballpark structure was Colcord Field, located along the banks of the North Canadian River in 1904, which was home to Oklahoma City's first professional baseball team. The facility was also called Saratoga Park, Liberty Park and Western League Park before being destroyed by flooding in 1923.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Holland Field, located at NW 4 and Pennsylvania, was built in 1924 and later became Tribe Park in the early 1940s and Texas League Park in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

All Sports Stadium opened in 1962 and was located at NW 10th Street and May at the state fairgrounds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 89ers played there for 36 seasons.

Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark celebrated its 20th season in 2017 at which numerous festivities were held throughout the season to mark this milestone, including a kickoff luncheon prior to the season featuring former OKC mayors and PCL President Branch B. Rickey. A commemorative brick display benefitting the OKC Dodgers Baseball Foundation was unveiled on the Mickey Mantle Plaza and fans were able to vote online throughout the season to select an All-Ballpark Team and determine the best players to step on the field at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. Ceremonial first pitches took place throughout the season, players wore special 20th Season jerseys, new merchandise was introduced in the Team Store and a 20th Season Stein was given away to fans to help mark the special occasion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OKC Dodgers Media Guide|url=http://www.milb.com/documents/9/0/4/222293904/2017_OKC_Dodgers_Media_Guide_o256bl9k.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Donauparkhalle''' was an indoor ice rink in Vienna-[[Donaustadt]] in [[Austria]]. It was originally built as an expo venue in 1964, next to an earlier landfill in [[Donaupark]] near [[Kaisermühlen, Vienna|Kaisermühlen]], to be used for the garden-themed exhibition Wiener [[Internationale Gartenschau]]. Two years later, it was rebuilt into an indoor ice rink.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samariter.at/ueber_uns/ueber_uns_detail/article/asboe-floridsdorf-donaustadt-die-erfolgsstory/?cHash=8eca3e0e11 : Samariterbund&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[1966/1967 Austrian Hockey League|1966/1967]] season, [[Wiener EV]] played its first home games inside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiener-eisloewen.at/wp/?page_id=273 :Wiener EV's history&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was used as home venue for the Vienna club [[WAT Stadlau]]. The venue was popular for its acoustics. The venue was demolished following the [[1990/1991 Austrian Hockey League|1990/1991]] season, as the area was planned to be used for the 1995 world exhebition that was never hosted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">{{nr|date=April 2018}}{{nn|date=April 2018}}'''EN 13537''' (or '''EN13537''') is a [[List of EN standards|European standard]] designed to standardize the temperature ratings on [[sleeping bag]]s manufactured and/or sold in Europe. As of January 1, 2005 a [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] criterion came into effect covering the testing and publication of temperature ratings for sleeping bags. The new criterion differs from the standards that existed formerly.  In 2016 this standard was superseded by [[ISO EN 23537]]:2016.

== Sleeping bag labeling ==
A European criterion for sleeping bags came into effect on January 1, 2005.   This criterion has significant legal connotations for brands, distributors and retailers selling sleeping bags in Europe. 

There is a key change to the way sleeping bags are labeled.  A European criterion means that all [[sleeping bag]]s adhering to the criterion will have the temperature ratings set by a standard laboratory test.  This means that sleeping bags from different manufacturers will all have comparable temperatures. 

There is no legal obligation for brands to conform, as the criterion is optional.

"EN 13537:2002 Requirements for Sleeping Bags" is the official European criterion for the classification of sleeping bags.  EN13537 applies to all sleeping bags with the exemption of sleeping bags for military use and sleeping bags for extreme temperatures, i.e., comfort range below -25°C.  The criterion was originally published in 2002 and has now been adopted in most European countries, and also used by numerous outdoor companies outside of Europe.
This norm was superseded in 2013 by EN 13537:2012 and in 2016 by ISO EN 23537:2016.

The criterion is used in the following countries: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and [[United Kingdom]].

EN13537 requires a [[thermal manikin]] test which produces four temperature results&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; upper limit, comfort, lower limit, and extreme.  These temperatures were worked for normal consumers.

The standard measures four temperature ratings:

* ''Upper Limit''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the temperature at which a standard male can sleep without excessive [[perspiration]].  It is established with the hood and zippers open and with the arms outside of the bag.
* ''Comfort''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the temperature at which a standard female can expect to sleep comfortably in a relaxed position.
* ''Lower Limit''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the temperature at which a standard male can sleep for eight hours in a curled position without waking.
* ''Extreme''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the minimum temperature at which a standard female can remain for six hours without risk of death from [[hypothermia]] (though [[frostbite]] is still possible).

These ratings are taken assuming that the subject is using a sleeping pad, tent and is wearing one base layer of thermal underwear.

For the purpose of these measurements, a "standard man" is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 73&amp;nbsp;kg; a "standard woman" is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.60 m and a weight of 60&amp;nbsp;kg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4499">The '''El Cajon Boulevard riot''' was the official name of what the [[San Diego Union Tribune|San Diego Union]] called the Drag Strip Riot. Some people consider the El Cajon Boulevard Riot one of the first major youth riots of the 1960s.

==About==
The riot began during the evening of August 20, 1960 as an organized protest over the closing of [[Hourglass Field]], an unused [[United States Navy]] airfield, to [[drag racing]]. The drag racing had been organized by the [[San Diego Timing Association]], a local group of [[hot rod]] clubs, but was unauthorized. The Navy and the police looked the other way because Hourglass Field was the only off-street venue available for drag racing at the time. On August 8, 1960, three (possibly four) bystanders were injured during a drag race. The Navy had been under some pressure to crack down on the drag racing and shut down the airfield to drag racing after the incident. Car clubs lobbied the city for an official drag racing site but were denied as the San Diego Police Chief A.E. Jensen said "Drag strips actually stimulate highway recklessness among those viewing such contests".&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080717/news_1ez17history.html&lt;/ref&gt;



The Protest was organized by thousands of fliers that were spread around town at coffee shops, car clubs, movie theaters and other places where people would gather. These fliers stated that there would be a "mass protest meeting" on El Cajon Boulevard on Sunday August 12. The news was also spread by the a DJ named Dick Boynton on the local radio station.&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080717/news_1ez17history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later The police arrested a printer by the name of Herbert Sturdyvin, 20, on suspicion of conspiracy on printing and printing of the fliers that were used to organize the protest. He was released two days later without charges due to the fact that the police did not have enough evidence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jalopyjournal.com/forum/threads/1960-san-diego-drag-street-riots.688267/&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to an organized mass protest the night of August 20 and 21 at the intersection of El Cajon Boulevard and Cherokee Street in San Diego. The crowd of about 3,000 teenagers and adults blocked three blocks of El Cajon Boulevard (one of San Diego's major east-west thoroughfares) and began holding impromptu drag races with just enough room for cars to race two-abreast down the street. Around 2 A.M. more than 65 police officers began quelling the riot first by ordering them to disperse and then moving in with tear gas and riot sticks. Some protestors tried to fight back by throwing coke bottles and rocks at the police and trying to overturn police cars. It took 3 hours to control the mob and two police officers were hurt during the course of the night. At the scene of the riot 80 adult demonstrators and 36 juveniles were arrested for the riot. The next night several Drag racers drove around town taunting the police leading to a further 100 people being arrested including over 30 juveniles who were charged with curfew violations. &lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080717/news_1ez17history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the riot the City of San Diego promised to form a committee to look into the problem of a lack of drag racing sites and the president of the national Hot Rod Association also pledged his support to getting local enthusiasts a place to race. Eventually all of these pressures came together and two new Drag racing strips were opened. The San Diego Raceway opened in Ramona in 1963 and the Carlsbad Raceway opened in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;http://johnstraub.blogspot.com/2010/08/san-diego-rodders-riot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Igualada Muleteer's Museum - Antoni Ros collection''' (in [[Catalan language]] '''Museu del Traginer - Col·lecció Antoni Ros''') is a museum located in [[Igualada]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], that displays the evolution of transport using [[mule]]s, [[horse]]s and other animals, and the different relationships between several trades that paved the way for the profession of [[muleteer]], including the [[cart]]er, [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], [[saddle]]r, [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], [[wicker]] [[Basket weaving|weaver]], [[farrier]], [[veterinarian]], [[stablehand]], [[Lumberjack|woodcutter]] and [[wood]] [[hauler]], [[Horse harness|harness maker]] and [[blacksmith]].

The museum displays 39 [[carriage]]s and [[cart]]s and a total of 2.175 items, most of them part of the collection created by [[Antoni Ros i Vilarrubias]] (1942–1994).&lt;ref name=""&gt;[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/revistaetnologia/article/viewFile/55270/63379 El Museu del Traginer- Col·lecció Antoni Ros:Un projecte museològic integratiu], Jordi Vilalta i Areñas {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located near the old city center, at an old farmhouse from the 18th century, which was purchased in the 1970s by the Ros family, a family closely linked to the "Antic Gremi de Traginers d'Igualada" muleteer association.

It is distributed into three main thematic areas ("oficis" - [[Job (role)|occupations]]; "selles i guarniments" – [[saddle]]s and [[bridle]]s; "carros i carruatges" - [[cart]]s and [[carriage]]s).

== History ==
[[File:Museu del Traginer (Igualada) - Sala Superior.JPG|thumb|right|Carriages at the upper floor of the museum]]
The "Traginer d'Igualada" [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] was created in 1994 in Igualada with the objective of creating the Muleteer's Museum.

The Ros family, owner of the collection created by Antoni Ros i Vilarrubias, was in charge of the foundation, and contacted a team of professionals that prepared the Museum project. The museum was permanently open on September 24, 2005, and became part of the museum network managed by the [[Diputació de Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="dip"&gt;Diputació de Barcelona, [http://www.diba.es/museuslocals/nouwebmuseus/Buscar/Fichas.asp?TipoFicha=3&amp;Codigo=1174937 Fitxa del Museu a la Xarxa de Museus Locals]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The museum has more than 1000 square meters of exhibition space, distributed in 3 floors:

* At the 1st floor there is a room displaying the muleteer trade evolution, and a "Sala dels Oficis" room displaying 10 trades including the [[cart]]er, [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], [[saddle]]r, [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], [[wicker]] [[Basket weaving|weaver]], [[farrier]], [[veterinarian]], [[stablehand]], [[Lumberjack|woodcutter]] and [[wood]] [[hauler]], [[Horse harness|harness maker]] and [[blacksmith]].
* At the 2nd floor there is a "Sala dels Guarniments" room displaying [[horse tack]],  a "[[Tres Tombs]]" room showing this tradition, and a "Sala dels carros de servei i pagesia" room showing carts and farming items.
* At the 3rd floor there is a "Sala dels Carruatges de la Burgesia" with carriages, and a room dedicated to Antoni Ros, founder of the museum collection, where there is a display of some sculptures created by him.

The '''Israel men's national volleyball team''' represents [[Israel]] in international men's [[volleyball]] competitions and friendly matches. It is governed by the [[Israel Volleyball Association]]. Just like in other sports, even though Israel is geographically located in Asia, it competes in European competitions due to the Arab boycott in the 1970s.

'''The Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education''' ('''LNIPE''')&lt;ref name="acronym"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abbreviations.com/term/1508824 | title=acronym | accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Lakshmibai National University of Physical Education and Lakshmibai College of Physical Education, Gwalior) is a [[Government of India]] sponsored [[deemed university]], under the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]], dedicated to promoting excellence in [[sports]] and [[physical education]] in the country. The campus is on the [[Agra]] - [[Mumbai]] National Highway at Shaktinagar, [[Gwalior]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.

== Profile ==
[[File:Laxmibai's statue in Solapur.JPG|200px|left|thumb|An equestrian statue of Rani Lakshmibai]]

The Lakshmibai National University of Physical Education began its life in 1957, in the form of '''Lakshmibai College of Physical Education''' (LCPE), in memory of [[Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi]], as a college of physical education, affiliated to [[Vikram University|Vikram University, Ujjain]]. In 1964, the college was shifted to [[Jiwaji University]].

In 1973, the college was renamed to '''Lakshmibai National College of Physical Education''' (LNCPE) and nine years later, in 1982, was upgraded as an autonomous college. A further name change occurred in 1995, to '''Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education'''. In 2000, the present name of '''Lakshmibai National University of Physical Education''' was accepted when it was declared, by the Government of India, as a [[deemed university]], handing over the affairs to the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]], which is funding all its activities. In 2017, it was renamed as '''Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education''' after a UGC's order to not use "University" word in deemed university's name.

The main objectives of the institute are aimed at
* the development of qualified physical education teachers; 
* assisting other sports-based institutes and organizations in India through academic and professional guidance; 
* promotion of sports and physical educations programs across the country; 
* and performance as a centre of excellence in the fields of physical education and sports.

Is also aims at community services in sports and the propagation of sports through audio-visual and print media.

LNIPE is in Shaktinagar, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, on the [[Agra - Mumbai Highway]], on land measuring 153 acres, which houses a faculty block, auditorium, research block, laboratories and administration building. It is a [[National Assessment and Accreditation Council]] accredited and [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] approved institution and has obtained [[ISO 9001:2008]], [[ISO 14001|ISO 14001:2004]] and [[ISO 18001:2007]] certifications through [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS).&lt;ref name="LNUPE@Glance" /&gt;

==Departments==

===Department of Physical Education Pedagogy===
The original name was the 'Department of Teacher Education' when it was launched in 2003, with the introduction of three-year BPE course, aimed at grooming quality physical education teachers in India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4238">In the [[sport]] of [[cricket]], a '''leg bye''' is a run scored by the batting team if the [[batsman]] has not hit the ball with his or her [[cricket bat|bat]], but the ball has hit the batsman's body or protective gear. It is covered by Law 23 of the [[Laws of Cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-23-bye-and-leg-bye/ |title=Law 23 – Bye and leg bye |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring leg byes==
If the ball deflects off the batsman's body he can attempt to score runs in a similar manner as if he had hit the ball. The number of runs scored are scored as leg byes – they are added to the team's total, but not to the number of runs scored by the batsman nor to the runs conceded by the bowler. If the ball deflects off the batsman's body and travels all the way to the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]], the batting team immediately scores four leg byes, similar to if the ball had been hit to the boundary for a [[four (cricket)|four]].

The only part of the batsman's body to which the rule does not apply is the hand or hands (that is, the batsman's gloves) holding the bat, which are deemed for the sake of the rules to be a part of the bat. If the ball strikes a hand which for whatever reason is not holding the bat, then leg byes may be scored. However, if the batsman deliberately allows the ball to hit a hand which is not holding the bat no leg byes can be scored, and he may on appeal be given out [[obstructing the field]].

Leg byes may only be scored if the ball hits the batsman while the batsman was either:
*attempting to hit the ball with his bat, or
*attempting to evade being hit by the ball.
If the batsman was attempting neither of these, and the ball hits his body, it is a [[dead ball (cricket)|dead ball]] and runs may not be scored. If the batsmen attempt to score runs in this instance, the fielding team may attempt to run either of them out. If the batting pair complete such a "run" when the ball is dead, the [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] signals dead ball, the run is not scored, and the batsmen must return to their [[wicket]]s as before the run attempt. 

If it appears that the ball would have hit the stumps were it not for the batsman's legs, the batsman may be dismissed [[leg before wicket]].

Leg byes are the most common form of [[Extra (cricket)|extras]] scored in Test cricket. The average number of leg byes scored in a Test match is about 20; in a 50 over game it is about 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aggregate extras in international cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;template=results;type=aggregate;view=extras|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most leg byes in a single test innings is 35, conceded by [[England cricket team|England]] against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] in the Proteas' tour of England, on 1 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/296911.html England v South Africa, 2008 Basil D'Oliveira Trophy – 3rd Test, Scorecard], Cricinfo, Retrieved on 5 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring notation==

The conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted [[Bye (cricket)|bye]] symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.

==Validity==
Prior to his retirement from Test cricket Australian captain [[Steve Waugh]] called for leg byes to be removed from the sport, commenting: "I don't think you should get runs when you miss the ball."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/aus_v_ind_2003-04/3362957.stm Goodbye to leg-byes?], BBC Sports, Retrieved on 5 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umpire's signal==
Umpires signal a leg bye with a hand touching their raised knee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/cricket/rules/umpire_signals/newsid_3809000/3809991.stm Umpire's signal], BBC Sport, Retrieved on 5 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[cheerleading]] jumps.

; X Jump/Spread Eagle :  You simply prep, swing, and jump with your arms pin a high V and your legs spread apart. Just jump off the ground and it will look like an X. This jump is generally used to practice group timing who and snapping legs down from a jump.
; Pencil/T/Straight Jump : This jump is probably the most simple jump. It inv completely straight with your arms in T-motion or in a point above your head. This jump is usually the first you would learn. Mainly used for correcting the body position for the main jumps.
; Toe-Touch : In this jump, the legs are straddled and straight, parallel to the ground,  toes pointed, knees are back, and your hands are in fists or blades and arms in a "T" motion. Despite its name, you do not touch your toes during a toe touch, you reach out farther in front of your legs. keep your back straight and bring your legs up to you. This is the most common cheer jump.
; Tuck : A jump in which the cheerleader uses stomach muscles to pull the legs up with thighs as close to the chest as possible, knees facing upward as if in a tucked position.
; Hurdler : The straight leg is either forward (a front hurdler) with arms in candlesticks, or out to the side (a side hurdler) with arms in a T. The bent knee faces the crowd in a side hurdler and the ground in a front hurdler. 
; Right hurdler: a right hurdler is basically the same as a hurdler you're just facing the right, and the same with left side.
; Pike : This jump is among the most difficult of jumps. Both legs are straight out, knees locked. Arms are in a touchdown motion out in front to create a folded position in the air, this motion is also called "candlesticks". This is often performed at a ninety-degree angle to the audience in order to show off the air position. 
; Around the World : The Around the World, or the pike-out, is a jump where the performer hits a pike and then whips his or her legs quickly back around into a toe touch. This jump is regarded as difficult to accomplish, because two positions must be reached in the very short time while the jumper is in the air. Not commonly used.
; Herkie : Named for Lawrence R. Herkimer, the founder of the [[National Cheerleaders Association]], this jump is similar to a side-hurdler, except that instead of both arms being in a "T" shaped motion, both arms are opposite of what the leg beneath them is doing.  Example of this would be the straight arm would be on the side of the bent leg, and the bent arm is on the side of the straight leg.  One other variation of this includes the bent leg is pointing straight down, instead of out like the side-hurdler.  The jump is speculated to have been invented because Herkie was not able to do an actual side-hurdler.
; Left Side: the leg to the audience is tucked in while the other is out.
; Right side: same as left also turn the left/right while approaching the jump
; Cheer leader jump: This jump is commonly used in cheer leading and on a dance team, you typically will have your arms up in a "V" above your head and then rotate one of your arms backwards and right after kick one of your legs up and pointed straight in the direction of your face. 
; Double Hook : A jump where the legs are in the "cheer sit" position.
; Double Jump : This is the name for when one performs any jump twice in a row.
; Triple Jump: This is the name for any jump with three jumps in a row connected by the "swing". This is most commonly used among the elite divisions.
; Jump combination: The official name for a series of jumps.
; Power Jump : A jump where there is no swinging of the arms in preparation for the jump. All the power for the jump comes from the legs. This jump is also known as a "Dip Jump."
;Turntable: A jump where the cheerleader's legs are up and are rotated from side to side while the arms are swished back and forth.

; Jump Tumbling: Depending on the level is how to determine the difficulty of the tumbling element out of the jump. Toe-touch to back handspring, back tuck, standing full. Or to front walkover, front handspring, aerial, etc. There are multiple elements to be chosen out of a jump. Level 4 from USASF is the first level that includes a jump to back tuck.

Already a year and half Meteor is closed in Dnipropetrovsk (Кто и когда разморозит Ледовый? Уже полтора года в Днепропетровске закрыт «Метеор»)]. Dnipro city portal. 15 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it was closed for reconstruction for the [[2015 EuroBasket]], but the construction was later suspended.

It is used by [[HK Dneprovskie Volki Dnepropetrovsk|HC Dniprovski Vovky]] and sometimes by a basketball team [[BC Dnipro]].

'''Montreal Forum''' ({{lang-fr|Le '''Forum de Montréal'''}}) was an [[indoor arena]] located facing [[Cabot Square, Montreal|Cabot Square]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. Called "the most storied building in hockey history" by ''[[Sporting News]]'',&lt;ref name=ERA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18096190.html | publisher=High Beam Research | title= The end of an era. (the Montreal Forum) | year=1996 | accessdate=2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the home of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Montreal Maroons]] from 1924 to 1938 and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] from 1926 to 1996. The Forum was built by the [[Brookfield Properties|Canadian Arena Company]] in 159 days.&lt;ref name="VMC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Musée de la Civilisation de Québec|title=Famous Canadian Arenas|work=Hockey: A Nation's Passion|publisher=Canadian Heritage Information Network|year=2001|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Hockey/English/Arenas/arenas.html|accessdate=July 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925085511/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Hockey/English/Arenas/arenas.html|archivedate=September 25, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located at the northeast corner of [[Atwater Avenue|Atwater]] and [[Saint Catherine Street|Ste-Catherine West]] ([[Atwater (Montreal Metro)|Metro Atwater]]), the building was historically significant as it was home to 24 [[Stanley Cup]] championships (22 of the Canadiens and two of the Montreal Maroons, for whom the arena was originally built). It was also home to the [[Montreal Roadrunners]] and [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]].

==History==
[[File:Forum Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|The Montreal Forum under construction in 1924.]]
The idea to build the Forum in 1923 is credited to Sir [[Edward Wentworth Beatty]], president of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. At the suggestion of Senator [[Donat Raymond]], [[William Northey]] developed a plan for a 12,500 seat capacity rink. Plans were scaled back for financial reasons to a rink of 9,300 seats. Even at the reduced size, the rink could not immediately find financing. The Forum would eventually be financed by H. L. Timmins. The site selected was the site of a [[roller skating]] rink named the Forum, and the name was kept. The site had previously been the site of an outdoor ice hockey rink, used by [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank]] and [[Lester Patrick]], [[Art Ross]] and [[Russell Bowie]] as youths.&lt;ref&gt;Mouton(1987), pp. 111–113&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum opened on November 29, 1924, at a total cost of [[Canadian dollar|{{dollarsign|CAD}}]]1,500,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|1500000|1924}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) with an original [[seating capacity]] of 9,300. It underwent two renovations, in 1949 and 1968.&lt;ref name=FORUM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/MontrealCanadiens/oldindex.htm|publisher=Ballparks.com|title=Montreal Forum|date=1996–2006|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Forum closed in 1996 it had a capacity of 17,959, which included approximately 1,600 in standing room.

By the time of the 1968 renovations, a centre hanging digital scoreclock was installed, designed by the Day Sign Company of Toronto and similar to those installed at the [[Boston Garden]] and [[Chicago Stadium]] during the 1970s. A new centre hanging scoreclock, designed by Daktronics, was installed in the mid-1980s and contained on each side a color matrix board.  Along with one other [[Original Six]] indoor ice hockey arena, the [[Boston Garden]], the Montreal Forum used a high-pitched siren to signal the end of an NHL game's period — the siren would later be re-installed in the Forum's successor facility, the [[Bell Centre]] (and still in use there), much as the [[TD Garden]] in Boston inherited the lower-pitched Garden's siren. A [[Rainforest Cafe]] was planned to open at the location following its closure, but was never built.

===Ice hockey===
[[File:Hockey. Chicago &amp; Canadiens BAnQ P48S1P02510.jpg|thumb|left|Canadiens vs. [[Chicago Blackhawks]] at the Forum]]
While hosting the Canadiens and Maroons on Thursdays and Saturdays, the Forum also hosted the [[Quebec Senior Hockey League]], featuring the [[Montreal Victorias]], [[Montreal Royals]] and the Montreal Canadiens amateur team on Wednesdays and Sundays. The Quebec Junior Hockey League played on Monday nights, the Bank League on Tuesdays and the Railways and Telephone League played on Friday nights.&lt;ref&gt;Mouton(1987), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal Forum hosted [[Memorial Cup]] games in 1950, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1973 &amp; 1976, with the Junior Canadiens winning on home ice in 1970. In 1972, the Forum hosted game one of the famous "[[Summit Series]]" between Team Canada and the USSR, the USSR won the game 7-3. The [[1980 NHL Entry Draft]] was hosted at the Forum. It would mark the first time that an NHL Arena hosted the event.&lt;ref&gt;The Montreal Canadiens:100 Years of Glory, D’Arcy Jenish, p.240, Published in Canada by Doubleday, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-385-66325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two visiting teams have ever won the Stanley Cup on Forum ice: the [[New York Rangers]] did so in 1928, defeating the Maroons, while the [[Calgary Flames]] defeated the Canadiens in 1989.

On March 11, 1996, the Montreal Canadiens played their last game at the Montreal Forum, defeating the [[Dallas Stars]] 4-1. The game was televised on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[TQS]] in Canada, and on [[ESPN2]] in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The Stars' [[Guy Carbonneau]], who had captained the Canadiens from 1989 to 1994 (including their 1993 Cup win), took the ceremonial opening faceoff. After the game, many previous hockey greats were presented to the crowd, most notably [[Maurice Richard]] (said to be the Canadiens' most beloved player of all time), who received a sixteen-minute standing ovation from the crowd as he broke down in tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/the-rocket-was-something-special-1.841865|title=The Rocket was something special|last=|first=|date=|work=CBC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symbolic torch—representative of a line quoted from the poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'', "To you from failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high," displayed in the Forum's home dressing room—was carried by [[Émile Bouchard|Emile Bouchard]] out of the Canadiens dressing room to the playing surface. The flaming torch was passed on to each of the former Canadiens captains (Jean Beliveau, Yvan Cournoyer, Henri Richard, Serge Savard, Bob Gainey, and Carbonneau), and finally to the then-current captain [[Pierre Turgeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HOCKEY;Blinking Back the Tears, Montreal Closes Its Forum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/12/sports/hockey-blinking-back-the-tears-montreal-closes-its-forum.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a parade was organized in which the torch was carried down the route to the Molson Centre (which has since been renamed the [[Bell Centre]]). Their first game at the new venue was against the [[New York Rangers]], a game which the Canadiens won.

===Other sports===
The Forum also hosted other sports, including indoor soccer, boxing, lacrosse and tennis. The Forum was a site of five events in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]: [[Gymnastics at the 1976 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]], [[Handball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|handball]] (final), [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|basketball]] (final),&lt;ref name="Official Report-1976 Montreal"/&gt; [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|volleyball]] (final), and [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|boxing]] (final).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1976/1976v2.pdf 1976 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 138-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The gymnastics event included [[Nadia Comăneci|Nadia Comaneci]]'s famous perfect 10, the first in Olympic history.

The Forum was the site of many major [[professional wrestling]] matches, as shown in the 1961 [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary ''[[Wrestling (documentary)|Wrestling]]'' (''La Lutte'').&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=10852|title=Wrestling|work=Collection|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable events===
[[File:Forum de Montreal 1945.jpg|thumb|Forum de Montreal 1945]]
On March 11, 1937, the Forum hosted its only funeral, for Canadiens great [[Howie Morenz]].  Morenz died from complications due to a broken leg, sustained in a game between the Canadiens and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] on January 28. On September 8, 1964, [[The Beatles]] performed at the Forum. Four tracks including a live version of "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]" for ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue]]'' were recorded here. The [[Bee Gees]] played two sold-out concerts here on September 1–2, 1979 during their North American [[Spirits Having Flown Tour]]. The first four tracks off the [[Journey (band)|Journey]] live album ''[[Captured (Journey album)|Captured]]'' were recorded at The Forum on August 8, 1980. In 1981, Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] filmed (and recorded almost all of) their 1981 concert film and album, ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]''. That same year, British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] recorded and filmed their concert film, titled ''[[We Will Rock You (video)|We Will Rock You]]'' (re-released as ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' in 2007), by performing the final two concerts of [[The Game Tour]] there. This had followed earlier performances by the band in 1977 for the [[A Day At The Races Tour]], 1978 for the [[Jazz Tour]], 1980 for the first leg of [[The Game Tour]], and finally in 1982 for the [[Hot Space Tour]]. In March 1983, American musical duo [[Hall &amp; Oates]] filmed and recorded their concert film, Rock 'n Soul Live. The live portions of [[Black Sabbath]]'s video for the song "[[Zero the Hero]]" were filmed in 1983. July 7–8 [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] with her [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] for two sold-out concerts. In July 1993, [[David Bowie]] held a concert for his [[Serious Moonlight Tour]] to promote his new album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''. [[Billy Graham]] held his Mission Quebec in 1990, before nearly 20,000 spectators, which was videotaped for international television syndication as a TV special. Then Canadien [[Ryan Walter]] delivered his testimony at the crusade.

===Seating capacity===
The seating capacity for hockey went as followed:
*9,300, 12,500 with standing room (1924-1949)&lt;ref name="media guide"&gt;2012-2013 Montreal Canadiens Media Guide&lt;/ref&gt;
*13,551, 15,551 with standing room (1949-1968)&lt;ref name="media guide"/&gt;
*16,500, 19,000 with standing room (1968-1978)&lt;ref name="media guide"/&gt;
*16,074, 18,076 with standing room (1978-1991)&lt;ref name="media guide"/&gt;
*16,259, 17,959 with standing room (1991-1996)&lt;ref name="media guide"/&gt;

==After hockey==
[[File:Montreal Forum interior.jpg|thumb|Montreal Forum interior]]
After the Canadiens left the Forum, the building was used to film arena sequences for the [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[Snake Eyes (film)|Snake Eyes]]''.&lt;ref name=EYES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cameraguild.com/interviews/chat_burum/Burum_SnakeEyes.htm|publisher=International Cinematographers Guild|title=Stephen Burum - Snake Eyes|year=1998|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then completely gutted and converted into a downtown entertainment centre called the Pepsi Forum, consisting of an [[AMC Theatres]] [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] theatre (sold to Cineplex Odeon in July 2012), shops and restaurants. Centre ice has been recreated in the centre of the complex complete with a small section of the grandstand, along with a statue of a fan leaning forward in delight (removed in the summer of 2017), while original seats are used as benches throughout the complex. A statue of [[Maurice Richard]] can be found next to the grandstand. On the Saint Catherine Street entrance there is a Quebec Walk of Fame consisting of Richard and [[Céline Dion|Celine Dion]]. Both were on hand for their bronze star's respective unveiling. The Atwater street entrance has a large bronze Montreal Canadiens logo surrounded by 24 bronze [[Stanley Cup]] banners cemented into the sidewalk. Inscribed in French are the words "forever proud". The entire building is themed after the Forum's storied history with special emphasis on the Montreal Canadiens.

The building was declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1997 because: {{quote|"it was arguably the country's most famous sporting venue... it also serves as an icon for the role of hockey in Canada's national culture... the Forum is the oldest of Canada's large-scale arenas and has, throughout its history, been the country's leading site for major indoor cultural, political and religious events."|Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, Minutes, June 1997&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=7464&amp;pid=0&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The city of Montreal estimates the value of the building at $36.8M, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://evalweb.ville.montreal.qc.ca/Role2014actu/roleact_arron_min.asp?ue_id=ZdQ%407%7FD%3F%2FmKognV%2BpvwI1{7Pc%5BnOiVw4&lt;/ref&gt; This is a $10M drop in value since the previous estimation in 2009. AMC Forum is now owned by New York City-based real estate investor Ben Ashkenazy through a firm called Investissements Forum Canadien Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.registreentreprises.gouv.qc.ca/RQAnonymeGR/GR/GR03/GR03A2_19A_PIU_RechEnt_PC/PageEtatRens.aspx?T1.JetonStatic=f5cc2618-563a-4a27-9b4d-7e4b8875f2bd&amp;T1.CodeService=S00436&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''outfield''' is a [[sport|sporting]] [[terminology|term]] used in [[cricket]] and [[baseball]] to refer to the area of the [[pitch (sports field)|field of play]] further from the [[batsman]] or [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] than the [[infield]], and in [[association football]] to players outside the goal.

==In cricket and baseball==
In both baseball and cricket, fielders in the outfield have more ground to cover, but also more time before the [[ball]] reaches them. [[Caught (cricket)|Catch]]es are most likely to arise from shots that have been 'skied' (in cricket) or 'popped 
' (in baseball). If a catch is not possible (for example, the ball has bounced, or is rolling or skidding across the [[lawn|turf]]) the fielder will attempt to head off, pick up and throw in the ball as quickly as possible to reduce the distance the runners can run and hopefully to effect a [[run out]] (cricket) or [[tag out]] (baseball).

In cricket, where the [[cricket ball|ball]] is far more likely to stay low against the ground than in baseball, the condition of the turf has a major effect on the speed at which the ball travels through the outfield. On a '''slow outfield''' the ball [[deceleration|decelerates]] significantly, making [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]] easier and [[batting (cricket)|batting]] harder &amp;mdash; in particular [[boundary (cricket)|boundaries]] are far harder to hit. This usually occurs if the playing surface is uneven or if it is damp from rain or dew. However, on a '''fast outfield''' the ball does not decelerate significantly even when [[rolling]] along the turf, often racing past the fielders and over the boundary rope. In these circumstances, batsmen find it easier to score [[run (cricket)|run]]s quickly. [[Cricket commentator|Commentators]] often refer to the ball [[acceleration|accelerating]] to the boundary on fast outfields, but this only physically occurs on [[cricket ground|grounds]] with a slope and on which the ball is moving downhill.

In baseball, a slow, damp outfield is usually considered an advantage for the hitter, in as much as a batted ball will not travel as quickly to an outfielder in the traditional deep position for fly balls, and thus may permit additional advance by batters and other runners on the basepaths. In addition, a wet, slick ball can not be thrown with the accuracy of a dry one, also permitting the opportunity for additional advance on the bases. Moreover, a wet field generally slows the footspeed of the defense, so fielders will be able to reach fewer flies and line drives in the air before they go through to the fences.

==Association football==
In association football, eleven players are fielded in each match. The [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] remains in the goal, and the remaining ten players are "outfield" players.

'''Penalty cards''' are used in many sports as a means of warning, reprimanding or penalising a player, coach or team official. Penalty cards are most commonly used by [[referee]]s or umpires to indicate that a player has committed an offense. The official will hold the card above his or her head while looking or pointing towards the player that has committed the offence. This action makes the decision clear to all players, as well as spectators and other officials in a manner that is language-neutral. The colour or shape of the card used by the official indicates the type or seriousness of the offence and the level of punishment that is to be applied. Yellow and red cards are the most common, typically indicating, respectively, cautions and dismissals.

==History and origin==
The idea of using language-neutral coloured cards to communicate a referee's intentions originated in [[association football]], with English referee [[Ken Aston]].&lt;ref name="KenAston"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/news/newsid=80623/index.html | title = Ken Aston – the inventor of yellow and red cards | publisher = fifa.com | accessdate = February 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aston had been appointed to the [[FIFA]] Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]], [[England national football team|England]] met [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee [[Rudolf Kreitlein]] had cautioned Englishmen [[Bobby Charlton|Bobby]] and [[Jack Charlton]], as well as sending off Argentinian [[Antonio Rattín]]. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager [[Alf Ramsey]] approached FIFA representative for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on [[traffic light]]s (yellow – stop if safe to do so, red – stop) would transcend language barriers and make it clear that a player had been cautioned or expelled.&lt;ref name=KenAston/&gt; As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico. The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.

==Commonly used penalty cards==

===Yellow card===
[[Image:Yellow card.svg|thumb|A yellow card is used in several sports and most commonly indicates a warning or a temporary suspension]]

A '''yellow card''' is used in many different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports; however, it most commonly indicates a caution given to a player regarding his or her conduct, or indicates a temporary suspension. Examples include:
*[[Association football]]: A yellow card is shown by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.&lt;ref name="FIFAwebsite"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html/ | title = Laws of the Game | publisher = fifa.com | accessdate = June 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a "booking". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a [[Red card (association football)|red card]]), meaning that he must leave the field immediately and take no further part in the game. The player may not be replaced by a substitute. Law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] (which are set by the [[International Football Association Board]] and used by [[FIFA]]) lists the [[Misconduct (association football)|types of offences and misconduct]] that may result in a caution or is cautionary. It also states that "only a player, substitute or substituted player" can be cautioned.&lt;ref name=FIFAwebsite/&gt;[[File:Ronaldo yellow card.jpg|thumb|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] is shown the yellow card]]
:In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in disqualification of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction.
:For more details, see ''[[Yellow card (association football)]]''
*[[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]: In track events, a yellow card is as a personal warning in both track and field events used to indicate that a second yellow card would result in a disqualification.&lt;ref name="athgreencard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.european-athletics.org/files/12-starting_guidelines-april2009.pdf|title=IAAF Starting Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IAAF]] rules have abolished false start warnings; false starts now result in immediate disqualification except in combined events where a diagonal yellow/black card indicates a warning for false start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/6018077/World-Athletics-IAAF-sanctions-immediate-disqualification-for-false-starts-come-January.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=IAAF sanctions immediate disqualification for false starts come January| date=August 12, 2009 | accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as of 2012, the false start rule is that an athlete's hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks before the gunshot in order for a false start to be given. Therefore, if an athlete makes a twitch, while being in their final 'set' position, the maximum penalty is a yellow card.   
*[[Australian rules football]]: A yellow card is issued against a player for committing any reportable offence (such as striking an opponent, swearing at an official, amongst others), except those listed as 'serious' reportable offences. Any player issued a yellow card is unable to participate in the game for the length of a quarter of play, excluding breaks, although the player can be replaced. However, a yellow card may be issued against a player at the discretion of an umpire, despite the player not committing a reportable offence. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the [[Australian Football League]], the highest level of play in Australian rules football.&lt;ref name="AFL Laws of the Game"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf | title = AFL Laws of the Game | publisher = AFL Commission | accessdate = October 20, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120522111034/http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf | archivedate = May 22, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Badminton]]: A yellow card is given to a singles player or doubles pair as a warning for breaching the Laws of Badminton. A yellow card can only be given once to a player or pair in a match, subsequent breaches are sanctioned with a red or black card.&lt;ref name="badmintonlaws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of badminton|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=608602&amp;dl=1|website=bwfbadminton.org|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|accessdate=1 March 2015|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="badmintontechnical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations to technical officials|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=550377&amp;dl=1|website=bwfbadminton.org|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|accessdate=1 March 2015|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bandy]]: A yellow card indicates a warning given to an entire team for technical fouls such as errors in the execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.internationalbandy.com/ | title = Bandy – Rules of Play | publisher = internationalbandy.com | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent technical fouls by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a [[Penalty card#White card|white card]].
*[[Canoe polo]]: A yellow card indicates a player has received a two-minute temporary suspension.&lt;ref name="CPrules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canoepolonz.org.nz/default.asp?Page=2996 |title=International Canoe Polo – Rules of Play |publisher=canoepolonz.org.nz |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014053924/http://www.canoepolonz.org.nz/default.asp?Page=2996 |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A yellow card can be awarded for a deliberate or dangerous foul that prevents the scoring of a near certain goal, dangerous illegal play that is deliberate or repeated, foul or abusive language, continuously disputing a referee's decisions or receiving a third green card for any reason.
*[[Equestrian sports]]: Yellow cards may be issued during [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] sanctioned events for abuse of a horse or incorrect behavior towards an official.&lt;ref name="Erules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fei.org/Rules/Documents/GeneralRegulations_22ndedition_effective1June2007.pdf |title=FEI General Regulations |publisher=fei.org |accessdate=September 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704030028/http://www.fei.org/Rules/Documents/GeneralRegulations_22ndedition_effective1June2007.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse of the horse may include riding an obviously lame horse, riding an exhausted horse, excessive use of [[whip]] or [[spur]]s, and dangerous riding. Riders may choose not to accept issued cards, but doing so may lead to a disciplinary hearing. A rider receiving a yellow card can be disqualified from the event and subsequently fined or suspended.&lt;ref name="Erules"/&gt;
*[[Fencing (sport)|Fencing]]: A yellow card indicates a warning to a fencer and is valid for the remainder of the bout.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.britishfencing.com/governance/rules/fie-rules/ | title = FIE Competition Rules | publisher = britishfencing.com | accessdate = Sep 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an annulment of any hit scored by the fencer at fault may also occur. Yellow cards are awarded for Group 1 offences such as making bodily contact with the opposing fencer (in [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] or [[Sabre (fencing)|sabre]]), leaving the piste without permission, or refusing to obey the referee. A yellow card can also be awarded when, at the first call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence. Any person not on the piste who disturbs the good order of the competition may also receive a yellow card on the first infringement.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt;
*[[Field hockey]]: A yellow card indicates a temporary suspension of at least 5 minutes. The length of the suspension is determined by the umpire.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fih.ch/media/807896/fih-rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf | title = Rules of Hockey | publisher = FIH | accessdate = November 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a player to receive two yellow cards for different offences during the same match; however, the period of suspension must be significantly longer with each yellow card. When an offence for which a yellow card has been awarded is repeated, the yellow card must not be used again and a more severe penalty must be awarded. There must also be a clear difference between the duration of a yellow card suspension for a minor offence and the duration for a major offence. The yellow card can be shown to a specific player or to the captain for misconduct by the entire team.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"/&gt; In this case, the captain is temporarily suspended.
*[[Gaelic games]]: In [[camogie]], [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] a yellow card ({{Lang-ga|cárta buí}}) is given to players for moderate fouls. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card.
*[[Handball]]: A yellow card indicates a warning and can be given to a player or team official for unsportsmanlike conduct, or to a player whose actions are mainly or exclusively directed at the opponent and not at the ball. [[International Handball Federation|IHF]] rules also allow referees to use discretion to award a yellow card outside of these situations.&lt;ref name="IHF rules"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ihf.info/ | title = International Handball Federation – Rules of the Game 2005 | publisher = ihf.info | accessdate = June 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mixed martial arts]] promotions [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] (defunct), [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|DEEP]], and [[ZST]]: A warning, the third leads to disqualification.
*[[Racewalking]]: A yellow card indicates a competitor's foot fails to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised, or the front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.&lt;ref name="What is Olympic Race Walking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trackandfield.about.com/od/distanceevents/a/olymwalkbasic.htm|title=Olympic Race Walking Basics|author=Mike Rosenbaum|work=About.com Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rugby league]]: Yellow cards are not usually used in rugby league in the southern hemisphere with referees indicating a 10-minute suspension by raising both arms straight out with fingers spread (to indicate 10 minutes). This is otherwise known as a "[[sin bin]]". However, in the northern hemisphere it is common for a referee to use a yellow card in signaling a "[[sin bin]]" to indicate 10 minutes instead of using the arm and hand signal used in the southern hemisphere. It is possible for a player to receive seven yellow cards without receiving a red card (a player who receives eight yellow cards in a match will receive a red card, which results in ejection from the match). However, it is up to the referee's discretion at how bad the offences are, and in these cases, a red card may be commonly shown for a second major offence without the presence of a second yellow card.
*[[Rugby union]]: According to the laws of the game published by [[World Rugby]] (WR), during international matches, any player who commits an offence under Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a yellow card and suspended from the game for 10 minutes (2 minutes in [[rugby sevens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9&amp;variation=2 |title=Law 9 – Foul Play (Sevens Variation) |work=Laws of the Game: Rugby Union |publisher=World Rugby |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the player cannot be replaced during that time.&lt;ref name="World Rugby laws"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9 |title=Law 9 – Foul Play |work=Laws of the Game: Rugby Union |publisher=World Rugby |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offences include obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the game. Receiving a yellow card is known colloquially as being sent to the "sin bin". A player receiving a second yellow card in a game will also be shown a red card (see below) meaning that he or she has been [[ejection (sports)|sent-off]] and will be unable to take part in the remainder of the match.
*[[Volleyball]]: Under FIVB rules a yellow card is the second stage of a formal warning for a player(s)/coach for minor misconduct, the first being a verbal one given through the team captain.  It is recorded on the scoresheet but has no immediate consequences - there is no loss of service (if applicable) and no point awarded to the opposition. It is shown together with a red card (in one hand) where a player(s)/coach is sanctioned with expulsion, and (with a card in each hand) separately with a red card where a player(s)/coach is sanctioned with disqualification, all such offences are recorded on the scoresheet.
*[[Water polo]]: Given as an official warning for disrespectful conduct from the coach, individual players, or the entire bench.

===Red card===
[[Image:Red card.svg|thumb|A red card is used in several sports and most commonly indicates a serious offense and can often mean that a player has been removed from the game and may be barred from the next game as well.]]

A '''red card''' is used in several different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports, but it most commonly indicates a serious offence and often results in a player being permanently suspended from the game (commonly known as an [[Ejection (sports)|ejection]], dismissal, expulsion, removal, or sending-off, often with [[Walk of shame|personal embarrassment]]). In many sports the ejected player's team cannot replace them and thus must continue the rest of the game with one fewer player, which may be a significant disadvantage. Examples include:
*[[Association football]]: A red card is shown by a [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to signify that a player has been sent off.&lt;ref name="FIFAwebsite"/&gt; A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately and must take no further part in the game.  The player who has been sent off cannot be replaced during the game; his team must continue the game with one player fewer. Only players, substitutes and substituted players may receive a red card.  If a goalkeeper receives a red card another player will be allowed to assume goalkeeping duties (teams will usually [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] an outfield player for another goalkeeper if this option is available). A red card will be shown to a player who has committed a serious offense such as violent conduct or an illegal and purposeful obstruction of a goal scoring opportunity for the opposing team. A red card will also be shown to a player who accumulates two yellow cards for more minor offenses. 
:For more details, see ''[[Red card (association football)]]''.
*[[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]: A red card indicates that the athlete is disqualified after receiving 2 yellow cards. A diagonal red/black card is issued if a false start has been made.&lt;ref name="athgreencard"/&gt;
*[[Australian rules football]]: A red card is issued against a player who has accumulated two yellow cards over the course of a match, or has committed a 'serious reportable offence' (such as striking an umpire or kicking an opponent). A player issued with a red card may not participate for the remainder of the match; however, unlike most sports, the player can be replaced, although not until a length of time equivalent to one-quarter (excluding breaks) has elapsed. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the [[Australian Football League]], the highest level of play in Australian rules football.&lt;ref name="AFL Laws of the Game"/&gt;
*[[Badminton]]: A red card is given to a singles player or doubles pair to penalize subsequent infractions after receiving a yellow card. It counts as fault, meaning the opposing side is awarded a point. After a second red card, a player or pair may be disqualified with a black card at the tournament referee's discretion.&lt;ref name="badmintonlaws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="badmintontechnical"/&gt;
*[[Bandy]]: A red card indicates a [[match penalty]], i.e. a player has been excluded for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"/&gt; Red card offenses include directly attacking an opponent or using abusive language. A coach or substitute may also be penalized with a red card. In this situation, a player currently on the rink also serves a ten-minute penalty, resulting in the number of players being reduced by one.
*[[Canoe polo]]: A red card indicates a player has been sent off for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.&lt;ref name="CPrules"/&gt; A red card can be awarded if a personal attack on a player occurs, repeated foul or abusive language, or when the award of a yellow card is disputed or has not had the desired effect of causing the player to control his play or attitude. A red card is also awarded when a player has received a second yellow card for any reason.
*[[Cricket]]: In December 2016, it was announced that by October 2017 cricket umpires would be given the power to issue red cards to send off players who have committed the following: “threatening an umpire; physically assaulting another player, umpire, official or spectator; or any other act of violence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/07/mcc-recommend-red-cards-sending-off-laws-of-cricket|title=MCC recommends sendings off be introduced into laws of cricket|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 December 2016|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fencing]]: A red card is used to indicate that a fencer has committed an offence that warrants a penalty hit to be awarded to the opponent.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; Second and subsequent Group 1 offences, all Group 2 offences and first Group 3 offences are penalised with a red card.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; A red card may also be awarded when, at the second call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence.
*[[Field hockey]]: A red card results in a player being permanently suspended from the game. The player cannot take any further part in the game and cannot be substituted. Unlike other penalty cards in field hockey, the red card is never given to the captain for team misconduct. In addition to their colour, red cards in field hockey are often circular in shape.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"/&gt;
*[[Floorball]]: A red card is results in the player being ejected from the game and his/her team being penalised with a 5 minute bench penalty. In floorball, the red card can be linked with 3 different types of Match Penalties (MP 1, 2 and 3). MP1 is linked with violent play during the game, such as heavy hits (pushing) against the goal-cage or boarding; this penalty does not cause additional suspension in the tournament. MP2 is linked with offences such as sabotage of the game, mild brawl (no punches), and is also given when a player receives his/her second 5 minute bench penalty; this match penalty causes an automatic 1 game suspension. MP3 is linked with vulgar conduct, such as insulting the referee, another player or spectators, violent conduct that is not directly linked with play (such as punching an opponent); this match penalty causes an automatic 1 game suspension, and is further reviewed by a disciplinary committee that can penalise the player with additional suspension.
[[Image:Cropped-red-card-handball.jpg|thumb|right|A red card shown in a handball match]]
*[[Gaelic games]]: In [[camogie]], [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] a red card ({{Lang-ga|cárta dearg}}) is given to players for serious fouls and violent conduct. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card.
*[[Handball]]: A red card indicates a disqualification of a player who has committed an offense such as unsportsmanlike conduct, serious foul play, or receiving a third two-minute suspension.&lt;ref name="IHF rules"/&gt; A red card prevents a player from playing for the remainder of the match and as a result reduces the number of players that are available to a team.  A red card also carries a two-minute suspension for the team, meaning that a team cannot replace the disqualified player until the two-minute team suspension has expired.&lt;ref name="IHF rules"/&gt;
*[[Racewalking]]: A red card indicates that a competitor's foot failed to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised or that his front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.  A judge would issue a yellow card for the first infraction committed by a competitor. And if the same judge detects the second infraction from the same competitor, a red card is issued.  Three red cards, from three different judges, will result in a competitor's disqualification.&lt;ref name="What is Olympic Race Walking"/&gt;
*[[Rugby league]]: Red cards are not usually used in rugby league in the southern hemisphere with referees indicating a player has been sent from the field for the rest of the match with one extended arm above the head with the index finger pointed in the direction of a sideline. However, in the northern hemisphere, it is common for a referee to use a red card in signaling a player has been sent from the field for the rest of the match, with no replacement allowed. It is possible for a player to receive seven yellow cards without receiving a red card (a player who receives eight yellow cards in a match will receive a red card, which results in ejection from the match). However, it is up to the referee's discretion at how bad the offenses are, and in these cases, a red card may be commonly shown for a second major offense without the presence of a second yellow card.
*[[Rugby union]]: A red card is used to indicate that a player has been sent off and can take no further part in the game.&lt;ref name="World Rugby laws"/&gt; He cannot be replaced, leaving his team with one fewer player for the remainder of the game. During international matches, a player who commits an offense under Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a red card. Red cards are normally issued for serious offenses. Any player receiving a second yellow card in a game will automatically be shown a red card.
*[[Volleyball]]: A red card can be issued by the referee for the first instance of Rude Conduct. It is recorded on the scoresheet and results in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point to the opposition. Rude Conduct is the only category of sanction punished by a Red card alone, and which results in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point. For the sanctions of Expulsion and Disqualification, a Red and Yellow card is shown simultaneously, held together in one hand, or separately in each hand, respectively.
:* [[beach volleyball|Two Man (beach)]]:  The rules vary in one aspect from the six-a-side competition. A red card is shown for the first and any second offense of Rude Conduct in the same set. It is recorded on the scoresheet, resulting in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point to the opposition. Otherwise the procedural use of cards is the same as for six-a-side.
*[[Water polo]]: A red card is issued to a coach or player on the bench for a second incident of misconduct after receiving a yellow card or severe unsporting conduct. A person receiving a red card must leave the competition area.

==Other types of penalty card==

===Green card===
[[Image:greencardhockey.svg|thumb|In [[field hockey]], a triangular-shaped green card indicates a 2 minute suspension for field players and a warning for a coach.]]

[[File:Indiana (80) (5028145116).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Penn State Nittany Lions field hockey|Penn State]] field hockey player receives a green card.]]
A '''green card''' is used in some sports to indicate an official warning to a player who has committed a minor offence that does not warrant a more serious sanction.
*[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]]: A green card indicates that the recall did not warrant a warning, which most commonly happens when the machines used to catch false-starters make a mistake.&lt;ref name="athgreencard"/&gt;
*[[Canoe polo]]: A green card indicates an official warning that can be applied to an individual player or a whole team.&lt;ref name="CPrules"/&gt; A green card can be awarded for deliberate unsporting behavior or unnecessary verbal communication to the referee.
*[[Field hockey]]: A green card indicates an official warning when a minor offence has occurred. A second green card for the same player will result in a yellow card (5 minute suspension). In this case, the umpire will show a green card, followed by a yellow card. When an offence for which a green card has been awarded is repeated, a yellow card should be awarded. A green card can be given to a specific player or to the captain as a warning to the entire team. Cards shown to the captain as a warning to the team are treated separate from cards shown to the captain as a player. In addition to their colour, green cards in field hockey are triangular in shape.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"/&gt; Under FIH Rules of Hockey, the green card carries a two-minute suspension during which time that player's team plays with one fewer player.
*[[Association football]]: A few minor leagues use a green card as an indication of ''commendable'' conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=¿Qué es la tarjeta verde? (What is the green card?) |url=http://www.rfef.es/noticias/que-es-tarjeta-verde |website=RFEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Serie B e la novità del 'cartellino verde'(The Serie B and the novelty of the 'green card') |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/cataliotti-la-serie-b-e-la-novita-del-cartellino-verde-ecco-cos--202500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White card===
{{double image|right|white card.svg|60|blue card.svg|60|In bandy, a white card indicates a five-minute penalty while a blue card indicates a ten-minute penalty.}}
A '''white card''' is used in [[bandy]] to indicate a five-minute timed penalty given to a player.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"/&gt; The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 5 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. Offences that can warrant a white card include trying to hinder the opponents from executing a free-stroke, illegal substitution or repeated illegal but non-violent attacks on an opponent.

In the 2012 [[Super Rugby]] season in rugby union, a White Card was introduced for incidents of suspected foul play where the referee is unsure of the identity of the perpetrator, or where the referee is unsure if a red card is warranted. The incident is later referred to the citing commissioner, and may result in a suspension for the offending player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/super-rugby-2012/rugby/story/159785.html|title=Super Rugby: White card set for Super Rugby bow - Live Rugby News - ESPN Scrum|work=ESPN scrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to a citation sign (arms crossed above the head) in rugby league. However, in 2013 the International Rugby Board, now known as World Rugby, extended the powers of the [[Rugby union match officials#Television match official|TMO]] to include reviewing suspected incidents of foul play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/article/51557-new-tmo-protocol|title=Rugby365 - New TMO protocol|work=rugby365.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, no white cards were issued in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/8982249/Rennie-apologises-for-bizarre-semi-incident|title=Rennie apologises for bizarre semi incident|work=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue card===
A '''blue card''' or 'Blue Disk' as pioneered by The Elms, is used in [[bandy]] to indicate a ten-minute timed penalty given to a player.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"/&gt; The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 10 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. A blue card is typically shown for offences that are more serious than those warranting a white card including attacking an opponent in a violent or dangerous way, causing advantage by intentionally stopping the ball with a high stick or protesting a referee's decision.

A blue card is also frequently used in indoor soccer in the United States, signifying that the offender must leave the field and stay in a penalty box (usually 2–5 minutes), during which time their team plays down a man (identical to [[ice hockey]] and [[roller hockey]]). If a goal is scored by the team opposite of the offender, then the offender may return to the field immediately.  It is also used in the [[Clericus Cup]] association football league for a 5-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play. And it is also used in the [[beach soccer]] for a 2-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play.

A Blue Card is also used in [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]] to indicate a technical foul. The fouling player is sent to the penalty box for one minute or until a goal is scored against the fouling player's team. Unlike a yellow card, there is no additional penalty for multiple blue cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quidditch Rulebook|url=http://www.usquidditch.org/files/USQ_Rulebook_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European indoor soccer or [[Futsal]], a Blue Card was used to send a player off the court; however the team was able to replace him with another player. The offending player could not return to play during the match. A blue card was shown directly for foul play or verbal abuse, if the same player had received two yellow cards, or if he had accumulated a total of 5 fouls during the game.

The Blue Card has been in use in Handball since the [[International Handball Federation]] announced a rule change that came into effect on July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympichandball.org/2016/03/04/ihf-announces-rule-changes-effective-july-1st-2016/|title=IHF Announces Rule Changes Effective July 1st 2016 : Irish Olympic Handball Association|author=|date=|website=www.olympichandball.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; First the Red Card is shown, then the referee will after a short discussion show the blue card. Following that a written report will accompany the score sheet and the Disciplinary Commission will then decide on further actions against the player.&lt;ref&gt;http://cms.eurohandball.com/PortalData/1/Resources/1_ehf_main/3_download_pdf/Rule_changes_2016_03_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black card===
[[Image:Black card.svg|thumb|A black card in fencing indicates an offense serious enough to warrant a suspension]]

A '''black card''' is used in [[fencing]]. It is issued by the [[Tournament director|director]], or the referee for severe rule infractions.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; A second instance of a Group 3 offence, and all Group 4 offences including deliberate brutality, refusal to fence, refusal to salute, and refusal to shake hands can be punished with a black card.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; When the black card is issued, the offending fencer is excluded from the remainder of the competition and may be suspended from further tournaments. In the official record of the tournament, his or her name is replaced with the words "FENCER EXCLUDED".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfencing.org/usfa/content/view/1273/111/ |title=Fencing For Parents |accessdate=2008-08-14 |work=U.S. Fencing – The Official Website of the U.S. Fencing Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625054519/http://www.usfencing.org/usfa/content/view/1273/111/ |archivedate=2008-06-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A black card is also used in the sport of [[badminton]] to indicate disqualification.&lt;ref name=nyp&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/olympics/badminton_players_tossed_match_olympic_28mGWBb3T9toHrGlBOCMFI | title=8 badminton players tossed from Olympic doubles after being accused of throwing matches | work=New York Post | date=1 August 2012 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gaelic Games]] of [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]], a ''tick'' or ''black book'' – was formerly recorded against a player for a minor infringement not warranting a yellow card, though multiple bookings will result in the issuance of a yellow card. The act of the referee physically holding up his black notebook in the same manner as a card has been discontinued by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-throw-caution-to-wind-and-abandon-black-books-1732523.html|title=GAA throw caution to wind and abandon black books|newspaper=Irish Independent | first=Colm|last=Keys|date=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning January 1, 2014 a player in [[Gaelic football]] can be ordered off the pitch for the remainder of the game with a substitution allowed by being physically shown a Black Card (the referee's black notebook) in the same manner as any other penalty card for "cynical behaviour," including blatant tripping, pulling down and bodychecking. This forced substitution is an intermediate punishment between the yellow and red cards. A player who receives a yellow card and a black card in the same game is sent off without any substitute being permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-pass-controversial-black-card-rule-29150028.html|date=23 March 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|title=GAA passcontroversial 'black card' rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prix de la Grotte''' is a [[Conditions races|Group&amp;nbsp;3]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run over a distance of 1,600&amp;nbsp;metres (about 1&amp;nbsp;mile) at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] in April.

==History==
The event was established in 1889, and it was originally open to colts and fillies aged three or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1889 Prix de la Grotte | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k526832d.f3&amp;l=5&amp;r=2756,3410,267,417 | newspaper = [[Le Gaulois]] | date = 8 April 1889 | accessdate = 17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its format varied during the early part of its history.

The modern version of the Prix de la Grotte was introduced in 1952. From this point it was restricted to three-year-old fillies, and was initially contested over 1,600&amp;nbsp;metres. It was designed to serve as a trial for the [[Poule d'Essai des Pouliches]].

The race's distance was modified several times during the 1960s. It was run over 1,400&amp;nbsp;metres (1965), 1,300&amp;nbsp;metres (1966) and 1,500&amp;nbsp;metres (1967) before reverting to 1,600&amp;nbsp;metres in 1968.

Several winners of the modern Prix de la Grotte have achieved victory in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. The first was Apollonia in 1956, and the most recent was Beauty Parlour in 2012.

'''''Rocky''''' is a 1976 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] and both written by and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].&lt;ref name="Rocky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20655/Rocky/|title=Rocky|work=TCM database|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the [[rags to riches]] [[American Dream]] story of [[Rocky Balboa]], an uneducated but kind-hearted [[working class]] [[Italian-American]] boxer working as a debt collector for a [[loan shark]] in the slums of [[Philadelphia]].  Rocky, a small-time [[club fighter]], gets a shot at the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]]. The film also stars [[Talia Shire]] as Adrian, [[Burt Young]] as Adrian's brother Paulie, [[Burgess Meredith]] as Rocky's trainer [[Mickey Goldmill]], and [[Carl Weathers]] as the champion, [[Apollo Creed]].

The film, made on a budget of just over $1 million, was a [[sleeper hit]]; it earned $225 million in global box office receipts, becoming the [[1976 in film|highest-grossing film of 1976]], and went on to win three [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The film received many positive reviews and turned Stallone into a major star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml |title=Inside the Actors Studio with Sylvester Stallone |accessdate=28 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041106/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml |archivedate=October  6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". ''Rocky'' is considered to be one of [[List of films considered the best#Sports|the greatest sports films ever made]] and was ranked as the second-best in the genre, after ''[[Raging Bull]]'', by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2008.

The film has spawned [[Rocky (film series)|seven sequels]]: ''[[Rocky II]]'' (1979), ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982), ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985), ''[[Rocky V]]'' (1990), ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006), ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) and Creed II (2018). Stallone portrays Rocky in all seven sequels, wrote the first five, and directed four (Avildsen returned to direct ''Rocky V'' and [[Ryan Coogler]] directed ''Creed''). An eighth film and direct sequel to ''Creed'', titled ''[[Creed II]]'', was released in 2018 with [[Steven Caple Jr.]] directing and Stallone returning to star and writing the script.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please try to refrain from expanding the plot, adding POV style information and including aspects of the fight that the reader doesn't need to know and can learn from renting the film. WP:FICT says plot summary should be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, as per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should stay in between 400–700 words. --&gt;

In late 1975, the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] world champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a [[title bout]] in [[Philadelphia]] during the upcoming [[United States Bicentennial]]. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him. He settles in on [[Rocky Balboa|Robert "Rocky" Balboa]], an aspiring [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia, known by the nickname "The Italian Stallion".

Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] Miles Jergens, unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as [[punching bag]]s, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer Mickey "Mighty Mick" Goldmill, a respected trainer and former [[bantamweight]] fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.

Meanwhile, Rocky meets Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish [[Pet store|pet store]]. He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian, culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his [[Meat packing industry|meatpacking business]] before the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena. He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but is content to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed and prove himself to everyone.

On [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries, Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head, and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.

After the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was "the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]] on March 24, 1975. Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did. Despite the fact that the match motivated Stallone to begin work on ''Rocky'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rocky Isn't Based on Me,' Says Stallone, 'But We Both Went the Distance'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/rocky-ar.html|accessdate=December 1, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=November 1, 1976|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201172004/https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/rocky-ar.html|archivedate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for the script.&lt;ref name="ESPN Wepner Recognized"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/page/IamChuckWepner/chuck-wepner-recognized-rocky-fame |title=Chuck Wepner finally recognized for 'Rocky' fame – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2011-10-25 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Real Rocky"&gt;{{cite video | people=Feuerzeig, Jeff (Director) | date=2011-10-25 | title=The Real Rocky | medium=Motion picture | publisher=ESPN Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible inspirations for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Joe Frazier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Struby|first1=Tim|title=Marciano's career mark unique but flawed?|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2165594|website=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201171638/http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2165594|archivedate=December 1, 2015|date=September 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McRae|first1=Donald|title=Still smokin' over Ali but there's no time for hatred now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201171407/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|archivedate=December 1, 2015|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Rocky Graziano]]'s autobiography ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' and [[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|the movie of the same name]]. Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name="The Real Rocky" /&gt;

[[United Artists]] liked Stallone's script, and viewed it as a possible vehicle for a well-established star such as [[Robert Redford]], [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Burt Reynolds]], or [[James Caan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=Dirt-Poor Sylvester Stallone Turned Down $300,000 In 1976 To Ensure He Could Play 'Rocky'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sylvester-stallone-made-rocky-against-all-odds-2014-4|website=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015|date=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallone insisted upon portraying the title character himself, to the point of issuing an ultimatum. Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself, had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead. He also knew that producers [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]]'s contract with the studio enabled them to "greenlight" a project if the budget was kept low enough. The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry, ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' (whose eventual losses were covered by ''Rocky''{{'s}} success).&lt;ref name = "EW"&gt;{{cite news| title = EW: The Right Hook: How Rocky Nabbed Best Picture | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,203553,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Chris | last=Nashawaty | date=2002-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neal Gabler]], ''ReelThirteen'', from [http://thirteen.org/ WNET], 2/22/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's production budget ended up being $1,075,000, with a further $100,000 spent on producers' fees and $4.2 million on advertising costs.&lt;ref name=BlockWilson583&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Block|editor1-first=Alex Ben|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Lucy Autrey|year=2010|title=George Lucas's Blockbusting: A Decade-By-Decade Survey of Timeless Movies Including Untold Secrets of Their Financial and Cultural Success|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=9780061778896|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbuSXSSqdkC&amp;pg=PA583 583]|quote=The budget was $1,075,000 plus producer's fees of $100,000 ...

Although Chartoff and Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by production standards (both were ultimately cast on the same day). Real-life boxer [[Ken Norton]] was initially sought for the role of [[Apollo Creed]], but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to [[Carl Weathers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vellin|first1=Bob|title=Former heavyweight champion Ken Norton dies at 70|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/09/18/former-heavywegith-champion-ken-norton-die/2834521/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton had had three fights with [[Muhammad Ali]], upon whom Creed was loosely based. According to ''The Rocky Scrapbook'', [[Carrie Snodgress]] was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. [[Susan Sarandon]] auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character. After [[Talia Shire]]'s ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, along with Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Boxer [[Joe Frazier]] has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film. The character of Apollo Creed was influenced by outspoken boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] who fought Frazier three times. During the [[49th Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film. Some of the plot's most memorable moments—Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], as part of his training regimen—are taken from the real-life exploits of Joe Frazier, for which he received no credit.&lt;ref name = "Joe Frazier Inspiration"&gt;{{cite news|title=Still smokin' over Ali but there's no time for hatred now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|work=The Guardian|first=Donald|last=McRae|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=3 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the film's comparatively low budget, members of Stallone's family played minor roles. His father rings the bell to signal the start and end of a round, his brother [[Frank Stallone|Frank]] plays a street corner singer, and his first wife, Sasha, was [[Unit still photographer|stills photographer]].&lt;ref name = "Stalone's wife Rocky photographer" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038664/bio |publisher= Internet Movie Database |title= Czack, Sasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cameos include former Philadelphia and then-current Los Angeles television [[Sports commentator|sportscaster]] [[Stu Nahan]] playing himself, alongside radio and TV broadcaster Bill Baldwin; and [[Lloyd Kaufman]], founder of the independent film company [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]], appearing as a drunk. Diana Lewis, then a news anchor in Los Angeles and later in Detroit, has a small scene as a TV news reporter. [[Tony Burton]] appeared as Apollo Creed's trainer, [[Tony "Duke" Evers]], a role he would reprise in the entire ''Rocky'' series, though he is not given an official name until ''Rocky II''. Though uncredited, [[Michael Dorn]], who would later gain fame as the [[Klingon]] [[Worf]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', made his acting debut as Creed's bodyguard.&lt;ref name=Trek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/dorn |title=Star Trek Database – Dorn, Michael |work=Star Trek Database |publisher=CBS Entertainment |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''Rocky'' began on January 9, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stallone starts filming Rocky|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/stallone-starts-filming-rocky|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|publisher=[[A&amp;E Networks]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202182201/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/stallone-starts-filming-rocky|archivedate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming took place primarily throughout [[Philadelphia]], with a few scenes being shot in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocky film locations|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/rocky.html#.Vl84HcpP0uI|website=The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906102019/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/rocky.html|archivedate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventor/operator [[Garrett Brown]]'s new [[Steadicam]] was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film's Philadelphia street jogging/training sequences and the run up the Art Museum's flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the [[Rocky Steps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stairway to Heaven|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1201-Winter-2012/Shot-to-Remember-Rocky.aspx|publisher=DGA|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used for some of the shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight. ''Rocky'' is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'' and ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html |title=Steadicam 30th anniversary press release |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430033456/http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html |archivedate=April 30, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain elements of the story were altered during filming. The original script had a darker tone: Mickey was portrayed as [[Racism|racist]], and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the [[professional boxing]] world after all.&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;

During filming, both Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose, the opposite injuries of what their characters had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neuwirth |first=Aaron |date=26 November 2015 |title=Movie Trivia Thursday (Nov. 26): 5 Cool Facts About 5 Classic Boxing Films |url=http://www.ranthollywood.com/2015/11/26/movie-trivia-thursday-nov-26-5-cool-facts-about-these-classic-boxing-films/ |publisher=RantHollywood |access-date=4 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620070011/http://www.ranthollywood.com/2015/11/26/movie-trivia-thursday-nov-26-5-cool-facts-about-these-classic-boxing-films/ |archivedate=June 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first date between Rocky and Adrian, in which Rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours in a deserted ice skating rink, was shot that way only because of budgetary pressures. This scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a skating rink during regular business hours. However, the producers decided that they could not afford to hire the hundreds of extras that would have been necessary for that scene.&lt;ref name="ReelLife"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merron|first1=Jeff|title=Reel Life: 'Rocky'|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020529.html|website=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202171945/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020529.html|archivedate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe. When Rocky points this out, he is told that "it doesn't really matter, does it?" According to director Avildsen's DVD commentary, this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify, so Stallone wrote the brief scene to ensure the audience did not see it as a goof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/72-hard-hitting-facts-about-the-rocky-movies-131837786.html |title=72 Hard-Hitting Facts About the 'Rocky' Movies |publisher=Yahoo.com |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Carl Weathers, coincidentally, wore white-striped red shorts for the Creed-Balboa rematch in ''[[Rocky II]]''.) Avildsen said that the same situation arose with Rocky's robe. When it came back from the costume department, it was far too baggy for Stallone.  Because the robe arrived on the day of filming the scene and there was no chance of replacing or altering it, instead of ignoring this and risking the audience laughing at it, Stallone wrote the dialogue where Rocky himself points out the robe is too big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/rocky-trivia-facts/ |title=Don't Be a Bum, Check Out These 10 'Rocky' Facts |publisher=Screencrush.com |date=2015-11-23 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main article|Rocky (soundtrack)}}

The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Rocky'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]], who previously composed a score for director [[John G. Avildsen]]'s ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]'' (1975) that was ultimately rejected by the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Conti Interview|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/bill-conti|website=Emmy TV Legends|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation]]|accessdate=November 29, 2015|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[David Shire]] (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for ''Rocky'' but had to turn  it down due to prior commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Lois|title=Rocky's Talia Shire Says the Song Is You to Her Composer Husband, David Shire|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 21, 1977|volume=7|issue=11|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067554,00.html|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio intervention due to the film's relatively low budget. "The budget for the music was 25 grand," said Avildsen. "And that was for everything: The composer's fee, that was to pay the musicians, that was to rent the studio, that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuade|first1=Dan|title=Director John G.

===Critical response===
''Rocky'' received positive reviews at the time of its release. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of "the young [[Marlon Brando]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= January 1, 1977 &lt;!-- although the online version says 1976, it was actually 1977 --&gt; |title = Rocky Movie Review &amp; Film Summary | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rocky-1976 | access-date=October 9, 2017 | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | via=RogerEbert.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Box Office Magazine'' claimed that audiences would be "touting Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone as a new star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1976-11-22 |title=Box Office Magazine Rocky Review |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview?&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4828 |accessdate=2006-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123101307/http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview%3F&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4828 |archivedate=November 23, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Arizona Daily Star Review |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=107744&amp;section=pressQuote |accessdate= 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Rich]] liked the film, calling it "almost 100 per cent [[schmaltz]]," but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as "gimmicky" and the script "heavy-handed".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Rich. ''[[The New York Post]]'' November 22, 1976.  p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviews, including [[Richard Eder]]'s (as well as Canby's negative review), compared the work to that of [[Frank Capra]].

The film, however, did not escape criticism. [[Vincent Canby]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "pure '30s make believe" and dismissed both Stallone's acting and Avildsen's directing, calling the latter "none too decisive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = November 22, 1976|accessdate = 23 September 2006|url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;title1=Rocky%20(Movie)&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&amp;pdate=19761122&amp;v_id=|title = Vincent Canby Rocky Review for New York Times|work = The New York Times|first = Manohla|last = Dargis}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sarris]] found the Capra comparisons disingenuous:  "Capra's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like ''Rocky'' could envisage, and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene," and, commenting on Rocky's work as a loan shark, says that the film "teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters."  Sarris also found Meredith "oddly cast in the kind of part the late [[James Gleason]] used to pick his teeth."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Village Voice]]'' November 22, 1976, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

Four decades later, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise; ''Rocky'' holds a 93% "Certified Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's consensus states: "This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Rocky |website=Rotten Tomatoes| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017776-rocky/| accessdate = July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the positive online reviews came from the [[BBC]] Films website, with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5/5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/12/rocky_1976_review.shtml|title = Rocky @ BBC Films|accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Steven J.

''Rocky'' was acknowledged as the second-best film in the sports genre, after ''[[Raging Bull]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | accessdate= 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Top 10 Sports | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/sports.html | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |accessdate= 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philly042107-014-RockyStatue.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The statue, situated just northeast of the steps.]]
[[File:Rocky Movie Legacy in Philadelphia Old City.jpg|thumb|Rocky merchandise and iconography is commonplace in Philadelphia.]]
The famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] has become a cultural icon, with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of "Rocky Steps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holzman|first1=Laura|title=Rocky|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/|website=Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202174125/http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/|archivedate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for ''[[Rocky III]]'', was placed at the top of the [[Rocky Steps]]. City Commerce Director [[Dick Doran]] claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city's image than "anyone since [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]]."&lt;ref name="RockyStatue"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avery|first1=Ron|title=Rocky Statue|url=http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|website=UShistory.org|publisher=[[Independence Hall Association]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110174827/http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|archivedate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena, although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for ''[[Rocky V]]'', and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original ''Rocky'' (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps). Later that year, it was permanently moved to a spot next to the steps.&lt;ref name="RockyStatue"/&gt;

The scene is frequently parodied in the media. In the 2008 movie ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', Zohan's nemesis, Phantom, goes through a parodied training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory. In the fourth-season finale of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', as the credits roll at the end of the episode, Will is seen running up the same steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; however, as he celebrates after finishing his climb, he passes out in exhaustion, and while he lies unconscious on the ground, a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat. In ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', there is a scene where Sherman Klump ([[Eddie Murphy]]) struggles to and eventually succeeds at running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus, victoriously throwing punches at the top.

In 2006, [[E!]] named the "Rocky Steps" scene #13 in its ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118091605/http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|url=http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|archivedate=2006-01-18|accessdate=2015-12-12|deadurl=yes|title = E! Channel's 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] torch relay, Philadelphia native [[Dawn Staley]] was chosen to run up the museum steps. In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004, Presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party's nomination for President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philly.com |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/9258078.htm |accessdate=2006-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217163800/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/9258078.htm |archivedate=December 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations and merchandise===
Upon the film's release, a paperback [[novelization]] of the screenplay was written by [[Rosalyn Drexler]] under the pseudonym Julia Sorel and published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 1976. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/rocky/oclc/2851748 |title=Rocky (Book, 1976) |publisher=WorldCat.org |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[video game]]s have also been made based on the film. The first ''Rocky'' video game was released by [[Coleco]] for [[ColecoVision]] in August 1983 titled ''[[Rocky Super Action Boxing]]''; the principal designer was Coleco staffer B. Dennis Sustare. [[Rocky (1987 video game)|Another]] was released in 1987 for the [[Sega Master System]]. In 1985, [[Dinamic Multimedia|Dinamic Software]] released a boxing game for the [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] (also advertised for and/or published on the Sega Master System, Amstrad CPC and MSX) called ''Rocky''. Due to copyright reasons it was quickly renamed "Rocco".&lt;ref&gt;{{WoS game|id=0004198|title=Rocky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky-themed merchandise is commonplace in Philadelphia.

In 1988, William T. Naud released a low budget parody entitled ''[[Ricky 1 (film)|Ricky 1]]''.

More recently, a [[Rocky (2002 video game)|''Rocky'' video game]] was released in 2002 for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and a [[sequel]], ''[[Rocky Legends]]'', was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
