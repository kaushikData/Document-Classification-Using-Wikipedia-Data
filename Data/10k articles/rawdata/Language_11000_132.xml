The term '''anal retentive''' (also '''anally retentive'''), often abbreviated to '''anal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anal-retentive |title=anal-retentive |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that it becomes an obsession and may be an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person. The term derives from [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]].

==Origins==
In Freudian psychology, the [[anal stage]] is said to follow the [[oral stage]] of [[infant development|infant]] or [[Child development|early-childhood development]]. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the [[bowel]]s but occasionally the [[bladder]]), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions—in other words, any form of child training and not specifically linked to toilet training.  Freud posited that children who experience conflicts, in which libido energy is under-indulged during this period of time, and the child is perhaps too strongly chastised for toilet-training accidents, may develop "anal retentive" fixations or personality traits.  These traits are associated with a child's efforts at excretory control: orderliness, stubbornness, and compulsions for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hall |first = Calvin S. |title = A Primer of Freudian Psychology |publisher = [[New American Library]] |year = 1954 |location = New York |page = 108 |isbn = 0-452-01183-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, those who are overindulged during this period may develop "[[anal-expulsive]]" personality types.

Freud's theories on early childhood have been influential on the [[psychological]] community; the phrase ''anal retentive'' and the term ''anal'' survive in common usage. The second edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM-II) introduced [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD), with a definition based on Freud's description of anal-retentive personality.&lt;ref name="Pinto 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinto |first=Anthon y|first2=Jane L. |last2=Eisen |first3=Maria C. |last3=Mancebo |first4=Steven A. |last4=Rasmussen |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=246–263 |title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Subtypes and Spectrum Conditions |chapter=Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder |editor-first1=Jonathan S. |editor-last1=Abramowitz |editor-first2=Dean |editor-last2=McKay |editor-first3=Steven |editor-last3=Taylor |isbn=978-0-08-044701-8 |chapter-url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/B9780080447018500164/3-s2.0-B9780080447018500164-main.pdf?_tid=5e5920c6-6e10-11e6-8885-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1472492906_7d594e8d9e99c696b9336666dab25769}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the association between OCPD and toilet training is largely regarded as unsupported "[[Popular psychology|pop-psychology]]" and therefore discredited by the majority of psychologists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{cite book |last = Berger |first = Kathleen |title = The Developing Person |publisher = Worth Publishers |year = 2000 |location = New York |pages = 218 |isbn = 1-57259-417-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no conclusive research linking anal stage conflicts with "anal" personality types.&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt; Research suggests that the overall pattern of [[Parenting styles|parental attitudes]] has a much more concrete effect on how an infant will grow up.

'''Antonin Perbòsc''' was a poet from [[Occitania]], [[France]]. He was born in [[Labarthe, Tarn-et-Garonne|Labarthe]], [[Tarn-et-Garonne]] in 1861 and died in 1944 in [[Montauban]]. His first job was as a primary school teacher in [[Comberouger]], a small town 30km off Montauban, and later in [[Loze]], near [[Villefranche-de-Rouergue]]. He'd teach his pupils about the region's traditions and cultural heritage and even formed a society for the more eager among them. The so-called ''societat tradicionista'' gathered 51 schoolgoers, both male and female, between 1900 and 1908.

The members of this club had a mission of collecting the oral patrimony around them, in other words all the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] songs, sayings, proverbs and tales they could come across where they lived. They'd then write them down without changing a single word. The younger pupils, who couldn't write yet, would tell what they heard and their older schoolmates would do the writing part for them. Perbòsc's innovative work was noted by folk specialists at the 1900 Congrès des traditions populaires in [[Paris]]. The tales told by the children were phonetically transcribed so as to respect the local accents and intonations, which still gave rise to tensions both with [[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]] and [[Gascony|Gascon]] activists who had their own views on how to better spell Occitan. These works can no longer be found.

Perbòsc also wrote poems, in magnificent style, which inspiration for he found in popular traditions.

'''BCD''' ("Binary-Coded Decimal"), also called '''alphanumeric BCD''', '''alphameric BCD''', '''BCD Interchange Code''',&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt; or '''BCDIC''',&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt; is a family of representations of numerals, uppercase Latin letters, and some special and control characters as [[six-bit character code]]s.

Unlike later encodings such as [[ASCII]], BCD codes were not standardized. Different computer manufacturers, and even different product lines from the same manufacturer, often had their own variants, and sometimes included unique characters. Other six-bit encodings with completely different mappings, such as some [[FIELDATA]]&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"&gt;{{cite book |title=Coded Character Sets, History and Development |series=The Systems Programming Series |author-last=Mackenzie |author-first=Charles E. |date=1980 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.]] |edition=1 |isbn=0-201-14460-3 |id={{ISBN|978-0-201-14460-4}} |lccn=77-90165 |url=https://textfiles.meulie.net/bitsaved/Books/Mackenzie_CodedCharSets.pdf |access-date=2017-04-22 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526172151/https://textfiles.meulie.net/bitsaved/Books/Mackenzie_CodedCharSets.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-26}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6-tQAAAAMAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; variants or [[Transcode (character encoding)|Transcode]], are sometimes incorrectly termed BCD.

Many variants of BCD encode the characters '0' through '9' as the corresponding binary values.

==History==
Technically, ''[[binary-coded decimal]]'' describes the encoding of decimal numbers where each decimal digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four.

With the introduction of the ''[[IBM card]]'' in 1928, IBM created a [[punched card code|code]] capable of representing alphanumeric information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STARS:Punched Card Equipment |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/STARS:Punched_Card_Equipment |publisher=IEEE Global History Network |access-date=2012-06-09 |author-last1=Pugh |author-first1=Emerson W. |author-last2=Heide |author-first2=Lars |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511034402/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/STARS%3APunched_Card_Equipment |archive-date=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; later adopted by other manufacturers.  This code represents the numbers 0-9 by a single punch, and uses multiple punches for upper-case letters and special characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Pugh |author-first=Emerson W. |title=Building IBM: Shaping and Industry and Its Technology |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-262-16147-3 |pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter has two punches (zone [12,11,0] + digit [1–9]); most special characters have two or three punches (zone [12,11,0,or none] + digit [2–7] + 8).

The BCD code is the adaptation of the punched card code to a six-bit [[binary code]] by encoding the digit rows (nine rows, plus unpunched) into the low four bits, and the zone rows (three rows, plus unpunched) into the high two bits.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Jones |author-first=Douglas W. |title=Punched Card Codes |url=http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/codes.html |access-date=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digit zero (a single punch in row 0) is usually handled specially in some way, and the digit code was extended to values 10 through 15 by combining a digit in the range 2–7 with a punch in row 8.  [[IBM]] applied the terms ''binary-coded decimal'' and ''BCD'' to the variations of BCD ''alphamerics'' used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].

Among the vendors using BCD were [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[Burroughs Corporation]] |title=Burroughs B5500 Information Processing Systems: Reference Manual |date=1964 |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/1021326_B5500_RefMan_May67.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bull]], [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Control Data Corporation |author-link=Control Data Corporation |title=Codes/Control Data 6600 Computer System |date=1965 |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/cyber/cyber_70/60141900_Codes_Rev-A_May65.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]], [[General Electric]] (the computer division was purchased by [[Honeywell]] in 1969), [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Siemens]], and [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]]-[[UNIVAC]].

IBM later created the 8-bit ''[[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (EBCDIC) based on BCDIC.

=={{anchor|Recordmark character}}Special characters==
The ''Recordmark'' or ''Record mark'' character (represented as ‡) is a character used to mark the end of a [[Record (computer science)|record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Record-mark |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/50300/record-mark |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |work=Encyclopedia |access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCD code for this character is 32&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; in some BCD variants. The closest Unicode equivalent is {{unichar|29E7|thermodynamic}}, but that is not found in many fonts, so {{unichar|2021|double dagger}} is often used instead. Functionally this corresponds to the EBCDIC ''IRS'' character (ASCII ''RS''), X'1E'.

The ''Groupmark'' or ''Group mark character'' (represented as [[File:IBM 1401 Group Mark.GIF]]) is a character used to indicate the start or finish of a group of related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=group mark |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-groupmark.html |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCD code for this character is 77&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; in some BCD variants. The groupmark was proposed for Unicode standardization in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Shirriff |author-first=Ken |title=Proposal for addition of Group Mark symbol |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15083-group-mark.pdf |website=unicode.org |access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was assigned to value {{unichar|2BD2|group mark}}. Functionally this corresponds to the EBCDIC ''IGS'' character (ASCII ''GS''), X'1D'. It is now in Unicode 10.0 at this position, but only the Symbola and Unifont fonts support it.

The ''[[Word mark (computer hardware)|Wordmark]]'', by contrast, is ''not'' a BCD character. Rather, it is a flag bit used to mark the end of a word on some [[variable word length computer]]s such as the [[IBM 1401]].

==BCD code variations==
There are many different versions of the six-bit BCD code.  There are three major categories of difference:
# The mapping from zone punches to high-order bits.  All codes translate no zone punches to a bit pattern of 00, but some encode the zone punches in 12-11-0 order, preserving alphabetical order, while others use 0-11-12 order, resulting in a partially reversed alphabet.
# The handling of the digit 0.  The straightforward translation from punched form would place the blank before digits 1&amp;ndash;9, and encode 0 somewhere else entirely.  All codes have some special-case handling which either translates the digit 0 to the all-zero binary code (and moves the blank elsewhere), or gives it binary code 001010 (decimal 10) and uses the 8+2 punch elsewhere.
# The assignment of special characters.  The characters assigned to codes beyond the basic alphanumeric set varied widely, even within one model of computer.

In "Spanish speaking countries", the character ''"Ñ"'' did not exist in the original system, therefore ''"@"'' was chosen by most manufacturers: Bull, NCR, and Control Data, but there was an inconsistency when merging databases to 7-bit ASCII code, for in that coding system the ''"/"'' character was chosen, resulting in two different codes for the same character.

==Examples of BCD codes==
The following charts show the numeric values of BCD characters in [[hexadecimal]] (base-16) notation, as that most clearly reflects the structure of 4-bit binary coded decimal, plus two extra bits.  For example, the code for 'A",  in row 2x and column x1, is hexadecimal 21, or binary '01 0001'.

===48-character BCD code===
The first versions of BCDIC had 48 characters, as they were based on card punch patterns and the repertoires of printers, neither of which encouraged having a power-of-two number of characters.

This was based on a 40-character punched card code; the original 37 (10 digits, 26 letters, and blank), plus three commercially important characters added around 1932:&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{Rp|67}} [[hyphen-minus]] used for printing credit balances and hyphenated names, the [[ampersand]] also used in many names and addresses ([[Procter &amp; Gamble]], Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith), and the [[asterisk]] used to overprint unused fields when printing [[cheque]]s.

==={{anchor|IBM 704 BCD}}IBM 704 BCD code===
The IBM 704 reordered the BCDIC code to allow a normal alphabetic collating order internally, with 0 before 1 and A before Z.  It could automatically translate between this internal form and the earlier BCDIC when reading and writing [[magnetic tape]]s.&lt;ref name="703 PoE"/&gt;

({{overset|+|0}} and {{overset|&amp;minus;|0}} were rarely-used characters that corresponded to the punched-card convention of a digit 0 with an overpunched sign in rows 12 or 11.)

The following table shows the code assignments for the type 716 printer used with the IBM 704 computer.&lt;ref name="703 PoE V"&gt;{{cite book |title=IBM 704 electronic data-processing machine manual of operation |date=1955 |publisher=[[IBM]] |id=Form 24-6661-2 |url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/24-6661-2_704_Manual_1955.pdf#page=35 |page=58 |access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This printer takes virtual punched-card columns as input, so the mapping from 6-bit binary characters is done by software, and is not built into the printer.

This is a repertoire of 45 characters (not counting blank, which is handled specially by the printer), as the characters &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; are duplicated.

There was some variation; IBM 704 Fortran had a different set of special characters (preserving only the duplicated minus sign).&lt;ref name="704 Fortran"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fortran Automatic Coding System for the IBM 704 |url=https://www.fortran.com/FortranForTheIBM704.pdf#page=51 |publisher=[[IBM]] |access-date=2015-09-15 |page=49 |date=1956-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar code was used for the [[IBM 709]], [[IBM 7090|7090]] and [[IBM 7094|7094]] successors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBM 7090/94 Character Representation |url=http://www.frobenius.com/characters.htm |author-first=Jack |author-last=Harper |date=2001-08-21 |access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with some of the special characters reassigned:

==={{anchor|IBM 1401 BCD}}IBM 1401 BCD code===
The [[IBM 1401]] used the all-zero code for blank, and moved the digit zero to the code 10.  It had defined character forms for all possible values, for documentation purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[IBM]] |title=IBM 1401 Data Processing System: Reference Manual |id=A24-1403-5 |date=April 1962 |page=170 |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314091317/http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only 48 of the 63 non-blank characters were printable, and there was considerable variation in how the other code values (shaded in the table below) were depicted in practice.  Even the other characters varied between different available print chains for the [[IBM 1403]] printer.

[[File:school-sport-cap-1930.jpg|thumb|Sports cap awarded to a [[Perth Academy]] schoolboy in the UK in the 1930s]]

In [[sport]], a '''cap''' is a [[metaphor]]ical term for a player's '''appearance''' in a game at international level. The term dates from the practice in the [[United Kingdom]] of awarding a [[cap]] to every player in an international match of [[association football]]. In the early days of football, the concept of each team wearing a set of matching shirts had not been universally adopted, so each side would distinguish itself from the other by wearing a specific sort of cap. 

An early illustration of the [[1872 Scotland vs England football match|first international football match]] between Scotland and England in 1872 shows the Scottish players wearing [[cowl]]s, and the English wearing a variety of school caps. The practice was first approved on 10 May 1886 for association football after a proposal made by N. Lane Jackson, founder of the [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]]: &lt;ref&gt; {{citeweb|title=What does the term 'Cap' mean in sport?|url=https://albionsports.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/what-does-the-term-cap-mean-in-sport/|website=albionsports.wordpress.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That all players taking part for England in future international matches be presented with a white silk cap with red rose embroidered on the front. These to be termed ''International Caps''.}}

The act of awarding a cap is now international and is applied to other sports. Although in some sports physical caps may not now always be given (whether at all or for each appearance) the term "cap" for an international or other appearance has been retained as an indicator of the number of occasions on which a sportsperson has represented a team in a particular sport. Thus, a "cap" is awarded for each game played and so a player who has played ''x'' games, for the team, is said to have been ''capped x'' times or have won ''x'' caps.

The practice of awarding a physical cap varies from sport to sport. It may be awarded prior to a player's debut or, particularly for national teams, a commemorative cap may be awarded after a player reaches the 100th cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=All Blacks century-makers: What it takes to crack 100|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11525788|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Steven Gerrard memorabilia to be exhibited at Anfield|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9850586/gerrards-anfield-exhibition|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==
As an example, the England men's association football teams still awards physical caps.  Players are awarded one cap for every match they play — unless they play in a World Cup or European Championship finals tournament. Then they are given a single cap for the competition — with the names of all their opponents stitched into the fabric of the cap itself.  For example, when David Beckham made his one hundredth appearance for England, because a number of his appearances had been at World Cup and European Championship final tournaments for which he received only one cap, he received only his 85th physical cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2008/03/26/dont-tell-anyone-but-this-is-only-beckhams-85th-cap/|title=Don’t tell anyone, but this is only Beckham’s 85th cap|website=Reuters|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world record holder for the highest number of international caps as of 5 November 2010 is retired [[United States women's national soccer team|American]] player [[Kristine Lilly]], who has 354 caps (between 1987 and 2010). In men's association football, the record belongs to former player [[Ahmed Hassan (footballer)|Ahmed Hassan]] of Egypt; he surpassed [[Claudio Suárez]] with his 178th cap on 27 March 2012. The first footballer to win 100 international caps was [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] of England's [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Wright went on to appear 105 times for England, 90 of them he obtained whilst he was a captain.

FIFA rules state that any club that refuses to release a player for national team duty is barred from using the player for two matches, a rule which is intended to discourage clubs from pretending that the player is injured. However, it is a player's choice to refuse to play for or retire from his or her national team.

===Records===
Some current leading holders of association football caps (as of 11 June 2017) are:

'''Bold''' denotes players currently active in international football.

==Cricket==
{{See also|Cricket cap}}
In [[cricket]], there are two types of caps. Firstly, there is the international type, as described above. Some countries also award a domestic type generally known as a "county cap". The latter system is most commonly applied in English&lt;!--sic - do not change to "British"--&gt; [[county cricket]]. Most counties do not automatically award caps to players on their first appearance; instead, they have to be "earned" through good performances. Indeed, one can play at the highest domestic level for several years, and have a quite significant career in [[first-class cricket]], without ever winning a cap.

===Records===
The world [[record for the number of caps in Test cricket]] is held by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[Indian cricket team|India]], who has, over the course of a 22-year career, collected 200. Tendulkar also holds the record for [[One Day International]]s, with 463 caps.

==Rugby Union==

{{See also|List of rugby union Test caps leaders}}

In [[rugby union]], 35 players have reached 100 international caps as of 5 June 2012.

Lions matches are classed as full international tests, and caps are awarded. The [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team|Pacific Islanders]] team, composed of players from [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]], [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]], [[Niue Rugby Union|Niue]] and [[Cook Islands national rugby union team|Cook Islands]] have a similar arrangement, although no players involved have so far reached 100 caps (Fijian [[Nicky Little]] is closest with 71 caps).

{{Mandarin vowels}}A '''Chinese [[vowel diagram]]''' or '''Chinese [[vowel chart]]''' is a schematic arrangement of the vowels of the [[Chinese language]], which usually refers to [[Standard Chinese]]. The earliest known Chinese vowel diagrams were made public in 1920 by Chinese linguist [[Yi Tso-lin]] with the publication of his ''Lectures on Chinese Phonetics'', three years after [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]] published the famous "cardinal vowel diagram" in 1917. Yi Tso-lin refers to those diagrams as "(simple/compound) rhyme composition charts [單/複韻構成圖]", which are diagrams depicting Chinese [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s. 

Unlike the trapezoidal English vowel diagram (right), the Chinese vowel diagram (left) is triangular. The phonetic symbols used in this diagram are known as the "National Phonetic Alphabet [注音字母]" or "National Phonetic Symbols [注音符號]" or simply "[[Bopomofo]]". Six vowels or monophthongs (simple rhyme or 單韻) are depicted in this diagram. They are: 

*ㄧ (IPA {{IPA|[i]}}), as in ㄧˋ (易, easy)
*ㄨ (IPA {{IPA|[u]}}), as in ㄨˋ (霧, fog)
*ㄦ (IPA {{IPA|[ɚ]}}), as in ㄦˋ (二, two)
*ㄛ (IPA {{IPA|[o]}}), as in ㄆㄛˋ (破, broken)
*ㄜ (IPA {{IPA|[ɤ]}}), as in ㄜˋ (餓, hungry)
*ㄚ (IPA {{IPA|[a]}}), as in ㄆㄚˋ (怕, fear)

Note that this chart utilizes four degrees of [[vowel height]] (closed, half-closed, half-open, open), three degrees of [[vowel backness]] (front, central, back), and three degrees of [[vowel roundedness]] (spread, natural, round). The placement of ㄦ({{IPA|[ɚ]}}) may be questionable, but all other vowels are generally speaking where they ought to be.
{|
|[[File:chn vowels 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese vowel diagram for monophthongs]]
|[[File:chn vowels 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese vowel diagram for falling diphthongs]]
|[[File:chn vowels 3.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese vowel diagram for rising diphthongs]]
|}
The same vowel chart is used to depict diphthongs (compound rhyme or 複韻), with an arrow indicating the starting position and ending position of each diphthong. Six [[falling diphthongs]] are depicted in the following diagram. They are： 

*ㄩ (IPA {{IPA|[y]}}), as in ㄩˋ (玉, jade)
*ㄝ (IPA {{IPA|[ɛ]}}), as in ㄧㄝˋ (夜, night)
*ㄟ (IPA {{IPA|[ei̯]}}), as in ㄌㄟˋ (累, tired)
*ㄡ (IPA {{IPA|[oʊ̯]}}), as in ㄉㄡˋ (豆, bean)
*ㄞ (IPA {{IPA|[ai̯]}}), as in ㄉㄞˋ (帶, belt)
*ㄠ (IPA {{IPA|[ɑʊ̯]}}), as in ㄉㄠˋ (道, way)

The reason why apparent monophthongs ㄩ {{IPA|[y]}} and ㄝ {{IPA|[ɛ]}} are included in this chart is purely phonological and historical. According to this theory, those two vowels are really diphthongs, i.e. ㄧㄨ {{IPA|[i̯u]}} and ㄧㄝ {{IPA|[i̯ɛ]}}. Even so, those vowels should be considered "rising diphthongs" on a par with those in the next diagram. 

The next diagram depicts four rising diphthongs, as follows:

*ㄧㄛ (IPA {{IPA|[i̯o]}}), as in ㄧㄛˋ (唷, an interjection)
*ㄨㄛ (IPA {{IPA|[u̯o]}}), as in ㄨㄛˋ (臥, lie)
*ㄧㄚ (IPA {{IPA|[i̯a]}}), as in ㄧㄚˋ (亞, Asia)
*ㄨㄚ (IPA {{IPA|[u̯a]}}), as in ㄨㄚˋ (襪, socks)

==Symbols of Mandarin vowels==
The exact number of vowels in Mandarin may vary depending on the phonological theory and methodology. The major systems for Mandarin (Putonghua) transliteration are listed below

Note the "apical vowels", often represented as {{IPA|[ɿ]}} and {{IPA|[ʅ]}} by sinologists, that appear after apical dental and retroflex fricatives/affricates. Notice that those two IPA symbols are now considered [[Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet]].

'''Chuukese''' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|uː|ˈ|k|iː|z}}, also rendered '''Trukese''' {{IPAc-en|t|r|ʌ|ˈ|k|iː|z}},&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Trukic languages|Trukic language]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]] spoken primarily on the islands of [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] in the [[Caroline Islands]] in [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]. There are communities of speakers on [[Pohnpei]], [[Guam]], and the Hawai'ian Islands as well. Estimates show that there are about 45,900 speakers in Micronesia.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Chuukese has the unusual feature of permitting word-initial [[geminate]] (double) consonants. The common ancestor of Western Micronesian languages is believed to have had this feature, but most of its modern descendants have lost it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Truk'' and ''Chuuk'' are a difference in orthography, and both older ''tr'' and current ''ch'' transcribe the sound {{IPAblink|tʂ}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33686">'''Conceptual writing''' (often used interchangeably with '''conceptual poetry''') is a term which describes a range of experimental texts based on techniques such as appropriation (the "literary [[Readymade|ready-made]]"), texts which may be reduced to a set of procedures, a generative instruction or constraint, a "concept" which precedes and is considered more important than the resulting text(s). As a category, it is closely related to [[conceptual art]].

== History of the term ==

Although ''conceptual poetry'' may have freely circulated in relation to some text-based [[Conceptual art]] works (during the heyday of the movement), "conceptual writing" was coined as a term in 2003, while ''The UbuWeb Anthology of Conceptual Writing'' was created by [[Craig Dworkin]] and [[Kenneth Goldsmith]] (the on-line anthology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/concept/|title=U B U W E B :: Anthology of Conceptual Writing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; differs from the 2011 print anthology). [[Marjorie Perloff]] organized a conference with the title ''Conceptual Poetry and Its Others'' in the summer of 2008, at the [[University of Arizona]] Poetry Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/04/conceptual-writing-a-worldview/|title=Conceptual Writing: A Worldview|author=Poetry Foundation|work=Harriet: The Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derek Beaulieu]], [[Robert Fitterman]] and [[Vanessa Place]] have also used the terms "conceptual poetry" or "conceptual poetics" in the following years.

== Conceptual art and conceptual writing ==

The first notable difference from conceptual art is that textual-orientated gestures (such as copying, erasing or replacing words) prevail in conceptual writing. The second difference is that, while conceptual strategies "are embedded in the writing process", recent conceptual writing has a relationship with the development and rise of the computers and especially of the [[Internet]]: "With the rise of the Web, writing has met its photography. [...] Faced with an unprecedented amount of available digital text, writing needs to redefine itself to adapt to the new environment of textual abundance. [...] The computer encourages us to mimic its workings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dworkin|first1=Craig|last2=Goldsmith|first2=Kenneth|title=Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing|date=2011|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Illinois|isbn=978-0-8101-2711-1|pages=xvii-xviii|url=http://monoskop.org/images/3/3c/Dworkin_Craig_Goldsmith_Kenneth_eds_Against_Expression_An_Anthology_of_Conceptual_Writing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third difference is the concept of ''thinkership''. [[Robert Fitterman]] writes that: "Conceptual Writing, in fact, might best be defined not by the strategies used but by the expectations of the readership or thinkership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitterman|first1=Robert|last2=Place|first2=Vanessa|title=Notes on Conceptualism|date=2010|publisher=Ugly Ducking Presse|location=New York|isbn=978-1-933254-46-3|page=11|edition=Second |url=http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Notes_free.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure conceptualism negates the need for reading in the traditional textual sense—one does not need to “read" the work as much as think about the idea of the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitterman|first1=Robert|last2=Place|first2=Vanessa|title=Notes on Conceptualism|date=2010|publisher=Ugly Ducking Presse|location=New York|isbn=978-1-933254-46-3|page=27|edition=Second |url=http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Notes_free.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''conceptual poetry'' is most often used for two reasons: it brings out the etymological meaning of the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[poiesis]] ("to make") and it emphasises the fact that this kind of writing has developed historically as a mode of avant-garde poetry (from [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]’s ''Le Livre'' and [[Dada]] to [[Oulipo]] and [[concrete poetry]]) and, let aside the visual artists who also explore or have explored writing (historical examples include [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] and especially [[Andy Warhol]]), is now practiced also within the literary field. It is significant though that many of these writers, including [[Kenneth Goldsmith]], are often supported by art institutions and may still come from art backgrounds.
 
''Conceptual poetry'' (or ''ConPo'') is often used as a name for the entire movement which has more recently emerged and largely originates in the American academic scene of the 2000s (although conceptual writers are present today in most countries with avant-garde traditions [citation needed]). Both the new conceptual writers and their well-established models, the [[Language poets]] (among which [[David Antin]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Bernadette Mayer]] or [[Ron Silliman]] also authored conceptual writings), have been placed by the critic [[Marjorie Perloff]] in an American tradition dating back to [[Gertrude Stein]] and the [[Objectivist poets|Objectivists]] [citation needed]. The [[Flarf poetry]] group is often mentioned in the same context and at least some of their works are considered conceptual, but are different in some aspects to the "pure" conceptualists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/goldsmith/whitney-intro.html|title=Introduction to Flarf vs. Conceptual Writing, Whitney Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/237176|title=Flarf is Dionysus. Conceptual Writing is Apollo.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/04/flarf-versus-conceptual-writing/|title=Flarf Versus Conceptual Writing|date=9 April 2009|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Goldsmith]] places emphasis on the concept of ''unoriginality'' and has dubbed his own course (where students learn ways to appropriate texts) as ''uncreative writing'', described in the book ''Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age'' (2011). Marjorie Perloff, to whom [[Craig Dworkin]] and Goldsmith have dedicated ''Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing'' (2011), considers in ''Unoriginal Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century'' (2012) that the "paradigmatic work" of the "unoriginal genius" is [[Walter Benjamin]]’s [[Arcades Project]] (which inspired the concept of Goldsmith’s 2015 book, ''Capital'').

== Criticism ==

In ''The Poetry Project Newsletter'', #231 of April/May 2012, [[Johanna Drucker]] publishes an article named "Beyond Conceptualisms: Poetics after Critique and the End of the Individual Voice", in which she considers that "Conceptual writing was intriguing and provocative. In the last few years, its practices have generated much debate. But as its outlines have become more defined, it seems to be passing into another phase. Institutionalization often signals that energetic innovation is becoming history or at least has ceased to break new ground. [...] Conceptualism is probably over now, even in its newest iterations".&lt;ref&gt;http://poetryproject.org/wp-content/uploads/PPNL-231-FINAL-FOR-PRINTING.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian poet and essayist, [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]] published on the blog of [[Poetry Foundation]] (known for publishing regularly texts by/on [[Flarf poetry|Flarf]] and Conceptual poets) a satire called ''Notes on Conceptualism'' (after the same-titled book by Fitterman and Place), containing lines such as "Conceptual poetry is mainly about unearthing neuroses in the minds of the people who make it. By far and away / the most common of these is obsessive-compulsive disorder" and "Conceptual poetry is constructed primarily by tools – by reason. There is relatively little in it of the less blatant faculties – imagination / emotion / memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2013/05/notes-on-conceptualism/|title=Notes on Conceptualism|author=Poetry Foundation|work=Harriet: The Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Theses on Antisubjectivist Dogma'', [[Keston Sutherland]] considers that "Conceptual poets and antisubjectivists of every other poetical stripe [...] are indifferent or oblivious to the history of poetic technique", as "there is no such thing as “traditional poetry" and there is no such thing as “the Lyric I". The use of the first person pronoun in poetry is as various and complex as the use of language itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afieryflyingroule.tumblr.com/post/49378474736/keston-sutherland-theses-on-antisubjectivist|title=A Fiery Flying Roule:|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely critical of the "closed" and "exclusive" politics of avant-garde groups, [[Amy King]] points out the strategies through which the American conceptual writers have achieved institutionalization:

"Now crowned the descendants of [[Language poets|Language Poetry]], both of these groups have calculated and curated a lineage, garnering attention by using the capitalist pop culture tool of sensationalism, specifically a faux-conflict, curated imitative performances of artists who successfully achieved status via the cult of personality [...], along with prolific referencing, reviews, and applause for each other’s efforts. [...] What took the Language poets a few decades, these two groups have achieved within a fraction of the time: the paved road to institutional acclaim, centrality, and canonization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2013/07/beauty-and-the-beastly-po-biz-part-1/|title=Beauty And The Beastly Po-Biz, Part 1 - The Rumpus.net|work=The Rumpus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy King continues in this article to denounce the "reductive" narratives of the Conceptualists, the questionable "institutional critique or capitalist unrest / disruption" they have brought and "the seamless perpetuation of commodification", doubting whether "Conceptual performances would hold up without the theory that explains and contextualizes it" or whether "the work sustain without the institutions they are framed in and supported by". A recurrent critique regards "the limited locus and demographic".

In the second part of her article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2013/07/beauty-and-the-beastly-po-biz-part-2/|title=Beauty And The Beastly Po-Biz, Part 2 - The Rumpus.net|work=The Rumpus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy King criticizes a large number of claims authored by [[Marjorie Perloff]] and notes [[Kenneth Goldsmith]]’s recent appearances on the TV and at the [[White House]]. She provides here the following clarification:

"Like many poets, I continue to use a number of techniques over which these groups have become proprietary. The techniques themselves are neutral; how one employs them is where poetics begins. Attempting to trademark these techniques (i.e. “Conceptualism," “Flarf") is precisely a form of capitalist [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]]. I’m not out to deny anyone institutional participation or access to resources; rather, I want to call attention to the claim these groups purport to block capitalism while intentionally employing capitalist techniques [...] to achieve and secure status within the capitalist structure."

=== 2015 controversy ===

Following the concept of ''Seven American Deaths and Disasters'', [[Kenneth Goldsmith]] read on March 13 ''The Body of Michael Brown'', a text consisting of [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]]’s [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] autopsy report rearranged as to end with the phrase "The remaining male genitalia system is unremarkable". This caused strong negatives reactions not among the audience, but on [[Twitter]] and other social networks [http://hyperallergic.com/190954/kenneth-goldsmith-remixes-michael-brown-autopsy-report-as-poetry/]. Apparently, the recording of the performance was not made public by the [[Brown University]] (where the text was read) according to Goldsmith’s wish; he also claimed that "my speaker’s fee from the Interrupt 3 event will be donated to the family of [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]]".&lt;ref name="alisonflood"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/17/michael-brown-autopsy-report-poem-kenneth-goldsmith|title=US poet defends reading of Michael Brown autopsy report as a poem|author=Alison Flood|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Vanessa Place]] had started tweeting [[Margaret Mitchell]]’s [[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]] in order to highlight its racist language and stereotypes, according to an artist statement that was posted on [[Facebook]]. However, a Change.org petition from 2015 demanded the blacklisting of Place from the Association of Writers and Writing Programs for "propagating offensive material", as the authors of the petition consider that her ''Gone With the Wind'' project is "racially insensitive, if not downright racist" and that it "re-inscribes that text’s racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/28/does-tweeting-gone-with-the-wind-make-this-poet-racist.html|title=Does Tweeting ‘Gone With the Wind’ Make This Poet Racist?|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2015, the Association announced that Place had been removed from the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awpwriter.org/magazine_media/writers_news_view/3716/update_regarding_the_awp_los_angeles_2016_subcommittee|title=AWP: The Writer's News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Poetry is becoming progressively fluid, merging protest and performance into its practice. The era of Conceptual Poetry’s ahistorical nihilism is over and we have entered a new era, the poetry of social engagement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/122985/new-movement-american-poetry-not-kenneth-goldsmith|title=The New Movement in American Poetry is not Kenneth Goldsmith - New Republic|author=Cathy Park Hong|date=1 October 2015|work=New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-conceptual poetry ==

In ''Notes on Post-conceptual Poetry'', [[Felix Bernstein (performance artist)|Felix Bernstein]] (son of the [[Language poets|Language poet]] [[Charles Bernstein]]) writes about a recent wave of "second-generation Conceptual poetry", "in dialogue with" and reacting to ''Conceptual poetry'', as part of a "turn" to what Bernstein calls "[[queer]] structuralism". These poets may often combine "confessional/affective/lyrical" and "mechanical/conceptual" aspects, while engaging with the "death of work" (in symmetry with the "death of the reader" of previous theory):

"This would mean falling into the messy muck of libidinal flows (or the Internet or ‘whatever’) without leaving a trace of authorship and without giving in to those dominant modes of leftist discourse (that mark the academy, the art world, and politics), which require the artwork to pave the way for didactic redemption, and require that art be boxed into the framings of [[queer theory]] or speculative [[materialism]] or [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralism]] or affect studies or [[Alain Badiou|Badiousian]]-[[Slavoj Žižek|Zizekian]], etc. That is to say, that the Post-conceptual poet could make works that are not afforded privilege of ‘example’ in the seemingly endless war between ‘neoliberal versus subversive’ or ‘subjective/affective versus mechanical’ or the various attempts to wield both subject and object [...] together vis-à-vis universalized particulars like the term ‘[[queer]]’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Felix|title=Notes on Post-conceptual poetry|url=http://www.thevolta.org/ewc41-fbernstein-p1.html|website=The Volta|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felix Bernstein (performance artist)|Felix Bernstein]] cites as examples [[Sophia Le Fraga]], [[Andrew Durbin]], [[J. Gordon Faylor]], [[Trisha Low]], [[Josef Kaplan]], [[Joey Yearous-algozin]], [[Holly Melgard]], [[Danny Snelson]], [[Steve McLaughlin]], [[Steve Zultanski]], while also mentioning in a footnote the Goldsmith-curated project ''Poetry Will Be Made By All'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poetrywillbemadebyall.com/1000-books/|title=1000 BOOKSBY 1000 POETS|work=Poetry Will Be Made By All}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains 1,000 books by 1,000 young poets (in English and several other languages). Containing both conceptual and lyrical writings (or a mix of both), the books published in this collection may be considered in some ways ''Post-conceptual''.

{{No footnotes|date=June 2018}}

In telecommunications, the '''coverage''' of a [[radio station]] is the geographic area where the station can communicate. [[broadcasting|Broadcasters]] and [[telecommunications]] companies frequently produce [[coverage map]]s to indicate to users the station's intended service area. 
Coverage depends on several factors, such as [[orography]] (i.e. mountains) and buildings, technology, radio frequency and perhaps most importantly for two-way telecommunications the sensitivity and transmit efficiency of the consumer equipment. Some frequencies provide better regional coverage, while other frequencies penetrate better through obstacles, such as buildings in cities. 

The ability of a mobile phone to connect to a [[base station]] depends on the strength of the signal. That may be boosted by higher power transmissions, better antennas, taller antenna masts or alternative solutions like in-building picocells. Normal Macro-Cell signals need to be boosted to pass through buildings, which is a particular problem designing networks for large metropolitan areas with modern skyscrapers, hence the current drive for small cells and micro and pico cells. Signals also do not travel deep underground, so specialized transmission solutions are used to deliver mobile phone coverage into areas such as [[underground parking]] garages and [[subway train]]s.

== Coverage noticer ==
A coverage noticer is a device that beeps (or vibrates) when in a zone that lacks coverage ([[wikt:white spot|white spot]]). This is fundamental for critical services (security, emergency and so on). When the user goes to a covered area, the noticer ceases beeping. Similarly [http://www.radiocoveragemaps.com/Google/MapPage/Eiffel.html] coverage maps are often used to visualize coverage, these are produced by networks themselves as well as independent companies.
 
Coverage noticers can be integrated in a [[mobile phone]] also and several apps exist to show coverage maps on devices, including 'Coverage?', [[OpenSignal]], and [[Sensorly]].

In medicine, '''distress''' is an [[suffering|aversive]] state in which a [[person]] is unable to completely adapt to [[stressor]]s and their resulting [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and shows maladaptive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1542&amp;page=4 4] |title=Recognition and Alleviation of Pain and Distress in Laboratory Animals |date=1992 |author1=National Research Council |author1-link=National Research Council (United States) |author2=Institute for Laboratory Animal Research |author2-link=Institute for Laboratory Animal Research |author3=Committee on Pain and Distress in Laboratory Animals |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-07525-1 |doi=10.17226/1542 |doi-access=free |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/1542/recognition-and-alleviation-of-pain-and-distress-in-laboratory-animals |chapter=Introduction |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/1542/chapter/2 |via=National Academies Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction (e.g., aggression, passivity, or withdrawal).

Distress is the opposite of [[eustress]], a positive stress that motivates people.

== Risk factors ==
Stress can be created by influences such as [[occupational stress|work]], school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age.

People under constant distress are more likely to become sick, mentally or physically. There is a clear response association between psychological distress and major causes of mortality across the full range of distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4933 |first1=Tom C. |last1=Russ |first2=Emmanuel |last2=Stamatakis |first3=Mark |last3=Hamer |first4=John M. |last4=Starr |first5=Mika |last5=Kivimäki |first6=G. David |last6=Batty |date=31 July 2012 |title=Association between psychological distress and mortality: individual participant pooled analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies |journal=BMJ |volume=345 |page=e4933 |doi=10.1136/bmj.e4933 |doi-access=free |pmid=22849956 |pmc=3409083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education has been linked to a reduction in psychological distress in both men and women, and these effects persist throughout the aging process, not just immediately after receiving education. However, this link does lessen with age. The major mechanism by which higher education plays a role on reducing stress in men is more so related to [[Labour economics|labor-market resources]] rather than [[Social influence|social resources]] as in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brännlund |first1=Annica |last2=Hammarström |first2=Anne |date=March 2014 |title=Higher education and psychological distress: A 27-year prospective cohort study in Sweden |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Public Health |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=155–62 |doi=10.1177/1403494813511559 |pmid=24265167 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the clinic, distress is a [[patient reported outcome]] that has a huge impact on patient's quality of life. To assess patient distress, a [[Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale]] (HADS) questionnaire is most commonly used. The score from the HADS questionnaire guides a clinician to recommend [[lifestyle medicine|lifestyle modifications]] or further assessment for mental disorders like [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hansen |first1=C.H. |last2=Walker |first2=J. |last3=Thekkumpurath |first3=P. |last4=Kleiboer |first4=A. |last5=Beale |first5=C. |last6=Sawhney |first6=A. |last7=Murray |first7=G. |last8=Sharpe |first8=M. |date=October 2013 |title=Screening medical patients for distress and depression: does measurement in the clinic prior to the consultation overestimate distress measured at home? |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=43 |issue=10 |pages=2121–8 |doi=10.1017/S0033291712002930 |pmid=23339843 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
{{See also|Psychological stress#Management}}
People often find ways of dealing with distress, in both negative and positive ways. Examples of positive ways are listening to music, calming exercises, coloring, sports and similar healthy distractions. Negative ways can include but are not limited to use of drugs including alcohol, and expression of anger, which are likely to lead to complicated social interactions, thus causing increased distress.

'''Dogon Sign Language''' is a [[community sign language]] spoken in [[Douentza]] and neighboring communities in the [[Dogon country]] in Mali.  It is unknown how similar it may be to the nearby [[village sign language]], [[Tebul Sign Language]].  As of 2013, there is no school for the deaf in the area, but one is planned; the introduction of [[American Sign Language]] as the language of instruction may affect Dogon Sign.  A video corpus has been collected by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics to document the pre-contact form of the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7232">'''Facility condition assessment''' (FCA) is an analysis of the condition of a facility in terms of age, design, construction methods, and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facility Condition Assessment|url=http://www.vfa.com/client-pages/facility-condition-assessment1/|website=VFA|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facility Condition Assessments|url=http://www.emgcorp.com/Services/capital-planning/facility-condition-assessment|website=EMG Corp|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry professionals who perform the assessment are typically architects and engineers, and skilled-trade technicians. Engineering and architectural professional opinions as to the conditions observed are part of the assessment. [[Building diagnostics]] go beyond FCAs to determine solutions to the problems found and predict outcomes of the solutions.

This analysis can be done by walk-through inspection, mathematical modeling (see Mathematical Model), or a combination of both. But the most accurate way of determining the condition requires walk-through to collect baseline data.

This analysis can be performed on government/public, commercial, and private facilities.

The term FCA describes work accomplished for Federal, State, and local government agencies or entities, as well as, private facilities.

==History==

Architectural and Engineering (A&amp;E) firms, or organizations, have assessed facilities as a part of their duties since those professions were conceived and formalized; though engineering and architectural work are not part of the assessment and are excluded in the scope of the assessment. The end product was usually an extensive narrative, supplemented with drawings and photographs, as to what conditions were observed, with a summary budget for correction of all deficiencies.

In the 1970s the term Facility Audit &lt;ref&gt;"The Facilities Audit, Dr. Harvey H. Kaiser"&lt;/ref&gt; was commonly used. The term Facility Audit was later phased-out as it suggested a review of the way a facility manager spent money on the facility; something that might be done by an ‘Auditor’. Modern-day FCA work took on its current form around the time of the founding of the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA) in 1980, although the two were not related.

What did enable FCA to become useful was the dramatic reduction in the size of computers, coupled with a rapid increase in speed and storage. This helped create the product known as a [[computerized maintenance management system]], or CMMS.

The first publication that described the use of FCA data, financial modeling, and the use of CMMS application was “Managing the Facilities Portfolio”, published by the National Association of College University Business Officers. The principal author of that book was Applied Management Engineering, Inc. of [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameinc.biz Applied Management Engineering, Inc]&lt;/ref&gt;

As technology has advanced, Facility Condition Assessment Modeling has become more recognized in the condition assessment industry.  In 2007, Graphic Systems, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teicholz|first1=Eric|last2=Evans|first2=Gary|title=Theoretical Condition Indices|url=http://www.graphicsystems.biz/gsi/articles/Condition%20Indices%20and%20Strategic%20Planning0707.pdf|website=Graphic Systems, Inc.|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; following research they had performed for the United States Federal Government, published a white paper on Condition Indices and Strategic Planning, demonstrating the value that strategic condition assessment modeling and the theoretical condition index can offer to traditional visual condition assessment programs.

==Application==

Once the walk-through data has been collected, appropriate estimates to correct the deficiencies should be prepared.

Once the estimates are prepared, the a user is left with potentially 1,000’s of line items that need to be sorted, grouped together, and presented in a useful format. It is typical this format will adhere to the guidelines set forth by the [[Construction Specifications Institute]].

At the point, computerized assistance makes the product usable and changes the nature of the FCA service from pure engineering and management, to an amalgam of engineering, management, and technology.

Mostly facility-intensive organization such as military bases, schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fieldingnair.com/publications/proven/proven_methodology.htm |title=School Planning &amp; Management - A Proven Methodology for Assessing School Buildings |work=fieldingnair.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309075209/http://www.fieldingnair.com/Publications/proven/proven_methodology.htm |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; colleges and universities, and city &lt;ref&gt;https://pbworld.com/capabilities_projects/new_york_city_school_construction_authority_building_condition_assessment_survey_.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and state governments need to develop a budget that allocates money for maintenance and repair. The FCA data is used by people or organizations (e.g. Board of Directors, Commissioners, Trustees, etc.) that must make these decisions as to how to distribute financial resources for facilities along with other needs of the organization. Frequently these people or organizations rely upon facility or building [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for year-to-year comparisons.

A good example of a facility metric that can be generated by the FCA is the [[Facility Condition Index]], or FCI. The FCI can be further used in the development and usage of [[Building Information Modeling]] for existing buildings. The United States [[National Park Service]] used the FCI and other metrics to better manage its assets and set realistic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facility Condition Index, Other Metrics, Improve Asset Management at National Park Service|url=http://www.facilitiesnet.com/facilitiesmanagement/article/Facility-Condition-Index-Other-Metrics-Improve-Asset-Management-at-National-Park-Service-Facilities-Management-Facilities-Management-Feature--14349|website=FacilitiesNet|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">'''Gaius Matius''' (fl. 1st century BC) (''[[Pauly-Wissowa|PW]]'' 1) was a citizen of [[ancient Rome]] notable as a friend of [[Julius Caesar]] and of [[Cicero]], who described him in a letter to Trabatius (53BC) as "homo suavissimus doctissimusque".

A member of the [[Matius|''gens'' Matia]], he belonged to the [[Caesar's civil war|party of Caesar]], and helped Cicero in his relationship with Caesar in 49 and 48 BC. After the murder of Caesar, Matius, a dedicated Caesarian, warned of potential for grave repercussions including possible rebellions in Gaul or revolts of Caesar's legions.  When Octavian came to Rome, Matius became one of his close associates. Matius and [[Augustus|Octavian]] managed the July 44 BC games honoring the recently assassinated dictator. An exchange of letters between Cicero and Matius later in 44 has been preserved (''Letters to Friends'', 11.27 f.).

A Gaius Matius (''[[Pauly-Wissowa|PW]]'' 2) is recorded as a friend and assistant of [[Caesar Augustus]], an ''[[Eques (ancient Rome)|eques]]'' who wrote three volumes on [[gastronomy]] ([[Columella]] credits him with "mincemeat à la Matius" (''minutal Matianum'')), and was said by [[Pliny the Elder]] to have invented the clipping of shrubs in [[topiary]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'' xii.6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear however if this is the same person, or a later generation: Ronald Syme&lt;ref&gt;Syme, ''The Roman Revolution'' 1939, chap. 5, p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; supposes the later Matius to be the son of the first.

According to the [[Real Academia Española]], the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for [[apple]], ''manzana'' (and thus the related [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''maçã'' and [[Galician language|Galician]] ''mazá'') derives from ''Mattiāna mala'', "apples of Matius." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manzana|url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=OItjStD|website=Diccionario de la lengua española|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was mentioned by Pliny among fruits that had been recently introduced to Roman tables.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis''! XV.1.15 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gurage languages''' ({{lang-am|ጉራጌ}} ''Guragē'', also known as '''Guragie''') are a group of [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|South Ethiopic languages]], which belong to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. They are spoken by the [[Gurage people]], who inhabit the [[Gurage Zone]] within the larger multi-ethnic [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region]] in southwestern [[Ethiopia]].

==Overview==
The Gurage languages do not constitute a coherent linguistic grouping. Instead, the term is both linguistic and cultural. The Gurage people speak a number of separate languages, which all belong to the Southern subdivision of the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]] within the Afroasiatic family, which also includes [[Amharic]]. The languages are often referred to collectively as "'''Guraginya'''" by other Ethiopians (''-inya'' is the Amharic suffix for most Ethiopian Semitic languages).

There are three dialectically varied Gurage subgroups: Northern, Eastern and Western. East Gurage is more closely related to Amharic than to either of the other two groups. All the Gurage subgroups (Northern, Western, and Eastern Gurage) belong to South Ethiopic and East Gurage is on a different sub-branch of the family tree than Northern and Western Gurage. East Gurage is closely related to Harari, while Northern and Western Gurage are related to each other and Gafat.

The Gurage languages are written with the [[Ge'ez script]]. The Gurage subset of this script has 44 independent glyphs.

There is no general agreement on how many languages or dialects there are, in particular within the West Gurage grouping.

As the Gurage people are surrounded by speakers of [[Cushitic languages]], these languages have influenced the Gurage languages perhaps even more than they have other Ethiopian Semitic languages. For example, the East Gurage languages have a ten-vowel system characteristic of the neighboring Cushitic languages rather than the seven-vowel system common to most other Ethiopian Semitic languages, including the West Gurage languages.

==Languages==
In the following listing, the distinction between languages and dialects follows [[Ethnologue]].

;In the Northern group{{anchor|Northern}}
* [[Soddo language|Soddo]] (Kistane)
** Dialects: Soddo, Goggot (Dobi)

; In the Eastern group{{anchor|Eastern}}
* [[Silt'e language|Silt'e]] (Selti; not, strictly speaking, a Gurage language, since the people do not consider themselves Gurage)
** Dialects: Ulbare, Wolane, Inneqor
* [[Zay language|Zay]] (Zway)

;In the Western group{{anchor|Western}}
* [[Inor language|Inor]]
** Dialects: Ennemor [Inor proper], Endegegn, Gyeto
* [[Mesmes language|Mesmes]] (extinct; sometimes considered Inor)
* [[Mesqan language|Mesqan]]
* [[Sebat Bet Gurage language|Sebat Bet Gurage]]
** Dialects: [[Chaha language|Chaha]], Ezha, Gumer, Gura, [[Muher language|Muher]]

Sebat Bet (or Sebat Beit), in particular, is best understood as a grouping in itself; the term means literally "Seven Houses," and refers to seven specific Western Gurage groups and [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]]. Silt'e is more closely related to Amharic than to Soddo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">'''Hebraism''' is the identification of a usage, trait, or characteristic of the [[Hebrew language]]. By [[synecdoche|successive extension]] it is often applied to the [[Jews|Jewish people]], their [[Judaism|faith]], [[Zionism|national ideology]], or [[Jewish culture|culture]].

== Idiomatic Hebrew ==
There exist in the Hebrew language numerous [[idiom]]atic terms that don't translate easily to more widely used languages. To the extent those broader cultures rely for cultural meaning on Hebrew-language-based [[Hebrew Bible|scriptures]], those idioms sometimes prove puzzling.

Writer David Bivin gives examples of some difficult Hebrew idioms: "''be'arba enayim'', literally 'with four eyes,' means face to face without the presence of a third person, as in, 'The two men met with four eyes.' [The term] ''lo dubim ve lo ya'ar'' is literally '[There are] neither bears nor forest,' but means that something is completely false. And ''taman et yado batsalahat'', 'buried his hand in the dish,' means that someone idles away his time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jerusalemperspective.com/Default.aspx?tabid=27&amp;ArticleID=1551 Bivin, David. "Hebrew Idioms in the Gospels," ''Jerusalem Perspective Online''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526023358/http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/Default.aspx?tabid=27&amp;ArticleID=1551 |date=2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hebrew etymologies ==
The word "hebraism" may also describe a word in another language that has Hebrew [[etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hebraism "Hebraism," Merriam-Webster online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Several common-place phrases in English have Hebrew origins. Some examples are "The way of women," "Flowing with milk and honey," and "[[wikt:stiff-necked|stiff-necked]]."{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Distinctive language ==
Beyond simple etymology, both spoken and written Hebrew is marked by peculiar [[linguistics|linguistic]] elements that distinguish its semitic roots. These hebraisms include word order, [[chiasmus]], compound [[prepositions]], and numerous other distinctive features.

==Systematic Hebraisms==
Finally, the word "hebraism" describes a quality, character, nature, or [[Jewish philosophy|method of thought]], or [[Judaism|system of religion]] attributed to the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]]. It is in this sense that [[Matthew Arnold]] (1869) contrasts Hebraism with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/arnold/writings/4.html Arnold, Matthew. "Hebraism and Hellenism". From ''Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman's response to Arnold expands on this usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-15524303.html Feldman, Louis H., "Hebraism and Hellenism reconsidered," ''Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought'', March 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining since the aftermath of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].&lt;ref name="ASB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OxfordDictionaryChristianChurch /&gt;{{refn|name="Sáenz-BadillosRH"|Sáenz-Badillos, Ángel and John Elwolde: "There is general agreement that two main periods of RH (Rabbinical Hebrew) can be distinguished. The first, which lasted until the close of the Tannaitic era (around 200 CE), is characterized by RH as a spoken language gradually developing into a literary medium in which the Mishnah, Tosefta, ''baraitot'' and Tannaitic ''midrashim'' would be composed. The second stage begins with the ''[[Amoraim]]'' and sees RH being replaced by Aramaic as the spoken vernacular, surviving only as a literary language. Then it continued to be used in later rabbinic writings until the tenth century in, for example, the Hebrew portions of the two Talmuds and in midrashic and haggadic literature."&lt;ref name="Sáenz-Badillos 1996. P.170-171"/&gt;|group="note"}} [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and to a lesser extent [[Greek language|Greek]] were already in use as international languages, especially among elites and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;"If you couldn't speak Greek by say the time of early Christianity you couldn't get a job. You wouldn't get a good job. a professional job. You had to know Greek in addition to your own language. And so you were getting to a point where Jews...the Jewish community in say Egypt and large cities like Alexandria didn't know Hebrew anymore they only knew Greek. And so you need a Greek version in the synagogue."  – Josheph Blankinsopp, Professor of Biblical Studies University of Notre Dame in A&amp;E's ''Who Wrote the Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of [[Jewish liturgy]], [[rabbinic literature]], intra-Jewish commerce, and [[Jewish literature#Poetry|poetry]]. Then, in the 19th century, [[Revival of the Hebrew language|it was revived]] as a spoken and literary language. It became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Palestinian Jews|Palestine's Jews]], and subsequently of the State of [[Israel]]. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', in 1998, it was the language of 5 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; After Israel, the [[United States]] has the second largest Hebrew-speaking population, with 220,000 fluent speakers,&lt;ref name="2009 survey"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population/ancestry_language_spoken_at_home.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225193634/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population/ancestry_language_spoken_at_home.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 December 2007 |title=Table 53.

[[Modern Hebrew]] is the [[official language]] of the State of Israel, while premodern Hebrew is used for prayer or study in [[Jews|Jewish]] communities around the world today. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan dialect]] is also the liturgical tongue of the [[Samaritans]], while modern Hebrew or Arabic is their vernacular. As a foreign language, it is studied mostly by [[Jews]] and students of Judaism and Israel, and by [[Archaeology of Israel|archaeologists]] and linguists specializing in the [[Middle East]] and its civilizations, as well as by theologians in Christian seminaries.

The [[Torah]] (the first five books), and most of the rest of the [[Hebrew Bible]], is written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with much of its present form specifically in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around the time of the [[Babylonian captivity]]. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as ''{{transl|he|[[Lashon Hakodesh]]}}'' ({{lang|he|לשון הקדש}}), "the Holy Language", since ancient times.

== Etymology ==
The modern English word "Hebrew" is derived from [[Old French]] ''Ebrau'', via Latin from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Ἑβραῖος'' (''Hebraîos'') and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ibrāy'', all ultimately derived from [[Biblical Hebrew]] ''Ibri'' ({{lang|he|עברי}}), one of several names for the [[Israelites|Israelite]] (Jewish and Samaritan) people. It is traditionally understood to be an adjective based on the name of Abraham's ancestor, [[Eber]], mentioned in {{bibleref2|Genesis|10:21}}. The name is believed to be based on the Semitic root ''ʕ-b-r'' ({{lang|he|עבר}}) meaning "beyond", "other side", "across";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5676.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 5676. עֵ֫בֶר (eber) -- region across or beyond, side|website=biblehub.com|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpretations of the term "Hebrew" generally render its meaning as roughly "from the other side [of the river/desert]"—i.e., an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] for the inhabitants of the land of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel/Judah]], perhaps from the perspective of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Phoenicia]], or the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] (with the river referenced perhaps the [[Euphrates]], [[Jordan River|Jordan]], or [[Litani River|Litani]]; or maybe the northern [[Arabian Desert]] between [[Babylonia]] and [[Canaan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=12606 |title=הספריה של מט"ח |publisher=Lib.cet.ac.il |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare cognate [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] ''ebru'', of identical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uycYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=assyrian%20ebru|title=A Concise Dictionary of the Assyrian Languages|last=Muss-Arnolt|first=William|date=1905|publisher=Reuther &amp; Reichard|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest references to the language's name as "Hebrew" is found in the prologue to the [[Book of Ben Sira]],{{Efn|https://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=30|See original text}} from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="XeravitsZsengellér2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Géza Xeravits|author2=József Zsengellér|title=Studies in the Book of Ben Sira: Papers of the Third International Conference on the Deuterocanonical Books, Shime'on Centre, Pápa, Hungary, 18-20 May, 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y042aO03HLUC&amp;pg=PA43|date=25 June 2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=90-04-16906-7|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible does not use the term "Hebrew" in reference to the language of the [[Jews|Hebrew people]].&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John, ed. (2004) [2002]. ''The Biblical World''. 2. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Hebrew belongs to the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite group of languages]]. In turn, the Canaanite languages are a branch of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] family of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Allen P. ''Introducing Biblical Hebrew'', Baker Academic, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Avraham Ben-Yosef, Hebrew flourished as a spoken language in the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdoms of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] during about 1200 to 586 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;
אברהם בן יוסף ,מבוא לתולדות הלשון העברית (Avraham ben-Yosef, Introduction to the History of the Hebrew Language), page 38, אור-עם, Tel-Aviv, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient times following the [[Babylonian exile]], when the predominant international language in the region was [[Old Aramaic]].

Hebrew was extinct as a colloquial language by [[Late Antiquity]], but it continued to be used as a literary language and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literary [[Medieval Hebrew]], until its [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revival as a spoken language]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Share |first1=David L. |year=2017 |chapter=Learning to Read Hebrew |editor1-last=Verhoeven |editor1-first=Ludo |editor2-last=Perfetti |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-link=Charles Perfetti |title=Learning to Read Across Languages and Writing Systems |url=https://books.google.com/?id=t-w0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;q=%22colloquial%20usage%20ceased%20for%20some%22 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=156 |isbn=9781107095885 |access-date=1 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fellman |first1=Jack |year=1973 |title=The Revival of a Classical Tongue: Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Modern Hebrew Language |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eH_6deaHk8IC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;q=%22hebrew%20died%20as%20a%20spoken%22 |location=The Hague |publisher=Mouton |page=12 |isbn=9789027924957 |access-date=1 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oldest Hebrew inscriptions ===
{{Further|Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Ancient Hebrew writings}}
In July 2008 Israeli archaeologist [[Yosef Garfinkel|Yossi Garfinkel]] discovered a ceramic shard at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]] which he claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating around 3,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7700037.stm |title='Oldest Hebrew script' is found |access-date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said that the inscription was "proto-Canaanite" but cautioned that, "The differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear," and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 |title=Have Israeli Archaeologists Found World's Oldest Hebrew Inscription? |work=Haaretz |agency=AP |date=30 October 2008 |access-date=8 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071612/http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 |archive-date=6 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gezer calendar]] also dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of the Monarchic Period, the traditional time of the reign of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. Classified as Archaic Biblical Hebrew, the calendar presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The [[Gezer]] calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one that through the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] later became the [[Roman script]]. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use [[Mater lectionis|consonants to imply vowels]] even in the places where later Hebrew spelling requires it.

[[File:Silwan-inscr.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Shebna Inscription]], from the tomb of a royal steward found in [[Siloam]], dates to the 7th century BCE.]]
Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example [[Protosinaitic]]. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the [[acrophonic]] principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous [[Moabite Stone]] written in the Moabite dialect; the [[Siloam Inscription]], found near [[Jerusalem]], is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the [[ostracon|ostraca]] found near [[Lachish]] which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.

=== Classical Hebrew ===

====Biblical Hebrew====
{{main|Biblical Hebrew}}
In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew means the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing between the 10th century BCE and the turn of the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="dvbrbw"&gt;[http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_36.pdf William M. Schniedewind, "Prolegomena for the Sociolinguistics of Classical Hebrew", The Journal of Hebrew Scriptures vol. 5 article 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035409/http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_36.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises several evolving and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.
* [[Archaic Biblical Hebrew]] from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the Babylonian Exile and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew. It was written in the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. A script descended from this, the [[Samaritan alphabet]], is still used by the [[Samaritans]].
[[File:Sefer-torah-vayehi-binsoa.jpg|thumb|Hebrew script used in writing a Torah scroll. Note ornamental "crowns" on tops of certain letters.]]
* [[Biblical Hebrew|Standard Biblical Hebrew]] around the 8th to 6th centuries BCE, corresponding to the late Monarchic period and the Babylonian Exile. It is represented by the bulk of the Hebrew Bible that attains much of its present form around this time. Also called Biblical Hebrew, Early Biblical Hebrew, Classical Biblical Hebrew (or Classical Hebrew in the narrowest sense).
* [[Late Biblical Hebrew]], from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BCE, that corresponds to the Persian Period and is represented by certain texts in the [[Hebrew Bible]], notably the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of the particle ''she-'' (alternative of 'ʾasher' "that, which, who"). It adopted the [[Aramaic alphabet|Imperial Aramaic script]] (from which the modern Hebrew script descends).
* [[Israelian Hebrew]] is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, attested in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts.

====Early post-Biblical Hebrew====
* [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] Hebrew from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, corresponding to the Hellenistic and Roman Periods before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the Qumran Scrolls that form most (but not all) of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Commonly abbreviated as DSS Hebrew, also called Qumran Hebrew. The Imperial Aramaic script of the earlier scrolls in the 3rd century BCE evolved into the [[Hebrew square script]] of the later scrolls in the 1st century CE, also known as ''ketav Ashuri'' (Assyrian script), still in use today.
* [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] from the 1st to the 3rd or 4th century CE, corresponding to the Roman Period after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the bulk of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]] within the [[Talmud]] and by the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]] letters and the [[Copper Scroll]]. Also called Tannaitic Hebrew or Early Rabbinic Hebrew.

Sometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into "Biblical Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and "Mishnaic Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls).&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;M. Segal, ''A Grammar of Mishnaic Hebrew'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; However, today, most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew, thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either.&lt;ref name=Qimron&gt;Elisha Qimron, ''The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Harvard Semitic Studies 29 (Atlanta: Scholars Press 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the Byzantine Period in the 4th century CE, Classical Hebrew ceases as a regularly spoken language, roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah, apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophic [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba War]] around 135 CE.

===Displacement by Aramaic===

{{See also|Aramaic language}}
Around the 6th century BCE, the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] conquered the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]], destroying much of [[Jerusalem]] and exiling its population far to the East in [[Babylon]]. During the [[Babylonian captivity]], many [[Israelites]] learned Aramaic, the closely related Semitic language of their captors. Thus for a significant period, the [[Jewish]] elite became influenced by Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Ostler, ''Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World'', Harper Perennial, London, New York, Toronto, Sydney 2006 p80&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Cyrus the Great]] conquered Babylon, he allowed the Jewish people to return from captivity. As a result, {{synthesis inline|date=September 2015}} a local version of Aramaic came to be spoken in Israel alongside Hebrew. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Aramaic was the primary colloquial language of [[Samaria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Galilee]]an Jews, and western and intellectual Jews spoke [[Greek language|Greek]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} but a form of so-called [[Rabbinic Hebrew]] continued to be used as a vernacular in Judea until it was displaced by Aramaic, probably in the 3rd century CE. Certain [[Sadducees|Sadducee]], [[Pharisees|Pharisee]], [[Scribe#Judaism|Scribe]], Hermit, Zealot and Priest classes maintained an insistence on Hebrew, and all Jews maintained their identity with Hebrew songs and simple quotations from Hebrew texts.&lt;ref name="Sáenz-Badillos 1996.

The languages of Israel: policy, ideology and practice. P.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;

While there is no doubt that at a certain point, Hebrew was displaced as the everyday spoken language of most Jews, and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language, then [[Greek language|Greek]],&lt;ref name="Spolsky P.9"/&gt;{{refn|name="Sáenz-BadillosRH"|group="note"}} scholarly opinions on the exact dating of that shift have changed very much.&lt;ref name=OxfordDictionaryChristianChurch&gt;"Hebrew" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', edit. F.L. Cross, first edition (Oxford, 1958), 3rd edition (Oxford 1997). ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' which once said, in 1958 in its first edition, that Hebrew "ceased to be a spoken language around the fourth century BCE", now says, in its 1997 (third) edition, that Hebrew "continued to be used as a spoken and written language in the New Testament period".&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, most scholars followed Geiger and Dalman in thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel's [[History of Palestine#Hellenic kingdoms period|Hellenistic Period]] in the 4th century BCE, and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time. Segal, Klausner, and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946–1948 near [[Qumran]] revealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.

The Qumran scrolls indicate that Hebrew texts were readily understandable to the average Israelite, and that the language had evolved since Biblical times as spoken languages do.{{refn|Fernández &amp; Elwolde: "It is generally believed that the Dead Sea Scrolls, specifically the Copper Scroll and also the Bar Kokhba letters, have furnished clear evidence of the popular character of MH [Mishnaic Hebrew]."&lt;ref&gt;''An Introductory Grammar of Rabbinic Hebrew'' (Fernández &amp; Elwolde 1999, p.2)&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} Recent scholarship recognizes that reports of Jews speaking in Aramaic indicates a multilingual society, not necessarily the primary language spoken. Alongside Aramaic, Hebrew co-existed within Israel as a spoken language.&lt;ref name="Judaism 2006. P.460"&gt;The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period. 2006. P.460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the quote refers to the last sentence--&gt; Most scholars now date the demise of Hebrew as a spoken language to the end of the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Period]], or about 200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Borrás, Judit Targarona and Ángel Sáenz-Badillos. 1999. Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century. P.3&lt;/ref&gt; It continued on as a literary language down through the [[History of Palestine#Byzantine period|Byzantine Period]] from the 4th century CE.

The exact roles of Aramaic and Hebrew remain hotly debated. A trilingual scenario has been proposed for the land of Israel. Hebrew functioned as the local [[mother tongue]] with powerful ties to Israel's history, origins, and golden age and as the language of Israel's religion; Aramaic functioned as the international language with the rest of the Middle East; and eventually Greek functioned as another international language with the eastern areas of the Roman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;!--Refers to the entire "role distribution" indicated above.--&gt; According to another summary, Greek was the language of government, Hebrew the language of prayer, study and religious texts, and Aramaic was the language of legal contracts and trade.&lt;ref name=spolsky/&gt; There was also a geographic pattern: according to Spolsky, by the beginning of the Common Era, "[[Judeo-Aramaic]] was mainly used in Galilee in the north, Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers, and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea."&lt;ref name="Spolsky P.9"/&gt; In other words, "in terms of dialect geography, at the time of the [[tannaim]] Palestine could be divided into the Aramaic-speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area, Judaea, in which [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Rabbinic Hebrew]] was used among the descendants of returning exiles."&lt;ref name="Sáenz-Badillos 1996.

=== Mishnah and Talmud ===
{{Main|Mishnaic Hebrew}}
The term "Mishnaic Hebrew" generally refers to the Hebrew dialects found in the [[Talmud]], excepting quotations from the Hebrew Bible. The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew I), which was a [[spoken language]], and [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a [[literary language]]. The earlier section of the Talmud is the [[Mishnah]] that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the [[Midrash halakha|halachic]] [[Midrash]]im ([[Sifra]], [[Sifre]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the [[Tosefta]]. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is ''[[Baraita|Baraitot]]''. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.

About a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, the [[Gemara]], generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.

Because as early as the Torah's transcription the Scribe has been the highest position in Judaism, Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html Languages of the World (Hebrew)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117194849/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html |date=17 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2nd century CE when the [[Roman Empire]] exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry, and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.

=== Medieval Hebrew ===
{{Main|Medieval Hebrew}}
[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Aleppo Codex]]: 10th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pointing (Joshua 1:1).]]
[[File:Cochin Jewish Inscription.JPG|thumb|Kochangadi Synagogue in [[Kochi]], India dated to 1344.]]

After the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of [[Medieval Hebrew]] evolved. The most important is [[Tiberian Hebrew]] or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of [[Tiberias]] in [[Galilee]] that became the standard for vocalizing the [[Hebrew Bible]] and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called "Biblical Hebrew" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning "tradition"), who added [[niqqud|vowel points]] and [[Cantillation|grammar points]] to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The [[Syriac alphabet]], precursor to the [[Arabic alphabet]], also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The [[Aleppo Codex]], a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in [[Tiberias]], and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.

During the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the [[Islamic grammatical tradition|grammarians]] of [[Classical Arabic]]. Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]&lt;ref&gt;Abraham ibn Ezra, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19685 ''Hebrew Grammar''], Venice 1546 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; and later (in [[Provence]]), [[David Kimhi]]. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in a "purified" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.&lt;ref&gt;T. Carmi, ''Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the [[Ibn Tibbon]] family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.) Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.

Hebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses—not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,&lt;ref&gt;Safrai, Shmuel, Shemuel Safrai, M. Stern. 1976. The Jewish people in the first century. P.1036&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maimonides]]' writings, which were mostly in [[Arabic]];&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Marvin. 1995. Interpreting Maimonides. P.326&lt;/ref&gt; but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cojs.org/1577-first-printing-press-middle-east-safed/|title=1577 The First Printing Press in the Middle East - Safed - Center for Online Judaic Studies|date=2017-09-07|work=Center for Online Judaic Studies|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi [[Avraham Danzig]] wrote the ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' in Hebrew, as opposed to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as a guide to ''[[Halacha]]'' for the "''average'' 17-year-old" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the [[Chofetz Chaim]], Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]]'s purpose in writing the ''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' was to "produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute".  The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, "the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=onNwsw0akyoC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14 |title=Mishnah B'rurah – Israel Meir (ha-Kohen), Aharon Feldman, Aviel Orenstein – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2013|isbn=9780873061988|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}
Hebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a [[pidgin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/This-week-in-history-Revival-of-the-Hebrew-language&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of that century the Jewish activist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], owing to the ideology of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] ({{lang|he|שיבת ציון}}, ''Shivat Tziyon,'' later [[Zionism]]), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the [[Second Aliyah]], it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including [[Judaeo-Spanish]] (also called "Judezmo" and "Ladino"), [[Yiddish]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]], and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the [[Jewish diaspora]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

The major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as [[neologism]]s from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.

In the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously ''Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Hebrew'', ''New Hebrew'', ''Israeli Standard Hebrew'', ''Standard Hebrew'', and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of [[Sephardic Hebrew]] from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.

[[File:Eliezer Ben-Yehuda at his desk in Jerusalem - c1912.jpg|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]]]
The literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, ''[[Me'assefim|HaMe'assef]]'' (The Gatherer), was published by [[maskil]]im in [[Königsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) from 1783 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shalom Spiegel]], ''Hebrew Reborn'' (1930), Meridian Books reprint 1962, New York p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. ''[[Hamagid]]'', founded in [[Ełk]] in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]]; there were also novels written in the language.

The [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a [[first language|mother tongue]] was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in 1881 immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] "[[shtetl]]" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[sacred language|liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Ahad Ha'am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the [[vernacular]]ization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904–1914 [[Second Aliyah]] that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in [[phonology]], was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.

While many saw his work as fanciful or even [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/43mag/ben-yehuda/ben-yehuda.htm Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Resurgence of the Hebrew Language] by Libby Kantorwitz&lt;/ref&gt; (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the [[Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] and a very few [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects, most notably those under the auspices of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.

In the [[Soviet Union]], the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew "reactionary" since it was associated with [[Zionism]], and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to [[secularization|secularize]] education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |title=The Transformation of Jewish Culture in the USSR from 1930 to the Present (in Russian) |publisher=Jewish-heritage.org |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222024723/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The official ordinance stated that Yiddish, being the spoken language of the Russian Jews, should be treated as their only national language, while Hebrew was to be treated as a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Nosonovsky |url=http://berkovich-zametki.com/Nomer16/MN31.htm |title=Nosonovski, Michael (in Russian) |publisher=Berkovich-zametki.com |date=25 August 1997 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew books and periodicals ceased to be published and were seized from the libraries, although liturgical texts were still published until the 1930s. Despite numerous protests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zionistarchives.org.il/ZA/SiteE/pShowView.aspx?GM=Y&amp;ID=48&amp;Teur=Protest%20against%20the%20suppression%20of%20Hebrew%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%201930-1931 Protest against the suppression of Hebrew in the Soviet Union 1930–1931] signed by [[Albert Einstein]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt; a policy of suppression of the teaching of Hebrew operated from the 1930s on. Later in the 1980s in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel ([[refusenik]]s). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. [[Iosif Begun|Yosef Begun]], [[Ephraim Kholmyansky]], [[Yevgeny Korostyshevsky]] and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.

Standard Hebrew, as developed by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], was based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] spelling and [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation. However, the earliest speakers of Modern Hebrew had Yiddish as their native language and often introduced [[calque]]s from Yiddish and [[phono-semantic matching]]s of international words.

The pronunciation of modern Israeli Hebrew is based mostly on the Sephardic Hebrew pronunciation. However, the language has adapted to [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] [[phonology]] in some respects, mainly the following:

* the elimination of [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal articulation]] in the letters ''chet'' (&lt;big&gt;{{Hebrew|[[ח]]}}&lt;/big&gt;) and ''ayin'' ({{nbsp}}&lt;big&gt;{{Hebrew|[[ע]]}}&lt;/big&gt;) by many speakers.
* the conversion of (&lt;big&gt;[[Resh|{{Hebrew|ר}}]]&lt;/big&gt;) {{IPA|/r/}} from an [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} to a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}, by most of the speakers, like in most varieties of standard German or Yiddish. ''see [[Guttural R]]''
* the pronunciation (by many speakers) of ''[[Zeire|tzere]]'' {{Hebrew| ֵ }} as {{IPA|[eɪ]}} in some contexts (''sifréj'' and ''téjša'' instead of Sephardic ''sifré'' and ''tésha'')
* the partial elimination of vocal ''[[Shva]]'' {{Hebrew| ְ }} (''zmán'' instead of Sephardic ''zĕman'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Rosén|title=A Textbook of Israeli Hebrew|year=1966|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago &amp; London|isbn=0-226-72603-7|pages=0.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in popular speech, penultimate stress in proper names (''Dvóra'' instead of ''Dĕvorá''; ''Yehúda'' instead of ''Yĕhudá'') and some other words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shisha Halevy|first=Ariel|title=The Proper Name: Structural Prolegomena to its Syntax – a Case Study in Coptic|year=1989|publisher=VWGÖ|location=Vienna|page=33|url=http://ling.huji.ac.il/Staff/Ariel_Shisha-Halevy/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134619/http://ling.huji.ac.il/Staff/Ariel_Shisha-Halevy/|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- It's not a mistake—the book is about Coptic, but that note is about Hebrew and it's relevant. --&gt;
* similarly in popular speech, penultimate stress in verb forms with a second person plural suffix (''katávtem'' "you wrote" instead of ''kĕtavtém'').{{refn|These pronunciations may have originated in learners' mistakes formed on the analogy of other suffixed forms (''katávta'', ''alénu''), rather than being examples of residual Ashkenazi influence.|group="note"}}

The vocabulary of Israeli Hebrew is much larger than that of earlier periods. According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]]:

{{bq|The number of attested Biblical Hebrew words is 8198, of which some 2000 are hapax legomena (the number of Biblical Hebrew roots, on which many of these words are based, is 2099). The number of attested Rabbinic Hebrew words is less than 20,000, of which (i) 7879 are Rabbinic par excellence, i.e. they did not appear in the Old Testament (the number of new Rabbinic Hebrew roots is 805); (ii) around 6000 are a subset of Biblical Hebrew; and (iii) several thousand are Aramaic words which can have a Hebrew form. Medieval Hebrew added 6421 words to (Modern) Hebrew. The approximate number of new lexical items in Israeli is 17,000 (cf. 14,762 in Even-Shoshan 1970 [...]). With the inclusion of foreign and technical terms [...], the total number of Israeli words, including words of biblical, rabbinic and medieval descent, is more than 60,000.&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]].

In Israel, Modern Hebrew is currently taught in institutions called [[Ulpan]]im (singular: Ulpan). There are government-owned, as well as private, Ulpanim offering online courses and face-to-face programs.

Currently, 90% of Israeli Jews are proficient in Hebrew, and 70% are highly proficient.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4335235,00.html |title=CBS: 27% of Israelis struggle with Hebrew – Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 60% of Israeli Arabs are also proficient in Hebrew,&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; and 30% report having a higher proficiency in Hebrew than in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Behadrey-Haredim"/&gt; In total, about 53% of the Israeli population speaks Hebrew as a native language,&lt;ref&gt;''The Israeli Conflict System: Analytic Approaches''&lt;/ref&gt; while most of the rest speak it fluently. However, in 2013 Hebrew was the native language of only 49% of Israelis over the age of 20, with [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] being the native tongues of most of the rest. Some 26% of [[1990s Post-Soviet aliyah|immigrants from the former Soviet Union]] and 12% of Arabs reported speaking Hebrew poorly or not at all.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/131811 |title=Some Arabs Prefer Hebrew – Education – News |publisher=Israel National News |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the current climate of [[globalization]] and [[Americanization]], steps have been taken to keep Hebrew the primary language of use, and to prevent large-scale incorporation of English words into Hebrew vocabulary. The [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] currently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more English words into Hebrew vocabulary. The [[Haifa]] municipality has banned officials from using English words in official documents, and is fighting to stop businesses from using only English signs to market their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4333113,00.html |title=Keeping Hebrew Israel's living language – Israel Culture, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a [[Knesset]] bill for the preservation of the Hebrew language was proposed, which includes the stipulation that all signage in Israel must first and foremost be in Hebrew, as with all speeches by Israeli officials abroad. The bill's author, MK [[Akram Hasson]], stated that the bill was proposed as a response to Hebrew "losing its prestige", and children incorporating more English words into their vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danan |first=Deborah |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=297627 |title=Druse MK wins prize for helping preserve Hebrew &amp;#124; JPost &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date=28 December 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebrew is also an official national minority language in [[Poland]], since 6 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efnil.org/documents/conference-publications/dublin-2009/16-Dublin-Pisarek-Mother.pdf |title=The relationship between official and minority languages in Poland |last=Pisarek |first=Walery |publisher=European Federation of National Institutions for Language |access-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
{{IPA notice}}
{{further|Biblical Hebrew#Phonology|Modern Hebrew phonology}}

[[Biblical Hebrew]] had a typical Semitic consonant inventory, with pharyngeal /ʕ ħ/, a series of "emphatic" consonants (possibly [[ejective consonant|ejective]], but this is debated), lateral fricative /ɬ/, and in its older stages also uvular /χ ʁ/. /χ ʁ/ merged into /ħ ʕ/ in later Biblical Hebrew, and /b ɡ d k p t/ underwent allophonic spirantization to [v ɣ ð x f θ] (known as [[begadkefat]]). The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a aː i iː u uː/ as well as /oː/, but this system changed dramatically over time.

By the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /ɬ/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /ʃ/ instead. (Elisha Qimron 1986. ''Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', 29). The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a ɛ e i ɔ o u ă ɔ̆ ɛ̆/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.

A number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental ([[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]]) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] tradition has a complex vowel system which does not correspond closely to the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] systems.

Modern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [ɣ ð θ] are not present. Most Israelis today also merge /ʕ ħ/ with /ʔ χ/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [ʁ] or a voiced velar fricative [ɣ] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.

Notes:
# Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*ś}} was still pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɬ}} in Biblical Hebrew, but no letter was available in the Phoenician alphabet, so the letter &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|ש}}&lt;/big&gt; did double duty, representing both {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ɬ/}}. Later on, however, {{IPA|/ɬ/}} merged with {{IPA|/s/}}, but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|ש}}&lt;/big&gt; were distinguished graphically in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] as &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|שׁ}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/ʃ/}} vs. &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|שׂ}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/s/}} &lt; {{IPA|/ɬ/}}.
# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes {{transl|sem|ġ}} {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, {{transl|sem|ḫ}} {{IPA|/χ/}}, {{transl|sem|ḏ}} {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{transl|sem|ṯ}} {{IPA|/θ/}}, based on transcriptions in the [[Septuagint]]. As in the case of {{IPA|/ɬ/}}, no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|ח}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/χ/ /ħ/}}, &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|ע}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/ʁ/ /ʕ/}}, &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|שׁ}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/θ/ /ʃ/}} and &lt;big&gt;{{script|Hebr|ז}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/ð/ /z/}}. In all of these cases, however, the sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.
# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent [[begadkefat]] spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds {{IPA|/b ɡ d k p t/}} were [[lenition|softened]] to the corresponding fricatives {{IPA|[v ɣ ð x f θ]}} (written ''ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ'') when occurring after a vowel and not geminated. This change probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes {{IPA|/θ, ð/}} disappeared in the 7th century&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew {{IPA|/χ, ʁ/}} c. 200&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to the generally accepted view, it is unlikely that begadkefat spirantization occurred before the merger of {{IPA|/χ, ʁ/}} and {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}}, or else {{IPA|[x, χ]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ, ʁ]}} would have to be contrastive, which is cross-linguistically rare. However, Blau argues that it is possible that lenited {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/χ/}} could coexist even if pronounced identically, since one would be recognized as an alternating allophone (as apparently is the case in Nestorian Syriac). See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|article=Begadkefat|date=October 2014}} After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low [[functional load]]), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic.&lt;ref name="bbgd"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Modern Hebrew]], the distinction has a higher functional load due to the loss of gemination, although only the three fricatives {{IPA|/v χ f/}} are still preserved (the fricative {{IPA|/x/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/χ/}} in modern Hebrew). (The others are pronounced like the corresponding stops, apparently under the influence of later non-native speakers whose native European tongues lacked the sounds {{IPA|/ɣ ð θ/}} as phonemes.)

== Hebrew grammar ==
{{Main|Modern Hebrew grammar}}
{{Further|History of Hebrew grammar}}
Hebrew grammar is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of the verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a [[construct state]], called "smikhut", to denote the relationship of "belonging to": this is the converse of the [[genitive case]] of more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.  In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition "shel", meaning "of".  There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and "person"-[[enclitic]]s are widely used to "decline" prepositions.

=== Morphology ===
Like all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of "[[triliteral]]", or 3-consonant [[Triliteral|consonantal roots]] , from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels, and/or adding prefixes, suffixes, or [[infix]]es. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequnt in the modern languge due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themsleves constructed from a 3-consonant verbs. Some trilateral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called "Nechim" (handicapped).

Hebrew uses a number of [[Prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew|one-letter prefixes]] that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or "Letters of Use" ({{lang-he|אותיות השימוש|Otiyot HaShimush|links=no}}). Such items include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''ha-'' ({{IPA|/ha/}}) (="the"); [[preposition]]s ''be-'' ({{IPA|/bə/}}) (="in"), ''le-'' ({{IPA|/lə/}}) (="to"; a shortened version of the preposition ''el''), ''mi-'' ({{IPA|/mi/}}) (="from"; a shortened version of the preposition ''min''); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ''ve-'' ({{IPA|/və/}}) (="and"), ''she-'' ({{IPA|/ʃe/}}) (="that"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction ''asher''), ''ke-'' ({{IPA|/kə/}}) (="as", "like"; a shortened version of the conjunction ''kmo'').

The vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes, hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form, may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word which begins with a moving [[Shva]], then the preposition takes the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial ''be-kfar'' (="in a village") corresponds to the more formal ''bi-khfar''.

The definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like ''mé-ha-kfar'' (="from the village"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of ''mi-''. With ''be'',  ''le'' and ''ke'', the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ''ba'', ''la'' or ''ka''. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (="in the plane"). Note that this does not happen to ''mé'' (the form of "min" or "mi-" used before the letter "he"), therefore ''mé-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means "from the airplane".

:''* indicates that the given example is grammatically [[standard language|non-standard]]''.

=== Syntax ===
Like most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives, and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject, and so on.
* Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence "Dad went to work", in Hebrew, includes a word for ''Dad'' ({{lang|he|אבא}} ''{{transl|he|aba}}''), for ''went'' ({{lang|he|הלך}} ''{{transl|he|halaḵ}}''), and for ''to work'' (to the working place = {{lang|he|לעבודה}} ''{{transl|he|la-ʿavoda}}''). However, unlike in English, those three words can be put in almost any combination ({{lang|he|אבא&amp;nbsp;הלך&amp;nbsp;לעבודה/ לעבודה&amp;nbsp;אבא&amp;nbsp;הלך/ לעבודה&amp;nbsp;הלך&amp;nbsp;אבא/ הלך&amp;nbsp;אבא&amp;nbsp;לעבודה}} and so on).
* In Hebrew, there is no [[Indefinite article]].
* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the [[present tense]] is omitted. For example, the sentence "I am here" ({{lang|he|אני&amp;nbsp;פה}} ''{{transl|he|ani&amp;nbsp;po}}'') has only two words; one for I ({{lang|he|אני}}) and one for here ({{lang|he|פה}}). In the sentence "I am that person" ({{lang|he|אני&amp;nbsp;הוא&amp;nbsp;האדם&amp;nbsp;הזה}} ''{{transl|he|ani&amp;nbsp;hu&amp;nbsp;ha'adam&amp;nbsp;ha'ze}}''), the word for "am" corresponds to the word for "he" ({{lang|he|הוא}}). However, this may also be omitted. Thus, the sentence ({{lang|he|אני&amp;nbsp;האדם&amp;nbsp;הזה}}) is identical in meaning.
*Negative and interrogative Sentences have the same order as the regular declarative one. A question that have a yes/no answer begins with {{lang|he|"האם"}} (''haim'', an interrogative form of 'if'), but it's largely ommited in informal speach.
* Though early [[Biblical Hebrew]] had a verb-subject-object ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/basic-word-order-in-the-biblical-hebrew-verbal-clause-part-6/ |title=Basic Word Order in the Biblical Hebrew Verbal Clause, Part 6 &amp;#124; Ancient Hebrew Grammar |publisher=Ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Hebrew there is a specific preposition ({{lang|he|את}} ''{{transl|he|et}}'') for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase "he ate the cake" would in Hebrew be {{lang|he|הוא&amp;nbsp;אכל&amp;nbsp;את&amp;nbsp;העוגה}} ''{{transl|he|hu&amp;nbsp;akhal&amp;nbsp;et&amp;nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (literally, "He ate {{lang|he|את}} the cake"). The word {{lang|he|את}}, however, can be omitted, making {{lang|he|הוא&amp;nbsp;אכל&amp;nbsp;העוגה}} ''{{transl|he|hu&amp;nbsp;akhal&amp;nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' ("He ate the cake"). Former Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] was convinced that {{lang|he|את}} should never be used as it elongates the sentence without adding meaning. 
* In spoken Hebrew {{lang|he|-את ה}} {{transl|he|et ha-}} is also often contracted to {{lang|he|-ַת'}} {{transl|he|ta-}}, e.g. {{lang|he|ת'אנשים}} {{transl|he|ta-anashim}} instead of {{lang|he|את האנשים}} {{transl|he|et ha-anashim}} (the ' indicate non-standart use). This phenomenon has also been found by researchers in the [[Cave of Letters#Bar-Kokhba letters|Bar Kokhba documents]]: {{lang|he|מעיד אני עלי תשמים… שאני נותן תכבלים ברגליכם}}, writing {{lang|he|תללו}} instead of {{lang|he|את הללו}}, as well as {{lang|he|תדקל}} and so on.

== Writing system ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Character Set]] --&gt;
{{Main|Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew braille}}
[[File:Frank-ruehl.png|thumb|[[Hebrew alphabet]]]]
Modern Hebrew is written from [[Right-to-left|right to left]] using the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is an "impure" [[abjad]], or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancient [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] is similar to those used for [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Modern scripts are based on the "square" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A [[cursive Hebrew]] script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents.  The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as [[Rashi script]].  When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels.  Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation, and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see [[Cantillation]]).

== Liturgical use in Judaism ==
{{Listen|filename=Cantillation_Example_Aliyah_Reform2.ogg|title=Audio example of liturgical Hebrew |description=This is a portion of the blessing that is traditionally [[cantillation|chanted]] before the [[Baal kore|Aliyah La-Torah]] (reading of the Torah). |format=[[Ogg]]}}

Hebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.

[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the [[Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] communities. It was influenced by the Yiddish language.

[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is the traditional pronunciation of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] in the countries of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of [[Yemenite Hebrew]].  This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by the [[Judezmo]] language.

[[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic world. It was possibly influenced by the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic language]]s, and in some cases by [[Sephardi Hebrew]], although some linguists maintain that it is the direct heir of [[Biblical Hebrew]] and thus represents the true dialect of Hebrew.  The same claim is sometimes made for [[Yemenite Hebrew]] or ''Temanit'', which differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and "ghimel".)

These pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study, in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew, though some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.

Many synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the "Sephardic" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between [[Niqqud|tsere]] and [[Niqqud|segol]].

'''Illegal stamps''' are [[postage stamp]]-like [[label]]s issued in the names of existing independent countries or territories used to [[Fraud|defraud]] [[postal administration]]s, [[Stamp collecting|stamp collector]]s, and the general public. Often, but not always, a member nation of the [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU) will have asked the UPU to issue of an "International Bureau Circular" advising others of the illegal stamps. According to the UPU, the market is estimated to be at least $500 million  per year.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Illegal stamps are to be distinguished from the many varieties of [[cinderella stamp]]s which may have some of the same characteristics as illegal stamps but which are not usually issued in the name of an existing country.

==Identifying illegal stamps==
There is no definitive method to identifying illegal stamp issues.
* Many illegal stamps are issued in the names of countries or territories from Africa or the former Soviet Union, or smaller island nations from around the world. Older illegal issues (from the 1970s) were often in the names of Arab states.
* Most illegal stamps are not listed in the major [[stamp catalogue]]s, though some may have been included in error or because their status is unclear or because the criteria for entry differ from those used by the UPU to recognise valid stamp issues.
* The [[WADP Numbering System]] (WNS), developed by the World Association for the Development of Philately and the UPU, catalogues stamps issued by UPU member nations since 2002. Not all UPU members participate.

==Consequences of illegal postage issues==
Illegal stamps are said to result in adverse consequences for several different parties. [[Postal administration]]s lose revenue to illegal issues and stamp collectors may lose money by mistakenly buying illegal stamps that have little or no monetary value. In addition, inexperienced or non-philatelists have been tricked into buying illegal stamps that are worthless memorabilia for their favorite hobby or interests. Additionally, legitimate [[stamp dealer]]s may see their market, and the reputation of their industry, eroded by the illegal issues market. Finally, artists and photographers do not receive royalties from artistic work that is used on illegally printed issues.

[[Image:Kajira-kef.svg|thumb|100px|right|The kajira "kef" symbol (or "staff and fronds") of the Gor books]]
In [[John Norman]]'s ''[[Gor]]'' novels, a '''Kajira''' is a female slave or slave-girl.

==Terminology==
The phrase "''la kajira''"  is said to mean "I am a slave-girl." in the Gorean language, the most widely spoken lingua franca in the known regions of the planet Gor (this is one of the few complete Gorean-language sentences given in the Gor novels). The word is usually seen in the feminine form "kajira" ([[plural|pl.]] "kajirae"), as most slaves in the Gorean lifestyle are female; the masculine forms are "kajirus" and "kajiri" (with endings taken from the nominative forms of [[Latin]] first and second [[Latin declension|declension]] nouns, as also seen in words such as "alumna"/"alumnus" etc.). The construction "kajiras" is incorrect, but is occasionally seen in third-party writing.

[[File:The Gor Project 1 by mjranum stock.jpg|thumb|right|Model dressed as a kajira in a Camisk with a simulated ''kef'' brand]]

==Training==
There exist various techniques in Gorean culture to teach Gorean slaves corresponding conduct. Slave tasks may include not only sexual slavery, but also the ability to maintain a household, possess artistic skills, wear an appealing outfit and address the master in a certain manner.

==Marking==
To mark a slave as a particular owner's property, a collar with the owner's name is placed upon the slave (male and female slaves are collared).

Gorean slave women are branded, which means they are marked with certain signs burned into the flesh on being enslaved. "The kef is about an inch and a half in height, and a half inch in width. A rather simple, delicate, graceful, almost floral mark, in cursive script. Appearing slender, more vertical, more like a stem with floral, cursive curled loops. A rather severe, straight line staff, with two, upturned, frondlike curls, adjacent to it, joined where they touch the staff on its right. It bears a distant, remote resemblance to the printed letter K."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoreancave.com/research/brand.php |title=Brands |publisher=TheGoreanCave |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of kajirae==

Kajirae have a plethora of types&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goreanpalaces.com/blog/types-of-gorean-slaves/#more-1075 Types of Gorean Slaves]&lt;/ref&gt; of varying prestige depending on their virginity, origins, and fields of employment including the following:

===Virginity===

*Red Silk Girl: A kajira who is not a virgin.
*White Silk Girl: A kajira 'not yet opened to men' (i.e. a virgin), a case which is depicted very rarely in the novels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gor.net/soa/training/slvslk.htm A Girl Speaks of Slave Silks]&lt;/ref&gt; for a virgin kajira will usually be deflowered shortly after her enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoreancave.com/silks/silks.php?offset=-120 The Gorean Cave - Slave Silk, Its Color and Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===

*Gorean-born
**Passion Slave: A kajira who has been bred through selective breeding for particularly desired physical or psychological traits, as opposed to other Gorean-born kajirae who may be either captured or bred. 
*Barbarian: A kajira who was brought from the Earth by Journey of Acquisition. Since they have no Home Stone, barbarian girls are considered natural slaves, occupying the lowest rank, yet considered the most sexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gor-now.net/delphius2002/id22.htm Kajirae Basics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===

*Pleasure Slave: A kajira whose main function is providing sexual services. However, her training includes broader skills such as dancing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gor.net/things/terms.html Glossary of Gorean Words]&lt;/ref&gt;
**Prostitutes: Kajirae employed in prostitution by their masters.
***Coin Girl: A kajira used by her master as a streetwalker. 
***Camp Slave: A kajira rented out for satisfying sexual needs during military campaigns. 
***Bath Girl: A kajira who works as a prostitute and masseuse in a bathhouse. 
***Feast Slave: A kajira rented out at feasts as a pleasure slave.
*Paga Slave or Paga Slut: A kajira who serves the alcoholic drink ''paga'' at a tavern. Their service usually includes sexual tasks.
*Flute Girl: A kajira versed in playing the flute. They are employed at feasts and may also serve sexual tasks.
*Kettle Girl / Kettle-and-Mat Girl: A kajira employed exclusively for domestic works is referred to as a kettle girl or pot girl. If the kajira's function is divided between household task and sexual service, she is known with the comparatively more prestigious moniker kettle-and-mat girl.     
**Tower Slave: A kajira owned as a maid in a private household.
**State Slave: A kajira owned by a particular polity and used for domestic needs of citizens.
*Message Girl: A kajira who delivers secret messages.

==Kajirus==

Kajiri, male slaves, also exist on the planet Gor, but they are far fewer than kajirae, since Gorean men can only rarely be effectively "tamed", so that most male slaves are considered inherently slightly dangerous, and have little value other than as unskilled heavy labor which must often be kept under continual armed guard. The phrase "lo kajirus" is said to mean "I am a slave-boy." Men conquered in war who are not left free are more often than not killed than enslaved, while women in the same situation are almost always enslaved (since kajirae are a readily-negotiable commodity, among other reasons).

A male slave kept by a woman owner for bedroom duties is a "silk slave" (while most male slaves on Gor are used for hard labor in work gangs). When a free woman makes use of a kajirus sexually, he is often chained so that he is unable to hold her in his arms — since allowing this would be considered to add a note of male domination to the lovemaking. Some free women carefully avoid kissing a kajirus when making sexual use of him, since they would consider it degrading to soil their lips by touching them to the body of a mere slave. Note that only a small minority of rich free women on Gor own silk slaves and (in contrast to the usual situation with free men and kajirae) it is often not very easy or convenient for a free woman to obtain the sexual use of a kajirus whom she does not personally own (in the city of Ar, the largest city of known Gor, it is strictly forbidden by law). Silk slaves are generally despised by free men on Gor and their type of slavery is often considered to be rather unnatural.
Kajiri do not usually wear locked collars; rather, a band of iron.[http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php/Gor_-_Dictionary#K]

The '''Khitan scripts''' were the writing systems for the now-extinct [[Mongolic languages#Para-Mongolic|Para-Mongolic]] [[Khitan language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian.|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027238252|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the 10th-12th century by the [[Khitan people]] who had established the [[Liao dynasty]] in [[Northeast China]]. There were two scripts, the [[Khitan large script|large script]] and the [[Khitan small script|small script]]. These were functionally independent and appear to have been used simultaneously. The Khitan scripts continued to be in use to some extent by the [[Jurchen people]] for several decades after the fall of the Liao dynasty until the Jurchens fully switched to a [[Jurchen script|script of their own]].  Examples of the scripts appeared most often on [[epitaph]]s and [[monument]]s, although other fragments sometimes surface.

Many scholars recognize that the Khitan scripts have not been fully [[Decipherment|deciphered]] and that more research and discoveries would be necessary for a proficient understanding of them.&lt;ref name=daniels&gt;{{Citation|last=Daniels|first=Peter T.|last2=Bright|first2=William|publication-date =1996|title =The World’s Writing Systems|publication-place=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages =230–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kara&gt;{{Citation|last=Kara|first= György|publication-date=1987|title= On the Khitan Writing Systems|periodical=Mongolian Studies|series=10|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khitan scripts are part of the [[Chinese family of scripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp028_chinese_scripts.html|title=The Family of Chinese Character-Type Scripts (Twenty Members and Four Stages of Development)|surname=Zhou|given=Youguang|author-link=Zhou Youguang|editor-given=Victor H.|editor-surname=Mair|editor-link=Victor H.

Knowledge of the Khitan language, which was written by the Khitan script, is quite limited as well. Although there are several clues to its origins, which might point in different directions, the Khitan language shares an ancestor with the Mongolian languages but is not one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027238252|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Large script==
{{Main| Khitan large script}}
[[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Abaoji]] of the [[Yelü clan]], founder of the Khitan, or Liao Dynasty, introduced the original Khitan script in 920 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=script%20khitan%20close%20%20%20write&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=353|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Large script”, or “big characters" (大字), as it was referred to in some Chinese sources, was established to keep the record of the new Khitan state. The Khitan script was based on the idea of the Chinese script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=khitan%20inspired&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=34|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mote2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick W.

[[File:Yanningmuzhi.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Memorial for Yelü Yanning in Khitan large script. Dated 986.]]
The Khitan large script was considered to be relatively simple.  The large script characters were written equally spaced, in vertical columns, in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|the same way]] as the Chinese has been traditionally written.  Although large script mostly uses [[logogram]]s, it is possible that [[ideogram]]s and [[Syllabary|syllabograms]] are used for [[Grammar|grammatical]] functions.  The large script has a few similarities to [[Chinese character|Chinese]], with several words taken directly with or without modifications from the Chinese (e.g. characters 二,三,十,廿,月,日, which appear in dates in the apparently bilingual ''Xiao Xiaozhong muzhi''  inscription from Xigushan, [[Huludao|Jinxi]], [[Liaoning Province]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Most large script characters, however, cannot be directly related to any Chinese characters. The meaning of most of them remains unknown, but that of a few of them (numbers, symbols for some of the  [[Wu Xing|five elements]] and the [[Earthly Branches|twelve animals]] that the Khitans apparently used to designate years of the [[sexagenary cycle]]) has been established by analyzing dates in Khitan inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has long been controversy as to whether a particular monument belong to the large or small script,&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;
there are several monuments (steles or fragments of stelae) that the specialists at least tentatively identify as written in the Khitan large script. However, one of the first inscriptions so identified (the ''Gu taishi mingshi ji'' epitaph, found in 1935) has been since lost, and the preserved [[Gravestone rubbing|rubbings]] of it are not very legible; moreover, some believe that this inscription was a forgery in the first place. In any event, the total of about 830 different large-script characters are thought to have been identified, even without the problematic ''Gu taishi mingshi ji''; including it, the character count rises to about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 6, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Memorial for Yelü Yanning]] (dated 986 CE) is one of the earliest inscriptions in Khitan large script.

==Small script==
{{Main| Khitan small script }}
The Khitan small script was invented in about 924 or 925 CE by a scholar named [[Yelü Diela]].  He drew his inspiration from “the [[Uyghur language]] and script,”&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt; which he was shown by a visiting Uyghur ambassador at the Khitan court.  For this reason, Khitan small script was originally thought to be a daughter script of the [[Uyghur alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=based%20on%20uighur%20script&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=354|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a smaller number of symbols than large script, small script was less complex, yet still “able to record any word.”&lt;ref name=kara/&gt; While small-script inscriptions employed some logograms as well, most words in small script were made using a blocked system reminiscent of the later [[Hangul]] writing of [[Korea]], meaning that a word is represented by one group (square block) composed of several [[glyph]]s with individual phonetic meanings (somewhat similar to the ''[[Hangul#Jamo|jamo]]'' units of Hangul). Unlike Hangul's ''jamo'', a Khitan phonetic symbol could represent not just a single vowel or consonant, but a CV or VC pair as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Each block could incorporate two to seven such "phonetic element" characters, written in pairs within the block, with the first half of the pair on the left.  If there were an odd number of characters in a block, the unpaired character would be centered below the preceding pair.

Although there is some speculation, it appears there are no characters that both scripts share.  Periodically, epitaphs written using small script will be written using the large script method of [[linear]]ity{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. &lt;!-- what was that supposed to mean? --&gt; Although small script had some similarities to Chinese, Khitan characters were often used to record Chinese words.  The appearance of a likeness between a small script and a Chinese character does not aide in the reading of Khitan.  For example, the  Chinese character for ‘mountain’(山) is the same as the Khitan small script logogram for ‘gold’(and, thus, the name of the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]]).&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 378 known small script characters, 125 are [[Semantics|semantic]], 115 are [[Phonetics|phonetic]], and the remainder have not been deciphered.&lt;ref name=kara/&gt;  (Usually, it was possible to guess the phonetic value of an element if it has been used to transcribe a Chinese loanword in a Khitan inscription; otherwise, such phonetic values are hard to determine, as very little of the Khitan language is known.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;)
Small script uses a mixture of logograms, syllabograms, and, as some as sources claim, a few single sound [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]].  Sometimes [[suffix]]es were written with syllabograms, just as single syllables sometimes were written with three syllabograms (with one each for the initial, medial, and final sounds of the syllable).  Sometimes the initial [[consonants]] of syllables are indicated to be [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[guttural]], or [[Nasal stop|nasal]] etc., based on the syllabograms involved.  Additionally, [[vowels]] are sometimes indicated to be labial or non-labial, or [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] in the front or back of the mouth.

Much of this information came from the "Khitan Script Research Group", led by the [[Inner Mongolia|Mongolian]] scholar named [[Chinggeltei|Činggeltei]], &lt;!-- (清格尔泰, born 06.1924) --&gt; who used monuments, [[Chinese calendar|calendar]], and similar Chinese texts to decipher sections of small script.&lt;ref&gt;According to Kane (1989) (p. 13), the most complete publication on the Khitan small script as of that time was the book by Činggeltei et al. (1985). It contained the complete corpus of inscriptions in that script known to date, summary of research done on the subject in China and elsewhere, and a complete bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly valuable object of their study was the inscription on the ''Da Jin huangdi dotong jinglüe langjun xingji'' (大金皇帝都统经略郎君行记) stele, which is the only known bilingual Chinese-Khitan inscription. Produced during the Jurchen [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]], it was originally (before the discovery of other Khitan inscriptions in 1922) thought to be in [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]].&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 4-5, 13-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurchen==
{{main|Jurchen script}}
Some of the characters of the [[Jurchen script]]s have similarities to Khitan large script.  According to some sources, the discoveries of inscriptions on monuments and epitaphs give clues to the connection between Khitan and Jurchen.&lt;ref name=kiyose&gt;{{Citation|last=Kiyose|first=Gisaburo N.|publication-date =1985|title= The Significance of the New Kitan and Jurchen Materials|periodical=Papers in East Asian Languages|pages=75–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the fall of the Liao Dynasty, the Khitan (small-character) script continued to be used by the Jurchen people for a few decades, until fully replaced with Jurchen script and, in 1191,  suppressed by [[Emperor Zhangzong of Jin|imperial]] order.&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=khitan%20script%20big%20characters&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=359|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of Khitan inscriptions}}

[[File:Small Khitan Fish Tally.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bronze 'fish tally' with small Khitan inscription owned by [[Stephen Wootton Bushell]]]]
There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy written by Tao Zongyi (陶宗儀) during the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are about 17 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan large script, ranging in date from 986 to 1176, and about 33 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan small script, ranging in date from 1053 to 1171.  The two scripts are mutually exclusive (never occurring together on the same monument), but it is not known why the Khitan people used two different scripts, or what determined the choice of which script to use.

In addition to monumental inscriptions, short inscriptions in both Khitan scripts have also been found on tomb murals and rock paintings, and on various portable artefacts such as mirrors, amulets, [[paiza]] (tablets of authority given to officials and envoys), and special non-circulation coins.  A number of bronze official [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] with the seal face inscribed in a convoluted [[seal script]] style of Khitan characters are also known.

The '''Mandinka language''' (''Mandi'nka kango''), or '''Mandingo''', is a [[Mandé language]] spoken by the [[Mandinka people]] of the [[Casamance]] region of Senegal, [[The Gambia]], and northern [[Guinea-Bissau]]. It is one of principal languages of the Gambia and one of the native language in Guinea.

Mandinka belongs to the [[Manding languages|Manding]] branch of Mandé, and is thus similar to [[Bambara language|Bambara]] and [[Maninka language|Maninka/Malinké]].  
In a majority of areas, it is a [[tonal language]] with two tones: low and high, although the particular variety spoken in the Gambia and Senegal borders on a [[pitch accent]] due to its proximity with non-tonal neighboring languages like [[Wolof language|Wolof]].

==Phonology==

Mandinka is here represented by the variety spoken in Casamance.&lt;ref&gt;Maŋ Lafi Dramé (c. 2003) ''Parlons Mandinka''&lt;/ref&gt; There is little dialectical diversity.

===Tone===
Mandinka has two tones, high and low. Unmodified nouns are either high tone on all syllables or low tone on all syllables. The definite suffix ''-o'' takes a low tone on high-tone nouns and a falling tone on low-tone nouns. It also assimilates any preceding short vowel, resulting in a long /oo/ with either low or falling tone. It shortens a preceding long high vowel (''ii'' &gt; ''io'', ''uu'' &gt; ''uo''; ''ee'' optionally &gt; either ''eo'' or ''ee'') or assimilates itself (''aa'' remains ''aa'') leaving only its tone:
:/búŋ/ 'a room' &gt; /búŋò/ 'the room'
:/tèŋ/ 'a palm tree' &gt; /tèŋô/ 'the palm tree'
:/kídí/ 'a gun' &gt; /kídòò/ 'the gun'
:/kòrdàà/ 'a house' &gt; /kòrdáà/ 'the house'

In Senegal and Gambia, Mandinka is approaching a system of [[pitch accent]] under the influence of local non-tonal languages such as Wolof. The tonal system is more robust in Guinea-Bisau.

===Vowels===
Vowel qualities are {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}. All may be long or short. There are no [[Nasal vowel|nasal vowels]]; instead, there is a coda consonant /ŋ/.

===Consonants===

The following table gives the consonants in the Latin orthography, and their IPA equivalent when they differ.
{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
! colspan=2| 
! [[Labial consonant|Labial]]

|}
⟨c⟩ and ⟨j⟩ are pronounced approximately /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/. /g/ and /p/ are found in French loans. /r/ is only found initially in loans and onomatopoeia. Otherwise it is the intervocalic allophone of /d/.

Syllabic nasals occur in e.g. ''nnààm'' 'yes!' (response), ''ŋte'' "I, me". Word-initial ''mb, nd, ndy, ng'' occur but are not particularly common; it is not clear whether they should be considered syllabic nasals or additional consonants.

Consonants may be geminated in the middles of words (at least /pp, cc, jj, kk, ll, mm, nn, ññ/). The only other consonant found at the ends of syllables in native words is {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. It assimilates to a following consonant: /ns, nc, mb/ etc. Syllable-final /r/ and /s/ are found in French loans (e.g. /kùrtù/ "pants").

==Orthography==
[[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Arabic script]]-based alphabets are widely used for Mandinka; the former is official, but the latter is more widely used and older. In addition, the pan-[[Manding languages|Manding]] writing system, the [[N'Ko script]], invented in 1949, is often used in north east Guinea, and bordering communities in Ivory Coast and Mali.

In the Latin script, c represents {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}, ŋ {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, and ñ {{IPA|/ɲ/}}; the letters v, x, z, and q are not used. Vowels are as in Spanish or Italian, and are doubled to indicate length or distinguish words that are otherwise homophones.

The Arabic script uses no extra letters (apart from, rarely, an extra vowel mark for ''e''), but some of the letters are pronounced differently from in Arabic.

The Latin and Arabic consonants correspond as follows:

{|class="wikitable"

|ج

|ح
|خ

|''s''
|''s''
|''s''
|f
|l
|m
|n, ñ, ŋ
|w
|y
|k, g
|la
|}

Letters in italics are not normally used in native Mandinka words.  ه (h) may also be used to indicate a final [[glottal stop]], which is not noted in the Latin script.  The letter ŋ of the Latin script is often indicated with vowel signs in the Arabic script; see below.

The vowels correspond as follows (diacritics are placed over or under the consonant in Arabic):

{|class="wikitable"
!Arabic
|ـَ
|ـِ
|ـُ
|ـْ
|ـִ
|ـً
|ـٍ
|ـٌ

|-

| tambi baa duuma;
| sira tilindiŋo fula;
| sira tilindiŋo duuma fula;
| ŋoo biriŋo fula.
| 
| 
| 
|}

In addition, a small Arabic 2 (۲) may be used to indicate [[reduplication]], and the ''hamza'' may be used as in Arabic to indicate glottal stops more precisely.

In [[linguistics]] and social sciences, '''markedness''' is the state of standing out as unusual or divergent in comparison to a more common or regular form. In a marked–unmarked relation, one term of an opposition is the broader, dominant one. The dominant default or minimum-effort form is known as ''unmarked''; the other, secondary one is ''marked''. In other words, markedness involves the characterization of a "normal" linguistic unit against one or more of its possible "irregular" forms.

In linguistics, markedness can apply to, among others, [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Semantics|semantic]] oppositions, defining them in terms of marked and unmarked oppositions, such as ''honest'' (unmarked) vs. ''dishonest'' (marked). Marking may be purely semantic, or may be realized as extra morphology. The term derives from the marking of a grammatical role with a suffix or another element, and has been extended to situations where there is no morphological distinction.

In [[social science]]s more broadly, markedness is, among other things, used to distinguish two meanings of the same term, where one is common usage (unmarked sense) and the other is specialized to a certain cultural context (marked sense).

In [[statistics]] and [[psychology]], the social science concept of '''markedness''' is quantified as a measure of how much one variable is marked as a predictor or possible cause of another, and is also known as Δp (deltaP) in simple two-choice cases.  See [[confusion matrix]] for more details.

== Marked and unmarked word pairs ==
In terms of lexical opposites, a marked form is a non-basic one, often one with [[inflection]]al or [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]al endings. Thus, a morphologically negative word form is marked as opposed to a positive one: happy/unhappy, honest/dishonest, fair/unfair, clean/unclean and so forth. Similarly, unaffixed masculine or singular forms are taken to be unmarked in contrast to affixed feminine or plural forms: lion/lioness, host/hostess, automobile/automobiles, child/children. An unmarked form is also a default form. For example, the unmarked lion can refer to a male or female, while lioness is marked because it can refer only to females. 

The default nature allows unmarked lexical forms to be identified even when the opposites are not morphologically related. In the pairs old/young, big/little, happy/sad, clean/dirty, the first term of each pair is taken as unmarked because it occurs generally in questions. For example, English speakers typically ask how (old, big, happy, or clean) something or someone is; use of the marked term (''how &lt;u&gt;young&lt;/u&gt; are you?'') would presuppose youth, smallness, unhappiness, or dirtiness, respectively.

== Background in the Prague School ==
While the idea of linguistic asymmetry predated the actual coining of the terms marked and unmarked, the modern concept of markedness originated in the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague School]] [[structuralism]] of [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] as a means of characterizing binary oppositions.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen,  Henning "Markedness—The First 150 Years". In ''Markedness in Synchrony and Diachrony''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; 
Both sound and meaning were analyzed into systems of binary distinctive features. [[Edwin Battistella]] said "Binarism suggests symmetry and equivalence in [[linguistic analysis]]; markedness adds the idea of hierarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Battistella, Edwin ''Markedness: The Evaluative Superstructure of Language''. SUNY Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Trubetzkoy and Jakobson analyzed phonological oppositions such as nasal versus non-nasal as defined as the presence versus the absence of nasality; the presence of the feature, [[nasalization|nasality]], was marked; its absence, non-nasality, was unmarked.  For Jakobson and Trubetzkoy, binary phonological features formed part of a universal feature alphabet applicable to all languages. In his 1932 article "Structure of the Russian Verb", Jakobson extended the concept to grammatical meanings in which the marked element "announces the existence of [some meaning] A" while the unmarked element "does not announce the existence of A, i.e., does not state whether A is present or not'.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. (1932) "The Structure of the Russian Verb", reprinted in ''Russian and Slavic Grammar Studies, 1931–1981''. Mouton, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later, Jakobson described language by saying that "every single constituent of a linguistic system is built on an opposition of two logical contradictories: the presence of an attribute ('markedness') in contraposition to its absence ('unmarkedness')."&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. "Verbal Communication". ''Scientific American''; 227: 72–80, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 1941 ''Child Language, Aphasia, and Universals of Language'', Jakobson suggested that phonological markedness played a role in [[language acquisition]] and [[Language loss|loss]]. Drawing on existing studies of acquisition and [[aphasia]], Jakobson suggested a mirror-image relationship determined by a universal feature hierarchy of marked and unmarked oppositions. Today many still see Jakobson's theory of phonological acquisition as identifying useful tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Battistella, Edwin ''The Logic of Markedness''. New York: Oxford Uniuversity Press, 1996,&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jakobsonian tradition ==
The work of Cornelius van Schooneveld, [[Edna Andrews]], Rodney Sangster, Yishai Tobin and others on 'semantic invariance' (different general meanings reflected in the contextual specific meanings of features) has further developed the [[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] of grammatical items in terms of marked and unmarked features. Other semiotically-oriented work has investigated the isomorphism of form and meaning with less emphasis on invariance, including the efforts of Henning Andersen, Michael Shapiro, and Edwin Battistella. Shapiro and Andrews have especially made connections between the semiotic of [[C. S. Peirce]] and markedness, treating it "as species of interpretant" in Peirce's sign-object-interpretant triad.

Functional linguists such as [[Thomas Givon|Talmy Givón]] have suggested that markedness is related to
cognitive complexity—"in terms of attention, mental effort or processing time".&lt;ref&gt;Givón, T. ''Syntax: A Functional-Typological Introduction'', vol. 2, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic 'naturalists' view markedness relations in terms of the ways in which extralinguistic principles of perceptibility and psychological efficiency determine what is natural in language. Willi Mayerthaler, another linguist, for example, defines unmarked categories as those "in agreement with the typical attributes of the speaker".&lt;ref&gt;Mayerthaler Willi ''Morphological Naturalness''. Ann Arbor: Karoma, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural markedness and informedness ==
Since a main component of markedness is the information content and information value of an element,&lt;ref&gt;Battistella, Markedness, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; some studies have taken markedness as an encoding of that which is unusual or informative, and this is reflected in formal probabilistic definitions of Markedness and [[Informedness]] as chance-correct unidirectional components of the [[Matthews Correlation Coefficient]] corresponding to Δp and Δp'.&lt;ref name="Powers2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David M. W. |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Score to ROC, Informedness, Markedness &amp; Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37–63 |url=http://bioinfopublication.org/downpdf.php?artid=BIA0001114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual familiarity with cultural norms provided by familiar categories creates a ground against which marked categories provide a figure, opening the way for markedness to be applied to cultural and social categorization. 

As early as the 1930s Jakobson had already suggested applying markedness to all oppositions, explicitly mentioning such pairs as life/death, liberty/bondage, sin/virtue, and holiday/working day. Linda Waugh extended this to oppositions like male/female, white/black, sighted/blind, hearing/deaf, heterosexual/homosexual, right/left, fertility/barrenness, clothed/nude, and spoken language/written language.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, Linda "Marked and Unmarked: A Choice Between Unequals in
Semiotic Structure". ''Semiotica''; 38: 299–318, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Battistella expanded this with the demonstration of how cultures align markedness values to create cohesive symbol systems, illustrating with examples based on [[Rodney Needham]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;Battistella, Edwin ''Markedness'', 1990, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Other work has applied markedness to stylistics, music, and myth.&lt;ref&gt;Myers-Scotton, Carol (ed.) ''Codes and Consequences: Choosing Linguistic Varieties''. Oxford, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatten, Robert ''Musical Meaning in Beethoven: Markedness,
Correlation, and Interpretation''. Indiana University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liszka, James J. ''The Semiotic of Myth''. Indiana University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local markedness and markedness reversals ==
Markedness depends on [[context (language use)|context]]. What is more marked in some general contexts may be less marked in other local contexts. Thus, "ant" is less marked than "ants" on the morphological level, but on the semantic (and frequency) levels it may be more marked since ants are more often encountered many at once than one at a time.  Often a more general markedness relation may be reversed in a particular context. Thus, voicelessness of [[consonant]]s is typically unmarked. But between [[vowel]]s or in the neighborhood of voiced consonants, voicing may be the expected or unmarked value. 

Reversal is reflected in certain [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] words' plural and singular forms:&lt;ref&gt;Tiersma, Peter. "Local and General Markedness", ''Language'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In West Frisian, nouns with irregular singular-plural stem variations are undergoing regularization.{{cn|date=April 2015}} Usually this means that the plural is reformed to be a regular form of the singular:

* '''Old paradigm''': "koal" (coal), "kwallen" (coals) → '''regularized forms''': "Koal" (coal), "Koalen" (coals).

However, a number of words instead reform the singular by extending the form of the plural:

* '''Old paradigm''': "earm" (arm), "jermen" (arms) → '''regularized forms''': "jerm" (arm), "jermen" (arms)

The common feature of the nouns that regularize the singular to match the plural is that they occur more often in pairs or groups than singly; they are said to be semantically (but not morphologically) locally unmarked in the plural.

== Universals and frequency ==
[[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1966 book ''Language Universals'' was an influential application of markedness to typological linguistics and a break from the tradition of Jakobson and Trubetzkoy. Greenberg took frequency to be the primary determining factor of markedness in grammar and suggested that unmarked categories could be determined by "the frequency of association of things in the real world".

Greenberg also applied frequency cross-linguistically, suggesting that unmarked categories would be those that are unmarked in a wide number of languages. However, critics have argued that frequency is problematic because categories that are cross-linguistically infrequent may have a high distribution in a particular language.&lt;ref&gt;Battistella, Edwin ''The Logic of Markedness'', 1996, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the insights related to frequency have been formalized as chance-corrected conditional probabilities, with [[Informedness]] (Δp') and Markedness (Δp) corresponding to the different directions of prediction in human association research (binary associations or distinctions)&lt;ref name="Perruchet2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P. |last1=Perruchet |first2=R. |last2=Peereman |year=2004 |title=The exploitation of distributional information in syllable processing |journal=J. Neurolinguistics |volume=17 |pages=97–119 |doi=10.1016/s0911-6044(03)00059-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally (including features with more than two distinctions).&lt;ref name=Powers2011/&gt;

[[Language universals|Universals]] have also been connected to [[Implicational universal|implicational laws]]. This entails that a category is taken as marked if every language that has the marked category also has the unmarked one but not vice versa.

== Diagnostics ==
Markedness has been extended and reshaped over the past century and reflects a range of loosely connected theoretical approaches. From emerging in the analysis of binary oppositions, it has become a global semiotic principle, a means of encoding naturalness and language universals, and a terminology for studying defaults and preferences in language acquisition. What connects various approaches is a concern for the evaluation of linguistic structure, though the details of how markedness is determined and what its implications and diagnostics are varies widely. Other approaches to universal markedness relations focus on functional economic and iconic motivations, tying recurring symmetries to properties of communication channels and communication events. Croft (1990), for example, notes that asymmetries among linguistic elements may be explainable in terms economy of form, in terms of iconism between the structure of language and conceptualization of the world.

== In generative grammar ==
Markedness entered generative linguistic theory through [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and Halle's ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]''. For Chomsky and Halle, phonological features went beyond a universal phonetic vocabulary to encompass an 'evaluation metric', a means of selecting the most highly-valued adequate grammar. In ''The Sound Pattern of English'', the value of a grammar was the inverse of the number of features required in that grammar. However, Chomsky and Halle realized that their initial approach to phonological features made implausible rules and segment inventories as highly valued as natural ones.  The unmarked value of a feature was cost-free with respect to the evaluation metric, while the marked feature values were counted by the metric. Segment inventories could also be evaluated according to the number of marked features. However, the use of phonological markedness as part of the evaluation metric was never able to fully account for the fact that some features are more likely than others or for the fact that phonological systems must have a certain minimal complexity and symmetry&lt;ref&gt;Kean, Mary-Louise, ''The Theory of Markedness in Generative Grammar''. Bloomington: Indiana University Linguistics Club, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[generative syntax]], markedness as feature-evaluation did not receive the same attention that it did in phonology. Chomsky came to view unmarked properties as an innate preference structure based first in constraints and later in parameters of [[universal grammar]].  In their 1977 article 'Filters and Control', Chomsky and [[Howard Lasnik]] extended this to view markedness as part of a theory of 'core grammar':

:We will assume that [Universal Grammar] in not an 'undifferentiated' system, but rather incorporates something analogous to a 'theory of markedness' Specifically, there is a theory of core grammar with highly restricted options, limited expressive power, and a few parameters. Systems that fall within core grammar constitute 'the unmarked case'; we may think of them as optimal in terms of the evaluation metric. An actual language is determined by fixing the parameters of core grammar and then adding rules or conditions, using much richer resources, ... These added properties of grammars we may think of as the syntactic analogue of irregular verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam &amp; Lasnik, Howard "Filters and Control". ''Linguistic Inquiry''; 8.3: 425–504 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later Chomsky describes it thus:  

:The distinction between core and periphery leaves us with three notions of markedness: core versus periphery, internal to the core, and internal to the periphery. The second has to do with the way parameters are set in the absence of evidence. As for the third, there are, no doubt, significant regularities even in departures from the core principles (for example, in irregular verb morphology in English), and it may be that peripheral constructions are related to the core in systematic ways, say by relaxing certain conditions of core grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. ''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use''. Praeger,1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Some generative researchers have applied markedness to [[second-language acquisition]] theory, treating it as an inherent learning hierarchy which reflects the sequence in which constructions are acquired, the difficulty of acquiring certain constructions, and the transferability of rules across languages.&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, F. R. (1991). "The Structural Conformity Hypothesis and the Acquisition of Consonantal Clusters in the Interlanguage of Learners". ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition, 13'' (1), 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Optimality theory]] approaches emerging in the 1990s have incorporated markedness in the ranking of constraints.&lt;ref&gt;''see'' Archangeli 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23166">'''[[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]]''' is a [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian language]] that is mainly spoken in the Western [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] regions [[Samegrelo]] and [[Abkhazia]]. In [[Abkhazia]] the number of Mingrelian speakers declined dramatically in the 1990s as a result of heavy [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing of ethnic Georgians]], the overwhelming majority of which were [[Mingrelians]].

Mingrelian has two dialects: Zugdidi-Samurzaqano (northwestern) and Senaki-Martvili (southeastern). The dialects are extremely close to each other.

==Grammatical cases==

Mingrelian has nine [[grammatical case]]s: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[Lative case|lative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[adverbial case|adverbial]] and [[benefactive case|benefactive]]. For pluralization the suffix ''-ep'' is used, which is inserted between stem and case marker.

==Nouns==

Mingrelian shares a noun classification scheme with other Kartvelian languages and classifies objects as:

* 'Intelligent' entities (question ''mi?'' "who?")
* 'Non-intelligent' entities (question ''mu?'' "what?)

==Numerals==

The Mingrelian numerals are almost identical to Laz with minor phonetic differences. The number system is [[Vigesimal]] like Georgian.

===Cardinal numbers===

The most of Mingrelian cardinal numbers are inherited from [[Proto-Kartvelian language]], except ''arti'' (one) and ''eči'' (twenty), which are considered as a Karto-Zan heritage, since there are no regular equivalents in [[Svan language|Svan]].

===Ordinal numbers===

In Mingrelian the circumfix ''ma-...-a'' produces ordinal numbers, which is a [[Proto-Kartvelian language|Common-Kartvelian]] heritage, since it has regular phonetical equivalents in [[Svan language|Svan]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (''me-...-e'' in both)

==Verbs==
The Mingrelian verb has the categories of person, number, version, tense, mood, aspect, voice, and verbal focus.

===Personality and Number===

In Mingrelian the verbs can be monovalent, bivalent or trivalent. This feature is also shared with other [[Kartvelian languages]].

*Monovalent verbs are represented only by subjective person and are always intransitive.
*Bivalent verbs together with subject have also one object (''direct'' or ''indirect''). They are:
**transitive in the case of ''direct'' object
**intransitive if the object is ''indirect''
*Trivalent verbs have one subject and always both, ''direct'' and ''indirect'' objects and are ditransitive.

====Table of verb personality====

|}

The person may be singular or plural.

Subject and object markers in Mingrelian are roughly the same as in Laz.

====Subject markers====

! '''Plural'''
|-
! '''S1'''

|-

|-
! '''O2'''
| g-
| g-...-an/-es/-t
|-
! '''O3'''
| ∅-
| ∅-...-an/-es
|}

In pre-consonant position the markers ''v-'' and ''g-'' may change phonetically:
*''v- → b-'' (in Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect)
*''g- → r-'' (in both dialects)

===Version===

In Mingrelian there are four types of version marking like in other Kartvelian languages:
*subjective - shows that the action is intended for oneself,
*objective - action is intended for another person,
*objective-passive - the action is intended for another person and at the same time indicating the passiveness of subject,
*neutral - neutral with respect to intention.

===Mood===

'''Indicative'''

Indicative statement claims that the proposition should be taken as an apparent fact.

'''Interrogative'''

There are two ways to express interrogative mood:
*with interrogative words, e.g. ''mi?'' (who?), ''mu?'' (what?), ''so?'' (where?), ''mužams?'' (when?), ''muč'o?'' (how?) etc. This rule is shared with other [[Kartvelian languages]].
*by attaching an interrogative particle ''-o'' to the end of a verb. Cf. the interrogative particles in [[Laz language|Laz]] ''-i'', [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]] ''-a'' and [[Svan language|Svan]] ''-ma/-mo/-mu''.

'''Imperative'''

Indicates a command or request. The aorist form is used when addressing 2nd person (singular/plural) and aorist optative in all other cases.

'''Subjunctive'''

Expresses possibility, wish, desire. The subjunctive mood in Mingrelian is provided by optative screeves.

'''Conditional'''

Indicates condition in contrary to a fact. It is produced by adding a verbal suffix ''-ḳo(ni)'' to the end of a verb.

===Aspect===
In Mingrelian the verbs may have two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]] depending on the completeness of action (''perfective [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]'') or the lack of it (''imperfective [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]''). The ''perfective [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]'' is derived by adding a preverb to the verb.

In 2nd, 3rd, 4th series the verbs equally have both aspect forms, while in the 1st series the screeves are distributed between two aspects.

He is reported to have been around 106 when he died at [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]], Ontario in 1871; this would give him a birth date of ca. 1765.  

The year before his death, he met with the ethnologist [[Horatio Hale]], who gave the following description of him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''His appearance, as we first saw him, basking in the sunshine on the slope before his cabin, confirmed the reports, which I had heard, both of his great age and of his marked intelligence. "A wrinkled, smiling countenance, a high forehead, half-shut eyes, white hair, a scanty, stubby beard, fingers bent with age like a bird's claws" is the description recorded in my note-book. Not only in physiognomy, but also in demeanor and character, he differed strikingly from the grave and composed Iroquois among whom he dwelt. The lively, mirthful disposition of his race survived in full force in its latest member. His replies to our inquiries were intermingled with many jocose remarks, and much good-humored laughter.''&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Hale, "Tutelo Tribe and Language", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 21, no. 114 (1883), 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nikonha told Hale that his father had been a [[Tutelo]] chief named Onusowa, while his mother had died when he was a child, leaving him to be raised by his uncle. In 1779, when he was approximately 14, the Tutelo village of Coreorgonel, New York, was attacked during the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of the Revolutionary War, and the remnants fled, along with the [[Cayuga nation]], to Grand River. Nikonha also served in the [[War of 1812]]. His wife was Cayuga, and he had only spoken Cayuga at home for years, until Hale induced him to provide about 100 words of the Tutelo language of his youth. Hale was collecting information on Tutelo from the few surviving individuals who had preserved any knowledge of it &amp;mdash; who were, aside from Nikonha, heavily mixed with Cayuga. On the basis of the vocabulary and grammar that Hale collected, he was able to confirm the status of Tutelo as a Siouan language akin to Dakota and Hidatsa.

'''Production support''' is the practices and disciplines of supporting the [[Information technology|IT]] systems/applications which are currently being used by the [[User_(computing)#End_user|end user]]s. A production support person/team is responsible for receiving incidents and requests from [[end-user]]s, analyzing these and either responding to the end user with a solution or escalating it to the other IT teams.  These teams may include [[Software developer|developer]]s, [[system engineer]]s and [[database administrator]]s.

==The importance of production support==
In order to understand the importance of production support, one needs to take a few factors into account.
* Studies have found that the maintenance cost of [[software]] is more than 90% of the total cost.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* We also know that software spends much more time in production than development because it needs to verify the properties{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.
* The maintenance cost of the hardware.

From the factors listed above, one can see that the way in which production support is managed is extremely crucial.

== Production Support Steps ==
The major steps for Production Support are as below. These Production Support steps are in context of the [[Batch processing]].

=== Recording Production Error ===
Usually a batch job or group of related batch jobs (schedule/stream) runs to accomplish one or more business functions. These batch jobs run unattended and normally complete without any errors or issues. However, sometimes the batch job can have a break/interruption/abend/abort. There could be several reasons why a job could abend.

When a job abends, it can send out an automated alert notification via e-mail, page, text. Also, data center or operations team is also actively monitoring the jobs. They also send alert notification using e-mail, page, text or they can call the on call person responsible for the recovery of the abended job.

The on call person acknowledges the e-mail, page, text or phone call for the abended job. The on call person also records the abended job details in a production issue tracking system. Sometimes, the abended job automatically records the job abend details along with job standard list (job log) in a production issue tracking system. The abended job details (job standard list, error log files, etc.) are available in the production job scheduler tool. The Production issue tracking tool creates a request number and this request number is given to the support team. This request number is used to track the progress of the production support issue. The request is assigned to on call support team person.

=== Notification of Production Error ===
For critical Production Errors (e.g. Production job is in critical path and is likely to delay the batch completion [[Service-level_agreement|SLAs]] and if the Production error is impacting business data), an e-mail is sent to entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with the estimated time for Production error recovery.

=== Investigation or Analysis of Production Error ===
The Production support team on call person collects all the necessary information about the Production error. This information is then recorded in the Production error tracking tool using the correct support request number previously assigned. All the details such as data, environment, process, program logic that failed is used in the investigation. Production batch job, program used or any tool/utility used is reviewed for any possible errors.

=== Resolution of Production Error ===
If similar Production error occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new Production error then new Production error resolution steps are created and Production error is resolved. The new Production error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for the future usage. For major Production errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error. This is also called as an Incident Management. If a problem occurs repeatedly then it is recorded and tracked using appropriate tools and processes until it is resolved permanently. This is also called as Problem Management. The issue is closed only after the customer or end user agrees that the problem is resolved.

=== Production job/program code correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to programming errors then a request is created for the Development team to correct programming errors. Problem is identified, defined and root cause analysis is performed. The programming error is fixed using normal SDLC process - analysis/design/programming/QA/testing/release. The new version of the Production job/program is deployed and verified/validated.

=== Production Process correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to job/schedule dependency issues or sequence issues then further analysis is done to find the correct sequence/dependencies. The new sequence/dependencies are verified and validated in [[test environment]] before Production deployment.

=== Infrastructure Issue correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to infrastructure issues then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fix for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid same error again.

== Production Support Billing ==
If the Production error occurred due to unexpected consequences of infrastructure changes then most often the infrastructure team is not able to bill the time spent in resolving of the issue at the full rate. In some cases hours are completely disqualified from being billed.

== Production Support - Follow up and Reporting ==
The Production error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor resolved issues, repeating issues, pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of Production jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4370">The '''read-through''', '''table-read''', or '''table work''' is a stage of [[film production|film]], [[television production|television]], [[radio]], and [[theatre production]] when an organized reading around a table of the [[screenplay]] or [[Script (performing arts)|script]] by the [[actor]]s with speaking parts is conducted.&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Drew|title=Technical Theater for Nontechnical People (page 210-211)|editor=2|publisher=Allworth Communications, Inc.|year=2004|pages=272|isbn=1-58115-344-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3PzcjyIHcMC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22Read-through%22,+theater#PPA210,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Robert|title=Theatre Studies: The Basics (pgs 135-137)|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|pages=194|isbn=0-415-42639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kFqik4Z3icC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Read-through%22,+theater#PPA135,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the cast members with speaking parts, the read-through is usually attended by the principal [[financier]]s or [[studio]] [[corporate officer|executives]], [[film producer|producers]], heads of department, writers, and [[film director|directors]]. It is generally attended only by people involved in the production. It is usually the first time everyone involved in the production will have gathered together and it is traditional for everyone to introduce themselves by both name and job.{{fact|date=October 2017}} The director may then open proceedings by making a short speech outlining his or her aspirations for the project.

An additional professional actor not otherwise involved in the production may be hired to read the non-dialogue parts of the script such as scene headings and action. These parts of the script are usually edited down severely for the purposes of the read-through to keep the pace of the reading up.

==In film==
The read-through is an important milestone in the production of most [[film]]s. It is a clear signal that all of the key elements, including cast, [[finance]], and heads of department, are in place and that pre-production is almost complete. It is often the first time that the script has had a life beyond the written word, and it is also an opportunity for everyone involved in production to get at least a partial insight into the way the actors may approach their roles. In addition, a read-through is often a surprisingly  powerful tool for identifying problem areas in the script. Wooden dialogue, unbelievable situations, or boring sections of the film which have not been addressed during the script development process often become apparent during the read-through.&lt;ref name="FDF"&gt;{{cite book|last=Proferes|first=Nicholas T.|title=Film Directing Fundamentals: See Your Film Before Shooting (page 143)|editor=2|publisher=Focal Press|year=2004|pages=296|isbn=0-240-80562-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tj9BkYv2q6cC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22Read-through%22,+film#PPA145,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1093">A '''riseball''' or '''dimple''' is a pitch thrown by a pitcher in [[fastpitch softball]].  Upon release by the pitcher, the ball has [[backspin]].  The backspin and velocity are two of the factors that cause the ball to rise.  

Baseball does not have a rise ball as as a ball thrown overhand can not defy gravity and rise.   

[[Jennie Finch]] is famous for striking out [[Major League Baseball]] players with this pitch. The riseball is in effect upside down to a curve ball thrown overhand. 

The movement of the ball is caused by the [[Magnus effect]].

[[File:Drilling Roughnecks.png|thumb|right|320px|Roughnecks on a drilling rig.]]
'''Roughneck''' is a term for a person whose occupation is hard-manual labor. The term applies across a number of industries, but is most commonly associated with the workers on a [[drilling rig]].  The ideal of the hard-working, tough roughneck has been adopted by several sports teams who use the phrase as part of their name or logo.

Originally the term was used in the [[traveling carnival]]s of 19th-century [[United States]], almost interchangeably with [[roustabout]]. By the 1930s the terms had transferred to the [[oil drilling]] industry. In the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[oil industry]] starting in the 1970s, roughneck specifically meant those who worked on the drill floor of a [[drilling rig]] handling specialised drilling equipment for drilling and [[Well control|pressure]] controls.  In practice, these workers ranged from unskilled to highly skilled, depending subjectively on the individual worker's aptitude and experience. By contrast, a roustabout would perform general labor, such as loading and unloading [[cargo]] from crane baskets and assisting [[welding|welders]], mechanics, electricians and other skilled workers. The word roughneck was in use in the U.S. oil drilling industry even earlier and had a similar meaning.

==Oil field roughnecks==
[[Image:Roughneck 022.jpg|thumb|A roughneck.]]
[[File:Rig_up_yard.jpg|thumb]]
In [[oil fields]], a roughneck's duties can include anything involved with connecting pipe down the [[well bore]], as well as general work around a rig.  The crew of a land-based oil rig can be further divided into several positions:

* [[Toolpusher]]: The highest position at the drilling location, responsible for every crew.  A toolpusher may stay on location for a few days or weeks at a time during operations, whereas individual drilling crews work only eight- or 12-hour shifts or "tours" (pronounced as "towers").
* [[Driller (oil)|Driller]]: The head of an individual crew, responsible for controlling a rig's machinery during drilling, as well as most other rig operations.
* [[Derrickhand]] (derrick-man): Responsible for the [[drilling mud]], the mud pits where drilling fluids are circulated around the system, and the mud pumps, as well as being the hand up in the derrick manipulating stands into and out of the fingers during [[tripping (pipe)|tripping]] operations. Acting as a lead for the driller who is mostly restricted to the rig floor. In many cases the derrickman is exclusively responsible for work in the derrick during "tripping" pipe in and out of the hole. 
* Pit Watcher: Responsible for the drilling mud, the mud pits, and associated pumping/circulating of mud and various fluids through the pits, downhole and returning through the pits. 
* [[Motorman]] (motorhand): Responsible for maintenance of various engines, water pumps, water lines, steam lines, boilers and various other machinery incorporated into the rig on a daily basis. Also responsible for movement of equipment on site. On a four-man drilling crew the motorman is also the chainhand.
* Boilerman: Though this position is now obsolete, before the mid-20th century, when most rigs were steam-powered, the boilerman was responsible for the boilers.  The boilerman also functioned as the [[laundryman]], steam-cleaning the last crew's greasy work clothes in the "blow barrel" and then hanging them up to dry in the warm air near the boilers.
* Chainhand (Floorhand): This position is given to a floorhand that can also throw the chain that helps spin up the connections, but {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} with some tasks being [[Iron roughneck|automated]] on the drilling rigs is pretty much just another floorhand that watches out for the worm and does not get as filthy.
* Leadhand/Floorhand ("worm"): Usually the lowest member of the drilling crew, those in this position are often nicknamed "worm", because this hand has the dirtiest and most physically demanding position. The floorhand works primarily on the rig floor where he is the one actually operating the tongs, iron roughneck, tugger, and catwalk, and doing pretty much any other job which is asked of him.
* [[Roustabout]] (leasehand): On bigger rigs and offshore rigs, a roustabout does most of the painting and cleaning so roughnecks can take care of other work.
* Ginsel: The worm's helper. This is also derogatory insult among roughnecks. Also called the fifth hand.
* [[Iron roughnecks|Iron Roughneck]] is also a specialized equipment used in oil drilling operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inglis|first1=Tom|title=Directional Drilling |series=Petroleum Engineering and Development Studies |date=January 31, 1988|publisher=Springer|location=|isbn=978-0860107163|page=236|edition=2nd|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780860107163 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether pipe is being fed into the wellbore or it is being taken out, the iron roughneck uses a rotary table and torque wrench(es) to make up or break down pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=293|title=How Do Iron Roughnecks Work?|website=www.rigzone.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada on land-based rigs, the term ''roughneck'' refers to the floorhand.

==Cultural references==
The [[Edmonton Oilers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] used to use an oil rigging roughneck with an [[ice hockey stick]] as one of their secondary logos. The roughneck, as a symbol of hard work and fortitude, was the inspiration for the [[Calgary Roughnecks]] [[lacrosse]] team, as well as the [[Tulsa Roughnecks (1978–1984)|Tulsa Roughnecks]] of the [[North American Soccer League]], the [[Tulsa Roughnecks (1993–2000)|Tulsa Roughnecks]] of the [[United Soccer Leagues]], and the [[Tulsa Roughnecks FC]] of the USL. The [[West Texas Roughnecks]] of the [[Indoor Football League]] also use this nickname. In the [[BAFA National Leagues]], the [[Aberdeen Roughnecks]] have also adopted the nickname. In the AUDL (American Ultimate Disc League) the Dallas team is also the Roughnecks.

[[Rubbermaid]] has used the name "Roughneck" for trash containers and storage totes since the mid-1970s.

In Chapter 3 of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', on first meeting Jay Gatsby, [[Nick Carraway]] describes him as looking like "an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd."

[[Johnny Cash]] wrote and performed a song called "Born to Be a Roughneck".

Several television programs have focused on the roughneck life, including ''[[Oil Strike North]]'' (1975), ''[[Roughnecks (TV series)|Roughnecks]]'' (1994–1995), and ''[[Black Gold (TV series)|Black Gold]]'' (2008–2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5793">'''Semantic features''' represent the basic conceptual components of meaning for any lexical item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Language|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|last2=Rodman|first2=Robert|last3=Hyams|first3=Nina|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=578|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual semantic feature constitutes one component of a word's [[intension]], which is the inherent sense or concept evoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Grady|first1=William|last2=Archibald|first2=John|last3=Aronoff|first3=Mark|last4=Rees-Miller|first4=Janie|title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston, MA|page=619|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic meaning of a word is proposed to arise from contrasts and significant differences with other words. Semantic features enable linguistics to explain how words that share certain features may be members of the same [[semantic domain]]. Correspondingly, the contrast in meanings of words is explained by diverging semantic features. For example, ''father'' and ''son'' share the common components of 'human', 'kinship', 'male' and are thus part of a semantic domain of male family relations. They differ in terms of 'generation' and 'adulthood', which is what gives each its individual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nida|first1=Eugene A.|title=Componential analysis of meaning : an introduction to semantic structures|date=1975|publisher=Mouton|location=The Hague|isbn=9027979278|pages=32–33|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical context== 
The analysis of semantic features is utilized in the field of linguistic semantics, more specifically the subfields of [[lexical semantics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=F.R.|title=Semantics|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge u.a.|isbn=0521283760|pages=67–114|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[lexicology]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazzazi|first1=Hadumod Bussmann ; translated and edited by Gregory Trauth and Kerstin|title=Routledge dictionary of language and linguistics|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415022258|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aim of these subfields is to explain the meaning of a word in terms of their relationships with other words.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=F.R.|title=Semantics|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge u.a.|isbn=0521283760|page=83|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to accomplish this aim, one approach is to analyze the internal semantic structure of a word as composed of a number of distinct and minimal components of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=F.R.|title=Semantics|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge u.a.|isbn=0521283760|page=108|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is called [[componential analysis]], also known as semantic decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Grady|first1=William|last2=Archibald|first2=John|title=Contemporary linguistics : an introduction|date=2010|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0312555288|page=210|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic decomposition allows any given lexical item to be defined based on minimal elements of meaning, which are called semantic features. The term ''semantic feature'' is usually used interchangeably with the term ''semantic component''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipka|first1=Leonhard|title=An outline of English lexicology : lexical structure, word semantics, and word-formation|date=1990|publisher=Niemeyer|location=Tübingen|isbn=3484410035|page=98|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, semantic features/semantic components are also often referred to as [[Semantic property|semantic properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=F.R.|title=Semantics|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge u.a.|isbn=0521283760|pages=191, 198, 200|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of componential analysis and semantic features is not the only approach to analyzing the semantic structure of words. An alternative direction of research that contrasts with componential analysis is [[Prototype theory|prototype semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipka|first1=Leonhard|title=An outline of English lexicology : lexical structure, word semantics, and word-formation|date=1990|publisher=Niemeyer|location=Tübingen|isbn=3484410035|page=98|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
The '''semantic features''' of a word can be notated using a binary feature notation common to the framework of [[componential analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazzazi|first1=Hadumod Bussmann ; translated and edited by Gregory Trauth and Kerstin|title=Routledge dictionary of language and linguistics|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415022258|page=219|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[semantic property]] is specified in square brackets and a plus or minus sign indicates the existence or non-existence of that property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipka|first1=Leonhard|title=An outline of English lexicology : lexical structure, word semantics, and word-formation|date=1990|publisher=Niemeyer|location=Tübingen|isbn=3484410035|page=108|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Man'' is [+HUMAN], [+MALE], [+ADULT]&lt;br&gt;
''Woman'' is [+HUMAN], [-MALE], [+ADULT]&lt;br&gt;
''Boy'' is [+HUMAN], [+MALE], [-ADULT]&lt;br&gt;
''Girl'' is [+HUMAN], [-MALE], [-ADULT]

Intersecting [[semantic class]]es share the same features. Some features need not be specifically mentioned as their presence or absence is obvious from another feature. This is a [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] rule.

'''Sir Richard Arthur Surtees Paget, 2nd Baronet''' (13 January 1869 – 23 October 1955) was a British barrister and amateur scientific investigator, who specialised in [[speech science]] and the [[origin of speech]]. Following the publication of his book on these topics, ''Human Speech'', in 1930, Paget worked for the remaining decades of his life on a new type of signing system for the deaf, which became the [[Paget Gorman Sign System]].

==Early life and education==
Paget was born in 1869 at Cranmore Hall, Somerset. His father was [[Sir Richard Paget, 1st Baronet]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member of parliament; his mother was Caroline Isabel Surtees, the daughter of [[Henry Surtees (MP)|Henry Surtees]], another MP, of [[County Durham]]. He was educated at [[Eton College]], and then at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he received a third-class degree in chemistry. He succeeded his father as [[Paget baronets|Paget Baronet]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Harry Lowery, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35358 ‘Paget, Sir Richard Arthur Surtees, second baronet (1869–1955)’], rev. John Bosnell, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008, accessed 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
Paget was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] as a [[barrister]] at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1895. His sharp legal and scientific mind saw him appointed to a number of legal commissions, boards and committees, including the [[London Court of International Arbitration|London Court of Arbitration]], the Patent Law Committee, and the [[Admiralty]] [[Board of Invention and Research]].&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;&lt;ref name=branson&gt;{{cite book|last=Branson|first=Jan|title=Damned for their difference: the cultural construction of deaf people as "disabled" : a sociological history|year=2002|publisher=Gallaudet|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1563681188|author2=Miller, Don }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur scientist==
Educated as a chemist and having worked as a physicist, Paget held a deep interest in various fields of science. He was also well-versed in music and the arts (and had written several songs as well as constructed his own musical instruments), but his reputation was that of an "eccentric amateur" scientist.&lt;ref name=nevada&gt;{{cite news|last=Postlethwaite|first=Ken|title=Obituaries-English style|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G0QrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LtUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1438%2C6958299|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Nevada Daily Mail|date=28 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Richard's daughter, Pamela Paget (later Lady Glenconner), was often a subject of his experiments. Pamela's son and Sir Richard's grandson, [[Alexander Chancellor]], wrote in his "Long Life" column in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that Pamela had broken her arm when Sir Richard encouraged her to throw herself backwards from the open platform of a London bus on [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] to demonstrate his theory that, due to air currents, one could fall horizontally from a bus travelling at a certain speed and land safely on the road.&lt;ref name=longlife&gt;{{cite news|last=Chancellor|first=Alexander|title=Long life: How to fall off a moving bus backwards and land safely|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/long-life/8914371/how-to-fall-off-a-moving-bus-backwards-and-land-safely/|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Spectator|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bradt&gt;{{cite book|last=Vay|first=Benedict Le|title=Eccentric Cambridge: the Bradt city guide|year=2006|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|location=Chalfont St. Peter|isbn=1841621722|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTJaxmQ9ow8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Lady Glenconner's obituary in ''The Telegraph'', Sir Richard had also filled his daughters' ears with [[treacle]] (to simulate deafness) while testing his sign language system.&lt;ref name=nevada /&gt;

===Speech and sign language===
Sir Richard's most enduring legacy was his research into the nature of human speech and communication. While he made contributions to several branches of the field from phonetics and vocalisation to linguistics and vocabulary, it was his theories on the origin of speech and the "pantomimic action" of the lips and tongue being related to the speaker's senses and emotions that led to his central thesis that hand signs and gestures were the original form of human communication, and that humans had evolved to communicate vocally as their "hands [were] full".&lt;ref name=humanspeech&gt;Peterson, Joseph: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1415187 ''Human Speech: Some Observations, Experiments, and Conclusions as to the Nature, Origin, Purpose and Possible Improvement of Human Speech'' by Richard Paget], ''The American Journal of Psychology'', Vol. 43, No. 4 (Oct. 1931), pp. 710–712.&lt;/ref&gt; His book on these ideas, ''Human Speech'', was published in 1930, and was re-issued in 1964 due to its connections with later developments in communication engineering.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; The Irish author [[James Joyce]] was a close follower of Paget's research, and his works and those of [[Marcel Jousse]] were influential in Joyce's study and use of language.&lt;ref name=joyce&gt;[http://www.item.ens.fr/index.php?id=187421 Supplementing Babel: Paget in VI.B.32’], in ''James Joyce: The Study of Languages'', ed. Dirk Van Hulle (Brussels: Peter Lang, 2002) (p. 75-89.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Sir Richard began developing a [[Manually Coded Language|manually coded]] [[sign language]] system. He collaborated with the librarian at the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, [[Pierre Gorman]], to develop the system further. Upon his death in 1955, his widow, Lady Grace Paget, continued the work with Gorman, and the resulting [[Paget Gorman Sign System]] was widely used in the education of deaf children in Britain from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scarborough|first=Kim; Eric Broussine|title=Supporting people with learning disabilities in health &amp; social care|year=2011|publisher=SAGE|location=Los Angeles, [Calif.]|isbn=1446254321|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pgsshistory&gt;[http://www.pagetgorman.org/our-history Paget Gorman Signed Speech – Our History], Paget Gorman Signed Speech.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
Paget was married twice. His first marriage was to [[Muriel Paget|Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon Finch-Hatton]] (daughter of [[Murray Finch-Hatton, 12th Earl of Winchilsea]]) on 31 May 1897; they had three daughters and two sons (one of whom died as an infant). His youngest child, John Starr Paget (1914–1992), succeeded him in the [[Paget baronets|Paget Baronetcy]] as the 3rd Baronet.&lt;ref name=muriel&gt;Sybil Oldfield, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35357 ‘Paget , Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon (1876–1938)’], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biograph''y, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Muriel died in 1938 of cancer and exhaustion. On 22 July 1939, Sir Richard married Grace Hartley Glover; they had no children.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

The '''Societate American pro Interlingua''' ('''SAI''') is an [[Interlingua]]-speaking organization that covers the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. It is currently undergoing reorganization to be considered a non-profit group under US law.

The SAI's charter is a directive written to promote Interlingua in the three countries under its purview. To that end, it organizes meetings, publishes literature and publishes a journal ([[Confluentes]]), all in Interlingua.

==List of officers==

The SAI has six positions, which are filled by five people:

*President:  Dr. [[Stanley A. Mulaik]]
*Secretary and Treasurer:  Mr. Paul May
*Ad
**Mr. Chris Burd
**Jacinto Bowks, Ed.D.
**  

Of the memberships, three come from the United States, two are Canadian, and there are presently no Mexican members on the board of the SAI.

Different authors have used the concept of stance to refer to the interpretive framework that is at play in an interaction such as [[irony]], or [[role-playing]], others have used the concept of ''authorial stance'' to describe the way in which authors position themselves relative to their own texts, and another group have used the concept of ''interpersonal stance'' to describe the way the communicative goals of individual participants shape a communicative interaction. Others have drawn on [[Daniel Dennett]]'s concept of the ''intentional stance'' to describe the way humans tend to impute intentions and mental states to those with whom they engage in communication.{{sfn|Kockelman|2005|p=129}}{{sfn|Jaffe|2009}}

[[File:Alt Telefon.jpg|thumb|A [[rotary dial]] telephone, c. 1940s]]{{Lead too long|date=July 2018}}[[File:Tel 01LX.jpg|thumb|Modern telephones use push buttons.]]
A '''telephone''', or '''phone''', is a [[telecommunication]]s device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts [[sound]], typically and most efficiently the [[human voice]], into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.

In 1876, Scottish emigrant [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice. This instrument was further developed by many others. The telephone was the first device in history that enabled people to talk directly with each other across large distances. Telephones rapidly became indispensable to businesses, government and households and are today some of the most widely used [[small appliances]].

The essential elements of a telephone are a [[microphone]] (''transmitter'') to speak into and an [[earphone]] (''receiver'') which reproduces the voice in a distant location.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.defense.gov/2017/Mar/16/2001717399/-1/-1/0/CIM_9430_1.PDF  United States Coast Guard ''Sound-Powered Telephone Talkers Manual'', 1979, p. 1 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most telephones contain a ''ringer'' to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a [[telephone number]] when initiating a call to another telephone.  The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a [[handset]] which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected. The transmitter converts the [[sound wave]]s to [[Signal (information theory)|electrical signals]] which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a [[loudspeaker]]. Telephones are [[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously.

The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located [[Telephone switchboard|switchboards]]. This gave rise to [[landline]] telephone service in which each telephone is connected by a pair of dedicated wires to a local central office switching system, which developed into fully automated systems starting in the early 1900s, and eventually into a worldwide [[public switched telephone network]].  For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century.  Hand-held [[mobile phone]]s were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. In later decades their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost. 

[[Technological convergence#Cell phone convergence|Convergence]] has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.  They may be able to [[Answering machine|record spoken messages]], send and receive [[Text messaging|text messages]], [[Camera phone|take and display photographs]] or [[Videotelephony|video]], play music or [[video game|games]], [[Mobile browser|surf the Internet]], do [[turn-by-turn navigation|road navigation]] or immerse the user in [[virtual reality]]. Since 1999, the trend for mobile phones is [[smartphone]]s that integrate all mobile communication and computing needs.

== Basic principles ==
[[File:Telephoneschematic.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.35|&lt;center&gt;Schematic of a landline telephone installation&lt;/center&gt;]]

A traditional [[landline]] telephone system, also known as ''[[plain old telephone service]]'' (POTS), commonly carries both control and audio signals on the same [[twisted pair]] (''C'' in diagram) of insulated wires, the telephone line. The control and signaling equipment consists of three components, the ringer, the hookswitch, and a dial. The ringer, or beeper, light or other device (A7), alerts the user to incoming calls. The hookswitch signals to the central office that the user has picked up the handset to either answer a call or initiate a call. A dial, if present, is used by the subscriber to transmit a telephone number to the central office when initiating a call. Until the 1960s dials used almost exclusively the [[rotary dial|rotary]] technology, which was replaced by [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling]] (DTMF) with [[push-button telephone|pushbutton telephones]] (A4).

A major expense of wire-line telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on a single pair of wires. A twisted pair line rejects [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) and [[crosstalk]] better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with [[sidetone]] because a [[hybrid coil]] (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and [[impedance matching|adjusts the line's resistance]] (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce [[galvanic corrosion]]. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.

The landline telephone contains a switchhook (A4) and an alerting device, usually a ringer (A7), that remains connected to the phone line whenever the phone is "[[on hook]]" (i.e. the switch (A4) is open), and other components which are connected when the phone is "[[off hook]]". The off-hook components include a transmitter (microphone, A2), a receiver (speaker, A1), and other circuits for dialing, filtering (A3), and amplification.

A [[calling party]] wishing to speak to another party will pick up the telephone's handset, thereby operating a lever which closes the switchhook (A4), which powers the telephone by connecting the transmitter (microphone), receiver (speaker), and related audio components to the line. The off-hook circuitry has a low resistance (less than 300 [[ohm]]s) which causes a [[direct current]] (DC), which comes down the line (C) from the telephone exchange. The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends a [[dial tone]] to indicate readiness. On a modern [[push-button telephone]], the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the [[called party]]. The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that makes [[DTMF]] tones that the exchange receives. A [[Rotary dial|rotary-dial telephone]] uses [[pulse dialing]], sending electrical pulses, that the exchange can count to get the telephone number (as of 2010 many exchanges were still equipped to handle pulse dialing). If the called party's line is available, the exchange sends an intermittent [[Ringing (telephony)|ringing signal]] (about 75 volts [[alternating current]] (AC) in North America and UK and 60 volts in Germany) to alert the called party to an incoming call. If the called party's line is in use, the exchange returns a [[busy signal]] to the calling party. However, if the called party's line is in use but has [[call waiting]] installed, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate an incoming call.

The ringer of a telephone (A7) is connected to the line through a [[capacitor]] (A6), which blocks direct current but passes the alternating current of the ringing signal. The telephone draws no current when it is on hook, while a DC voltage is continually applied to the line. Exchange circuitry (D2) can send an AC current down the line to activate the ringer and announce an incoming call. When there is no automatic exchange, telephones have hand-cranked [[telephone magneto|magnetos]] to generate a ringing voltage back to the exchange or any other telephone on the same line. When a landline telephone is inactive (on hook), the circuitry at the telephone exchange detects the absence of direct current to indicate that the line is not in use.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Telephone |volume=26 |pages=547–557 |first1=Harry Robert |last1=Kempe |first2=Emile |last2=Garcke}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a party initiates a call to this line, the exchange sends the ringing signal. When the called party picks up the handset, they actuate a double-circuit switchhook (not shown) which may simultaneously disconnects the alerting device and connects the audio circuitry to the line. This, in turn, draws direct current through the line, confirming that the called phone is now active. The exchange circuitry turns off the ring signal, and both telephones are now active and connected through the exchange. The parties may now converse as long as both phones remain off hook. When a party hangs up, placing the handset back on the cradle or hook, direct current ceases in that line, signaling the exchange to disconnect the call.

Calls to parties beyond the local exchange are carried over [[Trunking|trunk]] lines which establish connections between exchanges. In modern telephone networks, [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic cable]] and [[Digital Multiplex System|digital technology]] are often employed in such connections. [[Communications satellite|Satellite technology]] may be used for communication over very long distances.

In most landline telephones, the transmitter and receiver (microphone and speaker) are located in the handset, although in a [[speakerphone]] these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure. Powered by the line, the microphone (A2) produces a modulated electric current which varies its [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] in response to the [[sound]] waves arriving at its [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone (via the local exchange or via a larger network), where it passes through the [[voice coil|coil]] of the receiver (A3). The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver's diaphragm, reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter.

Along with the microphone and speaker, additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other. This is accomplished through a [[hybrid coil]] (A3). The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor (A8) and the primary winding of the coil (A3) which passes it to the speaker (A1). Since the current path A8 – A3 has a far lower impedance than the microphone (A2), virtually all of the incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone.

At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor-coil (A8-A3) branch and the microphone-coil (A2-A3) branch. The DC current through the resistor-coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal. But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC current (in response to voice sounds) which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil's (A3) primary winding, which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding. This causes a small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker, while the rest of the AC current goes out through the phone line.

A [[lineman's handset]] is a telephone designed for testing the telephone network, and may be attached directly to aerial lines and other infrastructure components.

In the United Kingdom ''the blower'' is used as a slang term for a telephone. The slang came from the [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] ships prior to telephones. Communication was direct, through a voice pipe. The pipe had a whistle inserted at each end. When a message was to be passed, the caller would remove the whistle at his end, place his mouth into the cavity, sealing it. He would then blow hard. The whistle at the other end would attract the man on watch. He would remove his whistle and call into the pipe. Conversations over, both whistles were replaced.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Before the development of the electric telephone, the term "telephone" was applied to other inventions, and not all early researchers of the electrical device called it "telephone". A communication device for sailing vessels ''The Telephone'' was the invention of a captain John Taylor in 1844. This instrument used four [[air horn]]s to communicate with vessels in foggy weather.&lt;ref&gt;Timbs, John; "Year Book of Facts in Science and Art", 1844 edition, p. 55.

Kingsbury published in 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, c. 1860, [[Johann Philipp Reis]] used the term in reference to his [[Reis telephone]], his device appears to be the first such device based on conversion of sound into electrical impulses, the term telephone was adopted into the vocabulary of many languages. It is derived from the {{lang-el|τῆλε}}, ''tēle'', "far" and φωνή, ''phōnē'', "voice", together meaning "distant voice".

Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed. As with other influential [[invention]]s such as [[Invention of radio|radio]], [[History of television|television]], the [[Incandescent light bulb#History|light bulb]], and the [[History of computing hardware|computer]], several inventors pioneered experimental work on ''voice transmission over a wire'' and improved on each other's ideas. New controversies over the issue still arise from time to time. [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Antonio Meucci]], [[Johann Philipp Reis]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and [[Elisha Gray]], amongst others, have all been credited with the invention of the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coe|first=Lewis|title=The Telephone and It's Several Inventors: A History|year=1995|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=978-0-7864-2609-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

* 1844: [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] first mooted the idea of a "speaking telegraph" or telephone. Use of the "speaking telegraph" and "sound telegraph" monikers would eventually be replaced by the newer, distinct name, "telephone".
* 26 August 1854: [[Charles Bourseul]] published an article in the magazine ''[[L'Illustration]]'' (Paris): "Transmission électrique de la parole" (electric transmission of speech), describing a "make-and-break" type telephone transmitter later created by Johann Reis.
* 26 October 1861: [[Johann Philipp Reis]] (1834–1874) publicly demonstrated the [[Reis telephone]] before the Physical Society of Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Reis' telephone was not limited to musical sounds. Reis also used his telephone to transmit the phrase "Das Pferd frisst keinen Gurkensalat" ("The horse does not eat cucumber salad"). 
* 22 August 1865, La Feuille d'Aoste reported "It is rumored that English technicians to whom Mr. [[Innocenzo Manzetti|Manzetti]] illustrated his method for transmitting spoken words on the telegraph wire intend to apply said invention in England on several private telegraph lines".

A 'patent caveat' was not an invention [[patent]] award, but only an unverified notice filed by an individual that he or she intends to file a regular patent application in the future.
* 1874: Meucci, after having renewed the caveat for two years does not renew it again, and the caveat lapses.
* 6 April 1875: Bell's U.S. Patent 161,739 "Transmitters and Receivers for Electric Telegraphs" is granted. This uses multiple vibrating steel reeds in make-break circuits.

* 27 April 1877: Edison files for a patent on a carbon (graphite) transmitter. The patent 474,230 was granted 3 May 1892, after a 15-year delay because of litigation. Edison was granted patent 222,390 for a carbon granules transmitter in 1879.

=== Early commercial instruments ===
Early telephones were technically diverse. Some used a [[water microphone]], some had a metal diaphragm that induced current in an electromagnet wound around a permanent magnet, and some were [[Dynamic microphone|dynamic]] - their diaphragm vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or the coil vibrated the diaphragm. The sound-powered dynamic variants survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications, where its ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used the Edison/Berliner [[carbon transmitter]], which was much louder than the other kinds, even though it required an [[induction coil]] which was an [[impedance matching]] transformer to make it compatible with the impedance of the line. The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time the network was more important than the instrument.

Early telephones were locally powered, using either a dynamic transmitter or by the powering of a transmitter with a local battery. One of the jobs of [[outside plant]] personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery. During the 20th century, telephones powered from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals became common.

Early telephones used a single wire for the subscriber's line, with [[Single wire earth return|ground return]] used to complete the circuit (as used in [[telegraph]]s). The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one port opening for sound, with the user alternately listening and speaking (or rather, shouting) into the same hole. Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.

At first, the benefits of a telephone exchange were not exploited. Instead telephones were leased in pairs to a [[subscriber]], who had to arrange for a telegraph contractor to construct a line between them, for example between a home and a shop. Users who wanted the ability to speak to several different locations would need to obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones. [[Western Union]], already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential.

[[Signaling (telecommunications)|Signalling]] began in an appropriately primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange [[Switchboard operator|operator]], by [[whistling]] into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell in a [[ringer box]], first operated over a second wire, and later over the same wire, but with a condenser ([[capacitor]]) in series with the bell coil to allow the [[Alternating current|AC]] ringer signal through while still blocking [[Direct current|DC]] (keeping the phone "[[on hook]]"). Telephones connected to the earliest [[Strowger switch]] automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the [[Changeover switch|knife switch]], one for each [[telegraph key]], one for the bell, one for the [[push-button]] and two for speaking. Large wall telephones in the early 20th century usually incorporated the bell, and separate [[bell box]]es for desk phones dwindled away in the middle of the century.

Rural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had a [[telephone magneto|magneto]] hand-cranked generator to produce a high voltage alternating signal to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the operator. Some local farming communities that were not connected to the main networks set up [[barbed wire telephone lines]] that exploited the existing system of field fences to transmit the signal.

[[File:Marguerite_Martyn_sketch_of_Finley_Johnson_Shepard_at_his_desk_being_congratulated_on_his_engagement_to_Helen_Gould,_1917.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon by journalist [[Marguerite Martyn]] shows a man using a candlestick telephone, 1917.]]
In the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, packaged in three parts. The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a "[[Candlestick telephone|candlestick]]" for its shape. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a "switchhook". Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone "off the hook". In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery and magneto were in a separate bell box or "[[ringer box]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} &lt;/ref&gt; In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out of the way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.

Cradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, now called a [[handset]], separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts. They were larger than the "candlestick" and more popular.

Disadvantages of single wire operation such as crosstalk and [[Mains hum|hum from nearby AC power wires]] had already led to the use of twisted pairs and, for long distance telephones, [[four-wire circuit]]s. Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place [[long distance call]]s from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special soundproofed long distance [[telephone booth]] furnished with the latest technology.

What turned out to be the most popular and longest lasting physical style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's [[Model 202 telephone|202-type]] desk set. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use sat in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled. In local battery configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a local battery and inductively coupled, while the receiver was included in the local loop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070616083345/http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg Circuit Diagram, Model 102], Porticus Telephone website.&lt;/ref&gt; The coupling transformer and the ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set. The dial switch in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.

In the 1930s, telephone sets were developed that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box. The [[rotary dial]] becoming commonplace in the 1930s in many areas enabled customer-dialed service, but some magneto systems remained even into the 1960s. After World War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the [[model 500 telephone]] in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using [[push-button telephone]]s by [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) in 1963.

The invention of the transistor in 1947 dramatically changed the technology used in telephone systems and in the long-distance transmission networks. With the development of [[electronic switching system]]s in the 1960s, [[telephony]] gradually evolved towards [[digital telephony]] which improved the capacity, quality, and cost of the network.

The development of digital data communications method, such as the protocols used for the [[Internet]], it became possible to digitize voice and transmit it as real-time data across [[computer network]]s, giving rise to the field of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, also known as [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), a term that reflects the methodology memorably. VoIP has proven to be a [[disruptive technology]] that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone network infrastructure.

As of January 2005, up to 10% of telephone subscribers in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] have switched to this digital telephone service. A January 2005 [[Newsweek]] article suggested that Internet telephony may be "the next big thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheridan |first=Barrett |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6831938/site/newsweek/ |title=Newsweek – National News, World News, Health, Technology, Entertainment and more... - Newsweek.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118033848/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6831938/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=January 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006 many VoIP companies offer service to [[consumer]]s and [[business]]es.

From a customer perspective, IP telephony uses a high-bandwidth Internet connection and specialized customer premises equipment to transmit telephone calls via the Internet, or any modern private data network. The customer equipment may be an [[analog telephone adapter]] (ATA) which interfaces a conventional analog telephone to the IP networking equipment, or it may be an [[IP Phone]] that has the networking and interface technology built into the desk-top set and provides the traditional, familiar parts of a telephone, the handset, the dial or keypad, and a ringer in a package that usually resembles a standard telephone set.

In addition, many computer software vendors and telephony operators provide [[softphone]] application software that emulates a telephone by use of an attached microphone and audio headset, or [[loud speaker]].

Despite the new features and conveniences of IP telephones, some may have notable disadvantages compared to traditional telephones. Unless the IP telephone's components are backed up with an [[uninterruptible power supply]] or other emergency power source, the phone ceases to function during a [[power outage]] as can occur during an emergency or disaster when the phone is most needed. Traditional phones connected to the older [[PSTN]] network do not experience that problem since they are powered by the telephone company's battery supply, which will continue to function even if there is a prolonged power outage. Another problem in Internet-based services is the lack of a fixed physical location, impacting the provisioning of emergency services such as police, fire or ambulance, should someone call for them. Unless the registered user updates the IP phone's physical address location after moving to a new residence, emergency services can be, and have been, dispatched to the wrong location.

{{IPA notice}}

[[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], an extinct [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] language, has the largest consonant inventory of all documented languages that do not use clicks, and also has the most disproportional ratio of phonemic consonants to vowels. It has consonants in at least eight, perhaps nine, basic [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] and 29 distinct [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], 27 [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]s, and 20 [[uvular consonant|uvular]]s, more than any other documented language. Some Khoisan languages, such as [[Taa|ǃXóõ]], may have larger consonant inventories due to their extensive use of [[click consonants]], although some analyses&lt;ref&gt;See for instance {{Harvcoltxt|Traill|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; view a large proportion of the clicks in these languages as clusters, which would bring them closer into line with the Caucasian languages.

# Note the large number of basic series; Ubykh has basic consonants at nine places of articulation.
# The glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is also noted, but only as an allophone of {{IPA|/qʼ/}}.
# Of the three secondary articulations:
#* Palatalization, abbreviated "pal.", is indicated with {{angbr|{{IPA|ʲ}}}}.
#* Labialization, abbreviated "lab.", is indicated with {{angbr|{{IPA|ʷ}}}}.
#* Pharyngealization, abbreviated "phar.", is indicated with {{angbr|{{IPA|ˤ}}}}.
# The three postalveolar series have traditionally been called "postalveolar", "alveolo-palatal", and "retroflex", respectively, and have been transcribed with their associated symbols.
# The laminal and apical postalveolar series are more accurately transcribed as {{IPA|/ʃ̻/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ̺/}}, respectively.
# There is no standard IPA notation for the laminal-closed postalveolar series. They are transcribed {{IPA|/ŝ/}}, etc. by Catford.
# The velar stops {{IPA|/k/ /ɡ/ /kʼ/}} and the labiodental fricative {{IPA|/v/}} are only found in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Circassian language|Circassian]] loanwords.
# Out of the labials, the fricatives {{IPA|/v/ /vˤ/ /f/}} are labiodental, the others bilabial.

All but four of the 84 consonants are found in native vocabulary. The plain velars {{IPA|/k/ /ɡ/ /kʼ/}} and the voiced labiodental fricative {{IPA|/v/}} are found mainly in loans and onomatopoeia: {{IPA|/ɡaarɡa/}} ('crow') from Turkish ''karga''), {{IPA|/kawar/}} ('slat, batten') from Laz ''k'avari'' 'roofing shingle'), {{IPA|/makʼəf/}} ('estate, legacy') from Turkish ''vakıf''), {{IPA|/vər/}} ('the sound of glass breaking'). As well, the pharyngealised labial consonants {{IPA|/pˤ/ /pˁʼ/}} are almost exclusively noted in words where they are associated with another pharyngealised consonant (for instance, {{IPA|/qˁʼaapˁʼa/}} 'handful'), but are occasionally found outside this context (for example, the verb root {{IPA|/tʼaapˁʼ/}} 'to explode, to burst'). Finally, {{IPA|/h/}} is mainly found in interjections and loans, with {{IPA|/hənda/}} ('now') the only real native word to contain the phoneme.  The frequency of consonants in Ubykh is quite variable; the phoneme {{IPA|/n/}} alone accounts for over 12% of all consonants encountered in connected text, due to the presence of the phoneme in the ergative and oblique singular and plural case suffixes, the third person singular and plural ergative verbal agreement prefix, the adverbial derivative suffix, the present and imperfect tense suffixes, and in suffixes denoting several non-finite verb forms.

Very few allophones of consonants are noted, mainly because a small [[acoustics|acoustic]] difference can be phonemic when so many consonants are involved. However, the alveolopalatal labialised fricatives {{IPA|/ɕʷ ʑʷ/}} were sometimes realised as alveolar labialised fricatives {{IPA|[sʷ zʷ]}}, and the uvular ejective stop {{IPA|/qʼ/}} was often pronounced as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in the past tense suffix -{{IPA|/qʼa/}}, due to the influence of the [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] languages.

The consonant {{IPA|/pˤ/}} has not been attested word-initially, and {{IPA|/pˁʼ/}} is found initially only in the personal name {{IPA|/pˁʼapˁʼəʒʷ/}}, but every other consonant can begin a word. Restrictions on word-final consonants have not yet been investigated; however, Ubykh has a slight preference for open syllables (CV) over closed ones (VC or CVC). The pharyngealised consonants {{IPA|/mˤ/}} and {{IPA|/wˤ/}} have not been noted word-finally, but this is probably a statistical anomaly due to the rarity of these consonants, each being attested only in a handful of words.

The alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}} is not common in native Ubykh vocabulary, appearing mostly in loan words. However, the phoneme carries a [[phonaestheme|phonaesthetic]] concept of rolling or a repeated action in a few verbs, notably {{IPA|/bəqˁʼəda/}} ~ {{IPA|/bəqˁʼərda/}} ('to roll around') and {{IPA|/χˤʷəχˤʷəda/}} ~ {{IPA|/χˤʷəχˤʷərda/}} ('to slither').

=== Karacalar Ubykh Phonology ===
A divergent dialect of Ubykh spoken by Osman Güngör, an inhabitant of Karacalar in Balıkesir province{{sfnp|Fenwick|2011}} was investigated by [[Georges Dumézil]] in the 1960s.{{sfnp|Dumézil|1965|p=266–269}} Below is an [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] representation of the Karacalar Ubykh consonant inventory.

Güngör's speech differed phonologically from Standard Ubykh in a number of ways:

* the labialised alveolar stops {{IPA|/dʷ/ /tʷ/ /tʷʼ/}} have merged into the corresponding bilabial stops {{IPA|/b/ /p/ /pʼ/}}.
* The labialised alveolopalatal fricatives {{IPA|/ɕʷ/ /ʑʷ/}} have merged with their postalveolar counterparts {{IPA|/ʃʷ/ /ʒʷ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɣ/}} seems to have disappeared.
* Pharyngealisation is no longer distinctive, surviving only on the lexemes {{IPA|/abˤa/}} ('to be ill') and {{IPA|/qˤʷə/}} ('to bark'), and being replaced in many instances by [[gemination]] (standard {{IPA|/wˤa/}} ('dog') → Karacalar {{IPA|/wːa/}}), and in at least one instance by ejectivisation (standard {{IPA|/tsaqˤapˤə/}} ('roasted maize') → Karacalar {{IPA|/tsaqʼapʼə/}}).
* Palatalisation of the uvular consonants is no longer phonemic, also being replaced in many instances by gemination (standard {{IPA|/qʲa/}} ('to cough') → Karacalar {{IPA|/qːa/}}).
* The voiced retroflex affricate {{IPA|/ɖʐ/}} has, at least in some cases, merged with {{IPA|/dʒ/}}.

== Vowels ==
Ubykh has very few basic phonemic vowels. The analysis in {{Harvcoltxt|Vogt|1963}} retains {{IPA|/oː/}} as a separate vowel, but most other linguists{{sfnp|Dumézil|1965}} do not accept this analysis, preferring one with simpler [[vertical vowel system|vertical]] distinction: {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}. Other vowels, notably {{IPA|/u/}}, appear in some loanwords. The question of whether an additional vowel {{IPA|/aa/}} should be retained is of some debate, since it differs from {{IPA|/a/}} not in length but in quality. However, [[phonology|phonologically]] and [[diachronic linguistics|diachronically]], it is often derived from two instances of {{IPA|/a/}}.

Even with so few vowels, there are many [[vowel]] [[allophone]]s, affected by the secondary articulation of the consonants that surround them. Eleven basic phonetic vowels appear, mostly derived from the two phonemic vowels adjacent to [[labialisation|labialised]] or [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] consonants. The phonetic vowels are {{IPA|[a e i o u ə]}} and {{IPA|[aː eː iː oː uː]}}. In general, the following rules apply:{{sfnp|Vogt|1963}}

:{{IPA|/Cʷa/ &amp;rarr; [Co]}} and {{IPA|/aw/ &amp;rarr; [oː]}}
:{{IPA|/Cʲa/ &amp;rarr; [Ce]}} and {{IPA|/aj/ &amp;rarr; [eː]}}
:{{IPA|/Cʷə/ &amp;rarr; [Cu]}} and {{IPA|/əw/ &amp;rarr; [uː]}}
:{{IPA|/Cʲə/ &amp;rarr; [Ci]}} and {{IPA|/əj/ &amp;rarr; [iː]}}

Other, more complex vowels have been noted as allophones: {{IPA|/ajəwʃqʼa/}} ('you did it') can become {{IPA|[ayʃqʼa]}}, for instance. On occasion, [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] sonorants (particularly {{IPA|/n/}}) may even decay into [[nasal vowel|vowel nasality]]. For instance, {{IPA|/najnʃʷ/}} ('young man') has been noted as {{IPA|[nɛ̃jʃʷ]}} as well as {{IPA|[najnʃʷ]}}.

The vowel {{IPA|/a/}} appears initially very frequently, particularly in the function of the [[definite article]]. {{IPA|/ə/}} is extremely restricted initially, appearing only in [[ditransitive verb]] forms where all three arguments are [[grammatical person|third person]], e.g. {{IPA|/əntʷən/}} ('he gave it to him') (normally {{IPA|/jəntʷən/}}). Even then, {{IPA|/ə/}} itself may be dropped to provide an even shorter form {{IPA|/ntʷən/}}.

Both vowels appear without restriction finally, although when {{IPA|/ə/}} is unstressed finally, it tends to be dropped: {{IPA|/tʷə/}} ('father') becomes the definite form {{IPA|/atʷ/}} ('the father'). In fact, the alternation between {{IPA|/ə/}} and zero is often not phonemic, and may be dropped root-internally as well: {{IPA|/maqʷəta/}} ~ {{IPA|/maqʷta/}} ('hoe'). This kind of allomorphy is called a [[zero allomorph]].

&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;'''Võ Cạnh inscription''' is the oldest [[Sanskrit]] [[Stele|inscription]] ever found in [[Southeast Asia]], discovered in 1885 in the village of Võ Cạnh, about 4&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[Nha Trang]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Keat"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA643&amp;dq=Vo-Canh+text&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix1p_U5aPVAhVHQLwKHfSwDd8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vo-Canh%20text&amp;f=false|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|last=Keat|first=Gin Ooi|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|edition=berilustrasi|volume=1|page=643|id=ISBN 1576077705, 9781576077702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=6kDm5d3cMIYC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Vo-Canh+text&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix1p_U5aPVAhVHQLwKHfSwDd8QuwUITzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Vo-Canh%20text&amp;f=false|title=Southeast Asia: From Prehistory to History|last=Glover|first=Ian|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|edition=Berilustrasi|page=219|id=ISBN 041529777X, 9780415297776}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inscription is in the form of a 2.5 m high stone stele, with three uneven sides inscribed with the inscription lines.

The inscription mentions the name of King [[Sri Mara]], which according to [[Palaeography|paleographic]] analysis was to whom it was erected by his descendants around 2nd or 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=ufOAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=Sri+Mara&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8oNeL46PVAhWMa7wKHcsUCBQQuwUILTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sri%20Mara&amp;f=false|title=Racial Synthesis in Hindu Culture|last=Viswanatha|first=S.V.|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|page=225|id=ISBN 1136384200, 9781136384202}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still debates whether the inscription was a legacy of [[Lâm Ấp]], [[Champa]], or [[Funan]].
[[George Cœdès|George Coedès]] mentioned the possibility of identifying Sri Mara with Fan Shih-man (c. 230 CE), which according to the Chinese chronicles was one of the rulers of Funan.&lt;ref name="Coedès"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Sri+Mara&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8oNeL46PVAhWMa7wKHcsUCBQQuwUIQTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Sri%20Mara&amp;f=false|title=The Indianized States of South-East Asia|last=Coedès|first=George|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1968|page=40-41|id=ISBN 082480368X, 9780824803681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coedès considered the Võ Cạnh inscription as proof of the first wave of [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianization in Southeast Asia]].

Currently, the inscription is stored in the [[National Museum of Vietnamese History]] in the city of [[Hanoi]], Vietnam.

The use of certain Sanskrit terms in the inscription text, according to Jean Filliozat, shows the possibility that [[Valmiki]]'s [[Ramayana]] epic was spread on the [[Indochina|Indochina peninsula]] at the time this inscription was made.

&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the editor of Rashtramat and Swatantra Hindustan during the freedom struggle of India.  He courted arrest and came to be known as Veer Wamanrao Joshi or Veer Vamanrao Joshi. He wrote the play 'RaNa-dundubhi', whose songs were made famous by Dinanath Mangeshkar.

Waman Gopal Joshi should not be confused with the writer Vaman Malhar Joshi. They were contemporaries.
