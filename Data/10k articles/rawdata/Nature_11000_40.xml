In [[Greek mythology]], '''Alseids''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|s|iː|ᵻ|d|z}}; Ἀλσηΐδες) were the [[nymph]]s of [[glens]] and [[grove (nature)|groves]]. Of the [[Classics|Classical]] writers, the first and perhaps only poet to reference ''alseids'' is [[Homer]]. Rather than ''alseid'' he used the spelling ''alsea''. The three uses of ''alsea'' by Homer are as follows:

"The nymphs who live in the lovely groves (ἄλσεα - alsea), and the springs of rivers (πηγαὶ ποταμῶν - pegai potamon) and the grassy meadows (πίσεα ποιήεντα - pisea poiëenta)."&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''[[Iliad]]'', 20.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

"They [nymphs] come from springs (krênai), they come from groves (alsea), they come from the sacred rivers (ποταμοί - potamoi) flowing seawards."&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''[[Odyssey]]'', 10.348.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The nymphs [of Mount Ida] who haunt the pleasant woods (alsea), or of those who inhabit this lovely mountain (ὄρος - oros) and the springs of rivers (pegai potamon) and grassy meads (pisea)."&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''[[Homeric Hymn|Homeric Hymn V To Aphrodite'']], 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantic horseshoe crab''' (''Limulus polyphemus''), also known as the '''American horseshoe crab''', is a species of [[marine biology|marine]] and [[brackish]] [[chelicerate]] [[arthropod]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Despite their name, [[horseshoe crab]]s are more closely related to [[spider]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[scorpion]]s than to [[crab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chliboyko, J. "Crabby Ancestors", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', April 2008, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This species is found in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and along the Atlantic coast of North America.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; A main area of annual [[Animal migration|migration]] is [[Delaware Bay]].&lt;ref name=delawareaudubon&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.delawareaudubon.org/birding/hscrab_redknot_may.html |title=Horseshoe crab spawning and red knot migration |accessdate=16 January 2017 | publisher=Delaware Audubon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their eggs were eaten by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],&lt;ref name=Zaldivar2009&gt;{{cite book | author1=Zaldívar-Rae, J. | author2=Sapién-Silva, R.E. | author3=Rosales-Raya, M. | author4=Brockmann, H.J. | year=2009 | chapter=American horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, in México: open possibilities | pages=97–113 | editor1=J.T.

==Names and classification==
[[File:Horseshoe crab with shells.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|Atlantic horseshoe crab with attached ''[[Crepidula]]'' shells on the [[Delaware Bay]] beach in Villas, New Jersey.]]
[[File:Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) (5).jpg|alt=Underside of living horseshoe crab|thumb|Underside view of a living male crab, showing the mouth, gills and legs]]
This group of animals is also known as '''horsefoot''', or '''saucepan'''. Some people call the horseshoe crab a "helmet crab", but this common name is more frequently applied to a true crab, a [[malacostracan]], of the species ''[[Telmessus cheiragonus]]''. The term "king crab" is sometimes used for horseshoe crabs, but it is more usually applied to a group of [[decapoda|decapod]] crustaceans.

''Limulus'' means "askew"&lt;ref name="Coast by Willie Heard"&gt;[http://www.marine.usf.edu/pjocean/packets/f01/f01u5p3.pdf Coast by Willie Heard]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''polyphemus'' refers to [[polyphemus|the giant in Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="Coast by Willie Heard"/&gt; It is based on the misconception that the animal had a single eye.

Former scientific names include ''Limulus cyclops'', ''Xiphosura americana'', and ''Polyphemus occidentalis''.

It is the tail that earns this order its name Xiphosura, which derives from the Greek for "sword tail".

Studies of [[microsatellite DNA]] have revealed several distinct geographic groups in the Atlantic horseshoe crab.

Horseshoe crabs have three main parts to the body: the head region, known as the "[[prosoma]]", the [[abdomen|abdominal]] region or "[[opisthosoma]]", and the spine-like tail or "[[telson]]". The smooth shell or [[carapace]] is shaped like a horseshoe, and is greenish grey to dark brown in colour. The sexes are similar in appearance, but females are typically 25 to 30% larger than the male in length and width, and can reach more than twice the weight.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0362-4331 | last = Angier | first = Natalie | title = Tallying the Toll on an Elder of the Sea | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = June 11, 2008 | date = June 10, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/science/10angi.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130929091006/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/science/10angi.html | archivedate=September 29, 2013&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCGov&gt;{{cite web | author1=Brad Floyd | author2=Larry DeLancey | url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/mrri/pubs/SCComplianceHSC2011.pdf |title=South Carolina Horseshoe Crab Fishery and Management Program Compliance Report for the Year 2011 | publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources | date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females can grow up to {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, including tail,&lt;ref name=WAZA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.waza.org/en/zoo/choose-a-species/invertebrates/other-aquatic-invertebrates/limulus-polyphemus |title=Horseshoe Crab (Limulus polyphemus) | publisher=[[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums|WAZA]] |accessdate=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|4.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref name=SCGov/&gt; There are also geographic differences: In the United States, there is a north–south [[Cline (biology)|cline]] in the size.

Horseshoe crabs possess the rare ability to [[regeneration (biology)|regrow lost limbs]], in a manner similar to [[sea stars]].&lt;ref name="ref to Schaller's discovery"&gt;{{cite news | author=Misty Edgecomb| title=Horseshoe Crabs Remain Mysteries to Biologists| newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]] (Maine), repr. [[National Geographic News]] | date=June 21, 2002 | page=2 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0621_020621_wirehorseshoecrab_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of marine species become attached to the carapace, including [[algae]], [[flat worm]]s, [[mollusk]]s, [[barnacle]]s, and [[bryozoan]]s, and horseshoe crabs have been described as 'walking museums' due to the number of organisms they can support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan M. Wells|author2=Robert M. Pyle|author3=N. Mark Collins|title=The IUCN Invertebrate Red Data Book|date=1983|publisher=IUCN|page=235|url=https://archive.org/stream/iucninvertebrate83well#page/234/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where ''Limulus'' is common, the shells, [[exoskeleton]]s or [[exuviae]] (molted shells) of horseshoe crabs frequently wash up on beaches, either as whole shells, or as disarticulated pieces.

The [[brain]] and the [[heart]] are located in the prosoma. On the underside of the prosoma, six pairs of appendages occur, the first of which (the small [[Pincer (biology)|pincer]]s or [[chelicerae]]) are used to pass food into the mouth, which is located in the middle of the underside of the [[cephalothorax]], between the chelicerae. Although most [[arthropod]]s have mandibles, the horseshoe crab is jawless.

The second pair of appendages, the pedipalps, are used as walking legs; in males they are tipped with 'claspers', which are used during mating to hold onto the female's carapace. The remaining four pairs of appendages are the 'pusher legs', also used in locomotion. The first four pairs of legs have claws, the last pair has a leaf-like structure used for pushing.&lt;ref name="md"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021120000901/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/education/horseshoecrab/anatomy.html Anatomy of the Horseshoe Crab], Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Retrieved 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opisthosoma bears a further six pairs of appendages; the first pair houses the genital pores, while the remaining five pairs are modified into flattened plates, known as [[book gill]]s, that allow them to breathe underwater, and can also allow them to breathe on land for short periods of time, provided the gills remain moist.

The telson (i.e., tail or caudal spine) is used to steer in the water and also to flip itself over if stuck upside down.

Among other senses, they have a small [[chemoreceptor]] organ that senses smells on the triangular area formed by the exoskeleton beneath the body near the ventral eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Juvenile ''Limulus polyphemus'' generate two water currents that contact one proven and one putative chemoreceptor organ |author1=Elizabeth Quinn |author2=Kristen Paradise  |author3=Jelle Atema  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=195 |issue=2 |year=1998 |pages=185–187 |jstor=1542829 |doi=10.2307/1542829|pmid=28570188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vision===
''Limulus'' has been extensively used in research into the physiology of [[visual system|vision]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The [[List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel prize in Medicine]] was awarded in 1967 in part for research performed on the horseshoe crab eye.

A large [[compound eye]] with monochromatic vision is found on each side of the prosoma;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Peak absorption is at 525&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Battelle2006/&gt; it has five simple eyes on the carapace, and two simple eyes on the underside, just in front of the mouth,&lt;ref name=Battelle2006/&gt; making a total of nine eyes. The simple eyes are probably important during the embryonic or larval stages of the organism,&lt;ref name=Battelle2006/&gt; and even unhatched embryos seem to be able to sense light levels from within their buried eggs.&lt;ref name=Harzsch2006/&gt; The less sensitive compound eyes, and the median ocelli, become the dominant sight organs during adulthood.&lt;ref name=Battelle2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2006.07.002 |date=December 2006 |author=Battelle, B.A. |title=The eyes of ''Limulus polyphemus'' (Xiphosura, Chelicerata) and their afferent and efferent projections |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=261–274 |pmid=18089075 |journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tail bears a series of light-sensing organs along its length.

Each compound eye is composed of about 1000 receptors called [[ommatidia]],&lt;ref name=md/&gt; complex structures consisting of upwards of 300 cells.&lt;ref name=Harzsch2006&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Harzsch |first1=S. |last2=Hafner |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=Evolution of eye development in arthropods: phylogenetic aspects |journal=[[Arthropod Structure &amp; Development]] |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=319–340 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2006.08.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1467803906000570 |pmid=18089079}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ommatidia are somewhat messily arranged, not falling into the ordered hexagonal pattern seen in more derived arthropods.&lt;ref name=Battelle2006/&gt; Each ommatidium feeds into a single [[nerve]] fiber. Furthermore, the nerves are large and relatively accessible. This made it possible for [[electrophysiology|electrophysiologists]] to record the nervous response to light stimulation easily, and to observe visual phenomena such as [[lateral inhibition]] working at the cellular level. More recently, behavioral experiments have investigated the functions of visual perception in ''Limulus''. [[Habituation]] and [[classical conditioning]] to light stimuli have been demonstrated, as has the use of brightness and shape information by males when recognizing potential mates.
{{Sea shell topics}}

The retinula (literally, "small retina") cells of the ommatidium of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny [[microvilli]] (tiny tubes extending out of the retinula) that interlock with neighboring retinular cells. This forms the [[rhabdom]], which contains the [[dendrite]] of the [[eccentric cell]], and may also contribute some microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric cell is the [[Bombyx mori|silkworm moth]]. Microvilli are composed of a double layer, 7&amp;nbsp;nm each and with 3.5&amp;nbsp;nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15&amp;nbsp;nm thick. In all arthropods, there is always a rhabdom below a crystalline cone, on or near the center of the ommatidium, and always aligned with the path of light. At right angles to the length of the rhabdome are the length of the microvilli, which are in line with each other. The microvilli are about 40–150&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;"Photoreception" ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology'', vol. 13, p. 461 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood===

The blood of horseshoe crabs (as well as that of most [[mollusks]], including [[cephalopods]] and [[gastropod]]s) contains the [[copper]]-containing [[protein]] [[hemocyanin]] at concentrations of about 50 g per liter.&lt;ref name = "AHC 2004 p276-7"/&gt; These creatures do not have [[hemoglobin]] ([[iron]]-containing protein), which is the basis of [[oxygen]] transport in [[vertebrate]]s. Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The [[blood]] in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow,&lt;ref name = "AHC 2004 p276-7"&gt;{{cite book

The blood of horseshoe crabs contains one type of blood cell, the [[amebocyte]]s. These play an important role in the defense against [[pathogen]]s. Amebocytes contain granules with a [[clotting factor]] known as coagulogen; this is released outside the cell when bacterial [[endotoxin]] is encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mürer|first1=EH|last2=Levin|first2=J|last3=Holme|first3=R|title=Isolation and studies of the granules of the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus, the horseshoe crab|journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology|date=December 1975|volume=86|issue=3 Pt 1|pages=533–42|pmid=413|doi=10.1002/jcp.1040860310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[coagulation]] is thought to contain [[bacterial infection]]s in the animal's semiclosed [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 September 2014|title=The Rabbit and the Horse Shoe Crab|url=http://www.wakopyrostar.com/blog/post/the-rabbit-and-the-horse-shoe-crab/|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlantic horseshoe crabs are found along the Atlantic [[East Coast of the United States]], ranging from [[Maine]] to Florida. In the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], they are found in Florida, [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Outside the United States, the only breeding population is in Mexico's [[Yucatán Peninsula]], where found on western, northern and eastern coasts.&lt;ref name=Zaldivar2009/&gt; Individuals rarely appear outside the breeding range, with a few records from the Atlantic coast of Canada ([[Nova Scotia]]), [[the Bahamas]], [[Cuba]] and the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] ([[Texas]] and [[Veracruz]]).&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zaldivar2009/&gt; There have been attempts of [[Introduced species|introducing]] it to Texas, [[California]] and the southern [[North Sea]], but these all failed to become established.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Records from Europe, [[Israel]] and Western Africa are considered releases/escapees of captives.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

Atlantic horseshoe crabs range from shallow coastal habitats such as lagoons, [[estuaries]] and [[mangrove]] to depths of more than {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on}} offshore.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; There are indications that they prefer depths shallower than {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.horseshoecrab.org/nh/habitat.html |title=Habitat Considerations | publisher=horseshoecrab.org |accessdate=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature preference varies depending on the population, with the northernmost being the most cold-resistant: In the [[Great Bay (New Hampshire)|Great Bay in New Hampshire]] they show increased activity above {{convert|10.5|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and in Delaware Bay they are active above {{convert|15|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In contrast, these northern populations do not tolerate as warm temperatures as southern populations of the species.&lt;ref name=Sekiguchi2009/&gt; Atlantic horseshoe crabs can be seen in waters that range from [[brackish]] (almost [[fresh water]]) to [[hypersaline]] (almost twice the salinity of [[sea water]]), but their optimum growth is at salinities around or slightly below sea water (20–40‰).&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehlinger2011&gt;{{cite web | author=G.

The crab feeds on [[mollusk]]s, [[annelid]] worms, other benthic [[invertebrate]]s, and bits of fish. Lacking jaws, it grinds up the food with bristles on its legs and a [[gizzard]] that contains sand and gravel.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The breeding season varies. Northern populations (all in the United States, except those in southern Florida) generally breed from the spring to the autumn, while southern populations (southern Florida and Yucatán Peninsula) breed year-round.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In the north, breeding is triggered by a temperature increase, but this is reversed in the Yucatán Peninsula, the southernmost population, where decreasing temperatures stimulate breeding.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In [[Massachusetts]], horseshoe crabs spend the winters on the [[continental shelf]] and emerge at the shoreline in late spring to spawn, with the males arriving first. The smaller male grabs on to the back of a female with a "boxing glove" like structure on his front claws, often holding on for months at a time. Often several males will hold on to a single female.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; Females reach the beach at high tide.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; After the female has laid a batch of eggs in a nest at a depth of {{convert|15-20|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} in the sand, the male or males fertilize them with their sperm.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; Egg quantity is dependent on the female's body size, and ranges from 15,000 to 64,000 eggs per female.&lt;ref name="Leschen et al."&gt;{{cite journal | author=Leschen, A.

"Development begins when the first egg cover splits and new membrane, secreted by the embryo, forms a transparent spherical capsule" (Sturtevant).{{incomplete citation|date=June 2018}} The larvae form and then swim for about five to seven days. After swimming, they settle, and begin the first molt. This occurs about 20 days after the formation of the egg capsule. As young horseshoe crabs grow, they move to deeper waters, where molting continues. Before becoming sexually mature around age 9, they have to shed their shells some 17 times.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In the first 2–3 years of their life, the juveniles stay in shallow coastal waters near the breeding beaches.&lt;ref name=Zaldivar2009/&gt; [[Longevity]] is difficult to assess, but the average lifespan is thought to be 20–40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/horseshoe-crab/limulus-polyphemus/info.html |publisher=[[ARKive]] |title=Horseshoe crab (''Limulus polyphemus'') |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from the University of New Hampshire gives insight into the [[circadian rhythm]] of Atlantic horseshoe crabs. For example, several studies have looked into the effect of a circa [[Tide|tidal]] rhythm on the locomotion of this species. While it has been known for a while that a circadian clock system controls eye sensitivity, scientists discovered a separate clock system for locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chabot|first=CC|author2=Watson, Win III|title=Circatidal rhythms of locomotion in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus: Underlying mechanisms and cues that influence them|journal=Current Zoology|year=2010|volume=56|issue=5|pages=499–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a sample of Atlantic horseshoe crabs were exposed to artificial tidal cycles in the lab, circa tidal rhythms were observed. The study found that light and dark cycles influence locomotion, but not as much as tidal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chabot|first=CC|author2=Watson, Win III|title=Artificial tides synchronize circatidal rhythms of locomotion in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus|journal=The Biological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=215|issue=1|pages=24–25|doi=10.2307/25470681|pmid=18723635|jstor=25470681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Horseshoe crabs were traditionally grouped with the extinct [[Eurypterus|eurypterids]] (sea scorpions) as the Merostomata. However, recent studies suggest a relationship between the eurypterids and the [[arachnid]]s, leaving Xiphosura in the [[clade]] [[Prosomapoda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamsdell|first=James C.|date=2012-12-18|title=Revised systematics of Palaeozoic ‘horseshoe crabs’ and the myth of monophyletic Xiphosura|url=https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article-abstract/167/1/1/2420794|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=167|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00874.x|issn=0024-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have evolved in the shallow seas of the [[Paleozoic]] Era (570–248 million years ago) with other primitive [[arthropod]]s like the [[trilobite]]s. The four species of horseshoe crab are the only remaining members of the [[Xiphosura]], one of the oldest classes of marine arthropods.

The extinct diminutive horseshoe crab, ''[[Lunataspis|Lunataspis aurora]]'', {{convert|4|cm|in|}} from head to tail-tip, has been identified in 445-million-year-old [[Ordovician]] strata in [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,326712,00.html |publisher=[[Fox News]] |title=Ancient horseshoe crabs get even older |date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horseshoe crabs are often referred to as [[living fossil]]s, as they have changed little in the last 445 million years.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Forms almost identical to this species were present during the [[Triassic]] period 230 million years ago, and similar species were present in the [[Devonian]], 400 million years ago.

Horseshoe crabs are valuable as a species to the medical research community, and in medical testing. The above-mentioned clotting reaction of the animal's blood is used in the widely used [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate|''Limulus'' amebocyte lysate]] (LAL) test to detect bacterial [[endotoxin]]s in pharmaceuticals and to test for several bacterial diseases.&lt;ref name="Coast by Willie Heard"/&gt;

Enzymes from horseshoe crab blood are used by [[astronauts]] in the [[International Space Station]] to test surfaces for unwanted [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/06feb_locad.htm?list208263 |title=Astronauts Swab the Deck |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and management==
Overall the Atlantic horseshoe crab is recognized as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[IUCN]] due primarily to [[overharvesting]] and [[habitat loss]]. There are, however, significant geographic differences with some populations increasing, some stable and some declining.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Horseshoe crab harvest, Delaware, 1928.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Horseshoe crab harvest, Delaware, circa 1926. Millions of crabs were harvested for fertilizer around [[Delaware Bay]]. Some were fed to hogs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/the-blood-harvest/284078/ The Blood Harvest], The Atlantic magazine, Feb. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Loggerhead Sea Turtle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[loggerhead sea turtle]] has suffered from the reduction in numbers of Atlantic horseshoe crabs]]

Early in the 20th century and possibly before, there was the mistaken belief in some areas that horseshoe crabs were destructive to fisheries, folklore held that they used their long spines to drill into some shellfish.  Because of this mistaken belief and folklore, bounties were sometimes offered by authorities for them.  On [[Cape Cod]] in the early 20th century five cents was offered for every dead horseshoe crab turned in.

The Atlantic horseshoe crab is not presently [[Endangered species|endangered]], but harvesting and [[habitat destruction]] have reduced its numbers at some locations and caused some concern for this animal's future. Since the 1970s, the horseshoe crab population has been decreasing in some areas, due to several factors, including the use of the crab as bait in [[eel]], [[whelk]] and [[conch]] trapping.
[[File:Red knot horseshoe crab feeding.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Red knots feeding on horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware]]
Conservationists have also voiced concerns about the declining population of [[Wader|shorebirds]], such as [[red knot]]s, which rely heavily on the horseshoe crabs' eggs for food during their spring [[Bird migration|migration]]. Precipitous declines in the population of the red knots have been observed in recent years. Predators of horseshoe crabs, such as the currently threatened [[Atlantic loggerhead turtle]], have also suffered as crab populations diminish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1995, the nonprofit Ecological Research and Development Group (ERDG) was founded with the aim of preserving the four remaining species of horseshoe crab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ERDG|url=http://www.horseshoecrab.org/misc/erdg.html|website=horseshoecrab.org|publisher=ERDG|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the ERDG has made significant contributions to horseshoe crab conservation. ERDG founder Glenn Gauvry designed a mesh bag for whelk/conch traps, to prevent other species from removing the bait. This has led to a decrease in the amount of bait needed by approximately 50%. In the state of [[Virginia]], these mesh bags are mandatory in whelk/conch fishery. The [[Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission]] in 2006 considered several conservation options, among them being a two-year ban on harvesting the animals, affecting both Delaware and New Jersey shores of [[Delaware Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Molly Murray |title=Seafood dealer wants to harvest horseshoe crabs (''subtitle: Regulators look at 2-year ban on both sides of Delaware Bay'') |publisher=[[The News Journal]] |pages=B1, B6 |date=May 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, Delaware Superior Court Judge Richard Stokes has allowed limited harvesting of 100,000 males. He ruled that while the crab population was seriously depleted by overharvesting through 1998, it has since stabilized, and that this limited take of males will not adversely affect either horseshoe crab or red knot populations. In opposition, Delaware environmental secretary John Hughes concluded that a decline in the red knot bird population was so significant that extreme measures were needed to ensure a supply of crab eggs when the birds arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |title = Horseshoe Crabs in Political Pinch Over Bird's Future / Creature is Favored Bait On Shores of Delaware; Red Knot Loses in Court | pages = A1, A10 | date = June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = [[Charlotte Observer]] |agency = Associated Press |title = Judge dumps horseshoe crab protection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting of the crabs was banned in New Jersey March 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Philly Burbs.Com]] |agency=Associated Press |title=NJ to ban horseshoe crabbing... |url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/104-03252008-1508360.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090116021450/http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/104-03252008-1508360.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, about 10% of the horseshoe crab breeding population dies when rough surf flips the creatures onto their backs, a position from which they often cannot right themselves. In response, the ERDG launched a "Just Flip 'Em" campaign, in the hopes that beachgoers will simply turn the crabs back over.&lt;!-- [[Just Flip 'Em]] and [[Just Flip Em]] redirect here --&gt;

A large-scale project to tag and count horseshoe crabs along the North American coast was underway in the spring and summer of 2008, termed projectlimulus.org.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
Due to the lack of information and knowledge regarding horseshoe crab populations, the management policies lack any abundance of rules and regulations. To implement management policies for the species, more population information needs to be obtained.&lt;ref name="asmfc-horseshoe crab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asmfc.org/horseshoeCrab.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040427224557/http://www.asmfc.org/horseshoeCrab.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 27, 2004 |title=Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission: Horseshoe Crab  |accessdate=June 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
Since 1994, the populations in the Yucatán Peninsula have been recognized as endangered under Mexican law. They have declined since the 1960s and remaining significant Yucatán populations are mostly within protected areas.&lt;ref name=Zaldivar2009/&gt;

The '''Biblical Museum of Natural History''', currently located in the northern industrial zone of [[Beit Shemesh]], [[Israel]], was founded in 2014 by [[Natan Slifkin]], affectionately referred to as the "Zoo Rabbi."

==Vision and purpose==
The establishment describe itself as "part natural history museum, part zoo" and is meant to "enhance the appreciation and understanding of biblical scripture and Jewish tradition via the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Action'' [https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/03/2015/off-beaten-track-biblical-museum-natural-history/ On and Off the Beaten Track in...the Biblical Museum of Natural History], March 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors are able to gain insight into the animals that lived in Israel during biblical times even if they no longer exist there now, such as bears and crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;''JNS.org'' [http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/2/27/hippos-in-israel-new-museum-re-animates-forgotten-biblical-wildlife#.VUHLEJNtFjY= Hippos in Israel?

Visitors to the museum are currently directed by special tour by appointment only.  Features include live animal, [[taxidermy]] and skeleton exhibits, as well as audio/visual presentations.  Tour topics include unraveling incidents of misidentification of animals by biblical scholars of species mentioned in both the [[Five Books of Moses]] and the [[Talmud]] due to their lack of familiarity with different families that are not represented in places like Europe, where much of the Jewish medieval biblical commentary was written.

==History==
In 2017 the Museum held a "Feast of Exotic Curiosities," at which foods including locusts, guineafowl, and [[water buffalo]], that are described as kosher in the Bible but rarely served, were prepared by chef [[Moshe Basson]] of [[The Eucalyptus]], a restaurateur known for his contemporary preparations of biblical foods.&lt;ref name="RudeeCuriosities"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rudee |first1=Eliana |title=Biblical Scripture Comes Alive in Feast of Ancient Exotic Curiosities |url=https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/95805/exotic-biblical-feast-seeks-recreate-god-ordained-ties-man-beast-photos/ |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Israel News |date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complementary text==
Slifkin has authored the first volume of what will be a large collection of information related to the interplay of Judaism and zoology entitled ''The Torah Encyclopedia of the Animal Kingdom''.  The encyclopedia will attempt to cover all animals mentioned in the Jewish scripture and highlight little known historical facts such as population diversity and habitation during biblical times.&lt;ref&gt;''JewishStandard.com'' [http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/where-the-wild-things-are/ Where the Wild Things Are], July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar glory and Spectre of the Brocken from GGB on 07-05-2011.jpg|thumb|200px|A Brocken spectre within a [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]]'s rings]]

A '''Brocken spectre''' ({{lang-de|Brockengespenst}}), also called '''Brocken bow''' or '''mountain spectre''', is the magnified (and apparently enormous) [[shadow]] of an observer cast upon clouds [[antisolar point|opposite of]] the Sun's direction. The figure's head is often surrounded by the [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]-like rings of coloured light forming a [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], which appears opposite of the Sun's direction when uniformly-sized water droplets in clouds refract and [[backscatter]] [[sunlight]].

The phenomenon can appear on any misty mountainside or cloud bank, even when seen from an aeroplane, but the frequent fogs and low-altitude accessibility of the [[Brocken]], a peak in the [[Harz Mountains]] in [[Germany]], have created a local legend from which the phenomenon draws its name. The Brocken spectre was observed and described by [[Johann Silberschlag]] in 1780, and has since been recorded often in literature about the region.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Brocken Spectre at California Place.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A semi-artificial Brocken spectre created by standing in front of the headlight of a car, on a foggy night.]]
[[Image:Night spectre of the brocken.jpg|thumb|Another night Brocken spectre created by high lights of a car.]]
The "spectre" appears when the sun shines from behind the observer, who is looking down from a ridge or peak into [[mist]] or [[fog]]. The light projects their shadow through the mist, often in a triangular shape due to [[perspective (visual)|perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/globrock.htm|title=Brocken spectre|work=atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent magnification of size of the shadow is an [[optical illusion]] that occurs when the observer judges his or her shadow on relatively nearby clouds to be at the same distance as faraway land objects seen through gaps in the clouds, or when there are no reference points by which to judge its size. The shadow also falls on [[drop (liquid)|water droplets]] of varying distances from the eye, confusing [[depth perception]]. The ghost can appear to move (sometimes suddenly) because of the movement of the cloud layer and variations in density within the cloud.

==References in popular culture and the arts==

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "Constancy to an Ideal Object" concludes with an image of the Brocken spectre:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
And art thou nothing? Such thou art, as when
The woodman winding westward up the glen
At wintry dawn, where o'er the sheep-track's maze
The viewless snow-mist weaves a glist'ning haze,
Sees full before him, gliding without tread,
An image with a glory round its head;
The enamoured rustic worships its fair hues,
Nor knows he makes the shadow he pursues!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lewis Carroll's "[[Phantasmagoria (poem)|Phantasmagoria]]" includes a line about a Spectre who "...tried the Brocken business first/but caught a sort of chill/so came to England to be nursed/and here it took the form of thirst/which he complains of still."

[[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''[[Fiasco (novel)|Fiasco]]'' (1986) has a reference to the "Brocken Specter" (sic): "He was alone. He had been chasing himself. Not a common phenomenon, but known even on Earth. The Brocken Specter in the Alps, for example." The situation, of pursuing one's self, via a natural illusion is a repeated theme in Lem. A scene of significance in his book ''[[The Investigation]]'' (1975) depicts a detective who, within the confines of a snowy, dead-end ally, confronts a man who turns out to be the detective's own reflection, "The stranger... was himself. He was standing in front of a huge mirrored wall marking the end of the arcade."

In ''The Radiant Warrior'' (1989), part of Leo Frankowski's [[Leo Frankowski#Conrad Stargard series|Conrad Stargard series]], the protagonist uses the Brocken Spectre to instill confidence in his recruits.

The Brocken spectre is a key trope in [[Paul Beatty]]'s ''[[The White Boy Shuffle]]'' (1996), in which a character, Nicholas Scoby, declares that his dream (he specifically calls it a "Dream and a half, really") is to see his glory through a Brocken spectre (69).

In [[James Hogg]]'s novel ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' (1824) the Brocken spectre is used to suggest psychological horror.
[[File:Glory of the Pilot.jpg|thumb|Shadow of an airplane cast by the sun on nearby clouds]]
[[Carl Jung]] in ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... I had a dream which both frightened and encouraged me. It was night in some unknown place, and I was making slow and painful headway against a mighty wind. Dense fog was flying along everywhere. I had my hands cupped around a tiny light which threatened to go out at any moment... Suddenly I had the feeling that something was coming up behind me. I looked back, and saw a gigantic black figure following me... When I awoke I realized at once that the figure was a "specter of the Brocken," my own shadow on the swirling mists, brought into being by the little light I was carrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |author1-link=Carl Jung |first1=Carl |last1=Jung |first2=Aniela |last2=Jaffé |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage |page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Geli Tripping and Slothrop make "god-shadows" from a Harz precipice, as [[Walpurgisnacht]] wanes to dawn. Additionally, the French–Canadian quadruple agent Rémy Marathe muses episodically about the possibility of witnessing the fabled spectre on the mountains of Tucson in [[David Foster Wallace]]'s novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

The explorer [[Eric Shipton]] saw a Brocken Spectre during his first ascent of Nelion on [[Mount Kenya]] with [[Percy Wyn-Harris]] and Gustav Sommerfelt in 1929. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then the towering buttresses of Batian and Nelion appeared; the rays of the setting sun broke through and, in the east, sharply defined, a great circle of rainbow colours framed our own silhouettes. It was the only perfect Brocken Spectre I have ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=That Untravelled World |author1-link=Eric Shipton |first1=Eric |last1=Shipton |year=1969 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |pages=55–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[progressive metal]] band [[Fates Warning]] makes numerous references to the Brocken Spectre in both their debut album title ''[[Night on Bröcken]]'' and in lyrics on a subsequent song called "The Sorceress" from the album ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]'' that read "Through the Brocken Spectre rose a luring Angel."

The design of Kriemhild Gretchen, a Witch in the anime series ''[[Puella Magi Madoka Magica]]'', may have been inspired by the Brocken spectre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Kriemhild_Gretchen|title=Kriemhild Gretchen|work=puella-magi.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Little Dorrit]]'', Book II Chapter 23, Flora Finching, in the course of one of her typically free-associative babbles to Mr Clennam, says " ... ere yet Mr F appeared a misty shadow on the horizon paying attentions like the well-known spectre of some place in Germany beginning with a B ... "

"Brocken Spectre" is the title of a track on [[David Tipper]]'s 2010 album ''[[Broken Soul Jamboree]]''.

In the manga and anime ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger]]'', Brocken Spectres were one of the enemies that Gosei Angels must face.

In the manga [[One Piece]], Brocken spectres make an appearance in the sky island arc.

In addition, there are private conservation areas and other [[easement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calands.org/|title=California Protected Areas Data Portal|author=|date=|website=www.calands.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They include almost one-third of [[California]]'s scenic [[coastline]], including  [[coastal wetland]]s, [[estuaries]], [[beach]]es, and [[dune]] systems. The California [[State park|State Parks]] system alone has 270 units and covers 1.3 million acres (5,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with over 280 miles (450&amp;nbsp;km) of coastline, 625 miles (1,006&amp;nbsp;km) of lake and river frontage, nearly 18,000 campsites, and 3,000 miles (5,000&amp;nbsp;km) of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails.

Obtaining an accurate total of all protected land in California and elsewhere is a complex task. Many parcels have [[inholding]]s, private lands within the protected areas, which may or may not be accounted for when calculating total area. Also, occasionally one parcel of land is included in two or more inventories. Over 90% of Yosemite National Park for example, is listed both as wilderness by the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]], and as national park land by the [[National Park Service]]. The [[Cosumnes River Preserve]] is an extreme example, owned and managed by a handful of public agencies and private landowners, including the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[Sacramento County|County of Sacramento]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]].  Despite the difficulties, the CPAD gives the total area of protected land at {{convert|49253020|acre|km2}}, or 47.01% of the state (not including easements); a considerable amount for the most populous state in the country.

==National Park System==
{{main|List of areas in the National Park System of the United States|List of National Parks of the United States|List of National Monuments of the United States}}
The U.S. [[National Park System]] controls a large and diverse group of California parks, monuments, recreation areas and other units which in total exceed {{convert|6240000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/stats/acreagemenu.cfm |title=NPS Public Use Statistics Office: Acreage Reports |work=National Park Service |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known is [[Yosemite National Park]], noted for several iconic natural features including [[Yosemite Falls]], [[El Capitan]] and [[Half Dome]], which is displayed on the reverse side of the [[:Image:California quarter, reverse side, 2005.jpg|California state quarter]]. Other prominent parks are the [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]]-[[Sequoia National Park]] complex, [[Redwood National Park]], [[Channel Islands National Park]], [[Joshua Tree National Park]] and the largest, [[Death Valley National Park]]. The NPS also administers the [[Manzanar]] National Historic Site in [[Inyo County]].

National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a designation for certain protected areas of the United States managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Wildlife Refuge System is an extensive system of public lands and waters set aside to conserve America's fish, wildlife and plants. Many of the state's refuges are important stops and destinations for millions of migrating birds along the [[Pacific Flyway]] corridor. One, the [[Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area]], has the highest density of waterfowl in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/sacramentovalleyrefuges/r_butte.html |title=Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area |work=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=2010-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522123026/http://www.fws.gov/sacramentovalleyrefuges/r_butte.html |archivedate=2010-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 38 units in the refuge system in California, including both wildlife refuges and wildlife management areas, divided into 9 different regional areas.

==State Forests==
{{main|List of California state forests|l1=List of California state forests}}

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) operates eight Demonstration State Forests totaling 71,000 acres. The forests represent the most common forest types in the state. The State Forests grow approximately 75 million board feet of timber annually and harvest an average of 30 million board feet each year, enough to build 3,000 single-family homes. Revenue from these harvests fund the management of the State Forests. In addition, the forests provide research and demonstration opportunities for natural resource management, while providing public recreation opportunities, fish and wildlife habitat, and watershed protection. Activities include: experimental timber harvesting techniques, watershed restoration, mushroom collecting, hunting, firewood gathering, cone collecting for seed, a variety of university research projects, horseback riding, camping, mountain biking, and hiking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fire.ca.gov/resource_mgt/resource_mgt_stateforests |title=Cal Fire Demonstration State Forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8662">[[File:Christmas tree stand from Vienna.jpg|thumb|right|An Austrian Christmas tree stand, just one of the various existing styles]]
A '''Christmas tree stand''' is an object designed to support a cut, natural or an [[artificial Christmas tree]]. Christmas tree stands appeared as early as 1876 and have had various designs over the years. Those stands designed for natural trees have a water-well, which, in many cases may not hold enough water to adequately supply the cut tree. Some specialty Christmas tree stands have value on the secondary antiques market.

==History==
Christmas tree stands have been around at least since 1876, when ''Arthur's Illustrated Home Magazine'' suggested connecting a Christmas tree stand into a stand for flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arthur|first=T S|date=1876|volume=44|journal=[[Arthur's Lady's Home Magazine]]|pages=288|publisher=[[T.S. Arthur &amp; Sons]]|title=A Wee Bit Garden|accessdate=22 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzAZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=%22Christmas+tree+stand%22+date:0-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Hermann Albrecht of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] received {{US patent|183,100}} and {{US patent|183,194}}as two of the first Christmas tree stand patents issued in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RS=CCL%2F248%2F524&amp;Query=CCL%2F248%2F524&amp;TD=284&amp;Srch1=248%2F524.CCLS.&amp;StartAt=Jump+To&amp;StartNum=284 patft.uspto.gov]. Accessed December 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, carpenter Edward Smith suggested a homemade Christmas tree stand, noting, [[File:ChristmasTreeStand1919.PNG|200px|right|thumb|1919 bottle-shaped Christmas-tree stand configured to be weighted by water or sand to support the tree.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;As Christmas is near at hand, I will tell how I made a pretty stand for a Christmas tree: I took a board 14x14 inches, and one inch thick around this I made a tiny [[wiktionary:paling|paling]] fence — there is a post at each corner set firmly Into a 1/4-inch hole, and a gate at the middle of one side with little posts, the same as at the corner. The palings are about 1/8-inch thick, and 1/2 inch wide, and the cross pieces are just a little thicker. The best tacks I could find for tacking the palings to the cross-pieces were pins cut in two, using only the head ends. I then painted the fence white, and the board grass-green. In the center of this Is a hole into which to fasten the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Edward|date=1892|volume=30|title=Christmas-Tree Stand, etc.|journal=American Bee Journal|pages=830|publisher=[[Dadant &amp; Sons]]|isbn=|accessdate=22 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2JaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA830&amp;dq=%22Christmas+tree+stand%22+date:0-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1919, an American monthly magazine [[Popular Science]] touted a new type of Christmas-tree stand.&lt;ref name="Prevents"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 1917|journal=[[Popular Science]]|title=A New Christmas-Tree Stand That Prevents the Tree from Tipping|volume=91|issue=6|chapter=|pages=874|publisher=[[Bonnier Corporation]]|issn=0161-7370|quote=|accessdate=22 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA874&amp;dq=%22Christmas+tree+stand%22+date:1910-1920|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stand featured a broad, cone-shaped base that included an inlet for water and the Christmas tree trunk.&lt;ref name="Prevents"/&gt; Water placed in the galvanized iron shell would give considerable weight to the stand to steady the tree. Once the tree trunk was inserted into the water inlet, the tree would be kept fresh and green much longer than without the water supply.&lt;ref name="Prevents"/&gt;

==Design==
Christmas tree stands designed for natural [[Christmas tree]]s often have a water-well in them; natural trees require water so that they do not dry out.&lt;ref name=sandbeck&gt;Sandbeck, Ellen. ''Organic Housekeeping: In Which the Nontoxic Avenger Shows You how to Improve Your Health and that of Your Family While You Save Time, Money, And, Perhaps Your Sanity'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RIzcIEqrd8EC&amp;pg=PA332&amp;dq=christmas+tree+stand&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA332,M1 Google Books]), Simon and Schuster, 2006, p. 332, ({{ISBN|0743256204}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, growers state that the secret to long-lived natural Christmas tree is a lot of water, so often they recommend a tree stand that has a large water reservoir.&lt;ref name=boston&gt;Keene, Cindy Atoji. "[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/12/21/at_the_root_of_a_christmas_tradition/ At the root of a Christmas tradition]", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', December 21, 2008, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington State University]] [[plant pathology|plant pathologist]] Gary Chastagner conducted research into various models of Christmas tree stands and found that just six of 22 different stands tested had adequate water capacity for Christmas trees larger than 4 inches in diameter.&lt;ref name=wsu&gt;Fleenor, Denny. "[http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/reportertools/news/2003/better-christmas-2003-12.html A Better Christmas Tree and Tree Safety Tips] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208031914/http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/reportertools/news/2003/better-christmas-2003-12.html |date=2008-12-08 }}", ''[[Washington State University]]'': Marketing and News Service, December 10, 2003, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Christmas tree stands are manufactured for the specific purpose, one example would be a makeshift Christmas tree stand made from an old two-gallon bucket or can.&lt;ref name=dudley&gt;Dudley, Joseph Iron Eye. ''Choteau Creek: A Sioux Reminiscence'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=J3hjisAKJawC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=christmas+tree+stand&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), University of Nebraska Press, 1998, p. 27, ({{ISBN|0803266111}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a homemade-type Christmas tree stand is a converted [[cast iron]] garden urn.&lt;ref name=suntimes&gt;Garrity, Mary Carol. "[http://searchchicago.suntimes.com/homes/news/1316309,HOS-News-style07.article Decorate Christmas tree like a pro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208075811/http://searchchicago.suntimes.com/homes/news/1316309%2CHOS-News-style07.article |date=2008-12-08 }}", [[Scripps Howard News Service]] via ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', December 7, 2008, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tree stands==
Christmas tree stands sometimes had a more specialized role when it came to [[aluminum Christmas trees]]. The common method of illumination for these artificial Christmas trees was a floor-based "color wheel" which was placed under the tree.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; The color wheel featured varyingly colored segments on a clear plastic wheel, when switched on the wheel rotated and a light shone through the clear plastic casting an array of colors throughout the tree's metallic branches.&lt;ref name=oaktrib&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_/ai_n17077978 A dark family secret: the artificial Christmas tree]", ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', December 24, 2006, via [[findarticles.com]], accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this spectacle was enhanced by a rotating Christmas tree stand.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;Lukas, Paul. "[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2004/12/01/8192187/index.htm Trees Made of Tinsel]", ''[[Money Magazine]]'', via CNNMoney.com December 1, 2004, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary value==
Some Christmas tree stands were uniquely designed and have value in the secondary antiques market. One example is a 1950s decorative Christmas tree stand designed by National Outfit Manufacturers Association and made of [[lithograph]]ed tin and featuring a holiday design. A Christmas tree stand such of the lithographed [[tin]] design could fetch up to $250 on the open market.&lt;ref name=countryliving&gt;Staff.

The '''Clean Energy Act 2011''' was an Act of the [[Australian Parliament]], the main Act in a package of legislation that established an Australian [[emissions trading scheme]] (ETS), to be preceded by a three-year period of fixed [[carbon pricing in Australia]] designed to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00778/Html/Text#_Toc366829959|title=National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Regulations 2008 – F2013C00778}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of efforts to combat [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[Australian Government]] 
|date=2 September 2011  
|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The package was introduced by the [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor Government]] in February 2011 and was repealed by the [[Abbott Government]] on 17 July 2014, backdated to 1 July 2014.

==History==

===Rudd Government===
The [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor Government]]'s legislation followed unsuccessful efforts by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor Government]] to secure passage of an ETS through the Australian Parliament. In opposition, Rudd had called climate change "the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time" and called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/rule-of-reckless-vows/story-e6frg6zo-1111118413753?from=public_rss|title=Rule of reckless vows|author=Peter Van Onselen|journal=[[The Australian]]|date=27 December 2008|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the incumbent [[Howard Government]] and the [[Kevin Rudd|Rudd]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] opposition promised to implement an ETS before the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. Labor won the election, and the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd government]] began negotiating the passage of an ETS through Parliament.

The Opposition led by [[Brendan Nelson]] called for the vote on the government's ETS be delayed until after the United Nations climate change [[Copenhagen Climate Conference|summit in Copenhagen]] in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/coalition-to-amend-ets-to-aid-business-20090915-fp21.html | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Coalition to amend ETS 'to aid business' | date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudd said in response that it would be "an act of absolute political cowardice, an absolute failure of leadership not to act on climate change until other nations had done so" and the government pursued the early introduction of the Scheme.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2885204.htm |title=The 7.30 Report |publisher=ABC |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to secure the support of the [[Australian Greens]] for their preferred model, the government entered negotiations with the new Liberal Opposition Leader, Malcolm Turnbull, and in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference, developed an amended [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] (CPRS), with the support of Turnbull. Following a party revolt by Coalition members opposed to the Scheme, and shortly before the carbon vote, [[Tony Abbott]] challenged for the leadership of the Liberal Party and narrowly defeated Turnbull. Thereafter the Coalition opposed the ETS outright and the government was unable to secure the support of other Senators for its CPRS.

Abbott described Rudd's Emission Trading plan as a "Great big tax on everything" and opposed it. Abbott announced a new Coalition policy on carbon emission reduction in February, which committed the Coalition to a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020. Abbott proposed the creation of an 'emissions reduction fund' to provide 'direct' incentives to industry and farmers to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mclennan |first=David |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/abbott-announces-emissions-plan/1740219.aspx |title=Abbott announces emissions plan – Local News – News – General |work=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206014003/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/abbott-announces-emissions-plan/1740219.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the unsuccessful Copenhagen Conference, Rudd announced the deferral of the Scheme and elected not to take the matter to a [[double dissolution]] election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillham |first=Alexis |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/kevin-rudd-delays-plans-for-emissions-trading-scheme-until-2013/story-e6frf7jo-1225859004903 |title=Kevin Rudd delays plans for emissions trading scheme until 2013 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Rudd was replaced as leader of the Labor Party in an internal party leadership challenge and Julia Gillard became Prime Minister. Factional leader and key Gillard supporter [[Bill Shorten]] said that the sudden announcement of change of policy on the CPRS was a factor that had contributed to a collapse in support for Rudd's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2933046.htm |title=The Gillard Coup &amp;#124; Q&amp;A &amp;#124; ABC TV |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gillard Government===

Following her election as party leader, in various policy announcements in the lead up to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]], Prime Minister Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan gave assurances that no carbon tax would be introduced by a Gillard led government, but that a "citizens' assembly" would be called to sound out public support for a price on carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/election2010/7945914/pm-says-no-carbon-tax-under-her-govt |title=PM says no carbon tax under her govt |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Rodgers |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-23/gillard-heckled-at-climate-policy-launch/916910 |title=Gillard heckled at climate policy launch – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 election resulted in a [[hung parliament]] in which Gillard secured the support of the Greens and three independents to form a government. On 28 September, in a joint press conference with the Greens, Gillard announced that a citizens assembly would not be held and that instead a "multi-party climate change committee" consisting of Labor, Greens and Independent members, would examine the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/gillard-ups-the-ante-on-carbon-charge-20100927-15u5a.html |work=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne, Australia | title=Gillard names climate change committee – carbon tax possible | date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2011, in a joint press conference of the "Climate Change Committee" – comprising the Government, Greens and two independent MPs – Gillard announced a plan to legislate for the introduction of a fixed price to be imposed on "carbon pollution" from 1 July 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/gillard-to-reveal-climate-policy-today/story-e6frg6n6-1226011223441 | first1=Ben | last1=Packham | first2=James | last2=Massola | title=Australia to have carbon price from July 1, 2012, Julia Gillard announces | date=24 February 2011 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carbon tax in Australia|carbon tax]] would be placed for three to five years before a full emissions trading scheme is implemented, under a blueprint agreed by a multi-party parliamentary committee.&lt;ref&gt;(24 February 2011).

==Mechanism==
{{update|section|date=January 2013}}{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
{{main|Carbon pricing in Australia}}
The Act begins on 1 July 2012, and operates on a financial year basis. It is administered by the Clean Energy Regulator and the responsible Minister.  A carbon pollution cap limits the sum of: (a)     the total number of auctioned carbon units; and (b)     the total number of free carbon units issued in accordance with the Jobs and Competitiveness Program; and (c)  the total number of free carbon units issued to coal-fired electricity generators.If a person (including a corporation) is responsible for covered emissions of greenhouse gas from the operation of a facility, the facility's annual emissions are above a threshold, and the person does not surrender one eligible emissions unit for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalence of the gas, the person is liable to pay unit shortfall charge. The financial years beginning on 1 July 2012, 1 July 2013 and 1 July 2014 are fixed charge years (otherwise known in popular terms as the 'carbon tax').  In a fixed charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act for a fixed charge. Later financial years are flexible charge years which involve emissions trading. In a flexible charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act as the result of an auction plus by means of free allocation to coal fired generators and emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) industries. However, in the flexible charge years beginning on 1 July 2015, 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2017, some carbon units may be issued for a fixed charge (to act as a cap). Furthermore, free carbon units will be issued under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program (which deals with emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities).  Free carbon units will be issued to coal-fired electricity generators. If a carbon unit was not issued for a fixed charge, the unit is transferable. The Climate Change Authority will conduct periodic reviews of the Act.

=== Impacts ===
Under the scheme, around 500 entities will be required to buy permits for each tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted. Personal [[income tax]] will be reduced for those who earn less than $80,000 per year and the tax-free threshold increased from $6,000 to $18,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia | house=House of Representatives | date=12 October 2011 | page=11607 |speaker=[[Julia Gillard]] |position= Prime Minister }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that Clean Energy Future carbon price had not deterred new investment in the coal industry, as spending on exploration had increased by 62 percent in 2010–2011, more than any other mineral commodity. The government agency Geoscience Australia reported that investment in coal prospecting reached $520&amp;nbsp;million in 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Elastic energy''' is the potential mechanical [[energy]] stored in the configuration of a material or physical system as work is performed to distort its volume or shape.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Elastic energy occurs when objects are compressed and stretched, or generally deformed in any manner. [[Elasticity theory]] primarily develops formalisms for the mechanics of solid bodies and materials.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Elasticity |edition=3rd|last=Landau |first=L.D. |authorlink=Lev Landau |author2=Lifshitz, E. M. |authorlink2= Evgeny Lifshitz  |year=1986 |publisher=Butterworth Heinemann |location=Oxford, England |isbn=0-7506-2633-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note however, the work done by a stretched rubber band is not an example of elastic energy. It is an example of [[Ideal chain#Entropic elasticity of an ideal chain|entropic elasticity]].) The elastic potential energy equation is used in calculations of positions of [[mechanical equilibrium]]. The energy is potential as it will be converted into the second form of energy, such as [[kinetic energy|kinetic]]. Mathematically, the equation can be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac{1}{2}k \Delta x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

The essence of elasticity is reversibility. Forces applied to an elastic material transfer energy into the material which, upon yielding that energy to its surroundings, can recover its original shape.  However, all materials have limits to the degree of distortion they can endure without breaking or irreversibly altering their internal structure. Hence, the characterizations of solid materials include specification, usually in terms of strains, of its elastic limits.  Beyond the elastic limit, a material is no longer storing all of the energy from mechanical work performed on it in the form of elastic energy.

Elastic energy of or within a substance isstatic energy of configuration. It corresponds to energy stored principally by changing the inter-atomic distances between nuclei. [[Thermal energy]] is the randomized distribution of kinetic energy within the material, resulting in statistical fluctuations of the material about the equilibrium configuration. There is some interaction, however.  For example, for some solid objects, twisting, bending, and other distortions may generate thermal energy, causing the material's temperature to rise. Thermal energy in solids is often carried by internal elastic waves, called [[phonons]]. Elastic waves that are large on the scale of an isolated object usually produce macroscopic vibrations sufficiently lacking in randomization that their oscillations are merely the repetitive exchange between (elastic) potential energy within the object and the kinetic energy of motion of the object as a whole.

Although elasticity is most commonly associated with the mechanics of solid bodies or materials, even the early literature on classical thermodynamics defines and uses "elasticity of a fluid" in ways compatible with the broad definition provided in the Introduction above.&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Heat |edition=9th|last=Maxwell |first=J.C. |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell|editor=Peter Pesic |year=1888 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|location=Mineola, N.Y. |isbn=0-486-41735-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107 et seq.}}

Solids include complex crystalline materials with sometimes complicated behavior.  By contrast, the behavior of compressible fluids, and especially gases, demonstrates the essence of elastic energy with negligible complication. The simple thermodynamic formula: &lt;math&gt; dU = -P\,dV \ ,&lt;/math&gt; where dU is an infinitesimal change in recoverable internal energy ''U'', ''P'' is the uniform pressure (a force per unit area) applied to the material sample of interest, and ''dV'' is the infinitesimal change in volume that corresponds to the change in internal energy.  The minus sign appears because ''dV'' is negative under compression by a positive applied pressure which also increases the internal energy. Upon reversal, the work that is done ''by'' a system is the negative of the change in its internal energy corresponding to the positive ''dV'' of an increasing volume. In other words, the system loses stored internal energy when doing work on its surroundings.  Pressure is stress and volumetric change corresponds to changing the relative spacing of points within the material.  The stress-strain-internal energy relationship of the foregoing formula is repeated in formulations for elastic energy of solid materials with complicated crystalline structure.

==Elastic potential energy in mechanical systems==
Components of mechanical systems store '''elastic potential energy''' if they are deformed when forces are applied to the system. Energy is transferred to an object by [[work (physics)|work]] when an external force displaces or deforms the object. The quantity of energy transferred is the vector [[dot product]] of the force and the displacement of the object.  As forces are applied to the system they are distributed internally to its component parts. While some of the energy transferred can end up stored as kinetic energy of acquired velocity, the deformation of component objects results in stored elastic energy.

A prototypical elastic component is a coiled spring. The linear elastic performance of a spring is parametrized by a constant of proportionality, called the spring constant. This constant is usually denoted as ''k'' (see also [[Hooke's Law]]) and depends on the geometry, cross sectional area, undeformed length and nature of the material from which the coil is fashioned.  Within a certain range of deformation, ''k'' remains constant and is defined as the negative ratio of displacement to the magnitude of the restoring force produced by the spring at that displacement.

:&lt;math&gt; k = - \tfrac{F_r}{L-L_{o}}&lt;/math&gt;

The deformed length, ''L'', can be larger or smaller than ''L''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the undeformed length, so to keep ''k'' positive, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; must be given as a vector component of the restoring force whose sign is negative for ''L''&gt;''L''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and positive for ''L''&lt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. If the displacement is abbreviated as 

:&lt;math&gt;  (L-L_{o})\rightarrow x\, &lt;/math&gt;

then Hooke's Law can be written in the usual form

:&lt;math&gt; F_r =\, - k \, x&lt;/math&gt;.

Energy absorbed and stored in the spring can be derived using Hooke's Law to compute the restoring force as a measure of the applied force. This requires the assumption, sufficiently correct in most circumstances, that at a given moment, the magnitude of applied force, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the magnitude of the resultant restoring force, but its direction and thus sign is different.  In other words, assume that at each point of the displacement ''F''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = ''k'' ''x'', where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of applied force along the x direction

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{F_a} \cdot \vec{x}  = F_{a}\,x .&lt;/math&gt;

For each infinitesimal displacement ''dx'', the applied force is simply ''k x'' and the product of these is the infinitesimal transfer of energy into the spring ''dU''.  The total elastic energy placed into the spring from zero displacement to final length L is thus the integral

:&lt;math&gt; U = \int_{0}^{L-L_o}{k\  x\ dx} = \tfrac{1}{2} k (L-L_o)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

For a material of Young's modulus, ''Y'' (same as modulus of elasticity ''λ''), cross sectional area, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, initial length, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which is stretched by a length, &lt;math&gt;\Delta l&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;U_e = \int {\frac{Y A_0 \Delta l} {l_0}}\, d\left(\Delta l\right) = \frac {Y A_0 {\Delta l}^2} {2 l_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;var&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is the elastic potential energy.

The elastic potential energy per unit volume is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_e} {A_0 l_0} = \frac {Y {\Delta l}^2} {2 l_0^2} = \frac {1} {2} Y {\varepsilon}^2&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac {\Delta l} {l_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the strain in the material.

In the general case, elastic energy is given by the free energy per unit of volume ''f'' as a function of the [[strain tensor]] components ε''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt; f(\varepsilon_{ij}) = \frac{1}{2}  \lambda \varepsilon_{ii}^2 + \mu \varepsilon_{ij}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where λ and μ are the Lamé elastical coefficients and we use [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]]. Noting the thermodynamic connection between stress tensor components and strain tensor components,&lt;ref name=LL /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{ij} = \left ( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \varepsilon_{ij}} \right)_T , &lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript ''T'' denotes that temperature is held constant, then we find that if Hooke's law is valid, we can write the elastic energy density as 
:&lt;math&gt; f = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{ij} \sigma_{ij}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Continuum systems==
A bulk material can be distorted in many different ways: stretching, shearing, bending, twisting, etc.  Each kind of distortion contributes to the elastic energy of a deformed material.  In [[orthogonal coordinates]], the elastic energy per unit volume due to strain is thus a sum of contributions:

:&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{1}{2} C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{ij} \varepsilon_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is a 4th [[Tensor#Tensor rank|rank tensor]], called the elastic, or sometimes stiffness, tensor which is a generalization of the elastic moduli of mechanical systems, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[strain tensor]] ([[Einstein summation notation]] has been used to imply summation over repeated indices).  The values of &lt;math&gt; C_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; depend upon the [[crystal]] structure of the material.  For an [[isotropic]] material, &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl} = \lambda\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl} + \mu(\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}+\delta_{il}\delta_{jk})&lt;/math&gt;, where ''&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' are the [[Lamé constants]], and ''&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].

The strain tensor itself can be defined to reflect distortion in any way that results in invariance under total rotation, but the most common definition which regard to which elastic tensors are usually expressed defines strain as the symmetric part of the gradient of displacement with all nonlinear terms suppressed:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_i u_j + \partial_j u_i )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement at a point in the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; direction and &lt;math&gt;\partial_j&lt;/math&gt; is the partial derivative in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; direction. Note that:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{jj} = \partial_j u_j&lt;/math&gt;

where no summation is intended. Although full Einstein notation sums over raised and lowered pairs of indices, the values of elastic and strain tensor components are usually expressed with all indices lowered. Thus beware (as here) that in some contexts a repeated index does not imply a sum over values of that index (&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in this case), but merely a single component of a tensor.

In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], an '''energy rating label''' or '''energy rating''' is a label affixed to various appliances prior to retail sale, which allows consumers to compare the [[Efficient energy use#Appliances|energy efficiency]] of product and allows consumers to know how much power a particular model will use to run. They allow consumers to compare the energy consumption of similar products, and factor lifetime running cost into their purchasing decision.&lt;ref name=rating&gt;[http://www.energyrating.gov.au/about/what-we-do/labelling Labelling Overview] [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/legalcode Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia licence].&lt;/ref&gt; The energy rating label is a mandatory comparison label under Australian regulations for store sales but not for products sold online.&lt;ref name=rating /&gt; The label comprises an energy consumption figure for the appliance and a star rating. The energy consumption figure is an estimate of how much energy (in [[kilowatt-hours]] or kWh) the appliance will use over a year, based on assumptions about “average usage”.

However, actual energy consumption will depend on how an appliance is used and how often it is used. Factors like climate can also influence energy consumption (and efficiency) for some appliances.

The energy rating label usually incorporates an [[energy star]] label, which is an endorsement label that is not regulated by the Australian Government. It is an international standard for energy efficient consumer products that originated in the United States. Appliances and equipment that qualify to carry the energy star mark are generally in the top 25% most energy efficient products. In Australia, the label is used for office equipment and home electronics. New Zealand uses the energy star label for a much wider range of products such as whitegoods, lighting, heating, water heating and windows.&lt;ref name=rating /&gt; 

==History==
The label was introduced in 1986 in the Australian states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and later its use was extended to all states and territories. A mandatory, national labelling scheme was agreed to in 1992. Australia was the third country to establish such a system, after [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="hlp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyrating.gov.au/history.html |title=History of the labelling program in Australia |date=2 February 2009 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=11 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601175054/http://www.energyrating.gov.au/history.html |archivedate=1 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[International Energy Agency]] survey revealed that compliance by retailers showing the labels was raised from 94% in 2001 to 98% in 2009.&lt;ref name="erls"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://bigpondnews.com/articles/National/2010/10/12/Energy_rating_labels_succes_524831.html |title=Energy rating labels success |accessdate=11 June 2011 |date=13 October 2010 |work=Bigpond News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European Distributed Energy Partnership''' (EU-DEEP) is a large research project supported by the [[European Union]] (EU) and coordinated by [[GDF Suez]]. Started in 2004, the project gathers 41 organizations around the common objective of removing the main barriers to massive deployment of [[distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER).

==Background==
DER are small grid connecting devices that enable decentralized energy to be stored or generated close to the load they serve with the capacity of 10 [[megawatts]] (MW) or less. Centralized power plants use energy to transmit power over long distance, so decentralizing the system uses less energy and encompasses a wide variety of different advancing renewable technologies such as [[Wind power]], [[Solar power]], [[Geothermal power]], [[Biomass]], and [[Biogas]] into the system.

“European cities are the most advanced in terms of the transition to new energies”, Denis Simonneau, Head of International and European Relations at GDF SUEZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the Transfer to New Energies going in Europe Today?|url=http://www.gdfsuez.com/en/group/opinions/interview-denis-simonneau-mipim-new-energies/|website=http://gdfsuez.com|publisher=GDF Suez|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU-DEEP project, developed by eight different European energy companies, was designed so that  most of the technical and non-technical issues which halt a massive deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) in Europe could be eliminated.&lt;ref name=fenix&gt;{{cite web|website=http://fenix.iwes.fraunhofer.de/html/objectives.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies related to the project==
To address the wide range of challenges associated with operating the electricity system of the future, the leading [[Transmission system operator]](TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs), manufacturers and research establishments in the EU have formed a consortium of 18 partners to undertake a 4-year project code named FENIX whose overall aim is:
"To conceptualize, design and demonstrate a technical architecture and commercial framework that would enable DER based systems to become the solution
for the future cost efficient, secure and sustainable EU electricity supply system." &lt;ref name=fenix/&gt;

"The main concern is to provide answers to tackle the different types of barrier to DER deployment." There is three main types of barriers to the DER deployment which are technology barriers, market barriers, and regulatory barriers.&lt;ref name=FEEM&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Project: The birth of a EUropean Distributed EnErgy Partnership - EU-DEEP|url=http://www.feem.it/getpage.aspx?id=319&amp;sez=Research&amp;padre=70&amp;sub=4054|website=FEEM - Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei|publisher=FEEM|accessdate= 16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feem was one of the EU-DEEP partner that was responsible for developing Regulatory Models for the integration of DER. Focusing on FEEM's research, they had work on Demand Response. The main point of the work was to show "how to correlate price patterns to different generation technologies and validation of the three Business Models."&lt;ref name=FEEM /&gt;


==EU-DEEP Partners==
The EU-DEEP is made up of forty-two partners from sixteen countries. The partners are different from one another as they include energy operators, industrial manufacturers, research centers, academics, professionals and national agencies. Each partner also has different capabilities from the development of electric equipments to the analysis of the energy markets mechanisms.&lt;ref name=eudeep&gt;{{cite web|title=Work Description|url=http://www.eudeep.com/index.php?id=456#workdescription|website=eu-deep|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bankside power station and St George the Martyr church - geograph.org.uk - 1607688.jpg|thumb|Flue gas from London's [[Bankside Power Station]], 1975]]

'''Flue gas''' is the [[gas]] exiting to the atmosphere via a [[flue]], which is a pipe or channel for conveying exhaust gases from a fireplace, oven, [[furnace]], [[boiler]] or [[Boiler (power generation)|steam generator]]. Quite often, the flue gas refers to the [[combustion]] exhaust gas produced at [[power plants]]. Its composition depends on what is being burned, but it will usually consist of mostly [[nitrogen]] (typically more than two-thirds) derived from the combustion of air, [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), and [[water vapor]] as well as excess [[oxygen]] (also derived from the combustion air). It further contains a small percentage of a number of pollutants, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (like [[soot]]), [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[sulfur oxides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fossil_fuel_combustion_glue_gases?topic=74180 Fossil fuel combustion flue gases] Milton R. Beychok, Encyclopedia of Earth, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrubbing==
At power plants, flue gas is often treated with a series of chemical processes and [[scrubber]]s, which remove pollutants. [[Electrostatic Precipitator|Electrostatic precipitators]] or [[Dust collector#Fabric filters|fabric filters]] remove particulate matter and [[flue-gas desulfurization]] captures the [[sulfur dioxide]] produced by burning fossil fuels, particularly coal. Nitrogen oxides are treated either by modifications to the combustion process to prevent their formation, or by high temperature or catalytic reaction with [[ammonia]] or [[urea]]. In either case, the aim is to produce nitrogen gas, rather than nitrogen oxides. In the United States, there is a rapid deployment of technologies to remove [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from flue gas—typically by [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] on sorbents or by capture in inert solids as part of the [[flue-gas desulfurization]] product. Such scrubbing can lead to meaningful recovery of sulfur for further industrial use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulfur?topic=49557 Sulfur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028080550/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulfur?topic=49557 |date=October 28, 2012 }} C. Michael Hogan, Encyclopedia of Earth, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies based on regenerative capture by [[amines]] for the removal of {{CO2}} from flue gas have been deployed to provide high purity {{CO2}} gas to the food industry, and for [[enhanced oil recovery]]. They are now under active research as a method for {{CO2}} capture for long-term storage as a means of [[greenhouse gas remediation]], and have begun to be implemented in a limited way commercially (e.g. the [[Sleipner gas field#Carbon capture and storage project|Sleipner West field]] in the [[North Sea]], operating since 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoil.com/en/TechnologyInnovation/ProtectingTheEnvironment/CarboncaptureAndStorage/Pages/CarbonDioxideInjectionSleipnerVest.aspx|title=Technology - Technology and innovation - statoil.com|website=www.statoil.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216072031/http://www.statoil.com/en/TechnologyInnovation/ProtectingTheEnvironment/CarboncaptureAndStorage/Pages/CarbonDioxideInjectionSleipnerVest.aspx|archivedate=2009-12-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of proven technologies for removing pollutants emitted from power plants that are now available. There is also much ongoing research into technologies that will remove even more air pollutants.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8696">[[File:GAW logo new.jpg|thumb|The official logo of the Global Atmosphere Watch program since 2012.]]
The '''Global Atmosphere Watch''' ('''GAW''') is a worldwide system established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]{{spaced ndash}}a [[United Nations]] agency{{spaced ndash}}to monitor trends in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It arose out of concerns for the state of the atmosphere in the 1960s.

== Mission ==
The Global Atmosphere Watch's mission is quite straightforward, consisting of three concise points:
# To make reliable, comprehensive observations of the chemical composition and selected physical characteristics of the atmosphere on global and regional scales;
# To provide the scientific community with the means to predict future atmospheric states;
# To organize assessments in support of formulating environmental policy.

== Goals ==
The GAW program is guided by 8 strategic goals:
*To improve the measurements programme for better geographical and temporal coverage and for near real-time monitoring capability;
*To complete the quality assurance/quality control system;
*To improve availability of data and promote their use;
*To improve communication and cooperation between all GAW components and with the scientific community;
*To identify and clarify changing roles of GAW components;
*To maintain present and solicit new support and collaborations for the GAW programme;
*To intensify capacity-building in developing countries;
*To enhance the capabilities of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in providing urban environmental [[air quality]] services.
Moreover, the programme seeks not only to understand changes in the Earth's atmosphere, but also to forecast them, and perhaps control the human activities that cause them.

== Genesis ==
[[Image:GAWlogo.png|thumb|Global Atmosphere Watch's logo until 2012]]
The original reason for testing the atmosphere for trace chemicals was mere scientific interest, but of course, many scientists eventually wondered what effects these trace chemicals could have on the atmosphere, and on life.

The GAW's genesis began as far back as the 1950s when the World Meteorological Organization began a programme of monitoring the atmosphere for trace chemicals, and also researching [[air pollution]] from a [[meteorology|meteorological]] point of view. They were also responsible for monitoring [[ozone]], establishing the Global Ozone Observing System (GO3OS) in 1957, in the [[International Geophysical Year]].

In 1968, the United Nations called for an international conference to address world environmental problems caused by rapid [[industrialization]]. At about this time, the World Meteorological Organization set up another environmental research body, the Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network. The conference was held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972, and addressed several environmental concerns, namely:

*The threat posed to the atmosphere by [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs);
*Acidification of [[lake]]s and [[forest]]s in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] due to [[acid rain]];
*[[Global warming]] caused by build-up of [[greenhouse gases]].

Indeed, it was the World Meteorological Organization's readings and observations that figured prominently at this conference. They had little good news to offer.

The GAW itself was eventually created in 1989 by combining the GO3OS and the Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network. The GAW consists of a worldwide system of observing stations and supporting facilities providing data for atmospheric assessments, and also serving as an early warning system for chemical or physical changes in the Earth's atmosphere which could be cause for environmental concern. Such changes might involve a change in [[ozone]], and therefore [[ultraviolet]], levels, levels of greenhouse gases, or precipitation chemistry, the culprit in the world's acid rain woes.

== Organization ==
The GAW consists of a coordinated system of various components, prominent among which are:

*measurement stations;
*calibration and data quality centres;
*data centres;
*external scientific groups.

=== Measurement stations ===
More than 65 countries currently host and operate the GAW's global or regional measurement stations. There are also "contributing stations" that furnish additional data. Lately, [[satellite]] programmes have also become important to the GAW, providing atmospheric data that complement ground measurements.

=== Calibration and data quality centres ===
These have the job of ensuring that all data produced by the system measure up to international standards. This is achieved by assuring a rigorous adherence to standards established by scientific advisory groups and a strict enforcement of world calibration standards. A number of programmes such as education, workshops, calibration station visits and so on are provided within the GAW programme to enhance the performance of the human component of the GAW. This has become particularly important in recent years as quite a number of stations are now operating in [[developing countries]] where further education is often a luxury enjoyed only by a small élite.

=== Data centres ===
The Global Atmosphere Watch currently has six World Data Centres, each administered by its host nation, and each responsible for gathering and storing atmospheric data from measurement stations worldwide, and making it freely available to scientists in a number of different forms.

The six data centres are:

#The World Ozone and UV radiation Data Centre ([http://www.woudc.org WOUDC]), hosted by Environment Canada.
#The World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases ([http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/ WDCGG]), hosted by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
#The World Data Centre for Aerosols ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110320051723/http://www.gaw-wdca.org/ WDCA]), hosted by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU).
#The World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC), hosted by the Main Geophysical Observatory, St Petersburg
#The World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry ([http://wdcpc.org/ WDCPC]) hosted by the Illinois State Water Survey
#The World Data Centre for Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere ([http://wdc.dlr.de WDC-RSAT]), hosted by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).

=== External scientific groups ===
Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) have the job of managing and implementing the GAW programme. This includes establishing data quality objectives and standard operating procedures, and also providing guidelines and recommendations for achieving these things. Measurement methods and procedures also fall within the SAGs' domain. They are also charged with promoting twinning and training in developing countries.

The '''Indian Ocean garbage patch''', discovered in 2010, is a [[Ocean gyre|gyre]] of [[marine litter]] suspended in the upper [[water column]] of the central Indian Ocean, specifically the [[Indian Ocean Gyre]], one of the five major oceanic [[gyre]]s.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;[http://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/21331 First Voyage to South Atlantic Pollution Site] SustainableBusiness.com News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GY&gt;[http://green.yahoo.com/blog/greenpicks/286/new-garbage-patch-discovered-in-indian-ocean.html New garbage patch discovered in Indian Ocean], Lori Bongiorno, Green [[Yahoo]], 27 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-24/tech/plastiki.ocean.gyres_1_plastic-two-oil-spills-smog?_s=PM:TECH Opinion: Islands are 'natural nets' for plastic-choked seas] Marcus Eriksen for [[CNN]], Petroleum, CNN Tech 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCS&gt;[http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_15092258 Our Ocean Backyard: Exploring plastic seas], [[Dan Haifley]], 15 May 2010, [[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TL&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article758551.ece/Life-aquatic-choked-by-plastic Life aquatic choked by plastic] 14 November 2010, [[Times Live]]&lt;/ref&gt; The patch does not appear as a continuous debris field.

A similar patch of floating plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean, the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]], was predicted in 1985, and discovered in 1997 by [[Charles J. Moore]] as he passed through the North Pacific Gyre on his return from the [[Transpacific Yacht Race]]. The [[North Atlantic garbage patch]] was discovered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/03/100302-new-ocean-trash-garbage-patch/ |title= Huge Garbage Patch Found in Atlantic Too |work= National Geographic News |publisher= [[National Geographic Society]] |first= Richard A. |last= Lovett |date= 2 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8534052.stm |title=Plastic rubbish blights Atlantic Ocean |author=Victoria Gill |date=24 February 2010 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

The existence of the Great Pacific garbage patch, the first to be discovered, was predicted in a 1988 paper published by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) of the United States. The prediction was based on results obtained by several Alaska-based researchers between 1985 and 1988 that measured [[neuston]]ic [[Plastics|plastic]] in the North Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Research studying trash washed onto beaches in and around the Indian Ocean suggested that there would be plastics found in the water column in the Indian Ocean as well.&lt;ref name=GY/&gt;

In 2010, the [[5 Gyres]] Project set off on the first of its planned series of transoceanic voyages to determine whether the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean gyres were affected in the same way as the North Pacific and North Atlantic gyres.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt;&lt;ref name=GY/&gt;&lt;ref name=SCS/&gt;&lt;ref name=TL/&gt; On the Indian Ocean leg of their trip, they travelled between [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]], and [[Port Louis, Mauritius]] (east of Madagascar); each of the water samples they collected in the {{convert|4800|km|abbr=on}} between contained plastic.&lt;ref name=GY/&gt; They found that the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean gyres were affected in the same way as the North Pacific and North Atlantic gyres.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt;&lt;ref name=GY/&gt;&lt;ref name=SCS/&gt;&lt;ref name=TL/&gt; Anna Cummins, cofounder of 5 Gyres Institute called the pollution they found "a thin plastic soup".&lt;ref name=GY/&gt;

'''Jay Robert Inslee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|n|z|l|iː}}; born February 9, 1951) is an American [[politician]], author, and attorney who is the 23rd [[List of Governors of Washington|Governor of Washington]], elected in 2012. Inslee is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Born in [[Seattle]], Inslee graduated from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Willamette University College of Law]]. He served in the [[Washington House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1993. Inslee represented {{ushr|WA|4}}, which included parts of the state around [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]], in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 1995. Defeated for re-election in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994]], Inslee returned to private practice and then ran for governor of Washington in the [[Washington gubernatorial election, 1996|1996 election]], coming in fifth in the [[blanket primary]] ahead of the general election, which was won by Democrat [[Gary Locke]]. Inslee then served as regional director for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

Inslee was elected back to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998, this time for {{ushr|WA|1|}}, which included Seattle's northern suburbs in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]] and [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]]. He was reelected six times before announcing that he was running for Governor of Washington again on June 27, 2011. He resigned from Congress on March 20, 2012, to focus on his campaign. He defeated Republican [[Rob McKenna]], the [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General of Washington]], in [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2012|the general election]], 52% to 48%. Inslee was [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2016|reelected]] to a second term in 2016, defeating Republican [[Port of Seattle|Seattle Port Commissioner]] [[Bill Bryant (politician)|Bill Bryant]], 54% to 46%.

Inslee has emerged as one of the most recognized [[Protests against Donald Trump|critics]] of the administration of President [[Donald Trump]]. Alongside State Solicitor General [[Noah Purcell]] and State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]], Inslee played a major role in [[Washington v. Trump|the opposition to]] Trump's [[Executive Order 13769]], in which a restriction halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries, and a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States. The order was blocked by the courts and later superseded by other executive orders.

Inslee served as chair of the [[Democratic Governors Association]] for the [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018 election cycle]].

==Early life, education, and law career==
Inslee was born in Seattle, the son of Adele A. (née Brown), a sales clerk, and Frank E. Inslee, a teacher and coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/inslee.htm |title=inslee |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Seattle's [[Ingraham High School]], the [[University of Washington]] ([[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Economics]]), and [[Willamette University College of Law]] ([[Juris Doctor]]).

Inslee has attributed his interest in the outdoors to the years his parents spent leading student groups on wilderness conservation trips in cooperation with the SCA in [[Mount Rainier]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mundy"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003598649_aliciacol03.html Putting Parents Before Pollsters], Alicia Mundy, May 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He practiced law for 10 years in [[Selah, Washington]], a city just north of [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]].

==Washington House of Representatives (1989–1993)==

===Tenure===
In the Washington state legislature, Inslee pursued a bill to provide initial funding to build five branch campuses of the [[Washington State University]] system. Although the bill failed, Inslee's tenacity made an impression on House Speaker Joe King, who said: "He's not afraid to incur the wrath of the speaker or the caucus."&lt;ref&gt;Yakima Herald-Republic, June 11, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Inslee voted for a state energy policy which required the state to devise a cost-effective energy strategy, and also that state agencies and school districts must pursue and maintain energy-efficient operation of their facilities.&lt;ref&gt;HB 1022 - An act relating to state energy policy.

;1994
:He lost his bid for re-election in the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994 in a rematch against his 1992 opponent, [[Doc Hastings]].

Inslee moved to [[Bainbridge Island]], a suburb of [[Seattle]], and briefly resumed the practice of law.

===1996 gubernatorial election===
{{Main|Washington gubernatorial election, 1996}}
He ran for [[Governor of Washington]] in [[Washington gubernatorial election, 1996|1996]] and lost in the [[blanket primary]].

Democratic [[Mayor of Seattle]] [[Norm Rice]] ranked second with 18%, but didn't qualify for the general election. Republican State Senator [[Ellen Craswell]] ranked third with 15%, and became the Republican candidate to qualify for the general election. Republican State Senator and Senate Majority Leader [[Dale Foreman]] ranked fourth with 13%. Inslee ranked fifth with 10%.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2012)==

===Elections===
[[File:Jay Inslee, Official Portrait, c112th Congress.jpg|thumb|Inslee as a representative]] Inslee ran again for Congress in 1998, this time in the 1st congressional district against two-term incumbent [[Rick White (politician)|Rick White]]. His campaign attracted national attention when he became the first Democratic candidate to air television ads attacking his opponent and the Republican congressional leadership for the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref name="lewinskiad"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/campaign101198.htm Candidates Are Held Hostage by Scandal], Washington Post, October 11, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Inslee won with 49.8% of the vote to White's 44.1%; he had an unintentional assist in his successful return by the conservative [[third political party]] candidacy of Bruce Craswell, husband of 1996 GOP gubernatorial nominee [[Ellen Craswell]].
 
The 1st was a swing district for most of the 1990s; Inslee's win marked the third time the district had changed hands in four elections. However, Inslee was a major beneficiary of the recent Democratic trend in the Seattle area. Inslee defeated [[Washington Senate]] Minority Leader Dan McDonald in 2000, taking 54.6% of the vote. Inslee defeated former state representative Joe Marine in 2002, taking 55.6% of the vote after the district was made more Democratic in the 2000s round of redistricting. He would never face another contest nearly that close, and was reelected three more times with over 60 percent of the vote.

In July 2003, after [[Gary Locke]] announced he would not seek a third term as Washington's governor, Inslee briefly flirted with a gubernatorial bid before deciding to remain in Congress.&lt;ref name="inslee4gov"&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/138758_governor09.html Inslee Won't Run For Governor], Joel Connelly, Seattle Post Intelligencer, September 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009-10 campaign cycle, Inslee raised $1,140,025. In data compiled for the period 2005 to 2007 and excluding individual contributions of less than $200, 64 percent of Inslee's donations were from outside the state of Washington and 86 percent came from outside his district (compared to 79 percent for the average House member). 43 percent of Inslee's donations came from Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland. The largest interests funding Inslee's campaign were pharmaceutical and health related companies, lawyers and law firms, and high tech companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign Funding Sources|url=http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/297-jay-inslee|work=Inslee Contributions Illuminated|publisher=maplight.org|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 he won by a 15-point margin, with 57.67% of the votes cast in his favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Sam|title=Congressional District 1|url=http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/WEI/Results.aspx?ElectionID=37&amp;JurisdictionTypeID=3&amp;JurisdictionID=103&amp;ViewMode=Results|work=2010 Election Results|publisher=Washington Secretary of State|accessdate=29 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321001943/http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/WEI/Results.aspx?ElectionID=37&amp;JurisdictionTypeID=3&amp;JurisdictionID=103&amp;ViewMode=Results|archivedate=21 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His district went 62% to [[Barack Obama]] in 2008, an indication of how strongly the district then leaned Democratic.

Inslee was awarded a "Friend of the National Parks" award by the [[National Parks Conservation Association]] (NPCA) in 2001 for his support of legislation protecting the integrity and quality of the [[National Park System]].&lt;ref name="NPCAfriend"&gt;[http://www.npca.org/media_center/press_releases/2001/page-27598936.html Friend of the National Parks Award Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121111738/http://www.npca.org/media_center/press_releases/2001/page-27598936.html |date=2008-11-21 }}, [[National Parks Conservation Association]], February 15, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Inslee co-authored ''[[Apollo's Fire (book)|Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy]]'', in which he argues that through improved Federal policies the United States can wean itself off of its dependence on foreign oil and [[fossil fuel]], create millions of [[Green-collar worker]] jobs, and stop [[global warming]]. He has been a prominent supporter of the [[Apollo Alliance]].&lt;ref name="ApolloAlliance"&gt;[http://www.apolloalliance.org/resources_100mpg.php Inslee articles at the Apollo Alliance web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126233311/http://www.apolloalliance.org/resources_100mpg.php |date=2008-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inslee strongly believes the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] should remain authorized to regulate [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. In a 2011 House hearing on the [[Energy Tax Prevention Act]], Inslee said Republicans have "an allergy to science and scientists," during a discussion of whether the [[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]] should remain in place following a controversial court finding on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wing|first=Nick|title=Jay Inslee: Republicans Suffer From 'Allergy To Science And Scientists'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/09/jay-inslee-gop-allergy-science_n_833404.html|work=Huffpost Politics|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been an outspoken critic of the [[George W. Bush]] administration's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. On July 31, 2007, Inslee introduced legislation that called for an inquiry to determine whether then [[United States Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] should be impeached. Gonzales eventually resigned.&lt;ref name="LATimes20070801A"&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-impeach1aug01,1,130274.story?coll=la-news-politics-national&amp;track=crosspromo ''Bill calls for Gonzales impeachment inquiry''], [[Los Angeles Times]], August 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Inslee voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the federal health care law.&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Inslee voted in favor of authorizing the use of U.S. armed forces in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] and voted against limiting the use of funds to support [[NATO]]'s [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Votes on Libya|url=http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/400193_jay_inslee|work=Inslee Supports Adventure in Libya|publisher=OpenCongress.org|accessdate=1 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701094839/http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/400193_Jay_Inslee|archivedate=1 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First term: 2013–2017 ===

During the 2013 session, the [[Washington State Legislature|legislature]] failed to create a fiscal budget plan during the initial session, and Inslee was forced to call two special sessions in order to give time for a budget to be created. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-controlled [[Washington State Senate|Senate]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-controlled [[Washington State House of Representatives|House]] each passed their own budgets, but could not agree with one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington Gov.

In January 2014, Inslee gave a speech commending machinists who voted to renew [[Boeing]]'s contract with Seattle, allowing the company to build its [[Boeing 777#777X Program|Boeing 777x]] aircraft in Seattle. Inslee said the contract would bring Washington to a new industrial plateau and be a turning point for Washington jobs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These jobs are in the thousands and it is not only on the 777X, the first model of the 777X but all the subsequent derivative models as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The plan was to prevent Boeing from building part of the aircraft in Washington and part of it somewhere else, as they had done with the [[Boeing 787]], which had been partially constructed in [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Hana|title=Governor Inslee says Boeing deal could open new industrial plateau|url=http://q13fox.com/2014/01/04/governor-inslee-says-boeing-deal-could-open-new-industrial-plateau/#axzz2pVAPMUv4|newspaper=Q13 Fox|date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boeing pact with Machinists union called turning point for labor|url=http://triblive.com/business/headlines/5360816-74/boeing-union-state#axzz2pVAQFg9d|newspaper=TribLive|date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014, Inslee announced that he was issuing a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on [[Capital punishment in Washington state|executions in Washington]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been too many doubts raised about capital punishment, there are too many flaws in this system today. There is too much at stake to accept an imperfect system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inslee cited the high cost of pursuing the death penalty, the randomness with which it was sought, and a lack of evidence that it is a deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inslee halts executions in state while he is governor|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2022883256_deathpenaltyinsleexml.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington state to suspend death penalty by governor's moratorium|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/washington-state-death-penalty-governor-inslee-suspends|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3799">The family [[Clusiaceae]] was divided by [[Cronquist system|Cronquist]] into 2 [[subfamily|subfamilies]]: the Clusioideae (typical subfamily) and the Hypericoideae. The latter was often treated as a family - the '''Hypericaceae''' or '''St. John's wort family'''. Elements of the Hypericoideae are more common in North [[temperate]] areas and those of the Clusioideae  are centered in the [[Tropics]].

Later classifications however divide the family in a finer way. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] below mostly follows that of Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, P. F. (1980). A revision of the Old World species of Calophyllum (Guttiferae). ''J. Arnold Arboretum'' 61:117–699.&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular studies have shown that the family [[Podostemaceae]] - the riverweeds - as well as the Theaceae-segregate [[Bonnetiaceae]] need to be included in this group. Their inclusions make Clusiaceae in a wide-sense polyphyletic, and Stevens's subfamilies need to be recognised at family level: Clusioideae as Clusiaceae sensu stricto; Hypericoideae as [[Hypericaceae]]; and Kielmeyeroideae as [[Calophyllaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;APG III (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The classification of subfamily Clusioideae is not yet fully established ! --&gt;

Mountains constitute a significant part of [[Bulgaria]] and are dominant in the southwest and central parts. Bulgaria's highest mountains are [[Rila]] (highest peak [[Musala]], 2925 m; the highest in the [[Balkans]]) and [[Pirin]] (highest peak [[Vihren]], 2914 m). The large [[mountain chain]] of [[Stara planina]] (Balkan Mountains) runs west-east across the entire country, bisecting it and giving the name to the entire Balkan peninsula. Other extensive mountains are the [[massif]]s [[Rhodopes]] and [[Strandzha]] in the south.

The '''Marineland of Antibes''' is a [[Amusement park|theme park]] founded in 1970 by [[Roland de la Poype|Roland de La Poype]] in [[Antibes]] ([[Alpes-Maritimes]]), in the [[French Riviera]]. On 26 hectares it includes a marine [[zoological park]] with [[dolphinarium]], a [[water park]] (''Aquasplash''), a children's play park (''Kid's Island''), a mini golf (''Aventure Golf'') and a three-star hotel (''Marineland Resort''). It is the property of the Spanish multinational company [[Parques Reunidos]], whose majority shareholder is the British investment fund Arle Capital Partners. The actual director is Arnaud Palu.

It is one of the four French dolphinariums and one of the two European dolphinariums presenting [[Killer whale|orcas]]. With 1.2 million visitors in 2014, it's the most visited site of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region]]. The zoological park is one of the most visited in France.

Since the 2010s, it is more and more criticised by the opponents to [[cetacea]]n captivity, which claims that dolphinariums can't assure captivity conditions that fits to the proper needs of those [[species]], leading to a prematurate mortality of individuals.

== History ==
On July 25, 2006, the park was sold to the Spanish amusement park group [[Parques Reunidos]] for about 75 million Euros&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourmag.com/Antibes-Marineland-ouvre-son-premier-hotel_a73658.html Tourmag.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Killer whale show
The largest killer whale pool complex in the world performing in {{Convert|11000000|gal|m3}} of water, with a panoramic glass wall {{Convert|64|m}} long. Marineland holds four [[orcas]]:  Inouk, [[Wikie (killer whale)|Wikie]], Moana and Keijo.

;Dolphin show
Marineland is currently housing (Apr 2017) a total of 13 [[bottlenose dolphins]]. The name of the dolphins are: Ecume (F), Lotty (F), Sharky (F), Malou (F), Éclair (M), Alize (M), Rocky (M), Dam (M), Neo (M), Mila-Tami (F), Nala (F), Ania (F), and Joseph (M). 

;Les Coulisses de l'apprentissage (sea lion show)
A live demonstration of the learning techniques used with all the mammals in the park, in which the [[pinniped|seal]] and [[sea lion]] trainers disclose some of the "ropes" for preparing the show, the better to understand the basis of the relationship between humans and animals.

;The shark tunnel
In a {{Convert|30|m|sing=on}} tunnel through an aquarium containing nearly {{Convert|2000000|l|gal}} of water, visitors are surrounded by [[shark]]s and [[manta rays]].

;Polar bears
Marineland is one of few places in Europe where one can see [[polar bear]]s. As of 2015, there are 3 of them: one male (Rasputin), one female (Flocke), and their cub (Hope).

;Life under the sea (The tropical aquarium gallery and The touch pool)
The tropical aquarium gallery shows the world of coral reefs, and the touch pool is a chance to touch skates and rays - fish that seem to "fly" in the water.

;[[Pinnipeds]]
Beaches featuring California sea lions, South American sea lions, black seals and grey seals.

;Aquatic birds
Beaches featuring [[penguins]], [[pelicans]] and [[flamingos]].

;Meeting with dolphins
Each session lasts approximately 1 hour, to discover the biology and ecology of [[dolphins]], before approaching the [[dolphins]] for 20 minutes under close supervision by trainers on a sunken deck.

'''Oil reserves in [[Canada]]''' were estimated at {{convert|172|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=2}} as of the start of 2015
.  This figure includes the [[oil sands]] reserves that are estimated by government regulators to be economically producible at current prices using current technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this figure, Canada's reserves are third only to [[Oil reserves in Venezuela|Venezuela]] and [[Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]].  Over 95% of these reserves are in the [[oil sands]] deposits in the province of [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="EIACAN"&gt;{{cite web

The balance is concentrated in several other provinces and territories.  [[Saskatchewan]] and offshore areas of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in particular have substantial oil production and reserves.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Canadian oil production 1950 to 2030.svg|lang=en|thumb|left|Canadian conventional oil production peaked in 1973, but oil sands production is forecast to increase to at least 2020]]

Canada has a highly sophisticated energy industry and is both an importer and exporter of oil and refined products. In 2006, in addition to producing {{convert|1.2|Goilbbl|e6m3}}, Canada imported {{convert|440|Moilbbl|e6m3}}, consumed {{convert|800|Moilbbl|e6m3}} itself, and exported {{convert|840|Moilbbl|e6m3}} to the U.S.&lt;ref name="EIACAN" /&gt; The excess of exports over imports was {{convert|400|Moilbbl|e6m3}}.  Over 99% of Canadian oil exports are sent to the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest supplier of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision  of accounting {{convert|174|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=2}} of the Alberta oil sands deposits as proven reserves was made by the [[Energy Resources Conservation Board]] (ERCB), now known as the [[Alberta Energy and Utilities Board]] (AEUB).&lt;ref name="ST98"&gt;{{Cite journal

  | accessdate = 2008-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although now widely accepted, this addition was controversial at the time because oil sands contain an extremely heavy form of crude oil known as [[bitumen]] which will not flow toward a well under reservoir conditions. Instead, it must be mined, heated, or diluted with solvents to allow it to be produced, and must be upgraded to lighter oil to be usable by refineries.&lt;ref name="ST98" /&gt; Historically known as bituminous sands or sometimes as "tar sands", the deposits were exposed as major rivers cut through the oil-bearing formations to reveal the bitumen in the river banks.  In recent years technological breakthroughs have overcome the economical and technical difficulties of producing the oil sands, and by 2007 64% of Alberta's petroleum production of {{convert|1.86|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} was from oil sands rather than conventional oil fields. The ERCB estimates that by 2017 oil sands production will make up 88% of Alberta's predicted oil production of {{convert|3.4|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref name="ST98" /&gt;

[[Image:WTI Crude Oil Price 1998-2007.png|thumb|right|The fivefold increase in oil prices from 1998 to 2007 made Canadian oil sands production profitable.]]

Analysts estimate that a price of $30 to $40 per barrel is required to make new oil sands production profitable.&lt;ref name="EIACAN" /&gt; In recent years prices have greatly exceeded those levels and the Alberta government expects $116 billion worth of new oil sands projects to be undertaken between 2008 and 2017.&lt;ref name="ST98" /&gt; However the biggest constraint on oil sands development is a serious labor and housing shortage in Alberta as a whole and the oil sands centre of [[Fort McMurray]] in particular. According to [[Statistics Canada]], by September, 2006 unemployment rates in Alberta had fallen to record low levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cross |first=Philip |author2=Geoff Bowlby |title=The Alberta economic juggernaut |work=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=September 2006 |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326023337/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ads-annonces/11-010-x/pdf/6000725-eng.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2009 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; and per-capita incomes had risen to double the Canadian average. Another hurdle has been Canada's capacity to rapidly increase its export pipelines.  The [[National Energy Board]] indicated that exporters faced pipeline [[rationing|apportionment]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

Up until 2010 Canada was the only major oil producer in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ([[OECD]]) to have an increase in oil production in recent years. Production in the other major OECD producers (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway and Mexico) at that time have been declining, as was conventional oil production in Canada. Total crude oil production in Canada was projected to increase by an average of 8.6 percent per year from 2008 to 2011 as a result of new non-conventional oil projects.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''pentagrid converter''' is a type of radio receiving valve ([[vacuum tube]]) with five grids used as the [[frequency mixer]] stage of a [[superheterodyne]] radio receiver.

The pentagrid was part of a line of development of valves that were able to take an incoming RF signal and change its frequency to a fixed [[intermediate frequency]], which was then amplified and detected in the remainder of the receiver circuitry.  The device was generically referred to as a ''frequency changer'' or just ''mixer''.

==Origins==
The first devices designed to change frequency in the manner described above seem to have been developed by the French, who simply put two grids into what would otherwise have been an ordinary [[triode]] valve (the ''bi-grille'').  Although technically a four-component [[electrode]] device, neither the term [[tetrode]] nor the tetrode valve as it is known today had yet appeared.  Each grid was able to accept one of the incoming signals, and the non-linearity of the device produced the sum and difference frequencies.  The valve would have been very inefficient, but, most importantly, the capacitive coupling between the two grids would have been very large.  It would therefore have been quite impossible to prevent the signal from one grid coupling out of the other.  At least one reference claims that the ''bi-grille'' was self-oscillating, but this has not been confirmed.

In 1918, [[Edwin Armstrong]] used only triodes when he invented the [[superheterodyne receiver]].  One triode operated in a conventional oscillator circuit. Another triode acted as a mixer by coupling the oscillator signal into the mixer's cathode and the received signal to the grid. The sum and difference frequencies were then available in the mixer's [[anode]] circuit.  Once again, the problem of coupling between the circuits would be ever present.

Shortly after Armstrong invented the superheterodyne, a triode mixer stage design was developed that not only mixed the incoming signal with the local oscillator, but the same valve doubled as the oscillator.  This was known as the [[autodyne]] mixer.  Early examples had difficulty oscillating across the frequency range because the oscillator feedback was via the first [[intermediate frequency]] [[transformer]] primary tuning capacitor, which was too small to give good feedback.  Also keeping the oscillator signal out of the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] circuit was difficult.

The invention of the tetrode demonstrated the idea of screening electrodes from each other by using additional earthed (grounded) grids (at least, as far as the signal was concerned).  In 1926, Philips invented a technique of adding yet another grid to combat the [[secondary emission]] that the tetrode suffered from.  All the ingredients for the pentagrid were now in place.

==Pentagrid==
[[File:Heptode.svg|thumb|100px|Circuit symbol of a heptode]]

The development of the pentagrid or '''heptode''' (seven-electrode) valve was a novel development in the mixer story.  The idea was to produce a single valve that not only mixed the oscillator signal and the received signal and produced its own oscillator signal at the same time but, importantly, did the mixing and the oscillating in different parts of the same valve.

The invention of the device at first sight doesn't seem to be obscure, but it would appear that it was developed in both America and the United Kingdom, more or less at the same time.  However, the UK device is different from its American counterpart.

It is known that Donald G. Haines of RCA applied for a patent for the pentagrid on 28 March 1933 (subsequently granted on 29 March 1939) under US patent number 2,148,266.  The pentagrid also featured in a UK patent (GB426802) granted on 10 April 1935.  However, the Ferranti company of Great Britain entered the valve business with the first known UK-produced pentagrid, the '''VHT4''', late in 1933 (though it must have been in development, and would certainly have existed as a prototype well before that time).

The pentagrid proved to be a much better mixer.  Since the oscillator circuit was more or less self-contained, good feedback for reliable oscillation across the frequency range was easy to obtain.  Some manufacturers that had adopted the [[autodyne]] mixer converted some, if not all, of their designs to pentagrid mixers.

What was the goal to develop a reliable self-oscillating mixer?  The reasons were to differ from the UK to America.  The UK radio manufacturers had to pay a royalty of £1 per valve holder to the [[British Valve Association]] to cover use of their members' patent rights.  Further, they dictated that not more than one electrode structure could be contained in a single envelope (which would have evaded the royalty - at least in part).  The Americans appeared to be driven by the desire to produce a low-cost 'every expense spared' design which was to lead to the [[All American Five]].  By making the mixer self-oscillate, the necessity of providing a separate oscillator valve is avoided.  The All American Five was to use a pentagrid converter from when it first appeared in 1934, right up until valves became obsolete when transistors took over.

In the UK, the five grids operated thus.  Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid in conjunction with grid 2 which acted as its anode.  Grid 4 accepted the incoming signal with the remaining two grids, 3 and 5 connected together (usually internally) which acted as screen grids to screen the anode, grid 4 and grid 2 from each other.  Because grid 2 was a 'leaky' anode in that it allowed part of the modulated electron stream through, the oscillator was coupled into the mixing section of the valve.  In fact, in some designs, grid 2 consisted of just the support rods, the actual grid wire itself being omitted.

In America, the configuration was different.  Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid as before, but in this case, grids 2 and 4 were connected together (again usually internally).  Grid 2 functioned as both a screen and the oscillator anode; in this case the grid wire had to be present to provide the screening.  Grid 3 accepted the incoming signal.  Grid 4 screened this from the anode, and grid 5 was a suppressor grid to suppress secondary emission.  This configuration limited the oscillator design to one where the oscillator 'anode' was operated from the HT+ (B+) rail.  This was often accomplished by using a [[Hartley Oscillator]] circuit and taking the cathode to the tap on the coil.

It will be noted that the UK version would have had significant secondary emission and would also have had a [[tetrode|tetrode kink]].  This was exploited in providing the non linearity necessary to produce good sum and difference signals.  The American devices although having no secondary emission due to the suppressor grid, nevertheless were able to get the required non linearity by biasing the oscillator such that the valve was overdriven.  The American version was also a little more sensitive because the grid that accepted the signal was closer to the cathode increasing the amplification factor.

The pentagrid converter in either guise operated extremely well, but it suffered from the limitation that a strong signal was able to 'pull' the oscillator frequency away from a weaker signal.  This was not considered a major problem in broadcast receivers where the signals were likely to be strong, but it became a problem when trying to receive weak signals that were close to strong signals.  Some short wave radios managed quite satisfactorily with these devices.  Special high frequency versions appeared after World War II for the 100&amp;nbsp;MHz FM bands.  Examples are the '''6SB7Y''' (1946) and the '''6BA7''' (1948).  The pulling effect had a beneficial side effect in that it gave a degree of automatic tuning.

Another disadvantage was that in spite of the presence of the screen grids, the electron beam, modulated by the oscillator electrodes, still had to pass through the signal grid, and coupling of the oscillator into the signal circuit was inevitable.  The American [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC) started requiring radio manufacturers to certify that their products avoided this interference under Part 15 of their rules.  In the UK, the Postmaster General (who was responsible for radio licensing), laid down a set of stringent rules concerning radio interference.

==Hexode==
[[File:Hexode symbol.svg|thumb|100px|Circuit symbol of a hexode]]

The '''hexode''' (six-electrode) was actually developed after the heptode or pentagrid.  It was developed in Germany as a mixer but was designed from the start to be used with a separate triode oscillator.  Thus the grid configuration was grid 1, signal input; grids 2 and 4 screen grids (connected together - again, usually internally) and grid 3 was the oscillator input.  The device had no suppressor grid.  A major advantage was that by using grid 1 as the signal input grid, the device was more sensitive to weak signals.

It was not long before the triode and hexode structures were placed in the same glass envelope - by no means a new idea.  The triode grid was usually internally connected to the hexode grid 3, but this practice was dropped in later designs when the mixer section operated as a straight IF amplifier in AM/FM sets when operating on FM, the mixing being carried out in a dedicated FM frequency changing section.

The UK manufacturers were initially unable to use this type of mixer because of the [[British Valve Association|BVA]] prohibition on multiple structures (and indeed unwilling to use separate valves because of the levy).  One UK company, [[Marconi-Osram Valve|MOV]], successfully enforced the cartel rules against the German Lissen company in 1934 when they attempted to market a radio in the UK which had the triode-hexode mixer.

Following pressure from the UK manufacturers, the BVA were compelled to relax the rules and the UK started to adopt triode-hexode mixers.  The [[Mullard]] '''ECH35''' was a popular choice.

One company, [[Osram]], made an ingenious move.  One of their popular pentagrid converter designs was the '''MX40''', initially marketed in 1934.  They put on sale in 1936, the '''X41''' triode-hexode frequency changer.  The clever bit was that the '''X41''' was a direct plug-in pin-compatible replacement for the MX40.  Thus a pentagrid radio could easily be converted to a triode-hexode without any other circuit modifications.

America never really adopted the triode-hexode and it was seldom used, even though the '''6K8''' triode-hexode was available to manufacturers in 1938.

In some designs, a suppressor grid was added to produce yet another heptode design.  Mullard's '''ECH81''' became popular with the move to miniature nine-pin valves.

==Octode==
[[Image:Mixer oktode.png|right|162px|thumb|Octode-based pentagrid converter circuit]]
Although not strictly a pentagrid (in that it has more than five grids), the '''octode''' (eight-electrode) nevertheless operates on the pentagrid principle.  It resulted simply from the addition of an extra screen grid to the UK version of the pentagrid heptode.  This was done mainly to improve the antenna/oscillator separation and to reduce the power consumption for use in radio sets operated by dry batteries that were becoming increasingly popular.

In North America, the only octode manufactured was the '''7A8'''.  Introduced by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] in 1939 (and used mostly by [[Philco]]), this valve was the product of adding a suppressor grid to type '''7B8''', which was the [[Loctal base|loctal]] version of type '''6A7'''.  Adding the suppressor allowed Sylvania to lower the current of the 6.3-volt heater from 320 milliamperes&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/084/7/7B8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to 150 milliamperes&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/108/7/7A8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining the same conversion [[transconductance]] (550 microsiemens).  This allowed Philco to use this valve in every line of radio throughout the 1940s.

The Philips '''EK3''' octode was designated as a "beam octode".  The novel part about the design was that grids 2 and 3 were constructed as beam-forming plates.  This was done in such a way that Philips claimed that the oscillator electron beam and the mixer electron beams were separated as much as possible and thus the pulling effect was minimised.&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/046/e/EK3.pdf Manufacturer's marketing information.&lt;/ref&gt;  No information is available as to the degree of success.  The manufacturer's information also notes that the valve's high performance comes at a cost of a high heater current of 600 mA – double that of more conventional types.

==Pentode==
{{main|Pentode}}
The use of a [[pentode]] would seem an unlikely choice for a frequency converter because it only has one control grid.  However, during the [[Great Depression]], many American radio manufacturers used pentode types '''6C6''', '''6D6''', '''77''' and '''78''' in their lowest priced AC/DC receivers because they were cheaper than pentagrid type '''6A7'''.  In these circuits, the suppressor (grid 3) acted as the oscillator grid, and the valve operated in a similar manner to a true pentagrid.

One UK company, [[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]]/[[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|Ediswan]], produced a triode-pentode frequency changer, the '''AC/TP'''.  Designed for low-cost AC radios, the device was deliberately designed to allow strong signals to pull the oscillator without the risk of radiating the oscillator signal from the aerial.  The cathode was common to both sections of the valve.  The cathode was connected to a secondary coil on the oscillator coil and thus coupled the oscillator into the pentode mixer section, the signal being applied to grid 1 in the conventional manner.  The AC/TP was one of the AC/ range of valves designed for low-cost radios.  They were considered durable for their time (even the AC/TP frequency changer, which was normally problematic).  Any AC/ valves encountered today are likely to be brand new as service shops stocked up on spares which were seldom required.

==Nomenclature==
In order to distinguish between the two versions of the heptode, manufacturers data often describes them as "heptode of the hexode type" for a heptode without a suppressor grid, and a "heptode of the octode type", where a suppressor grid is present.

'''Qos''' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|קוס/קוש}},&lt;ref name="Manyanya" &gt;Lévi Ngangura Manyanya. (2009). [https://books.google.it/books?id=kiR_xkWUFS4C&amp;pg=PA258 La fraternité de Jacob et d'Esaü (Gn 25-36): quel frère aîné pour Jacob?] ''Labor et Fides'', p.257.&lt;/ref&gt; also '''Qōs''', '''Qaus''', '''Koze''') was the national god of the [[Edom]]ites.&lt;ref&gt;Detlef Jericke. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=67Q3uY4opoAC&amp;pg=PA17 Abraham in Mamre: Historische und exegetische Studien zur Region von Hebron und zu Genesis 11, 27–19, 38], p.19. BRILL.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Idumea]]n rival of [[Yahweh]], and structurally parallel to him. Thus ‘Benqos’ (son of Qōs) parallels the Hebrew ‘Beniyahu’ (son of Yahweh).&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The name occurs only once in the Old Testament (if we exclude a possible allusion in an otherwise corrupted text in the [[Book of Proverbs]]&lt;ref&gt;With a minimal adjustment of emendation Vriezen elicited from the corrupt אלקום ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], 30:31) an allusion to “the god Qos”. (Dicou 1994, p.177, n.1).&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Book of Ezra]] as an element in a personal name, ''Barqos'' ('Qōs gleamed forth'),&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Ezra|Ezra]],2:53 = [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]],7:55.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the 'father' of a family or clan of perhaps Edomite/Idumaean [[Nethinim|''nĕtînîm'' or temple helpers]] returning from the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref name="Knauf" &gt;E. A. Knauf. (1999). Qos [in] Karel van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst [eds.], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA677 ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible''], pp.674-677. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing: “This clan or family must havbe been of Edomite or Idumaean origin.” (p.677).&lt;/ref&gt; The noun frequently appears combined with names on documents recovered from excavations in [[Elephantine]], where a mixed population of Arabs, Jews and Idumeans lived under the protection of a Persian-Mesopotamian garrison.

==Origins, meaning and cult==
Qōs may mean ''[[Bow and arrow|bow]]''.&lt;ref name="Dicou" /&gt; It is speculated that this god may have been interchangeable with [[Yahweh]], [[Baal]], [[Hadad|Haddu/Hadad]] and [[Dushara]], these five names being epithets for a common deity. Unlike the chief god of the [[Ammon]]ites ([[Moloch|Milkom]]) and the [[Moabites]] ([[Chemosh]]), the [[Tanakh]] refrains from explicitly naming the Edomite Qōs&lt;ref name="Knauf" /&gt; and Yahweh hailed from [[Mount Seir|Se'ir]] in the region of [[Edom]].&lt;ref name="Knauf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Judges]] 5:5; [[Psalms]], 68:9.&lt;/ref&gt; The omission may be explained, according to some scholars, by the close similarity of Yahweh with Qōs, making rejection of the latter difficult.&lt;ref name="Dicou" /&gt; Both Qōs and Yahweh are probably words of Arabic origin,&lt;ref name="Dicou" /&gt; and Knauf and others argue that [[YHWH]] is a northern Arabic word, from the [[Semitic root]] ''hwy'', meaning "he blows".&lt;ref name="Dicou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson" &gt;James S. Anderson. (2015 ). [https://books.google.it/books?id=vr7NCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101 ''Monotheism and Yahweh's Appropriation of Baal''], p.101. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Knauf concludes that the two are typologically similar, being:
&lt;blockquote&gt;forms of the Syrian-Arabian weather-god, among whose attributes the bow is as much a part of as the storm.&lt;ref name="Dicou" &gt;Bert Dicou. (1994). [https://books.google.it/books?id=B3ytAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 ''Edom, Israel's Brother and Antagonist: The Role of Edom in Biblical Prophecy and Story''], pp.167-181. A&amp;C Black. “Gestalten der syrisch-arabischen Wettergottes, zu dessen Attributen der Bogen genauso gehört wie der Sturm.” (p.177).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recently the view has been advanced that Yahweh was originally an Edomite/[[Kenite]] god of metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;Nissim Amzallag. (2009). [http://jot.sagepub.com/content/33/4/387.full.pdf+html Yahweh, the Canaanite God of Metallurgy?]. ''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]'', ''33'' (4), 387-404.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this approach Qōs might possibly have been a title for Yahweh, rather than a name.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; A further point connecting Yahweh with Qōs, aside from their common origin in that territory, is that the Edomite cult of the latter shared characteristics of the former. Thus we find that [[Doeg the Edomite|Dō’êḡ the Edomite]] has no problem in worshiping Yahweh, he is shown to be at home in Jewish sanctuaries, circumcision was practiced in Edom.&lt;ref name="Manyanya" /&gt;
Qōs became identified with [[Quzah]], “the archer” in the north Arabian pantheon, worshiped both as a mountain and a weather god. The similarity of the name would have permitted an assimilation of Qōs to the Arabian god of the rainbow, ''qaws quzaḥ''.&lt;ref name="Teixido" /&gt;

The worship of Qōs appears to originally have been located in the Hisma area of southern Jordan and north Arabia, where a mountain, ''Jabal al-Qaus,'' still bears that name.&lt;ref name="Knauf" /&gt; He entered the Edomite pantheon as early as the 8th century {{sm|b.c.}} M. Rose speculates that, prior to Qōs's advent, Edom worshipped Yahweh — a connection going back the early Egyptian references to YWH in the land of the [[Shasu]]&lt;ref&gt;The toponym ''t3 š3św'' (YWH in the land of Shasu) is at times identified with Seìir and Edom. (Dicou 1994, pp.179-180).&lt;/ref&gt; — and the former then overlaid the latter and assumed supremacy there when the Idumeans lost their autonomy under Persian rule, perhaps compensating for the destruction of national independence, a mechanism similar to that of the strengthening of Yahweh worship after the fall of the Jewish kingdom.&lt;ref name="Knauf" /&gt;
Qōs is described as a “King”, is associated with light, and defined as “mighty”. His works are described as ones where he “adorns, avenges,  blesses, chooses(?) gives.”&lt;ref name="Smith" &gt;[[Morton Smith]]. (1984).

[[File:Properties of regolith on Eros.jpg|thumb|Surface of asteroid [[433 Eros]]]]
'''Regolith''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|ɡ|əl|ɪ|θ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/regolith|title=regolith - Definition of regolith in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a layer of loose, [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] [[superficial deposits]] covering solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It includes [[dust]], [[soil]], broken rock, and other related materials and is present on [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], some [[asteroid]]s, and other [[terrestrial planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moons]].

==Etymology==
The term ''[[wiktionary:regolith|regolith]]'' combines two [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words: ''rhegos'' (ῥῆγος), "blanket", and ''lithos'' (λίθος), "rock".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. S. and Anderson, S. P., 2010, ''Geomorphology: The Mechanics and Chemistry of Landscapes''. Cambridge University Press, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|regolith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|r(h{{=}}gos|ρῆγος}}, {{LSJ|li/qos|λίθος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The American geologist [[George Perkins Merrill|George P. Merrill]] first defined the term in 1897, writing:

{{quote|In places this covering is made up of material originating through rock-weathering or plant growth ''[[in situ]]''. In other instances it is of fragmental and more or less decomposed matter drifted by wind, water or ice from other sources. This entire mantle of unconsolidated material, whatever its nature or origin, it is proposed to call the regolith.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, G. P. (1897) ''Rocks, rock-weathering and soils''. New York: MacMillan Company, 411p.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eggleton 2001 ''Regolith Geology and Geomorphology: Nature and Process'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]], UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Scott &amp; C. Pain 2009 ''Regolith Science''. [[CSIRO Publishing]], Australia&lt;/ref&gt; includes the following subdivisions and components:

* [[soil]] or [[pedolith]]
* [[alluvium]] and other transported cover, including that transported by [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]], [[Plucking (glaciation)|glacial]], marine, and [[Mass wasting|gravity flow]] processes.
* "saprolith'", generally divided into the
** ''upper [[saprolite]]'': completely oxidised [[bedrock]]
** ''lower saprolite'': chemically reduced partially [[weathered rocks]]
** ''saprock'': fractured bedrock with weathering restricted to fracture margins.
* [[volcanic ash]] and [[lava]]s
* [[duricrust]], formed by [[cementation (geology)|cementation]] of soils, saprolith and transported material by [[clays]], [[silicates]], [[iron oxides]] and [[oxyhydroxides]], [[carbonates]] and [[sulfates]], as well as less common agents, into [[indurated]] layers resistant to weathering and erosion.
* [[groundwater]]- and water-deposited [[salts]].
* [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] and [[organic matter|organic]] components derived from it.

Regolith can vary from being essentially absent to hundreds of metres in thickness. Its age can vary from instantaneous (for an [[ash fall]] or alluvium just deposited) to hundreds of millions of years old (regolith of [[Precambrian]] age occurs in parts of Australia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Cliff Ollier|C. Ollier]] 1992 ''Ancient Landforms''. Belhaven.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regolith on [[Earth]] originates from [[weathering]] and [[biota (ecology)|biological processes]]; if it contains a significant proportion of biological compounds it is more conventionally referred to as soil. People also call various types of earthly regolith by such names as [[dirt]], [[dust]], [[gravel]], [[sand]], and (when wet) [[mud]].

On Earth, the presence of regolith is one of the important factors for most [[life]], since few [[plant]]s can grow on or within solid rock and [[animal]]s would be unable to burrow or build shelter without loose material.

Regolith is also important to engineers constructing buildings, roads and other civil works. The mechanical properties of regolith vary considerably and need to be documented if the construction is to withstand the rigors of use.

Regolith may host many mineral deposits, for example mineral sands, [[Uranium ore#Basal channel .28palaeochannel.29|calcrete uranium]], and [[lateritic nickel deposits]], among others. Elsewhere, understanding regolith properties, especially geochemical composition, is critical to geochemical and geophysical exploration for mineral deposits beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Kauranne, R. Salminen, &amp; K. Eriksson 1992 ''Regolith Exploration Geochemistry in Arctic and Temperate Terrains''. [[Elsevier]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. R. M. Butt 1992 ''Regolith Exploration Geochemistry in Tropical and Subtropical Terrains''. Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; The regolith is also an important source of construction material, including sand, gravel, [[crushed stone]], lime, and [[gypsum]].

The regolith is the zone through which [[aquifers]] are recharged and through which aquifer discharge occurs. Many aquifers, such as alluvial aquifers, occur entirely within regolith. The composition of the regolith can also strongly influence water composition through the presence of salts and acid-generating materials.

==Moon==
{{main|Lunar regolith}}
[[File:Apollo 11 bootprint.jpg|thumb|This famous image taken during [[Apollo 11]] shows the fine and powdery texture of the lunar surface.]]

Regolith covers almost the entire [[Moon|lunar]] surface, [[bedrock]] protruding only on very steep-sided crater walls and the occasional [[lava channel]]. This regolith has formed over the last 4.6 billion years from the impact of large and small [[meteoroid]]s, from the steady bombardment of [[micrometeoroid]]s and from solar and galactic charged particles breaking down surface rocks.

The impact of micrometeoroids, sometimes travelling faster than {{convert|96000|km/h|abbr=on}}, generates enough heat to melt or partially vaporize dust particles. This melting and refreezing welds particles together into glassy, jagged-edged ''agglutinates'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The regolith is generally from 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;m thick in [[Lunar mare|mare]] areas and from 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;m in the older [[Moon#Terrae|highland]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The density of regolith at the Apollo 15 landing site averages approximately 1.35 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the top 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and it is approximately 1.85g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at a depth of 60&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Alshibli | first = Khalid | title = Lunar Regolith | publisher = University of Tennessee (Knoxville) | url = http://web.utk.edu/~alshibli/research/LR/lr.php | date = 2013| accessdate = 8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Composition of lunar soil.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Relative concentration of various elements on lunar surface]]

The term [[lunar soil]] is often used interchangeably with "lunar regolith" but typically refers to the finer fraction of regolith, that which is composed of grains one centimetre in diameter or less.  Some have argued that the term "[[soil]]" is not correct in reference to the Moon because soil is defined as having [[organic matter|organic]] content, whereas the Moon has none.  However, standard usage among lunar scientists is to ignore that distinction.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  "Lunar dust" generally connotes even finer materials than lunar soil, the fraction which is less than 30 micrometers in diameter. The average chemical composition of regolith might be estimated from the relative concentration of elements in lunar soil.

The physical and optical properties of lunar regolith are altered through a process known as [[space weathering]], which darkens the regolith over time, causing [[ray system|crater rays]] to fade and disappear.

During the early phases of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] Moon landing program, [[Thomas Gold]] of [[Cornell University]] and part of [[President's Science Advisory Committee]] raised a concern that the thick dust layer at the top of the regolith would not support the weight of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] and that the module might sink beneath the surface.  However, Joseph Veverka (also of Cornell) pointed out that Gold had miscalculated the depth of the overlying dust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/thomas-gold-astrophysicist-and-innovator-is-dead-at-84.html|title=Thomas Gold, Astrophysicist And Innovator, Is Dead at 84|first=Jeremy|last=Pearce|date=24 June 2004|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was only a couple of centimeters thick.  Indeed, the regolith was found to be quite firm by the robotic [[Surveyor program|Surveyor]] spacecraft that preceded Apollo, and during the Apollo landings the astronauts often found it necessary to use a [[hammer]] to drive a [[core sample|core sampling]] tool into it.

==Mars==
{{main|Martian soil}}
[[File:PIA08440-Mars Rover Spirit-Volcanic Rock Fragment.jpg|thumb|Martian sand and boulders photographed by NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'']]
[[File:PIA10741 Possible Ice Below Phoenix.jpg|thumb|left|Regolith beneath NASA's [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'']] Mars Lander, where the descent thrusters have apparently cleared away several patches of dust to expose the underlying ice.]]
[[File:Deimos Surface.png|thumb|The surface of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], a moon of [[Mars]], is covered by a layer of regolith estimated to be {{convert|50|m |ft|abbr=on}} thick. ''[[Viking 2]]'' orbiter image is from a height of {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}.]]

[[Mars]] is covered with vast expanses of sand and dust, and its surface is littered with rocks and boulders. The dust is occasionally picked up in vast planet-wide [[dust storm]]s. Mars dust is very fine and enough remains suspended in the atmosphere to give the sky a reddish hue. 

The sand is believed to move only slowly in the Martian winds due to the very low density of the atmosphere in the present epoch. In the past, liquid water flowing in gullies and river valleys may have shaped the Martian regolith. Mars researchers are studying whether [[groundwater sapping]] is shaping the Martian regolith in the present epoch and whether [[carbon dioxide clathrate|carbon dioxide hydrates]] exist on Mars and play a role. It is believed that large quantities of water and carbon dioxide ices remain frozen within the regolith in the equatorial parts of Mars and on its surface at higher latitudes.

==Asteroids==
[[File:Erosregolith.jpg|thumb|left|Taken from just 250 m above the surface of Eros as the ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'' spacecraft was landing, this image shows an area that is only 12 m across.]]
Asteroids have regoliths developed by meteoroid impact.  The final images taken by the [[NEAR Shoemaker]] spacecraft of the surface of [[433 Eros|Eros]] are the best images of the regolith of an asteroid.  The recent Japanese [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]] mission also returned clear images of regolith on an asteroid so small it was thought that gravity was too low to develop and maintain a regolith.  The asteroid [[21 Lutetia]] has a layer of regolith near its north pole, which flows in landslides associated with variations in albedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Titan==
[[File:Huygens surface color.jpg|thumb|upright|Pebbles on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s surface, imaged from a height of about 85 cm by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|Huygens spacecraft]]]]  
[[File:Swimming in Dunes.jpg|thumb|left|Dunes on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s surface in a radar image taken by the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft of a region approximately 160 by 325 kilometers (99 by 202 miles)]]

[[Saturn]]'s largest [[Moons of Saturn|moon]] [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is known to have extensive fields of dunes, though the origin of the material forming the dunes is not known - it could be small fragments of water ice eroded by flowing methane, or possibly particulate organic matter that formed in Titan's atmosphere and rained down on the surface.  Scientists are beginning to call this loose icy material ''regolith'' because of the [[mechanics|mechanical]] similarity with regolith on other bodies, although traditionally (and [[etymology|etymologically]]) the term had been applied only when the loose layer was composed of [[mineral]] grains like [[quartz]] or [[plagioclase]] or rock fragments that were in turn composed of such minerals.  Loose blankets of ice grains were not considered to be regolith because when they appear on Earth in the form of [[snow]] they behave differently from regolith, the grains melting and fusing with only small changes in pressure or temperature.  However, Titan is so cold that ice behaves like rock. Thus there is an ice-regolith complete with [[erosion]] and [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] and/or [[sediment]]ary processes.

The [[Huygens (spacecraft)|Huygens probe]] used a [[penetrometer]] on landing to characterize the mechanical properties of the local regolith. The surface itself was reported to be a [[clay]]-like "material which might have a thin crust followed by a region of relative uniform consistency."  Subsequent analysis of the data suggests that surface consistency readings were likely caused by ''Huygens'' displacing a large pebble as it landed, and that the surface is better described as a 'sand' made of ice grains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4417503.stm Titan probe's pebble 'bash-down'], BBC News, April 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The images taken after the probe's landing show a flat plain covered in pebbles. The pebbles, which may be made of water ice, are somewhat rounded, which may indicate the action of fluids on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/0115_The_Planetary_Societys_Huygens_Weblog.html New Images from the Huygens Probe: Shorelines and Channels, But an Apparently Dry Surface] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829220423/http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/0115_The_Planetary_Societys_Huygens_Weblog.html |date=2007-08-29 }}, Emily Lakdawalla, 2005-01-15, verified 2005-03-28&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rich fen''' is a type of [[fen]] that is rich in calcium, with a [[pH]] around 6-8, but nutrient poor. These special conditions have given the rich fens a specialized and species rich flora, which often consists of [[orchid]]s, [[sedges]] and [[mosses]] (Rydin et al. 1999). The rich fens are often classified into the categories moderately rich fen and extremely rich fen. The extremely rich fens have a higher pH and more [[vascular plants]] (Rydin et al. 1999).

== Threats ==

Historically rich fens have been used as meadows and pastures, but the practices ceased during the 20th century (Emanuelsson 2009). Many [[wetland]] areas, among them the rich fens, were drained in the 19th and 20th century to create new agricultural land or to increase productivity in the forestry (Emanuelsson 2009). There are several other threats though, that might cause degradation and loss of rich fens such as [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]], [[eutrophication]] and overgrowth by trees and bushes because of lack of management. [[Habitat fragmentation]] is an ongoing threat that leads to reduced connectivity within the landscape. Small and isolated fragments hold in general fewer species than larger and less isolated areas. One reason is that it is more difficult for the species to disperse between the isolated fragments (Hunter et al. 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3794">'''Richard Pickersgill''' (18 April 1749 in [[West Tanfield]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]] – July 1779 in [[London]]) was an English naval officer who accompanied the sailor and explorer [[James Cook]] on two of his South Seas trips.&lt;ref name="diary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/ralph-jackson-s-diary-part-5-richard-pickersgill |title=Ralph Jackson’s diary - Part 5: Richard Pickersgill |publisher=Captain Cook Society |access-date=2018-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crew-data"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/richard-pickersgill |title=Captain James Cook R.N. Crew Database Richard Pickersgill |publisher=Captain Cook Society |access-date=2018-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Pickersgill was born in 1749 in West Tanfield, near [[Ripon]], to Richard and Ann Pickersgill (née Lee). Pickersgill was the nephew of John Lee, the servant of George Jackson, a senior officer in the Admiralty. It is believed that his uncle managed to position him through his relationships on his first ships.&lt;ref name="diary"/&gt;

In 1766, at the age of 17, he participated in the circumnavigation of the world under Captain [[Samuel Wallis]] on the [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|Dolphin]]. Two years later, on August 26, 1768, Pickersgill belonged as a [[Master's mate]] to the [[HMS Endeavour|Endeavor]] team, which set off with James Cook to its first South Sea voyage. On this trip he also impressed Cook, who had a high opinion of his skills as a surveyor, his dealings with the indigenous peoples they encountered, and his judgment. When Robert Molineux, the [[Master (naval)|Master]] of the Endeavor, died on the return journey to England, Pickersgill was promoted to Master on April 16, 1771.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/cook/james/c77j/crew.html |title=Captain Cook’s Journal |publisher=University of Adelaide |access-date=2018-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to London Pickersgill was promoted on Cook's recommendation to [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]]. On July 13, 1772 Cook began his second expedition with the [[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]] and Richard Pickersgill belonged as the third Lieutenant back to the team.

He did not accompany Cook on his third voyage, but in April 1776 took command of the ship ''Lyon'' and was sent to [[Baffin Bay]] on the east coast of [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/pickersgill-interview-broadcast-on-radio |title=Pickersgill Interview Broadcast on Radio |publisher=Captain Cook Society |access-date=2018-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Glyn |date=2003 |title=Voyages of Delusion |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300098662 |pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Pickersgill died in 1779 at the age of 30, when he accidentally fell into the Thames when he entered a ship and drowned.&lt;ref name="crew-data" /&gt;

According to Richard Pickersgill, the [[Pickersgill Islands]] in the South Atlantic and [[Pickersgill Harbour]], a natural harbor in [[New Zealand]], were named.

River [[ecosystem|ecosystems]] are flowing waters that drain the landscape, and include the [[Biotic component|biotic]] (living) interactions amongst plants, animals and micro-organisms, as well as [[abiotic]] (nonliving) physical and chemical interactions of its many parts.&lt;ref name=Ang&gt;Angelier, E.  2003.  Ecology of Streams and Rivers.  Science Publishers, Inc., Enfield. Pp. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BiologyConcepts&amp;Connections&gt;”Biology Concepts &amp; Connections Sixth Edition”, Campbell, Neil A. (2009), page 2, 3 and G-9. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; River ecosystems are part of larger [[Drainage basin|watershed]] networks or catchments, where smaller [[headwater]] streams drain into mid-size streams, which progressively drain into larger river networks. 

River ecosystems are prime examples of lotic ecosystems. ''Lotic'' refers to flowing water, from the [[Latin]] ''lotus'', meaning washed. Lotic waters range from [[Spring (water)|spring]]s only a few centimeters wide to major [[river]]s kilometers in width.&lt;ref name=Allan&gt;Allan, J.D.  1995.  Stream Ecology: structure and function of running waters. Chapman and Hall, London.  Pp. 388.
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this article applies to lotic ecosystems in general, including related lotic systems such as [[stream]]s and [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. Lotic ecosystems can be contrasted with [[lentic ecosystems]], which involve relatively still terrestrial waters such as lakes, ponds, and [[Wetland|wetlands]]. Together, these two ecosystems form the more general study area of freshwater or [[aquatic ecology]].

The following unifying characteristics make the ecology of running waters unique among aquatic habitats.&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;Giller, S. and B. Malmqvist.  1998.  The Biology of Streams and Rivers. Oxford University Press, Oxford.  Pp. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Flow is unidirectional.
::* There is a state of continuous physical change.
::* There is a high degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity at all scales ([[microhabitat]]s).
::* Variability between lotic systems is quite high.
::* The biota is specialized to live with flow conditions.

==Abiotic factors==
The non living components of an ecosystem are called abiotic components

===Water flow===
Unidirectional water flow is the key factor in lotic systems influencing their ecology. Stream flow can be continuous or intermittent, though . Stream flow is the result of the summative inputs from groundwater, precipitation, and overland flow. Water flow can vary between systems, ranging from torrential rapids to slow backwaters that almost seem like lentic systems. The speed or velocity of the water flow of the water column can also vary within a system and is subject to chaotic turbulence, though water velocity tends to be highest in the middle part of the stream channel (known as the [[Thalweg|thalveg]]). This turbulence results in divergences of flow from the mean downslope flow vector as typified by eddy currents.  The mean flow rate vector is based on variability of friction with the bottom or sides of the channel, [[sinuosity]], obstructions, and the incline gradient.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;  In addition, the amount of water input into the system from direct precipitation, [[snowmelt]], and/or groundwater can affect flow rate. The amount of water in a stream is measured as [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] (volume per unit time). As water flows downstream, streams and rivers most often gain water volume, so at [[Baseflow|base flow]] (i.e., no storm input), smaller headwater streams have very low discharge, while larger rivers have much higher discharge. The "flow regime" of a river or stream includes the general patterns of discharge over annual or decadal time scales, and may capture seasonal changes in flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Canadian Science Publishing|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f89-228#.W_yLUS3MxHQ|doi=10.1139/f89-228#.w_ylus3mxhq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poff|first=N.

While water flow is strongly determined by slope, flowing waters can alter the general shape or direction of the stream bed, a characteristic also known as [[geomorphology]]. The profile of the river water column is made up of three primary actions: erosion, transport, and deposition. Rivers have been described as "the gutters down which run the ruins of continents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486685888.html|title=Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology|website=store.doverpublications.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are continuously [[Erosion|eroding]], transporting, and [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] substrate, sediment, and organic material. The continuous movement of water and entrained material creates a variety of habitats, including [[riffle]]s, [[Bacterial gliding|glides]], and [[Stream pool|pools]].&lt;ref name="Cush"&gt;Cushing, C.E. and J.D.

===Light===
[[File:Overlander Falls.JPG|thumb|right|Rapids in [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]]]]

'''Light''' is important to lotic systems, because it provides the energy necessary to drive [[primary production]] via [[photosynthesis]], and can also provide refuge for prey species in shadows it casts.  The amount of light that a system receives can be related to a combination of internal and external stream variables.  The area surrounding a small stream, for example, might be shaded by surrounding forests or by valley walls.  Larger river systems tend to be wide so the influence of external variables is minimized, and the sun reaches the surface.  These rivers also tend to be more turbulent, however, and particles in the water increasingly attenuate light as depth increases.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;  Seasonal and diurnal factors might also play a role in light availability because the angle of incidence, the angle at which light strikes water can lead to light lost from reflection.  Known as [[Beers law|Beer's Law]], the shallower the angle, the more light is reflected and the amount of solar radiation received declines logarithmically with depth.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Additional influences on light availability include cloud cover, altitude, and geographic position.&lt;ref name=Brown1987&gt;Brown 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
[[File:Castle Geyser, Yellowstone, 1874.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castle Geyser]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]

Most lotic species are [[poikilotherm]]s whose internal temperature varies with their environment, thus temperature is a key abiotic factor for them. Water can be heated or cooled through radiation at the surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate.  Shallow streams are typically well mixed and maintain a relatively uniform temperature within an area. In deeper, slower moving water systems, however, a strong difference between the bottom and surface temperatures may develop.  Spring fed systems have little variation as springs are typically from groundwater sources, which are often very close to ambient temperature.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Many systems show strong [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] fluctuations and seasonal variations are most extreme in arctic, desert and temperate systems.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  The amount of shading, climate and elevation can also influence the temperature of lotic systems.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Chemistry===
[[File:Winter Forest Near Erzhausen II.jpg|thumb|right|A forest stream in the winter near [[Erzhausen]], [[Germany]]]]

Water chemistry in river ecosystems varies depending on which dissolved solutes and gases are present in the water column of the stream. Specifically river water can include, apart from the water itself, 
* dissolved inorganic matter and major ions (calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, bicarbonate, sulfide, chloride)
* dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, silica)
* suspended and dissolved organic matter
* gases (nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen)
* trace metals and pollutants

==== Dissolved ions and nutrients ====
Dissolved stream solutes can be considered either ''reactive'' or ''conservative''. Reactive solutes are readily biologically assimilated by the [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] biota of the stream; examples can include inorganic nitrogen species such as nitrate or ammonium, some forms of phosphorus (e.g., soluble reactive phosphorus), and silica. Other solutes can be considered conservative, which indicates that the solute is not taken up and used biologically; chloride is often considered a conservative solute. Conservative solutes are often used as hydrologic tracers for water movement and transport. Both reactive and conservative stream water chemistry is foremost determined by inputs from the geology of its [[drainage basin|watershed]], or catchment area. Stream water chemistry can also be influenced by precipitation,  and the addition of pollutants from human sources.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt; Large differences in chemistry do not usually exist within small lotic systems due to a high rate of mixing.  In larger river systems, however, the concentrations of most nutrients, dissolved salts, and pH decrease as distance increases from the river’s source.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

==== Dissolved gases ====
In terms of dissolved gases, [[oxygen]] is likely the most important chemical constituent of lotic systems, as all aerobic organisms require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen’s solubility in water decreases as water pH and temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water’s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of lotic animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;

==== Suspended matter ====
Rivers can also transport suspended inorganic and organic matter. These materials can include sediment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=David J.|last2=Topping|first2=David J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=John C.|last4=Griffiths|first4=Ronald E.|last5=Sabol|first5=Thomas A.|date=January 2016|title=Sediment supply versus local hydraulic controls on sediment transport and storage in a river with large sediment loads|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JF003436|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=82–110|doi=10.1002/2015jf003436|issn=2169-9003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or terrestrially-derived organic matter that falls into the stream channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=J.

===Substrate===
[[File:Gabas 007.jpg|thumb|right|Cascade in the [[Pyrénées]]]]

The inorganic [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] of lotic systems is composed of the [[geologic]] material present in the catchment that is eroded, transported, sorted, and deposited by the current.  Inorganic substrates are classified by size on the [[Wentworth scale]], which ranges from boulders, to pebbles, to gravel, to sand, and to silt.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Typically, substrate [[Particle size (grain size)|particle size]] decreases downstream with larger boulders and stones in more mountainous areas and sandy bottoms in lowland rivers.  This is because the higher gradients of mountain streams facilitate a faster flow, moving smaller substrate materials further downstream for deposition.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Substrate can also be organic and may include fine particles, autumn shed leaves, [[large woody debris]] such as submerged tree logs, moss, and semi-aquatic plants.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Substrate deposition is not necessarily a permanent event, as it can be subject to large modifications during flooding events.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;
{{clear}}

==Biotic factors==
The living components of an ecosystem are called the biotic components. Streams have numerous types of biotic organisms that live in them, including bacteria, primary producers, insects and other invertebrates, as well as fish and other vertebrates.

=== Biofilm ===
[[Biofilm]] is the combination of algae, diatoms, fungi, bacteria, plankton, and other small [[microorganism]]s that exist in a film along the [[streambed]] or [[benthos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battin|first=Tom J.|last2=Besemer|first2=Katharina|last3=Bengtsson|first3=Mia M.|last4=Romani|first4=Anna M.|last5=Packmann|first5=Aaron I.|date=April 2016|title=The ecology and biogeochemistry of stream biofilms|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2016.15|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=14|issue=4|pages=251–263|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.15|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilm assemblages themselves are complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besemer|first=Katharina|last2=Peter|first2=Hannes|last3=Logue|first3=Jürg B|last4=Langenheder|first4=Silke|last5=Lindström|first5=Eva S|last6=Tranvik|first6=Lars J|last7=Battin|first7=Tom J|date=August 2012|title=Unraveling assembly of stream biofilm communities|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3400417/|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=6|issue=8|pages=1459–1468|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.205|issn=1751-7362|pmc=3400417|pmid=22237539}}&lt;/ref&gt; and add to the complexity of a streambed. 

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] are present in large numbers in lotic waters.  Free-living forms are associated with decomposing organic material, [[biofilm]] on the surfaces of rocks and vegetation, in between particles that compose the substrate, and suspended in the [[water column]].  Other forms are also associated with the guts of lotic organisms as parasites or in [[commensal]] relationships.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Bacteria play a large role in energy recycling (see [[#Trophic relationships|below]]).&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Primary producers===
[[File:Periphyton.jpg|thumb|right|Periphyton]]
[[File:water hyacinth.jpg|thumb|right|Common water hyacinth in flower]]

Algae, consisting of [[phytoplankton]] and [[periphyton]], are the most significant sources of primary production in most streams and rivers.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Phytoplankton float freely in the water column and thus are unable to maintain populations in fast flowing streams.  They can, however, develop sizeable populations in slow moving rivers and backwaters.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Periphyton are typically filamentous and tufted algae that can attach themselves to objects to avoid being washed away by fast currents.  In places where flow rates are negligible or absent, periphyton may form a gelatinous, unanchored floating mat.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

Plants exhibit limited adaptations to fast flow and are most successful in reduced currents.  More primitive plants, such as [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s attach themselves to solid objects.  This typically occurs in colder headwaters where the mostly rocky substrate offers attachment sites.  Some plants are free floating at the water’s surface in dense mats like [[duckweed]] or [[water hyacinth]].  Others are rooted and may be classified as submerged or emergent.  Rooted plants usually occur in areas of slackened current where fine-grained soils are found.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; These rooted plants are flexible, with elongated leaves that offer minimal resistance to current.&lt;ref name=Ang/&gt;

Living in flowing water can be beneficial to plants and algae because the current is usually well aerated and it provides a continuous supply of nutrients.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; These organisms are limited by flow, light, water chemistry, substrate, and grazing pressure.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Algae and plants are important to lotic systems as sources of energy, for forming microhabitats that shelter other fauna from predators and the current, and as a food resource.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Insects and other invertebrates===
Up to 90% of [[invertebrate]]s in some lotic systems are [[insect]]s.  These species exhibit tremendous diversity and can be found occupying almost every available habitat, including the surfaces of stones, deep below the substratum in the [[hyporheic zone]], adrift in the current, and in the surface film. 

Insects have developed several strategies for living in the diverse flows of lotic systems.  Some avoid high current areas, inhabiting the substratum or the sheltered side of rocks. Others have flat bodies to reduce the drag forces they experience from living in running water.&lt;ref name="Poff_2006"&gt; {{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;. Some insects time their life events based on when floods and droughts occur. For example, some mayflies synchronize when they emerge as flying adults with when snowmelt flooding usually occurs in Colorado streams. Other insects do not have a flying stage and spend their entire life cycle in the river. 

Like most of the primary consumers, lotic invertebrates often rely heavily on the current to bring them food and oxygen.&lt;ref name="CumminsKlug"&gt; {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invertebrates are important as both consumers and prey items in lotic systems.

The common orders of insects that are found in river ecosystems include [[Ephemeroptera]] (also known as a [[mayfly]]), [[Trichoptera]] (also known as a [[caddisfly]]), [[Plecoptera]] (also known as a [[stonefly]], [[Diptera]] (also known as a true [[fly]]), some types of [[Coleoptera]] (also known as a [[beetle]]), [[Odonata]] (the group that includes the [[dragonfly]] and the [[damselfly]]), and some types of [[Hemiptera]] (also known as true bugs).

Additional invertebrate [[taxa]] common to flowing waters include [[mollusk]]s such as [[snail]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s, as well as [[crustacean]]s like [[crayfish]], [[amphipoda]] and [[crab]]s.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

===Fish and other vertebrates===
[[File:Salvelinus fontinalis.jpg|thumb|right|The [[brook trout]] is native to small streams, creeks, lakes, and spring ponds.]]
[[File:New Zealand long fin eel.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Zealand longfin eel]]s can weigh over 50 kilograms.]]

Fish are probably the best-known inhabitants of lotic systems.  The ability of a fish species to live in flowing waters depends upon the speed at which it can swim and the duration that its speed can be maintained.  This ability can vary greatly between species and is tied to the habitat in which it can survive.  Continuous swimming expends a tremendous amount of energy and, therefore, fishes spend only short periods in full current.  Instead, individuals remain close to the bottom or the banks, behind obstacles, and sheltered from the current, swimming in the current only to feed or change locations.&lt;ref name=Ang /&gt; Some species have adapted to living only on the system bottom, never venturing into the open water flow.  These fishes are [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened to reduce flow resistance and often have eyes on top of their heads to observe what is happening above them.  Some also have sensory barrels positioned under the head to assist in the testing of substratum.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;

Lotic systems typically connect to each other, forming a path to the ocean (spring → stream → river → ocean), and many fishes have life cycles that require stages in both fresh and salt water.  [[Salmon]], for example, are [[anadromous]] species that are born in freshwater but spend most of their adult life in the ocean, returning to fresh water only to spawn. [[Eel]]s are [[catadromous]] species that [[Eel life history|do the opposite]], living in freshwater as adults but migrating to the ocean to spawn.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Other vertebrate taxa that inhabit lotic systems include [[amphibian]]s, such as [[salamander]]s, [[reptile]]s (e.g. snakes, turtles, crocodiles and alligators) various bird species, and mammals (e.g., [[otter]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[hippopotamus|hippos]], and [[river dolphin]]s).  With the exception of a few species, these vertebrates are not tied to water as fishes are, and spend part of their time in terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Many fish species are important as consumers and as prey species to the larger vertebrates mentioned above.

==Trophic relationships==

===Energy inputs===
[[File:ElodeaCanadensis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elodea canadensis|Pondweed]] is an autochthonous energy source]]
[[File:Stream at the Walhalla ravine.jpg|thumb|right|Leaf litter is an allochthonous energy source]]

Energy sources can be [[Indigenous (ecology)|autochthonous]] or [[allochthonous]].

* '''Autochthonous''' (from the latin "auto" = "self) energy sources are those derived from within the lotic system.  During [[photosynthesis]], for example, [[primary producer]]s form organic carbon compounds out of carbon dioxide and inorganic matter.  The energy they produce is important for the community because it may be transferred to higher [[trophic level]]s via consumption. Additionally, high rates of [[primary production]] can introduce [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) to the waters.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Another form of autochthonous energy comes from the decomposition of dead organisms and feces that originate within the lotic system.  In this case, bacteria decompose the [[detritus]] or coarse [[particulate]] organic material (CPOM; &gt;1&amp;nbsp;mm pieces) into fine particulate organic  matter (FPOM; &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm pieces) and then further into inorganic compounds that are required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tank|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Rosi-Marshall|first2=Emma J.|last3=Griffiths|first3=Natalie A.|last4=Entrekin|first4=Sally A.|last5=Stephen|first5=Mia L.|date=March 2010|title=A review of allochthonous organic matter dynamics and metabolism in streams|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1899/08-170.1|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society|language=en|volume=29|issue=1|pages=118–146|doi=10.1899/08-170.1|issn=0887-3593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is discussed in more detail below.
* '''Allochthonous''' energy sources are those derived from outside the lotic system, that is, from the terrestrial environment.  Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litter fall or lateral leaf blow.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that have been added to the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM.   The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] from the leaf upon its saturation with water. This adds to the DOM load in the system. Next [[microbe]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] [[colonize]] the leaf, softening it as the [[mycelium]] of the fungus grows into it.  The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004).  This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for [[invertebrate|shredding invertebrate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. EPA|title=Classifications of Macroinvertebrates|url=http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/html/invertclass.html|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leave only FPOM after consumption.  These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM.  Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, [[surface runoff]], [[River bank|bank]] [[erosion]], or [[groundwater]].  Similarly, DOM can be introduced through [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] drip from rain or from surface flows&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;.

===Invertebrates===
[[Invertebrate]]s can be organized into many [[Guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]] in lotic systems.  Some species are shredders, which use large and powerful mouth parts to feed on non-woody CPOM and their associated microorganisms.  Others are [[Filter feeder|suspension feeder]]s, which use their [[setae]], filtering aparati, nets, or even secretions to collect FPOM and microbes from the water.  These species may be passive collectors, utilizing the natural flow of the system, or they may generate their own current to draw water, and also, FPOM in Allan.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Members of the gatherer-collector guild actively search for FPOM under rocks and in other places where the stream flow has slackened enough to allow deposition.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Grazing invertebrates utilize scraping, rasping, and browsing adaptations to feed on [[periphyton]] and [[detritus]]. Finally, several families are predatory, capturing and consuming animal prey. Both the number of species and the abundance of individuals within each guild is largely dependent upon food availability. Thus, these values may vary across both seasons and systems.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Fish===
Fish can also be placed into [[Guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]]. Planktivores pick [[plankton]] out of the [[water column]].  [[Herbivore]]-[[detritivore]]s are [[Bottom feeder|bottom-feeding]] species that ingest both [[periphyton]] and [[detritus]] indiscriminately.  Surface and water column feeders capture surface prey (mainly terrestrial and emerging insects) and drift ([[benthic]] invertebrates floating downstream).  Benthic invertebrate feeders prey primarily on immature insects, but will also consume other benthic invertebrates.  [[Apex predator|Top predators]] consume fishes and/or large invertebrates.  [[Omnivore]]s ingest a wide range of prey.  These can be [[floral]], [[fauna]]l, and/or  detrital in nature.  Finally, [[parasite]]s live off of host species, typically other fishes.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Fish are flexible in their feeding roles, capturing different prey with regard to seasonal availability and their own developmental stage.  Thus, they may occupy multiple feeding  guilds in their lifetime.  The number of species in each guild can vary greatly between systems, with temperate warm water streams having the most benthic invertebrate feeders, and tropical systems having large numbers of detritus feeders due to high rates of [[allochthonous]] input.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

===Local species richness===
Large rivers have comparatively more species than small streams.  Many relate this pattern to the greater area and volume of larger systems, as well as an increase in habitat diversity.  Some systems, however, show a poor fit between system size and [[species richness]].  In these cases, a combination of factors such as historical rates of [[speciation]] and [[extinction]], type of [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], [[microhabitat]] availability, water chemistry, temperature, and disturbance such as flooding seem to be important.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

===Resource partitioning===
Although many alternate theories have been postulated for the ability of [[Guild (ecology)|guild-mates]] to coexist (see Morin 1999), [[resource partitioning]] has been well documented in lotic systems as a means of reducing competition.   The three main types of resource partitioning include habitat, dietary, and temporal segregation.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

[[Niche differentiation#Spatial partitioning|Habitat segregation]] was found to be the most common type of resource partitioning in natural systems (Schoener, 1974).  In lotic systems, microhabitats provide a level of physical complexity that can support a diverse array of organisms (Vincin and Hawknis, 1998).  The separation of species by substrate preferences has been well documented for invertebrates.  Ward (1992) was able to divide substrate dwellers into six broad assemblages, including those that live in: coarse substrate, gravel, sand, mud, woody debris, and those associated with plants, showing one layer of segregation.  On a smaller scale, further habitat partitioning can occur on or around a single substrate, such as a piece of gravel.  Some invertebrates prefer the high flow areas on the exposed top of the gravel, while others reside in the crevices between one piece of gravel and the next, while still others live on the bottom of this gravel piece.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Dietary segregation is the second-most common type of resource partitioning.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; High degrees of [[Niche differentiation#Morphological differentiation|morphological specializations]] or behavioral differences allow organisms to use specific resources.  The size of nets built by some species of invertebrate [[Filter feeder|suspension feeder]]s, for example, can filter varying particle size of FPOM from the water (Edington et al. 1984).  Similarly, members in the grazing guild can specialize in the harvesting of algae or detritus depending upon the morphology of their scraping apparatus.  In addition, certain species seem to show a preference for specific algal species.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

[[Niche differentiation#Temporal partitioning|Temporal segregation]] is a less common form of resource partitioning, but it is nonetheless an observed phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Typically, it accounts for coexistence by relating it to differences in life history patterns and the timing of maximum growth among guild mates.  Tropical fishes in [[Borneo]], for example, have shifted to shorter life spans in response to the [[ecological niche]] reduction felt with increasing levels of species richness in their ecosystem (Watson and Balon 1984).

===Persistence and succession===
Over long time scales, there is a tendency for species composition in pristine systems to remain in a stable state.&lt;ref&gt;Hildrew, A.G. and P.S. Giller.  1994.  Patchiness, species interactions and disturbance in the stream [[benthos]]. In Aquatic Ecology: scale pattern and process.  (P.S. Giller, A.G. Hildrew, and D.G. Rafaelli eds.) Blackwell, Oxford.  Pp. 21–62.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been found for both invertebrate and fish species.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; On shorter time scales, however, flow variability and unusual precipitation patterns decrease habitat stability and can all lead to declines in persistence levels. The ability to maintain this persistence over long time scales is related to the ability of lotic systems to return to the original community configuration relatively quickly after a disturbance (Townsend et al. 1987). This is one example of temporal succession, a site-specific change in a community involving changes in species composition over time.  Another form of temporal succession might occur when a new habitat is opened up for [[colonization]]. In these cases, an entirely new community that is well adapted to the conditions found in this new area can establish itself.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

===River continuum concept===

}}

The [[River continuum concept]] (RCC) was an attempt to construct a single framework to describe the function of temperate lotic ecosystems from the headwaters to larger rivers and relate key characteristics to changes in the biotic community  (Vannote et al. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vannote|first=R.L|date=1980|title=The River Continuum Concept|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=37|pages=|via=Canadian Science Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical basis for RCC is size and location along the gradient from a small stream eventually linked to a large river.  Stream order (see [[Stream#Characteristics of streams|characteristics of streams]]) is used as the physical measure of the position along the RCC.

According to the RCC, low ordered sites are small shaded streams where allochthonous inputs of CPOM are a necessary resource for consumers.  As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change.  Ample sunlight should reach the bottom in these systems to support significant periphyton production.  Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse Particulate Organic Matter - larger than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine Particulate Organic Matter - smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) to these downstream ecosystems.  Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity and a lack of substrate to support plants or periphyton.  Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing.  Thus, allochthonous inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the decomposition process and through lateral inputs from floodplains.

Biota should change with this change in energy from the headwaters to the mouth of these systems.  Namely, shredders should prosper in low-ordered systems and grazers in mid-ordered sites.  Microbial decomposition should play the largest role in energy production for low-ordered sites and large rivers, while photosynthesis, in addition to degraded allochthonous inputs from upstream will be essential in mid-ordered systems.  As mid-ordered sites will theoretically receive the largest variety of energy inputs, they might be expected to host the most biological diversity (Vannote et al. 1980).&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Just how well the RCC actually reflects patterns in natural systems is uncertain and its generality can be a handicap when applied to diverse and specific situations.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; The most noted criticisms of the RCC are: 1. It focuses mostly on [[macroinvertebrates]], disregarding that plankton and fish diversity is highest in high orders; 2. It relies heavily on the fact that low ordered sites have high CPOM inputs, even though many streams lack [[riparian]] habitats; 3. It is based on pristine systems, which rarely exist today; and 4. It is centered around the functioning of temperate streams.  Despite its shortcomings, the RCC remains a useful idea for describing how the patterns of ecological functions in a lotic system can vary from the source to the mouth.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

Disturbances such as congestion by dams or natural events such as shore flooding are not included in the RCC model.&lt;ref name="Junk J.W. 1989"&gt;Junk J.W., P.B. Bayley, R.E. Sparks: “The flood pulse concept in river flood plain systems”. Canadian Special Publications of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 106. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Various researchers have since expanded the model to account for such irregularities.  For example, J.V. Ward and J.A. Stanford came up with the Serial Discontinuity Concept in 1983, which addresses the impact of [[Geomorphology|geomorphologic]] disorders such as congestion and integrated inflows.  The same authors presented the Hyporheic Corridor concept in 1993, in which the vertical (in depth) and lateral (from shore to shore) structural complexity of the river were connected.&lt;ref&gt;Ward J.V., J.A. Stanford: The Serial Discontinuity Concept of River Ecosystems.  T.D. Fontaine, S.M. Bartell: “Dynamics of Lotic Ecosystems”. Science Publications, Ann Arbor Mich  29-42. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flood pulse concept]], developed by W.J. Junk in 1989, further modified by P.B. Bayley in 1990 and K. Tockner in 2000, takes into account the large amount of nutrients and organic material that makes its way into a river from the sediment of surrounding flooded land.&lt;ref name="Junk J.W. 1989"/&gt;

==Human impacts==

===Pollution===
River pollution can include but is not limited to: increasing sediment export, excess nutrients from fertilizer or urban runoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/|title=Fertilizer Runoff Overwhelms Streams and Rivers--Creating Vast "Dead Zones"|last=Biello|first=David|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sewage and septic inputs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2015/septic-tanks-arent-keeping-poo-out-of-rivers-and-lakes/|title=Septic tanks aren't keeping poo out of rivers and lakes|last=University|first=Michigan State|work=MSUToday|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; plastic pollution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/growing-concern-over-plastic-pollution-in-rivers-and-lakes|title=Growing Concern over Plastic Pollution in Rivers and Lakes|work=The Maritime Executive|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; nano-particles, pharmaceuticals and personal care products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolpin|first=Dana W.|last2=Furlong|first2=Edward T.|last3=Meyer|first3=Michael T.|last4=Thurman|first4=E.

Pollutant sources of lotic systems are hard to control because they can derive, often in small amounts, over a very wide area and enter the system at many locations along its length. While direct pollution of lotic systems has been greatly reduced in the United States under the government’s [[Clean Water Act]], contaminants from diffuse non-point sources remain a large problem.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Agricultural fields often deliver large quantities of sediments, nutrients, and chemicals to nearby streams and rivers. Urban and residential areas can also add to this pollution when contaminants are accumulated on impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots that then drain into the system.  Elevated nutrient concentrations, especially nitrogen and phosphorus which are key components of fertilizers, can increase periphyton growth, which can be particularly dangerous in slow-moving streams.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt; Another pollutant, [[acid rain]], forms from sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emitted from factories and power stations.  These substances readily dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lotic systems through precipitation. This can lower the pH of these sites, affecting all trophic levels from algae to vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt; Mean species richness and total species numbers within a system decrease with decreasing pH.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

===Flow modification===
[[File:River Calder Weir.JPG|thumb|right|A [[weir]] on the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]

Flow modification can occur as a result of [[Dam|dams]], water regulation and extraction, channel modification, and the destruction of the river floodplain and adjacent riparian zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/freshwater/tools/kaitiaki_tools/impacts/in-stream-barriers/changes-in-flow|title=Altered water flow (hydrology)|date=2009-07-06|work=NIWA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Dam]]s alter the flow, temperature, and sediment regime of lotic systems.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Additionally, many rivers are dammed at multiple locations, amplifying the impact. Dams can cause enhanced clarity and reduced variability in stream flow, which in turn cause an increase in [[periphyton]] abundance.  \Invertebrates immediately below a dam can show reductions in species richness due to an overall reduction in habitat heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;  Also, thermal changes can affect insect development, with abnormally warm winter temperatures obscuring cues to break egg [[diapause]] and overly cool summer temperatures leaving too few acceptable days to complete growth.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt; Finally, dams fragment river systems, isolating previously continuous populations, and preventing the migrations of [[anadromous]] and [[catadromous]] species.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;

===Invasive species===
[[Invasive species]] have been introduced to lotic systems through both purposeful events (e.g. stocking game and food species) as well as unintentional events (e.g. hitchhikers on boats or fishing waders).  These organisms can affect natives via competition for prey or habitat, predation, habitat alteration, hybridization, or the introduction of harmful diseases and parasites.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Once established, these species can be difficult to control or eradicate, particularly because of the connectivity of lotic systems.   Invasive species can be especially harmful in areas that have [[endangered]] biota, such as mussels in the Southeast United States, or those that have localized [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, like lotic systems west of the Rocky Mountains, where many species evolved in isolation.

'''Stream restoration''' or '''river restoration,''' sometimes called '''river reclamation''' in the UK, describes a set of activities that help improve the environmental health of a [[river]] or [[stream]]. These activities aim to restore the natural state and functioning of the river system in support of biodiversity, recreation, flood management and landscape development.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.restorerivers.eu/RiverRestoration/Whatisriverrestoration/tabid/2614/Default.aspx |title=What is river restoration, and how to do it? |publisher=European Centre for River Restoration |location=Utrecht, Netherlands |accessdate=2014-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007051649/http://www.restorerivers.eu/RiverRestoration/Whatisriverrestoration/tabid/2614/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improved health may be indicated by expanded [[habitat]] for diverse species (e.g. fish, aquatic insects, other wildlife) and reduced stream bank [[Erosion#Water|erosion]].&lt;ref name=montgomery&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/water/restoration/streams.html |title=Stream Restoration |publisher=Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection (MCDEP) |location=Rockville, MD |accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhancements may also include improved [[water quality]] (i.e. reduction of [[water pollution|pollutant]] levels and increase of [[dissolved oxygen]] levels) and achieving a self-sustaining, functional [[Environmental flow|flow regime]] in the stream system that does not require periodic human intervention, such as [[dredging]] or construction of [[flood]] control structures.&lt;ref name="Gilman &amp; Karl"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilman |first1=Joshua B. |last2=Karl |first2=Jarrod |date=May 2009 |title=Challenges of Stream Restoration as a Stormwater Management Tool; Part 1: A designer's perspective |journal=Stormwater |volume=10 |issue=3 |url=http://www.stormh2o.com/SW/Articles/6082.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207093803/http://www.stormh2o.com/SW/Articles/6082.aspx |archive-date=2015-02-07 |doi= |issn=1531-0574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite news |title=Follow the Silt |first=Cornelia |last=Dean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/science/24stream.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stream restoration projects can also yield increased property values in adjacent areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Bailey |first1=Pam |last2=Fischenich |first2=J.

Stream restoration differs from:
*[[river engineering]], a term which typically refers to alteration of a water body for a non-environmental benefit such as navigation, flood control or water supply diversion;
*[[waterway restoration]], a term used in the [[United Kingdom]] describing alterations to a canal or river to improve navigability and related recreational amenities.

==Restoration techniques==
[[File:Robinson Creek after.jpg|thumb|right|Robinson Creek restoration project (2005) included re-shaping of stream bank slopes, addition of live willow and large rock baffles, removal of [[invasive species]] and revegetation with indigenous species.&lt;ref&gt;Mendocino County Resource Conservation District, Ukiah, CA (2008). [https://archive.is/20120805083246/http://www.ice.ucdavis.edu/nrpi/project.asp?ProjectPK=09744 "Robinson Creek Restoration Project."] Project No. DWR P13-045.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Restoration activities may range from a simple removal of a disturbance which inhibits natural stream function (e.g. repairing or replacing a [[culvert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence, J.E. M.R. Cover, C.L. May, and V.H. Resh. |title=Replacement of Culvert Styles has Minimal Impact on Benthic Macroinvertebrates in Forested, Mountainous Streams of Northern California |journal=Limnologica |year=2014 |volume=47 | doi=10.1016/j.limno.2014.02.002 |pages=7–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or removing barriers to fish such as weirs), to stabilization of [[stream bank]]s, to more active intervention such as installation of [[stormwater]] management facilities, such as  [[riparian zone restoration]] and [[constructed wetland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cronin |first1=Amanda |date=March–April 2003 |title=Restoring Paradise in Moscow, Idaho |journal=Land and Water |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=18 |url=http://www.landandwater.com/features/vol47no2/vol47no2_1.html |doi= |issn=0192-9453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[recycled water]] to augment streamflows that have been depleted as a result of human activities can also be considered a form of stream restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bischel |first=H.N. |author2=J.E. Lawrence |author3=B.J. Halaburka |author4=M.H. Plumlee |author5=A.S. Bawazir |author6=J.P. King |author7=J.E. McCray |author8=V.H. Resh |author9=R.G. Luthy |title=Renewing Urban Streams with Recycled Water for Streamflow Augmentation: Hydrologic, Water Quality, and Ecosystem Services Management |journal=Environmental Engineering Science |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=455–479 |date=1 August 2013 |url= http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ees.2012.0201 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |doi=10.1089/ees.2012.0201}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Recent studies suggest that [[Lock (water navigation)|navigation locks]] have a potential to be operated as vertical slot [[fishway]]s to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful restoration projects begin with careful study of the stream system, including the historical weather patterns, stream [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulics]], [[sediment transport]] patterns and related conditions. Researchers evaluating restoration projects have found that many of these projects subsequently fail (e.g., with flooding or excessive erosion) because the projects were not designed with a sufficient scientific basis; restoration techniques may have been selected for aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref name="Gilman &amp; Karl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean" /&gt;

===In-stream techniques===

====Channel modification====
Modifications to a [[stream channel]] may be appropriate to address degradation. Channel modifications may yield improved habitat for wildlife and plants in a stream corridor, but can result in flooding, excessive erosion or other damage if not carefully planned. Design of modifications involves a careful analysis of a complex [[fluvial]] processes.&lt;ref name="Washington-SHRG"&gt;{{Cite report |chapter=Fluvial Geomorphology (Appendix) |title=Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00043/wdfw00043.pdf |author1=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) |author2=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |author3=Washington Department of Ecology |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alterations may include channel shape (in terms of [[sinuosity]] and [[meander]] characteristics), cross-section and channel profile (slope along the channel bed). Alterations affect the [[dissipation]] of energy through the channel, which affects stream velocity and [[turbulence]], [[sediment transport|sediment]] volume and size distribution, scour, and water surface elevations, among other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |chapter=Channel Modification |title=Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00043/wdfw00043.pdf |author1=WDFW |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-22|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Double Cross-Vane Structure (8079839399).jpg|thumb|Cross-vanes]]
====Cross-vanes and related structures====
A cross-vane is a "U"-shaped structure of [[boulder]]s or logs, built across the channel to reduce velocity and energy near the stream banks. It reduces bank erosion, maintains channel capacity and provides other benefits such as improved habitat for aquatic species. Similar structures used to dissipate stream energy include the W-Weir and J-Hook Vane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Rosgen |first1=Dave |date=August 2007 |title=Stream Restoration Design |section=654.1102. Restoration phases |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/water/manage/restoration/?cid=stelprdb1044707 |chapter-url=http://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/17771.wba |publisher=Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture |location=Washington, D.C.|page=11-58 |id=National Engineering Handbook 654. 210–VI–NEH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imbricated rip rap====
Stones are placed along the stream bank in an overlapping pattern, to protect the bank from erosion or washout. This technique may be employed where the stream segment is highly confined, or where [[infrastructure]] is threatened.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;
[[File:Rock Creek - step pool 2013a.jpg|thumb|Boulder step pools installed in [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]], Washington, D.C. The pools raise the water level and allow fish to swim over a partially-submerged sewer pipe which crosses the creek.]]
====Step pools====
In downstream areas, rocks are used to build a series of pools that gradually lower the elevation of the stream and reduce stream flow.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;

====Brush layering====
Live branch cuttings are placed along the stream bank. As new plants sprout from the live branches, the roots anchor the soil and prevent erosion.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;

====Engineered log jams====
An emerging stream restoration technique is the installation of ''engineered [[log jam]]s.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |chapter=Large Wood and Log Jams |title=Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00043/wdfw00043.pdf |author1=WDFW |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-22|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reintroduction of [[large woody debris]] into a stream is a fairly recent method that is being experimented with in streams such as [[Lagunitas Creek]] in Marin County, California &lt;ref name="large-wood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawrence |first1=J.E. |last2=Resh |first2=V.H. |last3=Cover |first3=M.R. |title=Large-wood Loading from Natural and Engineered Processes at the Watershed Scale |journal=River Research and Applications |year=2014 |volume=29 |doi=10.1002/rra.2589 |pages=1030–1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thornton Creek]], in Seattle, Washington. Because of [[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]] and removal of woody debris, many streams now lack the hydraulic complexity that is necessary to maintain bank stabilization and a healthy plant/animal habitat. Engineered log jams are individually designed to meet the needs of specific restoration projects, but there are overarching design elements. One element is to anchor logs along the stream bank in order to create a physical blockade against [[erosion]]. Large wood pieces, both living &lt;ref name="large-wood"/&gt; and dead,&lt;ref name="Dixon, S.J., and Sear, D.A. 2014 9194–9210"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=S.J. |last2=Sear |first2=D.A. |title=The influence of geomorphology on large wood dynamics in a low gradient headwater stream |journal=Water Resources Research |year=2014 |volume=50 |issue=12 |doi=10.1002/2014WR015947 |pages=9194–9210}}&lt;/ref&gt; play an important role in the long-term stability of engineered log jams.  A second element of engineered [[log jam]]s is to improve fish habitat. Log jams add diversity to the water flow by creating riffles, pools, and temperature variations. This is vital to fish because it provides the right circumstances to spawn, rest, feed, hunt, and hide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

There are inherent dangers to engineered log dams. If not properly implemented, they cause erosion and sediment in unwanted areas leading to more damage than repair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Furthermore, the individual pieces of wood in logjams are rarely stable over long time periods and are naturally transported downstream where they are trapped by further logjams,&lt;ref name="Dixon, S.J., and Sear, D.A. 2014 9194–9210"/&gt; if logjams are near to urban areas this can lead to wood being trapped against bridge piers or blocking culverts.

===Off-line techniques===
[[File:Rain garden overview.jpg|thumb|A rain garden in [[Singapore]]]]
As part of a stream restoration project, [[stormwater]] management facilities may be installed in the immediate corridor or in upland areas. These facilities, which reduce the velocity and/or the volume of stormwater entering the stream channel, can also improve water quality, and include:
*[[Bioretention]] systems and [[rain garden]]s
*[[Constructed wetland]]s
*[[Infiltration basin]]s
*[[Retention basin]]s.

==Monitoring of restoration projects==
Sponsors of restoration projects may conduct [[Aquatic biomonitoring|monitoring]] of stream conditions after construction, to evaluate effectiveness. In some projects it may take considerable time before there is evidence of desired biological activity, such as fish [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]]. Therefore, monitoring efforts may be conducted for several years after a restoration project has completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/water/restoration/monitoring.html |title=Restoration Monitoring |publisher=MCDEP |access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Practical River Restoration Appraisal Guidance for Monitoring Options" is a guidance document that aims to assist all practitioners in the process of setting monitoring protocols as part of a river restoration project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_pragmo.php |title=Practical River Restoration Appraisal Guidance for Monitoring Options (PRAGMO) |publisher=River Restoration Centre (RRC)|location=Cranfield, Bedfordshire, UK |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information resources==
The River Restoration Centre, based at Cranfield University, is responsible for the National River Restoration Inventory which is used to document best practice in river watercourse and floodplain restoration, enhancement and management efforts in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_nrri.php |title=National River Restoration Inventory|publisher=RRC |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_manual.php |title=Manual of River Restoration Techniques|publisher=RRC |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other established sources for information on river and stream restoration include the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) in the United States of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/metacat?action=read&amp;qformat=nceas&amp;docid=bowdish.143 |title=The National River Restoration Science Synthesis database at NBII |publisher=National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California |location=Santa Barbara, CA |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [http://www.ecrr.org/ European Centre for River Restoration] (ECRR) which holds details of projects across Europe, and in conjunction with the LIFE+ RESTORE project, has developed a ‘[https://restorerivers.eu/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page RiverWiki]’- based inventory of river restoration case studies which is freely available to view online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://restorerivers.eu/|title=The RESTORE River Wiki Database Of River Restoration Projects |publisher=Environment Agency, UK et al |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''be'er'', meaning a well, and ''sheva'', meaning "seven".

==History ==

{{Empty section|date=May 2015}}

==In the Hebrew Bible==
Beer-sheba is mentioned 33 times in the biblical text. It is often used when describing a border, such as “from Dan to Beer-sheba” (Judges 20:1; 1 Sam. 3:20; 2 Sam. 3:10, 17:11, 24:2, 24:15; 1 Kings 4:25; 2 Kings 23:8), but it is also a significant center in the patriarchal narratives. Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba (Genesis 22:19), Abraham and Abimelech entered a covenant at Beer-sheba (Genesis 21:32), and Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba (Genesis 21:33). The Lord spoke to both Isaac and Jacob, Abraham’s son and grandson respectively, at Beer-sheba (Genesis 26:23; Genesis 46:1). Beer-sheba is also the site of two significant wells: Abraham’s well at Beer-sheba was seized by Abimelech’s men (Genesis 21:25), and Isaac’s servants dug a well at Beer-sheba also (Genesis 26:25). Additionally, archaeological evidence of the dismantling of the altar at Tel Beer-sheba strongly supports a correlation with the biblical account of the cultic reform carried out by King Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:22).&lt;ref&gt;"Horned Altar for Animal Sacrifice Unearthed at Beer-Sheva."

Tel Beer-sheba, the site of the ancient city, is located on a hill overlooking the Wadi Beer-sheba about two and a half miles east of the modern city of [[Beersheba]]. The site was excavated from 1969 to 1976 by the Tel Aviv University Institute of Archaeology, directed by Prof. [[Yohanan Aharoni]], except for the last season which was led by Prof. [[Ze'ev Herzog]]. Most of the dig was devoted to uncovering the great, fortified, Israelite city traditionally dating to the United Monarchy of [[King David]] (his reign being dated from 1000 B.C.E.) and, later, to the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (980–701 B.C.E.). During the last three seasons of excavation (1974–1976), an effort was made to go below Beer-sheba of Iron Age II to find earlier occupation. A considerable part of the site was dug down to bedrock in order to find the earliest settlements at Beer-sheba. This effort revealed four earlier occupational strata (Strata VI through IX).&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Ze’ev. "Beer-Sheba of the Patriarchs." ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 6, no. 6 (1980):12-28. Accessed October 14, 2015. http://www.basarchive.org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/bswbBrowse.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=6&amp;Issue=6&amp;ArticleID=3&amp;UserID=2216&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations were renewed by Prof Herzog between 1993 and 1995 in order to complete the uncovering of the town's water system.&lt;ref name=parks/&gt;

==Iron Age I==
[[File:Mountseirsinaiwe00hull Page 173.png|thumb|right|[[Abrahams Well]] 1855.]]
The earliest occupation at Beer-sheba during Iron Age I (Stratum IX) was represented only by seven large pits about 22 to 25 feet in diameter. Archaeologists believe that the entire settlement of this stratum covered about 2,990 sq. yards, approximately the area of half of a football field. It likely contained about 20 dwelling pits and 10 granaries and would have housed from 100 to 140 people. Stratum IX was abandoned then reused, new structures being added to the old. In Stratum VIII, which dates to the 11th century B.C.E., archaeologists found houses for the first time. Like Stratum IX, Stratum VIII was abandoned rather than destroyed. The pottery suggests that the same people who lived in Stratum VIII built Stratum VII at the end of the 11th century B.C.E., which comprised five domestic units in a possibly enclosed settlement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Herzog, “Beer-Sheba of the Patriarchs.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron Age II==

The settlement of Beer-sheba was probably first fortified during the Iron IIA. Some archaeologists believe that Beer-sheba, which was on the southern border of the fledgling Israelite kingdom, was fortified by King Saul at the end of the 11th century B.C.E. during wars against the [[Amalekites]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, on the basis of interregional comparisons and recent radiocarbon evidence, this settlement phase probably belongs in the late – 10th or 9th century B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Boaretto, E. et al. Dating the Iron Age I/II Transition in Israel: first intercomparison results. Radiocarbon 47(1), 2005; Finkelstein, I., and Piasetzky, E.

Another viewpoint. Near Eastern Archaeology 74(1): 105-111, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved layout of the Iron II city may be reconstructed from Stratum II, which dates to the late 8th century B.C.E. during the Iron IIB. At this time, the city was destroyed in a conflagration, possibly during the campaign of Sennacherib in 701 B.C.E. Reconstructed plans of the city suggest that Beer-sheba was planned as a coherent entity with areas for administrative structures and for dwellings incorporated into a single system. Fortifications included a [[casemate wall]] and a four-room city gate. Drains running under some of the streets conducted rain-water out of the city and a well-preserved water system of cisterns provided the inhabitants with water. The incorporation of the houses into the casemate wall suggests that its occupants were directly responsible for the city’s defense and reflects the military and administrative function of the entire city. Archaeologists estimate around 350 people lived in the city of Beer-sheba during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Ze'ev.

==National park; UNESCO recognition==
The site was restored by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]] in 1990. In 2003, its water system was opened to the public as well. The excavated town is now open for visitors under the name Tel Be'er Sheva National Park.&lt;ref name=parks/&gt;

In 2007, Tel Sheva was recognized as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Of more than 200 tels in Israel, Beersheba was cited as one of the most representative, containing substantial remains of a city with biblical connections.&lt;ref name="highbeam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-136038939.html |title=Israel celebrates 8 new UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

===Horned altar===
[[Image:Tel Be'er Sheva Altar 2007041.JPG|thumb|Replica of horned altar (the original is in the [[Israel Museum]])]]

One of the most significant discoveries at Tel Beer-sheba is that of a horned animal altar, the first ever unearthed in Israel. Altars with horns at each of their four corners are mentioned frequently in the Bible (Lev. 4:7, 18, 25; Ex. 29:12, 30:2; 38:2; 1 Kings 1:50; 2:28). The altar was not found assembled in situ, but was discovered in secondary use—the stones of the altar had later been incorporated into a wall. There was an unresolved debate about the dating of the altar between Professor Aharoni and Professor Yigael Yadin of Hebrew University that remains undecided. Professor Aharoni believed that the Beer-sheba altar was one of the altars which was dismantled as part of Hezekiah’s religious reforms. Its stones were then reused in an 8th-century wall, and the wall itself was destroyed at the end of the 8th century, probably during Sennacherib’s Judean campaign of 701&amp;nbsp;B.C. However, Professor Yadin of Hebrew University dates this wall more than 100 years later than Professor Aharoni. According to Professor Yadin, the wall was probably destroyed about the time the Babylonians captured and destroyed Jerusalem (587&amp;nbsp;B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;”Horned Altar for Animal Sacrifice Unearthed at Beer-Sheva."

'''''The Birds of America''''' is a book by [[natural history|naturalist]] and painter [[John James Audubon]], containing illustrations of a wide variety of [[List of birds of the United States|birds of the United States]]. It was first published as a series in sections between 1827 and 1838, in [[Edinburgh]] and London. Not all of the specimens collected in the work were collected by Audubon himself, some were sent to him by [[John Kirk Townsend]] who had collected them on [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]]'s 1834 expedition with [[Thomas Nuttall]].&lt;ref&gt; Mearns, B. &amp; R. ''John Kirk Townsend: Collector of Audubon’s Western Birds and Mammals'' (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River' by John Kirk Townsend &lt;/ref&gt; 

The work consists of 435 hand-coloured, life-size [[Printmaking|prints]], made from [[engraving|engraved]] plates, measuring around {{convert|39|by|26|in|cm}}. It includes images of six now-[[Extinction|extinc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t birds:  [[Carolina parakeet]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[Labrador duck]], [[great auk]], [[Eskimo curlew]], and [[Heath hen|pinnated grouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web4.audubon.org/bird/boa/ExtinctBirds.html|title=Birds Extincted since Audubon's time|first=National Audubon|last=Society|website=web4.audubon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historians describe the quality of Audubon's work as being of high and printed with "artistic finesse."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The plant-life backgrounds of some 50 of the bird studies were painted by Audubon's assistant [[Joseph Mason (artist)|Joseph Mason]] but he is not credited for his work in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, DeVere.

==Early publication history==
[[File:1 Wild Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plate 1 by [[John James Audubon]] depicting a wild turkey, ([[Wild turkey|''Meleagris gallopavo'']]).]]
About 1820, around the age of 35, Audubon declared his intention to paint every bird in North America.&lt;ref name="NYT2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/arts/antiques-central-park-s-winged-tenants-by-audubon.html|title=Central Park's Winged Tenants, By Audubon|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In his bird art, he mainly forsook oil paint, the medium of serious artists of the day, in favour of [[watercolours]] and pastel crayons (and occasionally pencil, charcoal, chalk, [[gouache]], and pen and ink). As early as 1807, he developed a method of using wires and threads to hold dead birds in lifelike poses while he drew them.&lt;ref name="NYT2003"/&gt;
[[File:AudubonCarolinaParakeet2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Audubon Carolina parakeet ([[Carolina Parakeet|''Conuropsis carolinensis'']])&lt;br/&gt;now extinct]]
In 1823, Audubon went to [[Philadelphia]] and New York, looking for financial support using [[Subscription business model|subscription]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to enable him to publish his artwork. He sold the copper engraving plates through on a subscription basis in North America and Europe. Those subscribed obtained five plates at a time. Each subscriber received prints of three smaller birds, a larger bird and a mid-sized bird. The prints were produced from 1827 to 1838 that cost each subscriber around $1,000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is equivalent to $24,600 in 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/1838-dollars-in-2015|title=1838 dollars in 2015 {{!}} Inflation Calculator|website=www.in2013dollars.com|language=en|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that no more than 120 complete sets exist today. Each set consists of 435 individual plates that are based upon the original paintings. Each plate was engraved, printed, and hand colored by Robert Havell of London. While William Lizars, of Edinburgh, engraved the first ten plates, Havell actually finished some of those.

Audubon often found support lacking.&lt;ref name="NYT2003" /&gt; As a result, in 1826, he set sail for the United Kingdom with 250 of his original illustrations, looking for the financial support of subscribers and the technical abilities of [[Engraving|engraver]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/exhibitions/audubon/influence#lizars|title=Audubon and men of influence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting his drawings in [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], he journeyed to Edinburgh, where he met the accomplished engraver [[William H. Lizars]]. Lizars engraved up to ten of the first plates but was unable to continue the project when his colourists went on strike.&lt;ref name="loccat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/artgall/audubon/birds_of_america.htm|title=Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum|publisher=University of Liverpool|work=liv.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Audubon engaged the noted London animal engraver [[Havell family|Robert Havell Jr.]], and his father, [[Havell family|Robert Havell Sr]]. Havell Jr. oversaw the project through to its completion in 1838.&lt;ref name="Liverpool" /&gt;

The original edition of ''The Birds of America'' (sometimes called the Havell Edition&lt;ref name="minnies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minniesland.com/study_Havell_Edition.html|title=Original Audubon Prints - Antique Natural History Prints - Books - Havell - Bien - Imperial Folio - Bird and Animal Prints|work=minniesland.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619135214/http://www.minniesland.com/study_Havell_Edition.html|archivedate=19 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; after its printer, and sometimes called the [[Book size|"Double Elephant Folio"]], because of its size) was printed on handmade paper 39.5 inches tall by 28.5 inches wide. The principal printing technique was [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] etching, but engraving and [[aquatint]] were also used.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt; Colorists applied each color in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work).&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, 2004, pp. 273, 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audubon funded the costly printing project through a pay-as-you-go subscription. From 1826 to 1829, he travelled around the UK and to Paris, lecturing on ornithology and frontier American life&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; in an effort to entice wealthy patrons to subscribe to the series of prints. Subscribers included the French king [[Charles X]], the British queen [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]], and, later, the Americans [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Henry Clay]].&lt;ref name="NYT2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/03/books/antiques-rarae-aves-audubon-at-auction.html|title=Rarae Aves: Audubon At Auction|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints were issued in sets of five every month or two in tin cases&lt;ref name="NYT2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/arts/antiques-vibrant-birds-of-america-via-germany.html|title=Vibrant Birds Of America, Via Germany|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each set usually included one very large bird, one medium-sized bird, and three small birds.&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; The plates were published unbound and without any text to avoid having to furnish free copies to the public libraries in England.&lt;ref name="loccat"/&gt; It is estimated that not more than 200 complete sets were ever compiled.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; An accompanying text, issued separately, was written by Audubon and the Scottish naturalist and ornithologist [[William MacGillivray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/biographies/william-macgillivray/|title=William MacGillivray|work=nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in five volumes in [[Edinburgh]] between 1831 and 1839, under the title ''Ornithological Biography, or, An account of the habits of the birds of the United States of America''.&lt;ref name="loccat"/&gt; The additional cost of the five volumes of text brought the total cost of plates and text to about $1000.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt;

After the folio edition was completed, Audubon decided to produce a more affordable edition and employed a lithographer from Philadelphia named J. T. Bowen. Bowen and his team created a smaller [[Octavo#Size|Royal Octavo]] edition, which was issued to subscribers in seven volumes and completed in 1844 after selling 1,199 sets.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Five more octavo editions were completed through 1877. The octavo edition used the text of the Ornithological biography but increased the number of plates to 500, separating some birds which had originally appeared together. Some new drawings were included, mostly by John Woodhouse though Audubon and members of Bowen's team also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audubonhouse.org/audubon/octavo/bowen.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703042004/http://www.audubonhouse.org/audubon/octavo/bowen.cfm |archivedate=3 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abirdshome.com/Audubon/VolI/00000.html|title=The Registry Of Nature Habitats - Audubon Birds of America - Publisher's Preface|work=abirdshome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bien Edition (after [[chromolithography]] pioneer Julius Bien), was a full-sized reissue published in 1858 by Roe Lockwood in New York under the supervision of Audubon's youngest son, John Woodhouse Audubon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Ron|title=The Bien Edition / The Project, Quality, Errors and Market Value|url=http://www.auduboninfo.net/articles/BIEN%20ESSAY.htm|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the Civil War, the edition was never finished; only 15 parts of the 44 part series were completed. This edition consisted of 105 plates and included none of the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audubongalleries.com/guide/guide.php |title=Audubon Galleries Original Audubon Books and Prints |publisher=Audubongalleries.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 100 subscriptions were sold, making this edition rarer than other early editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Flynn |url=http://www.auduboninfo.net/articles/audubon_story.htm |title=About Audubon and His Octavo Edition Prints |publisher=Auduboninfo.net |date= |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audubon's practice of obtaining his subjects has been described as:“Audubon used what we like to call today as the barrel-of-the-shotgun method...After he killed the birds, he would use a complex system of wires and strings to position the birds. Previous artists would draw the birds in a stiff position, but Audubon was different. He drew the birds in dynamic ways, by positioning them how he would observe them in the field.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A full 8-volume, double-elephant folio version is on public display in the Audubon Room at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. This, the first book purchased by the University, was bought in 1839 for $970 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|970|1839|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}), at the time an amazing sum. The entire volume of 435 plates is also available for viewing online at the University of Michigan's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umich.edu/audubon-room/pictureit-rare-book-reader|title=PictureIt Rare Book Reader|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the [[Louisiana State University]] Libraries have hosted "Audubon Day," a semi-annual public showing of all four volumes of LSU's copy of the ''Birds of America.'' The set formerly belonged to one of the original subscribers, the [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], and was purchased with a grant from the Crown Zellerbach Corporation in 1964. In recent years, the event has drawn more than 200 visitors. It was profiled in a 2011 ''[[Wall Street Journal]] ''article titled "The Joys of Slow Looking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576327750299277440|title=Birds of America by John James Audubon at Hill Memorial Library at Louisiana State University-The Joys of Slow Looking|work=Wall Street Journal|author=Willard Spiegelman|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[University of Pittsburgh]], which owns a complete collection of ''Birds of America'' that had been recently restored and preserved by the Etherington Conservation Center, mounted a major exhibition of 62 selected plates and other materials in its [[Frick Fine Arts Building#University Art Gallery|University Art Gallery]]. Following this, the university constructed an exhibit case on the ground floor of the school's [[Hillman Library]] to continuously display a rotating selection of plates to the public. Single plates have been exhibited for two weeks at a time in plate number order.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/a/audubon/about.html | title=Audubon at Pitt | publisher=University Library System, University of Pittsburgh | year=2008 | accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the university undertook a project to digitize every plate from ''Birds of America'', as well as Audubon's ''Ornithological Biography'', and, for the first time, presented the complete set for public viewing through one site on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/a/audubon/|title=Audubon's Birds of America|work=pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08064/862193-42.stm | title=Audubon's 'Birds' now in flock on one Web site | first=Bob | last=Hoover | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=4 March 2008 | accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2017/11/14/John-James-Audubon-falcons-birds-of-prey-National-Aviary-Hillman-Library/stories/201711150043|title=Free Audubon Day includes prints, lectures|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=29 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event, called "Audubon day" was first conducted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.pitt.edu/Audubon_Day_2012|title=Pitt’s University Library System Hosts Second Annual Audubon Day|publisher= University of Pittsburgh News|website=www.news.pitt.edu|language=en|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pittnews.com/article/64902/news/birders-flock-to-audubons-art/|title=Birders flock to Audubon's art - The Pitt News|date=2 November 2015|work=The Pitt News|access-date=29 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Three Pilgrimage Festivals''', in [[Hebrew]] '''''Shalosh Regalim''''' (שלוש רגלים), are three major festivals in [[Judaism]]—[[Pesach]] (''Passover''), [[Shavuot]] (''Weeks'' or ''Pentecost''), and [[Sukkot]] (''Tabernacles'', ''Tents'' or ''Booths'')—when the ancient [[Israelite]]s living in the [[Kingdom of Judah]] would make a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], as commanded by the [[Torah]]. In Jerusalem, they would participate in festivities and ritual worship in conjunction with the services of the [[Kohen|kohanim]] ("priests") at the Temple.

After the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] and until the building of the [[Third Temple]], the actual pilgrimages are no longer obligatory upon Jews, and no longer take place on a national scale. During [[synagogue]] [[Jewish services|services]] the related passages describing the holiday being observed are read aloud from a [[Torah scroll]] on the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] (platform) used at the center of the synagogue services. During the [[Jewish holiday]]s in modern-day Israel, many Jews living in or near Jerusalem make an effort to attend prayer services at the [[Western Wall]] emulating the ancient pilgrimages in some small fashion. [[Samaritans]] make pilgrimages to [[Mount Gerizim]] three times a year to this day.

==Sources in the Hebrew Bible==

* [[Book of Exodus]] ({{em|emphasis added}}): "Offer a sacrifice to Me {{em|three times each year}}.

Then count seven weeks for yourself. From the time that you first put the sickle to the standing grain, you must count seven weeks. You shall then celebrate the festival of [[Shavuot]] to God your Lord, presenting a hand-delivered offering according to the extent of the blessing that God your Lord has granted you.... When you bring in the products of your [[threshing floor]] and wine vat, you shall celebrate the festival of [[Sukkot]] for seven days.... {{em|Three times each year}}, all your males shall thus be seen in the presence of God your Lord in the place that He will choose: on the festival of matzahs, on the festival of Shavuot, and on the festival of Sukkot. You shall not appear before God empty-handed."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11203">The island country of [[Bermuda]] has been affected by several [[tornado]]es and [[waterspout]]s in its history.

== December 1925 tornado ==
In the early hours of December 12, 1925 a weak tornado affected [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]].  Beginning as a waterspout, it moved into the Ireland Island
Dock Yard. The ''Ormonde'', a ship docked there, was nearly capsized, and the ship's [[barometer]] recorded an instantaneous drop of 4 [[millibar|mb]]. Moving onto land as a tornado, the vortex damaged roofs, sheds, and fences as it tore across the island. An office in the ship yard which contained another [[weather station]] was also struck&amp;mdash;the barometer there recorded a drop of 6&amp;nbsp;mb. The damage path was approximately 300 yards across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/054/mwr-054-10-0428b.pdf| title = An Early Morning Tornado at Bermuda| accessdate = 2006-11-10| author = Unknown|date=October 1926| format = PDF| work = [[Monthly Weather Review]]| publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]| pages = 428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== January 1986 tornadoes ==
On January 12, 1986, two tornadoes struck the north and south shores of the Main Island.  The first one, which touched down near [[Devonshire, Bermuda|Devonshire]], caused significant damage as it cut across the island.  The second tornado affected [[St. David's, Bermuda|St. David's]], on the north shore, less than two hours later.  Several boats were sunk by the two twisters as they moved over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6DD1131F931A25752C0A960948260| title = Tornadoes in Bermuda Tear Roofs Off Homes| accessdate = 2006-11-10| author = Associated Press| authorlink = Associated Press| date = 1986-01-12| work = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Emily September 1987 ==
On September 25, 1987 [[Hurricane Emily (1987)| Hurricane Emily]] made landfall in Bermuda as a category one hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]]. The fast moving hurricane was associated with several damaging tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1987-prelim/emily/prelim04.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

== February 1993 ==
Damaging winds, possibly related to tornadic activity impacted the island early in the morning on February 19th 1993. The storms effects were felt hardest in Sandy's Parish and along North Shore. One person was injured and 100 customers lost electricity in the storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/19930220/NEWS/302209992|title=Island pounded by fierce freak storm - The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News|website=royalgazette.com|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== March 1999 ==
There were several reports of tornadoes on March 4, 1999. One tornado was spotted offshore and another was spotted later in the day coming ashore in Smith's parish damaging a construction site and two homes. Bermuda Weather Service did not make a conclusion on whether this was a tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/19990305/NEWS/303059976|title=Suspected tornado rips through Smith's - The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News|website=royalgazette.com|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== April 2000 ==
A reported tornado damaged Spice Valley high school as it struck in the evening on April 27 2000. The Bermuda Weather Service meteorologists indicated active thunderstorms in the area possibly produced an isolated tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20000428/NEWS/304289982|title=Island - The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News|website=royalgazette.com|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Fabian September 2003 ==
Several unconfirmed reports of tornadoes spawned by [[Hurricane Fabian]] as it made a direct-hit on the island on September 5, 2003. One such possible tornado severely damaged St. George's Preparatory school. It was impossible to discern tornado damage from hurricane damage and so these reported tornadoes went unconfirmed.

== January 2004 ==
Weekend severe weather on the morning of January 10, 2004 included reports of tornadoes striking parts of Pembroke, Hamilton, Southampton and Warwick parishes. Damage was reported at the local Saltus Grammar School and nearby neighborhoods in Pembroke where the Bermuda Weather Service confirmed a tornado struck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20040112/NEWS/301129992|title=It was like a freight train coming through' - The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News|website=royalgazette.com|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== July 2005 ==
A 'freak storm' struck parts of Smith's parish at around 6:30am  on July 16, 2005 causing some roof damage. While residents were convinced it was a tornado, and Bermuda Weather Service radar suggested severe weather in the area, they could not conclusively say whether this was tornado damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20050118/NEWS/301189984|title=Storm causes damage in Smith's - The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News|website=royalgazette.com|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Florence September 2006==
Unconfirmed reports of tornado damage well in advance of [[Hurricane Florence (2006)|Hurricane Florence]] in Southampton as the outer bands of the hurricane spiraled across the island on the afternoon of September 10th, 2006.

== December 2009 ==
On December 19th, 2009, a tornado touched down in downtown Hamilton, Pembroke parish. It created a swath of damage from Pitt's Bay road to First Avenue in the Cavendish Heights area of Pembroke. Hardest hit areas included the commercial areas of Reid Street from Queen Street to Court Street, and parts of Bermudiana Road. Automated recording stations on Hinson's Island reported a wind gust of {{convert|64|kn|mph km/h}}. Although there were no reports of serious injuries, there was significant tree and roof damage, and the tornado was estimated to be an EF1 or EF2 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. There were other reports of tornadoes that turned out to be straight line winds from severe thunderstorms at Devonshire Bay, where trees were snapped and  a fence was reported to have been knocked over. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.weather.bm/DownloadsAndPresentations/19Dec2009_TornadoReport_webversion.pdf| title = Report on Tornado &amp; Severe Thunderstorm 19, December 2009| accessdate = 2010-04-02| author = BWS| date = December 2009| format = PDF| publisher = [[Bermuda Weather Service]]| pages = 1–7| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151602/http://www.weather.bm/DownloadsAndPresentations/19Dec2009_TornadoReport_webversion.pdf| archivedate = 2011-07-06| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Sandy October 2012 ==
On October 28, 2012, showers associated with the outermost circulation of a distant [[Hurricane Sandy]] were affecting the island. One of these showers briefly produced a tornado that resulted in roof damage and boundary wall damage to structures in Somerset Village in Sandy's Parish. The Bermuda Weather Service rated the tornado an F-0 on the [[Fujita Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL182012_Sandy}}| title = Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Sandy| accessdate = 3 January 2015 | author = Eric S.

'''Transit 5E-1''', [[International Designator]] 1963-038C, is an [[artificial satellite]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]] and launched in September 28, 1963, aboard a [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]] rocket from the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]].

==Launch==
Transit 5E-1 was launched for studying charged particles, [[magnetic field]]s and [[solar spectra]], as well as doing [[geodesy|geodetic]] research.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

It was launched to a [[polar orbit]], from where it did geomagnetic and geodetic measurements. Electrical power was produced by four [[solar panel]]s. After August 1969, the satellite did measurements infrequently. The last data were transmitted in November, 1974.

'''Water retention curve''' is the relationship between the [[water content]], θ,  and the soil [[water potential]], ψ. This curve is characteristic for different types of soil, and is also called the '''soil moisture characteristic'''.

It is used to predict the soil water storage, water supply to the plants ([[field capacity]]) and soil aggregate stability. Due to the [[Hysteresis#Matric potential hysteresis|hysteretic]] effect of water filling and draining the pores, different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.

The general features of a water retention curve can be seen in the figure, in which the volume water content, θ, is plotted against the matric potential, &lt;math&gt;\Psi_m&lt;/math&gt;. At potentials close to zero, a soil is close to saturation, and water is held in the soil primarily by capillary forces. As θ decreases, binding of the water becomes stronger, and at small potentials (more negative, approaching [[wilting point]]) water is strongly bound in the smallest of pores, at contact points between grains and as films bound by adsorptive forces around particles.

Sandy soils will involve mainly capillary binding, and will therefore release most of the water at higher potentials, while clayey soils, with adhesive and osmotic binding, will release water at lower (more negative) potentials. At any given potential, peaty soils will usually display much higher moisture contents than clayey soils, which would be expected to hold more water than sandy soils. The water holding capacity of any soil is due to the porosity and the nature of the bonding in the soil.

==Shape parameters==

The shape of water retention curves can be characterized by several models, one of them known as the van Genuchten model:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400050002x |last1=van Genuchten |first1=M.Th. |title=A closed-form equation for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils |journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal |year=1980 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=892–898|bibcode=1980SSASJ..44..892V }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(\psi) = \theta_r + \frac{\theta_s - \theta_r}{\left[ 1+(\alpha |\psi|)^n \right]^{1-1/n}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; is the water retention curve [L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;];
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi|&lt;/math&gt; is suction pressure ([L] or cm of water);
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; saturated water content [L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;];
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_r&lt;/math&gt; residual water content [L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;];
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is related to the inverse of the air entry suction, &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; ([L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;], or cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;); and,
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the pore-size distribution, &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (dimensionless).

Based on this parametrization a prediction model for the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity - saturation - pressure relationship was developed.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Buckingham |first=Edgar |author-link=Edgar Buckingham |year=1907 |title=Studies on the movement of soil moisture |series=Bureau of Soils, Bulletin |volume=38 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://archive.org/details/studiesonmovemen38buck }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wrc Buckingham.jpeg|thumb|left|The first published Water retention curve (1907)]] --&gt;
In 1907, [[Edgar Buckingham]] created the first water retention curve.&lt;ref name="Buckingham" /&gt; It was measured and made for six soils varying in texture from sand to clay. The data came from experiments made on soil columns 48 inch tall, where a constant water level maintained about 2 inches above the bottom through periodic addition of water from a side tube. The upper ends were closed to prevent evaporation.

==Method==
The van Genuchten parameters (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) can be determined through field or laboratory testing. One of the methods is the instantaneous profile method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watson, K.K.. |year=1966 |title=An instantaneous profile method for determining the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated porous materials |journal=Water Resources Research |volume=2|pages=709–715|issue=4 |bibcode = 1966WRR.....2..709W |doi = 10.1029/WR002i004p00709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[water content]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (or [[effective saturation]] &lt;math&gt;Se&lt;/math&gt;) are determined for a series of suction pressure measurements &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Due to the non-linearity of the equation, numerical techniques such as the non-linear [[least-squares]] method can be used to solve the van Genuchten parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seki, K. |year=2007|title=SWRC fit - a nonlinear fitting program with a water retention curve for soils having unimodal and bimodal pore structure |journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions |volume=4|pages=407–437|doi=10.5194/hessd-4-407-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chou, T.K.|year=2016|title=A free GUI application for solving the van Genuchten parameters using non-linear least-squares minimization and curve-fitting|journal=www.cmcsjc.com|volume=January|pages=1–5|url=http://cmcsjc.com/programs/2016.Chou.vGS.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074022/http://cmcsjc.com/programs/2016.Chou.vGS.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of the estimated parameters will depend on the quality of the acquired dataset (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;).

[[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] '''William Bligh''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (9 September 1754 – 7 December 1817) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] and a colonial administrator. The [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] occurred during his command of {{HMS|Bounty}} in 1789; after being set adrift in ''Bounty''{{'}}s [[Launch (boat)|launch]] by the mutineers, Bligh and his loyal men reached [[Timor]], a journey of {{convert|3618|nmi}}.

Seventeen years after the ''Bounty'' mutiny, on 13 August 1806, he was appointed [[Governor of New South Wales]] in [[Australia]], with orders to clean up the corrupt [[rum]] trade of the [[New South Wales Corps]]. His actions directed against the trade resulted in the so-called [[Rum Rebellion]], during which Bligh was placed under arrest on 26 January 1808 by the New South Wales Corps and deposed from his command, an act which the British Foreign Office later declared to be illegal. He died in [[Lambeth, London|Lambeth]], [[London]] on 7 December 1817.

==Early life==

William Bligh was born on 9 September 1754, but it is not clear where. It is likely that he was born in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]], as he was baptised at [[St Andrew's Church, Plymouth]] on 4 October 1754,&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography, Volumes 1-20, 22&lt;/ref&gt; where Bligh's father, Francis (1721–1780), was serving as a customs officer. Bligh's ancestral home of Tinten Manor near [[St Tudy]] near [[Bodmin]], Cornwall, is also a possibility. Bligh's mother, Jane Pearce (1713–1768), was a widow (née Balsam) who married Francis at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sttudy.org.uk/Bligh/bligh.htm Vice-Admiral William Bligh]&lt;/ref&gt; Bligh was signed for the [[Royal Navy]] at age seven, at a time when it was common to sign on a "young gentleman" simply to gain, or at least record, the experience at sea required for a commission. In 1770, at age 16, he joined HMS ''Hunter'' as an [[Able Seaman (rank)|able seaman]], the term used because there was no vacancy for a [[midshipman]]. He became a midshipman early in the following year. In September 1771, Bligh was transferred to {{HMS|Crescent|1779|2}} and remained on the ship for three years.

In 1776, Bligh was selected by [[Post Captain|Captain]] [[James Cook]] (1728–1779), for the position of [[sailing master]] of {{HMS|Resolution|1771|2}} and accompanied Cook in July 1776 on Cook's third voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]], during which Cook was killed. Bligh returned to England at the end of 1780 and was able to give details of Cook's last voyage.

Bligh married Elizabeth Betham, daughter of a customs collector (stationed in [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]), on 4 February 1781. The wedding took place at nearby [[Onchan]].&lt;ref name="Onchan"&gt;Trevor Kneale, ''The Isle of Man'', Pevensey Island Guides, Brunel House, Newton Abbot, Devon, 2007, {{ISBN|1-898630-25-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he was appointed to serve on [[French frigate Belle Poule (1765)|HMS ''Belle Poule'']] as master (senior warrant officer responsible for navigation). Soon after this, in August 1781, he fought in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] under [[Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet|Admiral Parker]], which at last won him his commission as a lieutenant. For the next 18 months, he was a lieutenant on various ships. He also fought with [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] at [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] in 1782.

Between 1783 and 1787, Bligh was a captain in the merchant service. Like many lieutenants, he would have found full-pay employment in the Navy; however, commissions were hard to obtain with the fleet largely demobilised at the end of the War with France when allied with the North American rebelling colonies in the [[American Revolutionary War|War of American Independence]] (1775–1783). In 1787, Bligh was selected as commander of His Majesty's Armed Transport ''[[HMS Bounty|Bounty]]''. He rose eventually to the rank of [[vice admiral]] in the Royal Navy.

==Naval career==
William Bligh's naval career involved various appointments and assignments. He first rose to prominence as Master of ''Resolution'', under the command of Captain James Cook. Bligh received praise from Cook during what would be the latter's final voyage. Bligh served on three of the same ships on which [[Fletcher Christian#Naval Career|Fletcher Christian]] also served simultaneously in his naval career.

In the early 1780s, while in the merchant service, Bligh became acquainted with a young man named [[Fletcher Christian]] (1764–1793), who was eager to learn navigation from him. Bligh took Christian under his wing, and the two became friends.

==Voyage of ''Bounty''==
{{main article|Mutiny on the Bounty}}

The mutiny on the Royal Navy vessel HMAV Bounty occurred in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on 28 April 1789. Led by [[Master's Mate]] / Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian, disaffected crewmen seized control of the ship, and set Bligh and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship's open launch. The mutineers variously settled on [[Tahiti]] or on [[Pitcairn Island]]. Meanwhile, Bligh completed a voyage of more than 3,500 nautical miles (6,500&amp;nbsp;km; 4,000&amp;nbsp;mi) to the west in the launch to reach safety north of [[Australia]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern [[Indonesia]]) and began the process of bringing the mutineers to justice.

===First breadfruit voyage===
[[File:Mutiny HMS Bounty.jpg|thumb|auto|The [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutineers]] turning Lt Bligh and some of the officers and crew adrift from His Majesty's Ship {{HMS|Bounty||6}}. By [[Robert Dodd (artist)|Robert Dodd]]]]In 1787, Bligh took command of ''Bounty.'' In order to win a premium offered by the [[Royal Society]], he first sailed to [[Tahiti]] to obtain [[breadfruit]] trees, then set course east across the South Pacific for [[South America]] and the [[Cape Horn]] and eventually to the [[Caribbean Sea]], where breadfruit was wanted for experiments to see whether it would be a successful food crop for [[Africa|African]]  slaves there on British colonial plantations in the [[West Indies]] islands. The notion that breadfruit had to be collected from Tahiti was intentionally misleading. Tahiti was merely one of many places where the esteemed seedless breadfruit could be found. The real reason for choosing Tahiti has its roots in the territorial contention that existed then between [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbach, Karl Ernst Alwyn. 'Conspiracy on the Bounty: Bligh's Convenient Mutiny'. 2012, printed University of Queensland, hardcover/Kindle, 366 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-9806914-1-2}}.  [see Appendix Four — An Afterword on Banks and his Breadfruit, pp. 309-314].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bounty'' never reached the Caribbean, as [[mutiny]] broke out on board shortly after the ship left Tahiti.

The voyage to Tahiti was difficult. After trying unsuccessfully for a month to go west by rounding South America and [[Cape Horn]], ''Bounty'' was finally defeated by the notoriously stormy weather and opposite winds and forced to take the longer way to the east around the southern tip of [[Africa]] ([[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]). That delay caused a further delay in Tahiti, as he had to wait five months for the breadfruit plants to mature sufficiently to be potted in soil and transported. ''Bounty'' departed Tahiti heading east in April 1789.

===Mutiny===
Because the vessel was rated only as a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], ''Bounty'' had no officers other than Bligh (who was then only a commissioned lieutenant), a very small crew, and no Marines to provide protection from hostile natives during stops or to enforce security on board ship. To allow longer uninterrupted sleep, Bligh divided his crew into three watches instead of two, placing his protégé [[Fletcher Christian]]—rated as a Master's Mate—in charge of one of the watches. The [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny]], which took place on 28 April 1789 during the return voyage, was led by Christian and supported by eighteen of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mutiny of the Bounty|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/mutiny.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had seized firearms during Christian's night watch and surprised and bound Bligh in his cabin.

[[File:Wr Bligh Journal fl3156809 a286171.jpg|thumb|Account of arrival at Timor, 14 June 1789. Log of the Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship Bounty, 1789, bound manuscript, [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110339148 Safe 1 / 47]]]Despite being in the majority, none of the loyalists put up a significant struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a {{convert|23|ft|adj=mid}} [[Launch (boat)|launch]] (so heavily loaded that the [[gunwale]]s were only a few inches above the water). They were allowed four [[cutlass]]es, food and water for perhaps a week, a [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and a compass, but no charts, or [[marine chronometer]]. Most of these were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on ''Bounty'' for their useful skills; they were later released in [[Tahiti]].

Tahiti was upwind from Bligh's initial position, and was the obvious destination of the mutineers. Many of the loyalists claimed to have heard the mutineers cry "Huzzah for Otaheite!" as ''Bounty'' pulled away. [[Timor]] was the nearest [[Europe|European]] colonial outpost in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern [[Indonesia]]), {{convert|3618|nmi|abbr=on}} away. Bligh and his crew first made for [[Tofua]], only a few leagues distant, to obtain supplies. However, they were attacked by hostile natives and John Norton, a quartermaster, was killed.&lt;ref&gt;"The Bounty" by Caroline Alexander.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleeing from Tofua, Bligh did not dare to stop at the next islands to the west (the [[Fiji]] islands), as he had no weapons for defence and expected hostile receptions. He did however keep a log entitled "Log of the Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship Bounty Lieut. Wm Bligh Commander from Otaheite towards Jamaica" which he used to record events from 5 April 1789 to 13 March 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first= William|last=Bligh|item = [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110339148 Log of the Proceedings of His Majestys Ship Bounty Lieut.

[[File:Mutineers of the Bounty by Jules Verne, illustration by Leon Bennett.jpg|thumb|auto|Original illustration by S. Drée from French author [[Jules Verne]]'s story "[[The Mutineers of the Bounty]]" (Les Révoltés de la Bounty) (1879).]]Bligh had confidence in his navigational skills, which he had perfected under the instruction of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]. His first responsibility was to bring his men to safety. Thus, he undertook the seemingly impossible {{convert|3618|nmi|adj=on}} voyage to Timor, the nearest European settlement. Bligh succeeded in reaching Timor after a 47-day voyage, the only casualty being the crewman killed on Tofua. From 4 May until 29 May, when they reached the [[Great Barrier Reef]] north of [[Australia]], the 18 men lived on {{convert|1/12|lb|g|abbr=off|-1}} of bread per day. The weather was often stormy, and they were in constant fear of foundering due to the boat's heavily laden condition. On 29 May they landed on a small island off the coast of Australia, which they named [[Ma’alpiku Island National Park|Restoration Island]], 29 May 1660 being the date of the restoration of the British monarchy after the [[English Civil War]]. Over the next week or more they island-hopped north along the Great Barrier reef—while Bligh, cartographer as always, sketched maps of the coast. Early in June they passed through the [[Endeavour Strait]] and sailed again on the open sea until they reached [[Kupang|Coupang]], a settlement on Timor, on 14 June 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first= William|last=Bligh|item = [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110339148 Log of the Proceedings of His Majestys Ship Bounty Lieut.

===Possible causes of the mutiny===
The reasons behind the mutiny are still a subject of debate. Some sources report that Bligh was a cruel tyrant whose abuse of the crew led them to feel that they had no choice but to take over the ship. Other sources argue that Bligh was no worse (and, in many cases, objectively gentler) than the average captains and naval officers of the era, and that the crew—inexperienced and unused to the rigours of the sea—were corrupted by the freedom, idleness and sexual licence of their five months in Tahiti, finding themselves unwilling to return to the "[[Jack Tar]]'s" life of an ordinary seaman.

This view holds that most of the men supported Christian's prideful personal vendetta against Bligh out of a misguided hope their new captain would return them to Tahiti and allow them to live out their lives in hedonistic peace, free from Bligh's acid tongue and strict discipline. This rationale is supported by most modern historians and reinforced by the ultimate decision of 16 out of 24 of the active mutineers to demand Fletcher return them to Tahiti (despite his rational protestations that it was the last [[Port#Port of call|port of call]] for the ''Bounty'' and inevitably the first place the Admiralty would search once word of the mutiny was received or the ship was reported overdue).

The mutiny is made more mysterious by the friendship of Christian and Bligh, which dates back to Bligh's days in the merchant service. Christian was well acquainted with the Bligh family. As Bligh was being set adrift he appealed to this friendship, saying "you have dandled my children upon your knee". According to Bligh, Christian "appeared disturbed" and replied, "That,—Captain Bligh,—that is the thing;——I am in hell—I am in hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Bligh's Narrative of the Mutiny on the Bounty|location=London|publisher=George Nicol|year=1790|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bounty/blighnarrative.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bounty''{{'}}s log shows that Bligh resorted to punishments relatively sparingly. He scolded when other captains would have whipped, and whipped when other captains would have hanged. He was an educated man, deeply interested in science, convinced that good diet and sanitation were necessary for the welfare of his crew. He took a great interest in his crew's exercise, was very careful about the quality of their food, and insisted upon the ''Bounty''{{'}}s being kept very clean. He tried (unsuccessfully) to check the spread of venereal disease among the men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The modern historian [[John Beaglehole]] has described the major flaw in this otherwise enlightened naval officer: "[Bligh made] dogmatic judgements which he felt himself entitled to make; he saw fools about him too easily … thin-skinned vanity was his curse through life … [Bligh] never learnt that you do not make friends of men by insulting them."&lt;ref name="The Life of Captain James Cook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beaglehole|first1=John |author1-link=John Beaglehole |title=The Life of Captain James Cook|date=1974|publisher=Stanford University|location=Stanford, California|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with [[Edward Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Edwards]] of {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}, who was sent on the Royal Navy's expedition to the South Pacific to find the mutineers and bring them to trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed Bligh as being. The 14 men from ''Bounty'' who were captured by Edwards' men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on ''Pandora''{{'}}s quarterdeck. Yet, when ''Pandora'' ran aground on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. Finally, Captain Edwards gave orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges, the armourer's mate, went into the cell to remove the prisoners' irons. Unfortunately, before he could finish the job, the ship sank. Four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the sinking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cages before jumping off the sinking vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.southbank.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Histories+of+Queensland/Transport+Maritime+History/~/media/4AC2615C4B2645F992EF72EB80A5BC99.pdf |title=The Pandora Story |publisher=Queensland Museum |date=14 August 2010 |format=PDF |first=Stephen |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
In October 1790, Bligh was honourably acquitted at the court-martial inquiring into the loss of ''Bounty.'' Shortly thereafter, he published ''A Narrative of the Mutiny on board His Majesty's Ship "Bounty"; And the Subsequent Voyage of Part of the Crew, In the Ship's Boat, from Tofoa, one of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch Settlement in the East Indies.'' Of the 10 surviving prisoners eventually brought home in spite of ''Pandora'''s loss, four were acquitted, owing to Bligh's testimony that they were non-mutineers that Bligh was obliged to leave on ''Bounty'' because of lack of space in the launch. Two others were convicted because, while not participating in the mutiny, they were passive and did not resist. They subsequently received royal pardons. One was convicted but excused on a technicality. The remaining three were convicted and hanged.

===Bligh's letter to his wife, Betsy===
The following is a letter to Bligh's wife, written from [[Kupang|Coupang]], [[Timor]], [[Dutch East Indies]] (circa June 1791), in which the first reference to events on ''Bounty'' is made.
[[File:William Bligh - Project Gutenberg eText 15411.jpg|thumbnail|right|250|William Bligh, pictured in his 1792 account of the mutiny voyage, ''A Voyage to the South Sea'']]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My Dear, Dear Betsy,

I am now, for the most part, in a part of the world I never expected, it is however a place that has afforded me relief and saved my life, and I have the happiness to assure you that I am now in perfect health....

Know then my own Dear Betsy, that I have lost the ''Bounty'' ... on the 28&amp;nbsp;April at day light in the morning Christian having the morning watch. He with several others came into my Cabin while I was a Sleep, and seizing me, holding naked Bayonets at my Breast, tied my Hands behind my back, and threatened instant destruction if I uttered a word. I however call'd loudly for assistance, but the conspiracy was so well laid that the Officers Cabbin Doors were guarded by Centinels, so Nelson, Peckover, Samuels or the Master could not come to me. I was now dragged on Deck in my Shirt &amp; closely guarded – I demanded of Christian the case of such a violent act, &amp; severely degraded for his Villainy but he could only answer – "not a word sir or you are Dead." I dared him to the act &amp; endeavoured to rally some one to a sense of their duty but to no effect....

The Secrisy of this Mutiny is beyond all conception so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it. It is unbeknown to me why I must beguile such force. Even Mr. Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite [Tahiti] that he also turned Pirate, so that I have been run down by my own Dogs...

My misfortune I trust will be properly considered by all the World – It was a circumstance I could not foresee – I had not sufficient Officers &amp; had they granted me Marines most likely the affair would never have happened – I had not a Spirited &amp; brave fellow about me &amp; the Mutineers treated them as such. My conduct has been free of blame, &amp; I showed everyone that, tied as I was, I defied every Villain to hurt me...

I know how shocked you will be at this affair but I request of you My Dear Betsy to think nothing of it all is now past &amp; we will again looked forward to future happyness.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strictly speaking, the crime of the mutineers (apart from the disciplinary crime of [[mutiny]]) was not piracy but [[barratry (admiralty law)|barratry]], the misappropriation, by those entrusted with its care, of a ship and/or its contents to the detriment of the owner (in this case the British Crown).

==Second breadfruit voyage==
After his exoneration by the [[court-martial]] [[inquiry]] into the loss of ''Bounty'', Bligh remained in the Royal Navy. From 1791 to 1793, as master and commander of {{HMS|Providence|1791|6}} and in company with {{HMS|Assistant|}} under the command of [[Nathaniel Portlock]], he undertook again to transport [[breadfruit]] from [[Tahiti]] to the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/banks/section-09|title=The Second Breadfruit Voyage of William Bligh|website=State Library of NSW|access-date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also transported plants provided by [[Hugh Ronalds]], a nurseryman in [[Brentford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2017|title=Ronalds Nurserymen in Brentford and Beyond|url=|journal=Garden History|volume=45|pages=82–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was generally successful, and [[Breadfruit#In history|breadfruit]] is a popular food in [[Puerto Rico]]; however, its immediate objective, which was to provide a cheap and nutritious food for the [[Africa|African]] slaves in the [[West Indies]] islands around the [[Caribbean Sea]] was not made, as most slaves refused to eat the new food. During this voyage, Bligh also collected samples of the [[ackee|ackee fruit]] of [[Jamaica]], introducing it to the [[Royal Society]] in Britain upon his return.&lt;ref name="kew.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014213759/http://kew.org/ksheets/fruits.html Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Information Sheets: Staple Foods II – Fruits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ackee's scientific name ''Blighia sapida'' in [[binomial nomenclature]] was given in honour of Bligh.

==Subsequent career and the Rum Rebellion==

In February 1797, while Bligh was captain of {{HMS|Director|1784|6}}, he surveyed the [[River Humber]], preparing a map of the stretch from [[Spurn]] to the west of [[Sunk Island]].

In April–May, Bligh was one of the captains whose crews mutinied over "issues of pay and involuntary service for common seamen" during the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies#Spithead|Nore mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tx68AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=The+naval+mutinies+of+1797&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eajOT_6ODsOxgwezrtS6CQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Mutinies of 1797]&lt;/ref&gt; The mutiny was not triggered by any specific actions by Bligh; the mutinies "were widespread, [and] involved a fair number of English ships".&lt;ref name="h2g2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3970352|title=William Bligh – Vice Admiral of the Blue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst ''Director'''s role was relatively minor in this mutiny, she was the last to raise the white flag at its cessation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he learned "that his common nickname among men in the fleet was 'that Bounty bastard'."&lt;ref name="h2g2"/&gt;

As captain of ''Director'' at the [[Battle of Camperdown]] on 11 October, Bligh engaged three Dutch vessels: ''Haarlem'', ''Alkmaar'' and [[Dutch ship Vrijheid|''Vrijheid'']]. While the Dutch suffered serious casualties, only seven seamen were wounded on ''Director''. ''Director'' captured ''Vrijheid'' and the Dutch commander Vice-Admiral [[Jan de Winter]].

Bligh went on to serve under [[Horatio Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]] on 2 April 1801, in command of {{HMS|Glatton|1795|2}}, a 56-gun [[ship of the line]], which was experimentally fitted exclusively with [[carronades]]. After the battle, Nelson personally praised Bligh for his contribution to the victory. He sailed ''Glatton'' safely between the banks while three other vessels ran aground. When Nelson pretended not to notice [[Hyde Parker (Royal Navy officer, born 1739)|Admiral Parker]]'s signal "43" (stop the battle) and kept the signal "16" hoisted to continue the engagement, Bligh was the only captain in the squadron who could see that the two signals were in conflict. By choosing to fly Nelson's signal, he ensured that all the vessels behind him kept fighting.

[[File:Arrest of Govenor Bligh.jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda cartoon of Bligh's arrest in Sydney in 1808, portraying him as a coward]]

Bligh had gained the reputation of being a firm disciplinarian. Accordingly, he was offered the position of [[Governor of New South Wales]] on the recommendation of Sir [[Joseph Banks]] (President of the Royal Society and a main sponsor of the breadfruit expeditions) and appointed in March 1805, at £2,000 per annum, twice the pay of the retiring Governor [[Philip Gidley King]]. He arrived in Sydney on 6 August 1806,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18516841 |title=A Place In History. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Herald (Sydney)|The Sunday Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=9 November 1952 |accessdate=2 May 2012 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become the fourth governor. As his wife Elizabeth had been unwilling to undertake a long sea voyage, Bligh was accompanied by his daughter [[Mary Putland]] who would be the Lady of Government House; Mary's husband John Putland was appointed as William Bligh's [[aide-de-camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Anne-Maree, 'William Bligh', in David Clune and Ken Turner (eds), ''The Governors Of New South Wales 1788–2010'', Federation Press, Sydney, 2009, pp. 87–105, {{ISBN|978-1-86287-743-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Sydney, his confrontational administrative style provoked{{cn|date=July 2017}} the wrath of a number of influential settlers and officials. They included the wealthy landowner and businessman [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] and prominent Crown representatives such as the colony's principal surgeon, [[Thomas Jamison]], and senior officers of the [[New South Wales Corps]]. Jamison and his military associates were defying government regulations by engaging in private trading ventures for profit: Bligh was determined to put a stop to this practice.

The conflict between Bligh and the entrenched colonists culminated in another mutiny, the [[Rum Rebellion]],&lt;ref&gt;Evatt, H. V., Rum Rebellion: A Study of the Overthrow of Governor Bligh, Dawson Publishing, Folkestone, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; when, on 26 January 1808, 400 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps under the command of [[George Johnston (New South Wales)|Major George Johnston]] marched on [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] in Sydney to arrest Bligh. A petition written by John Macarthur and addressed to George Johnston was written the day of the arrest but most of the 151 signatures were gathered in the days after Bligh's overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The petition against Governor Bligh|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/rebellion/petition.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebel government was subsequently installed and Bligh, now deposed, made for [[Hobart]] in Tasmania aboard {{HMS|Porpoise|1804|6}}. Bligh failed to gain support from the authorities in Hobart to retake control of New South Wales, and remained effectively imprisoned on the ''Porpoise'' from 1808 until January 1810.

Shortly after Bligh's arrest, a watercolour illustrating the arrest by an unknown artist was exhibited in Sydney at perhaps Australia's first public art exhibition.&lt;ref name=Australiana&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neville|first=Richard|title=The Arrest of Governor Bligh: Pictures and Politics|journal=Australiana|date=May 1991|volume=13|issue=2|pages=38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watercolour depicts a soldier dragging Bligh from underneath one of the servants’ beds in Government House and with two other figures standing by. The two soldiers in the watercolour are most likely John Sutherland and Michael Marlborough and the other figure on the far right is believed to represent Lieutenant William Minchin.&lt;ref name=Australiana /&gt; This cartoon is Australia's earliest surviving political cartoon and like all political cartoons it makes use of caricature and exaggeration to convey its message.&lt;ref name=100Objects&gt;{{cite web|title=Governor Bligh’s Arrest, 1808|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-026.htm|accessdate=8 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015162122/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-026.htm#|archive-date=15 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New South Wales Corps' officers regarded themselves as gentlemen and in depicting Bligh as a coward, the cartoon declares that Bligh was not a gentleman and therefore not fit to govern.&lt;ref name=100Objects /&gt;

Of interest, however, was Bligh's concern for the more recently arrived settlers in the colony, who did not have the wealth and influence of Macarthur and Jamison. From the tombstones in Ebenezer and Richmond cemeteries (areas being settled west of Sydney during Bligh's tenure as governor), can be seen the number of boys born around 1807 to 1811 who received "William Bligh" as a [[given name]], e.g. William Bligh Turnbull b. 8 June 1809 at Windsor, ancestor of [[Malcolm Bligh Turnbull]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72543348 |title=Death of an Early Hawkesbury Settler. |newspaper=[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]] |location=NSW |date=9 July 1892 |accessdate=23 October 2015 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Bligh Johnston, b.1809 at Ebenezer, son of Andrew Johnston who designed Ebenezer Chapel, Australia's oldest extant church and oldest extant school.

[[File:Captain Bligh House London.jpg|thumb|right|William Bligh House in London]]

Bligh received a letter in January 1810, advising him that the rebellion had been declared illegal, and that the British Foreign Office had declared it to be a mutiny. [[Lachlan Macquarie]] had been appointed to replace him as governor. At this news Bligh sailed from Hobart. He arrived in Sydney on 17 January 1810 only two weeks into Macquarie's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he would collect evidence for the coming court martial in England of Major Johnston. He departed to attend the trial on 12 May 1810, arriving on 25 October 1810. In the days immediately prior to their departure, his daughter, Mary Putland (widowed in 1808), was hastily married to the new Lieutenant-Governor [[Maurice Charles O'Connell]] and remained in Sydney. The following year, the trial's presiding officers sentenced Johnston to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]], a form of disgraceful dismissal that entailed surrendering his commission in the [[Royal Marines]] without compensation. (This was a comparatively mild punishment which enabled Johnston to return, a free man, to New South Wales, where he could continue to enjoy the benefits of his accumulated private wealth.) Bligh was court martialled twice again during his career, being acquitted both times.

Soon after Johnston's trial had concluded, Bligh received a backdated promotion to [[rear admiral]]. In 1814 he was promoted again, to [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|vice admiral of the blue]]. Significantly perhaps, he never again received an important command, though with the Napoleonic Wars almost over there would have been few fleet commands available. He did, however, design the North Bull Wall at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]] in Dublin. Its purpose was to clear a sandbar by [[Venturi effect|Venturi action]]. As a result of its building, [[Bull Island|North Bull Island]] was formed by the sand cleared by the river's now more narrowly focused force. Bligh also charted and mapped [[Dublin Bay]] and recommended the building walls for a refuge harbour at what was then known as Dunleary; the large harbour and naval base subsequently built there between 1816 and 1821 was called Kingstown, later renamed [[Dún Laoghaire]].

==Death==
[[File:Grave of William Bligh, Lambeth, London - geograph.org.uk - 1411724.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Bligh's tomb, surmounted by an eternal flame, sits in the Sackler Garden at the Garden Museum.]]
Bligh died in [[Bond Street]], London on 7 December 1817 and was buried in a family plot at St. Mary's, [[Lambeth]] (this church is now the [[Garden Museum]]). His tomb, notable for its use of [[Coade stone]] (''Lithodipyra)'', a compound of clay and other materials which was moulded in imitation of carved stonework and fired in a kiln. This stoneware was produced by Eleanor Coade at her factory in Lambeth. The tomb is topped by an eternal flame, not a breadfruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=Christopher|date=April 2016|title=Captain Bligh's tomb|url=http://britain-australia.org.uk/uploads/3rdparty/AGHVol27-Bligh.pdf|journal=Australian Garden History|volume=27 (4)|pages=18-20|via=http://britain-australia.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque marks Bligh's house, one block east of the Garden Museum at 100 Lambeth Road, near the [[Imperial War Museum]].

==In literature and film==

Bligh is humorously portrayed in Sir [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]]'s short story "Frenchman's Creek" as a competent but irascible and tactless surveyor sent to a small fishing village in Cornwall during the Napoleonic Wars. His accent and strong language being misunderstood by the locals as French, he is temporarily imprisoned as a spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frenchman's Creek |first=Arthur Thomas |last=Quiller-Couch |accessdate=2 August 2014 |url=http://fullreads.com/literature/frenchmans-creek/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation in Sydney in 1810, with Bligh returning from [[Tasmania]] to be restored as governor, is the setting of Naomi Novik's fantasy novel ''Tongues of Serpents'' (Harper-Collins, 2011).

On 16 December 1964, the "Adobe Dick" episode of the cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (episode 129) paid a humorous homage to Cpt. Bligh and his ship. On the show, the characters Fred and Barney took a chartered fishing trip with the guys from the lodge on the U.S.S. ''Bountystone''. The captain of the ship, CAPT. Blah, was a domineering man with a uniform resembling the historical figure, William Bligh. [https://m.imdb.com/title/tt6612200/ Mutiny], on channel 4 in the UK, charts a recreation of Bligh's journey to Timor. It aired in 2017.

Bligh was mentioned in the film ''[[Clear History]]'' by [[Larry David]]'s character while rowing a boat off the coast of [[Martha's Vineyard]].

Bligh was mentioned in the television show [[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|''Survivor'']] during the reunion show of ''[[Survivor: Panama]]'' by Jeff Probst describing the next season ''[[Survivor: Cook Islands]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foR0v0WeWA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14m17s|title=All Survivor Season Previews Borneo - Game Changers|work=YouTube|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bligh has been portrayed in film by the following actors:

* [[George Cross (actor)|George Cross]] in ''[[The Mutiny of the Bounty]]'' (1916)
* Mayne Lynton in ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' (1933)

'''Wood wool,''' known primarily as '''excelsior''' in North America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/rulings/tariffs/44050000.html U.S. commodity code: Wood wool (excelsior)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a product made of wood slivers cut from logs and is mainly used in packaging, for cooling pads in home evaporative cooling systems known as [[swamp cooler]]s, for [[erosion control]] mats, and as a raw material for the production of other products such as bonded wood wool boards and used as stuffing for stuffed animals.

== Terminology ==

In the [[United States]] the term ''wood wool'' is reserved for finer grades of excelsior.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. Forest Service stated in 1948 and 1961 that, "In this country the product has no other general name, but in most other countries all grades of excelsior are known as wood wool. In the United States the name wood wool is reserved for only a small proportion of the output consisting of certain special grades of extra thin and narrow stock."&lt;ref name=usdaforest&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Standard Industrial Classification]] Index SIC is 2429 for the product "Wood wool (excelsior)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theodora.com/sic_w1.html U.S. [[Standard Industrial Classification]] Index SIC 2429 for "Wood wool (excelsior)"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The same term is used by the United States for the external trade number under which wood wool is monitored: HTS Number: 4405.00.00 Description: Wood wool (excelsior); [[wood flour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/rulings/tariffs/44050000.html HTS Number for Wood wool (excelsior)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 4405.00 is applied to wood wool by the [[World Customs Organization]] in the [[Harmonized System|Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcoomd.org/files/1.%20Public%20files/PDFandDocuments/Harmonized%20System/0944E.pdf Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), page 2], 4405.00 wood wool&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grades and classifications ==
The 1973 U.S. federal procurement specification PPP-E-911, cancelled in 1991, categorized "wood excelsior" products according to the following table of terms and dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.everyspec.com/FED_SPECS/P/PPP-E-911D_10605/ | title = Federal Specification: Excelsior, Wood, Fabricated Pads and Bulk Form | date = September 28, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:Excelsior.png|right|thumb|250px|A patent illustrating cooling pads of excelsior]]
Excelsior has many applications, examples include:
* a packaging material for cushioning.
* a stuffing for plush toys or for real animals in [[taxidermy]]. It was traditionally used in stuffing [[Teddy bear]]s and still is for the muzzles of some [[collectible]] bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Tradition of the excelsior stuffing | url = http://www.hermann.de/fertigung/fer_st3e.htm | publisher = HERMANN-Spielwaren GmbH | accessdate = 24 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Wood wool fibers can be compressed and when the pressure is removed they resume their initial volume. This is a useful property for minimizing their volume when shipping. Due to its high volume and large surface area, wood wool can be used for applications where water or moisture retention is necessary. The width of wood wool fibers varies from 1.5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm, while their length is usually around 500&amp;nbsp;mm (depending on the production process).

In the UK there are specifications for dimensions, pH, moisture content and freedom from dust and small pieces, set by [[British Standard]] BS 2548 for wood wool for general packaging purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.quality.co.uk/bsi/bs37.htm BS 2548 Specification for wood wool for general packaging purposes] (British Standard)&lt;/ref&gt; This standard was originally issued in 1954 and subsequently re-issued in 1986.&lt;ref name="BSI"&gt;[http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000000154977 BS 2548] BSI British Standards&lt;/ref&gt;

When these fibers are bonded with cement or [[magnesite]], bonded wood wool boards are produced. Slabs of bonded wood wool are considered environmentally friendly construction and insulation materials because they do not contain organic binders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/construction/construction-materials-components/7941928-1.html Wood Based Panels International, Friday, March 1 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/impacts/article_3027_en.html European Commission Research - Industrial Technologies, 15/09/2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood wool can be produced in either horizontal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=17313 ISO 9567:1989 Woodworking machines&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Horizontal shredding machines for wood wool production, quadruple effect&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Nomenclature]&lt;/ref&gt; or vertical shredding machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=17428 ISO 9615:1989 Woodworking machines&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Vertical shredding machines for wood wool production, with hydraulic clamping&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Nomenclature]&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible further processing option is washing, which removes dust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wineschoppen.co.uk/acatalog/gift-box-filler.html "Our wood wool is washed and cleaned to remove as much dust as possible"]&lt;/ref&gt; Wood-wool processing may involve drying to reduce moisture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winebox.co.uk/Wood-Wool-Kiln-Dried-5kg-Tolerance-250g Kiln dried wood wool]&lt;/ref&gt; in compliance with local requirements, as in the UK.&lt;ref name="BSI" /&gt;

Finally, wood wool can be dyed to produce a variety of colored products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourseasonsflowers.com/excelsior.htm Colored Excelsior]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A different product was once known as "wood wool," as well as "pine needle-wool," or "pine wood-wool."&lt;ref&gt;

The process was chemical and made use of the leaves (needles) of [[Scots Pine]].

In England, yet another product known as wood wool was produced by the chemical breakdown of wood strips by means of [[sulphurous acid]], for use in such applications as absorbent material in surgical dressings.&lt;ref&gt;

The wood wool that is the topic of this article is what has traditionally been known as excelsior in the United States.  Fifteen U.S. patents related to "slivering machines" for producing the small wood shreds "known as ''excelsior''" were listed in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;

The earliest, a machine for "Manufacturing wood to be used as a substitute for curled hair in stuffing beds" was patented in the U.S. in 1842;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author = Wm. Baker | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=NiBBAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=fibers++wood+mattress&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1776&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=1870#PPA1,M1  | title = Machine for manufacturing wood so as to be used as a substitute for curled hair in stuffing beds | year = 1842 | work = U.S. patent 2654}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the product had no specific name when the process was first patented.

The 1868 patent, "Improved capillary material for filling gas and air carburettors,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = John A. Bassett | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=0WwAAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=60670 |  title = Improved capillary material for filling gas and air carburettors | year = 1868 | work = U.S. patent 60670}}&lt;/ref&gt; was for a new use for "fibres torn from the wood by suitable machinery" to be "sold and used as filling for mattresses, its commercial name being 'excelsior'."  This is the earliest description of the material by this name cited by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], though the term "excelsior mattress" had appeared in print as early as 1856.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the now-common use of excelsior in the cooling pads of evaporative coolers appeared in a patent that stated, "I have found that excelsior makes a very cheap and good material for this purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author = John Zellweger | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=04pHAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=cooling+excelsior&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1799&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=1910&amp;num=30#PPA2,M1| title = Air filter and cooler | year = 1906 | work = U.S. patent 838602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century wood wool was used as a raw material for producing wood wool panels in Europe, especially in Austria. By 1930, wood wool cement boards were being widely produced.

In the 21st century, excelsior appears in numerous patents for [[erosion]] control and [[sediment control]] methods and devices; for example, the 2006 "Sediment control device and system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sediment control device and system | author = Peter S.

Evidence suggests that the anomaly was predominantly a [[volcanic winter]] event caused by the massive [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) . This eruption was the largest eruption in at least 1,300 years (after the [[extreme weather events of 535–536]]), and perhaps exacerbated by the 1814 eruption of [[Mayon]] in the Philippines.

==Description==
The Year Without a Summer was an agricultural disaster. Historian John D. Post has called this "the last great [[subsistence crisis]] in the Western world".&lt;ref name=Post1977&gt;{{cite book|last1=Post|first1=John D.|title=The last great subsistence crisis in the Western World|date=1977|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801818509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EvansRobert"&gt;Evans, Robert [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/blast-from-the-past-65102374/ Blast from the Past], ''Smithsonian Magazine''. July 2002, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The climatic aberrations of 1816 had the greatest effect on most of [[New England]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and parts of [[western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/the-sciences/is-the-meghalayan-event-a-tipping-point-in-geology|title=Is the Meghalayan Event a Tipping Point in Geology?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent "dry fog" was observed in parts of the [[eastern United States]]. The fog reddened and dimmed the sunlight, such that [[sunspot]]s were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the "fog". It has been characterized as a "stratospheric [[sulfate]] aerosol veil".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1191/0309133303pp379ra | last1 = Oppenheimer | first1 = Clive | year = 2003 | title = Climatic, environmental and human consequences of the largest known historic eruption: Tambora volcano (Indonesia) 1815 | url = | journal = [[Progress in Physical Geography]] | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 230–259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weather was not in itself a hardship for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816,&lt;ref name="islandnet1"/&gt; [[frost]] killed off most crops in the higher elevations of [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Vermont]], as well as [[upstate New York]]. On June 6, snow fell in [[Albany, New York]], and [[Dennysville, Maine]].&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer2003"&gt;Oppenheimer 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cape May, New Jersey]], frost was reported five nights in a row in late June, causing extensive crop damage.&lt;ref&gt;American Beacon (Norfolk, VA), Vol. II, Issue 124 (July 4, 1816), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commented on the phenomenon. Sarah Snell Bryant, of [[Cummington]], [[Massachusetts]], wrote in her diary, "Weather backward."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Snell Bryant diary, 1816 Remarks, original at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Samuel Griswold Goodrich, Recollections of a Lifetime (New York: Auburn, Miller, Orton, and Mulligan, 1857), 2:78–79, quoted in Glendyne R. Wergland, One Shaker Life: Isaac Newton Youngs, 1793–1865 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2006), chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Church Family of [[Shakers]] near [[New Lebanon, New York]], Nicholas Bennet wrote in May 1816, "all was froze" and the hills were "barren like winter". Temperatures went below freezing almost every day in May. The ground froze on June 9. On June 12, the Shakers had to replant crops destroyed by the cold. On July 7, it was so cold, everything had stopped growing. The [[Berkshire Hills]] had frost again on August 23, as did much of the upper northeast.&lt;!-- (MA, NH, VT, ME, upstate New York) --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bennet, Domestic Journal, May–September 1816, Western Reserve Historical Society ms. V:B-68, quoted in Wergland, One Shaker Life: Isaac Newton Youngs, 1793–1865, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Massachusetts historian summed up the disaster:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Severe frosts occurred every month; June 7th and 8th snow fell, and it was so cold that crops were cut down, even freezing the roots .... In the early Autumn when corn was in the milk it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. It must be remembered that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Atkins, History of Hawley (West Cummington, Mass. (1887), 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July and August, lake and river ice was observed as far south as northwestern [[Pennsylvania]]. Frost was reported as far south as [[Virginia]] on August 20 and 21.&lt;ref&gt;American Beacon (Norfolk, VA), September 9, 1816, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid, dramatic temperature swings were common, with temperatures sometimes reverting from normal or above-normal summer temperatures as high as 95&amp;nbsp;°F (35&amp;nbsp;°C) to near-freezing within hours. [[Thomas Jefferson]], retired from the presidency and farming at [[Monticello]], sustained crop failures that sent him further into debt. On September 13, a Virginia newspaper reported that corn crops would be one half to two-thirds short and lamented that "the cold as well as the drought has nipt the buds of hope".&lt;ref&gt;"Crops," American Beacon(Norfolk, VA), September 13, 1816, 3&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Norfolk, Virginia]] newspaper reported: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now the middle of July, and we have not yet had what could properly be called summer. Easterly winds have prevailed for nearly three months past... the sun during that time has generally been obscured and the sky overcast with clouds; the air has been damp and uncomfortable, and frequently so chilling as to render the fireside a desirable retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Columbian Register(New Haven, CT), July 27, 1816, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regional farmers did succeed in bringing some crops to maturity, but [[maize|corn]] and other [[cereal|grain]] prices rose dramatically. The price of [[oats]], for example, rose from 12¢ per [[bushel]] (${{#expr:12/3.523907017round1}}0/m³) in 1815 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.12|1815|r=2}}}} today) to 92¢ per bushel (${{#expr:92/3.523907017round0}}/m³) in 1816 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.92|1816|r=2}}}} today). Crop failures were aggravated by an inadequate transportation network: with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads, it was expensive to import food.&lt;ref&gt;John Luther Ringwalt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tkcKAAAAIAAJ Development of Transportation Systems in the United States]'', "Commencement of the Turnpike and Bridge Era", 1888:27 notes that the very first artificial road was the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]], 1792–95, a single route of 62 miles; "it seems impossible to ascribe to the turnpike movement in the years before 1810 any significant improvement in the methods of land transportation in southern New England, or any considerable reduction in the cost of land carriage" (Percy Wells Bidwell, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=frIWAQAAIAAJ Rural Economy in New England]", in ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''20''' [1916:317]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Low temperatures and heavy rains resulted in failed harvests in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. Families in [[Wales]] traveled long distances begging for food. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of [[wheat]], [[oat]], and [[potato]] harvests. In [[Germany]], the crisis was severe; food prices rose sharply. With the cause of the problems unknown, people demonstrated in front of grain markets and bakeries, and later [[riot]]s, [[arson]], and [[looting]] took place in many European cities. It was the worst [[famine]] of 19th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The 'year without a summer' in 1816 produced massive famines and helped stimulate the emergence of the administrative state", observes [[Albert Gore]], ''Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the human spirit'', 2000:79&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects were widespread and lasted beyond the winter. In western [[Switzerland]], the summers of 1816 and 1817 were so cold that an [[Proglacial lake|ice dam]] formed below a tongue of the [[Giétro Glacier]] high in the [[Val de Bagnes]]. Despite engineer [[Ignaz Venetz]]'s efforts to drain the growing lake, the ice dam collapsed catastrophically in June 1818.&lt;ref&gt;The flood is fully described in Jean M. Grove, ''Little Ice Ages, Ancient and Modern'' (as ''The Little Ice Age'' 1988) rev. ed. 2004:161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
In [[China]], the cold weather killed trees, [[rice]] crops, and even [[water buffalo]], especially in the north. Floods destroyed many remaining crops. The [[monsoon]] season was disrupted, resulting in overwhelming floods in the [[Yangtze Valley]]. In [[India]], the delayed summer monsoon caused late torrential rains that aggravated the spread of [[cholera]] from a region near the [[Ganges]] in [[Bengal]] to as far as [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Discovery Channel"&gt;[http://www.yourdiscovery.com/earth/year_without_summer/facts/index.shtml Facts – Year Without Summer] ''Extreme Earth'', Discovery Channel&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Japan]], still exercising caution after the cold weather related [[Great Tenmei famine]] of 1782–1788, the cold damaged crops, but no crop failures were reported, and there were adverse effects on population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turning-point.info/YearWithoutaSummer.html 夏のない年 from turning-point.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Greenland sulfate.png|thumb|[[Sulfate]] concentration in [[ice cores]] from [[Greenland]]. An unknown eruption occurred before 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dai |first=Jihong |last2=Mosley-Thompson |first2=Ellen |last3=Thompson |first3=Lonnie G. |date=1991 |title=Ice core evidence for an explosive tropical volcanic eruption six years preceding Tambora |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |volume=96 | pages=17, 361–17, 366 |doi=10.1029/91jd01634|bibcode = 1991JGR....9617361D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak after 1815 was caused by Mount Tambora.]]

The aberrations are now generally thought to have occurred because of the April 5–15, 1815, [[Tambora volcano eruption in 1815|Mount Tambora volcanic eruption]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615181454/http://indodigest.com/indonesia-special-article-19.html Tambora, Indonesian Volcano (Tambora Volcano Part I): Tambora: The Year Without A Summer] Anthony Tully, Indodigest, archived on June 15, 2006 from [http://www.indodigest.com/indonesia-special-article-19.html the original]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellrock.org.uk/misc/misc_year.htm "The Year without a Summer"] Bellrock.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; on the island of [[Sumbawa]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Stammford Raffles: ''A History of Java''; Black, Parbury, and Allen for the Hon. East India Company 1817; reprinted in the Cambridge Library Collection, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption had a [[volcanic explosivity index]] (VEI) ranking of 7, a colossal event that ejected at least {{convert|100|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of [[material]]. It was the world's largest eruption since the [[Hatepe eruption]] in AD 180.

Other large volcanic eruptions (with VEIs at least 4) [[List of large volcanic eruptions of the 19th century|around this time]] were:

* 1809, The [[1808/1809 mystery eruption]] (VEI 6) in the southwestern [[Pacific Ocean]]
* 1812, [[Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] on [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] in the Caribbean
* 1812, [[Mount Awu|Awu]] in the Sangihe Islands, Dutch East Indies
* 1813, [[Suwanosejima]] in the [[Ryukyu Islands]], Japan
* 1814, [[Mayon Volcano|Mayon]] in the [[Philippines]]

These eruptions had built up a substantial amount of atmospheric dust. As is common after a massive volcanic eruption, temperatures fell worldwide because less sunlight passed through the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/why-does-the-stratosphere-cool-when-the-troposphere-warms/ |title=Why does the stratosphere cool when the troposphere warms? « RealClimate |doi=10.1038/nature17418 |publisher=Realclimate.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21|bibcode=2016Natur.532...94L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 analysis by [[Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature]], the 1815 Tambora eruption caused a temporary drop in the Earth's average land temperature of about 1&amp;nbsp;°C. Smaller temperature drops were recorded from the 1812–1814 eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/pdf/berkeley-earth-press-release-july-29.pdf Berkeley Earth Releases New Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021061031/http://berkeleyearth.org/pdf/berkeley-earth-press-release-july-29.pdf |date=2012-10-21 }}, 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth had already been in a centuries-long period of global cooling that started in the 14th century. Known today as the [[Little Ice Age]], it had already [[Little Ice Age#Europe|caused considerable agricultural distress in Europe]]. The Little Ice Age's existing cooling was exacerbated by the eruption of Tambora, which occurred near the end of the Little Ice Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eh-resources.org/timeline/timeline_lia.html |title=Environmental History Resources — The Little Ice Age, Ca. 1300 – 1870 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=eh-resources.org |publisher=Environmental History Resources |access-date=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also occurred during the [[Dalton Minimum]] (a period of relatively low [[Solar Activity|solar activity]]), specifically [[List of solar cycles|Solar Cycle 6]], which ran from December 1810 to May 1823. May 1816 in particular had the lowest sunspot number (0.1) to date since record keeping on solar activity began. The lack of [[solar irradiance]] during this period was exacerbated by atmospheric opacity from volcanic dust.

==Effects==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
As a result of the series of volcanic eruptions, crops in the aforementioned areas had been poor for several years; the final blow came in 1815 with the eruption of Tambora. Europe, still recuperating from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], suffered from food shortages. Food riots broke out in the United Kingdom and France, and grain warehouses were looted. The violence was worst in landlocked Switzerland, where [[famine]] caused the government to declare a national emergency. Huge storms and abnormal rainfall with flooding of Europe's major rivers (including the [[Rhine]]) are attributed to the event, as is the August frost. A major [[typhus]] epidemic occurred in Ireland between 1816 and 1819, precipitated by the famine caused by the Year Without a Summer. An estimated 100,000 Irish perished during this period. A BBC documentary, using figures compiled in Switzerland, estimated that the fatality rates in 1816 were twice that of average years, giving an approximate European fatality total of 200,000 deaths.

New England also experienced major consequences from the eruption of Tambora. The corn crop in New England failed. Corn was reported to have ripened so poorly that no more than a quarter of it was usable for food. The crop failures in New England, Canada, and parts of Europe also caused the price of wheat, grains, meat, vegetables, butter, milk, and flour to rise sharply.

The eruption of Tambora caused [[Hungary]] to experience brown snow. Italy's northern and north-central region experienced something similar, with red snow falling throughout the year. The cause of this is believed to have been volcanic ash in the atmosphere.

In China, unusually low temperatures in summer and fall devastated rice production in [[Yunnan]], resulting in widespread famine. Fort [[Shuangcheng]], now in [[Heilongjiang]], reported fields disrupted by frost and conscripts deserting as a result. Summer snowfall or otherwise [[mixed precipitation]] was reported in various locations in [[Jiangxi]] and [[Anhui]], located at around 30°N. In [[Taiwan]], which has a tropical climate, snow was reported in [[Hsinchu]] and [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]], and frost was reported in [[Changhua]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326133019/http://www.igsnrr.ac.cn/lwzzImg/1161151232919.pdf Serious Famine in Yunnan (1815–1817) and the Eruption of Tambola Volcano] Fudan Journal (Social Sciences) No. 1 2005, archived on March 26, 2009 from [http://www.igsnrr.ac.cn/lwzzImg/1161151232919.pdf the original]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural effects===
High levels of [[tephra]] in the atmosphere led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, a feature celebrated in the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. This may have given rise to the yellow tinge predominant in his paintings such as ''Chichester Canal ''circa'' 1828''. Similar phenomena were observed after the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], and on the [[West Coast of the United States]] following the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the Philippines.

The lack of oats to feed horses may have inspired the German inventor [[Karl Drais]] to research new ways of horseless transportation, which led to the invention of the [[draisine]] or [[velocipede]]. This was the ancestor of the modern bicycle and a step toward mechanized personal transport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524841.900-brimstone-and-bicycles.html "Brimstone and bicycles"] New Scientist, January 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The crop failures of the "Year without a Summer" may have helped shape the settling of the "[[Heartland (United States)|American Heartland]]", as many thousands of people (particularly farm families who were wiped out by the event) left New England for western New York and the [[Northwest Territory]] in search of a more hospitable climate, richer soil, and better growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nettels |first=Curtis |title=The Emergence of a National Economy |publisher=M. E. Sharpe |location=White Plains, NY |year=1977 |isbn=0-87332-096-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiana]] became a state in December 1816 and [[Illinois]] two years later. British historian [[Lawrence Goldman]] has suggested that this migration into the [[Burned-over district]] of New York was responsible for the centering of the [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] in that region.&lt;ref name=bragg&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077j4yv |title=BBC Radio 4 - In Our Time, 1816, the Year Without a Summer |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chichester Canal (1828).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Chichester Canal (painting)|Chichester Canal]]'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1828)]]
[[Vermont]] alone experienced a decrease in population of  between 10,000 and 15,000, erasing seven previous years of population growth.&lt;ref name="EvansRobert" /&gt;

In June 1816, "incessant rainfall" during that "wet, ungenial summer" forced [[Mary Shelley]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Lord Byron]] and [[John William Polidori]], and their friends to stay indoors at [[Villa Diodati]] overlooking [[Lake Geneva]] for much of their Swiss holiday.&lt;ref name=bragg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077j4yv |title=BBC Radio 4 - In Our Time, 1816, the Year Without a Summer |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/opinion/31deltoro.html Why Vampires Never Die] by [[Chuck Hogan]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]] [[The New York Times]] July 30, 2009; accessed 04-27-2015&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to have a contest to see who could write the scariest story, leading Shelley to write ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus]]'' and [[Lord Byron]] to write "[[Fragment of a Novel|A Fragment]]", which Polidori later used as inspiration for ''[[The Vampyre]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Shelley | first =Mary | authorlink =Mary Shelley | coauthors = | title =Frankenstein | publisher =Random House | pages =XV–XVI | isbn =0-679-60059-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; — a precursor to ''[[Dracula]]''. In addition, Lord Byron was inspired to write the poem "[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]", by a single day when "the fowls all went to roost at noon and candles had to be lit as at midnight".&lt;ref name=bragg/&gt;

[[Justus von Liebig]], a chemist who had experienced the famine as a child in [[Darmstadt]], later studied plant nutrition and introduced mineral [[fertilizer]]s.
