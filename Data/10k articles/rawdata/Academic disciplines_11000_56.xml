Alcohol is a depressant. After consumption, alcohol causes the body’s systems to slow down. Often, feelings of [[drunkenness]] are associated with elation and happiness but other feelings of anger or depression can arise. Balance, judgment, and coordination are also negatively affected. One of the most significant short term side effects of alcohol is reduced inhibition. Reduced inhibitions can lead to an increase in sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="LC2" /&gt;

As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency.&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol intoxication can [[Erectile dysfunction|decrease sexual arousal]], decrease pleasureability and intensity of [[orgasm]], and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.&lt;ref name="G4" /&gt;

== In women ==
In women, the effects of alcohol on libido in the literature are mixed. Some women report that alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, however, some studies show alcohol lower the physiological signs of arousal.&lt;ref name="B32"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ackerman|first2=KT|year=1995|title=Women, alcohol, and sexuality|journal=[[Recent Developments in Alcoholism]]|volume=12|pages=267–85|pmid=7624547|last1=Beckman|first1=LJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that alcohol negatively affected how positive the sexual experience was in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=M.

Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women's bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;ref name="LC22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=George|first2=WH|year=1989|title=Alcohol and human sexuality: Review and integration|journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]]|volume=105|issue=3|pages=374–86|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.374|pmid=2660179|last1=Crowe|first1=LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; Some women report a greater [[sexual arousal]] with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]], which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

Psychologically, alcohol has also played a role in sexual behavior. It has been reported that women who were intoxicated believed they were more sexually aroused than before consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; This psychological effect contrasts with the physiological effects measured, but refers back to the loss of inhibitions because of alcohol. Often, alcohol can influence the capacity for a woman to feel more relaxed and in turn, be more sexual. Alcohol may be considered by some women to be a sexual disinhibitor.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

==Drug facilitated sexual assault==
{{main article|Drug facilitated sexual assault}}

Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), also known as predator rape, is a sexual assault carried out after the victim has become incapacitated due to having consumed [[alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. The unofficial term "date rape drug" came into widespread usage in the early 1990s through U.S. news media reports. Researchers say that unlike other types of rape, DFSA is not a crime of physical violence: it is a crime of sexual [[hedonism]] and entitlement.&lt;ref name="Welner 2008"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Michael | last1=Welner | first2=Barbara | last2=Welner | chapter=Chapter 23: Drug-Facilitated Sex Assault | pages=445–462 | editor1-first=Robert R. | editor1-last=Hazelwood | editor2-first=Ann Wolbert | editor2-last=Burgess | title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation: A Multidisciplinary Approach | edition=4th | publisher=CRC Press | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4200-6504-6 | doi=10.1201/9781420065053.ch23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A date rape drug, also called a predator drug, is any drug that can be used to assist in the execution of [[drug facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA). The most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim ingested drugs willingly for recreational purposes, or had them administered surreptitiously:&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=978-0849398087|pages=70|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the latter type of [[assault]] that the term "date rape drug" most often refers to.

==Sexual risk-taking==
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviours, such as [[unprotected sex]].&lt;ref name="G4"/&gt; It is unclear whether the two are linked or the [[personality type]]s of people who often drink large amounts of alcohol are more tolerant of risk-taking.

Alcohol is linked to a large proportion of unwanted outcomes associated with sex such as [[date rape]], [[unwanted pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;

=="Beer goggles"{{anchor|Beer_goggles}}== &lt;!-- [[Beer goggles]], [[Cider visor]], and [[Stella vision]] all redirect to this section --&gt;
"Beer goggles" is a slang term for the phenomenon in which consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] lowers [[sexual inhibition]]s to the point that very little or no discretion is used when approaching or choosing sexual partners. The term is often humorously applied when an individual is observed making, and later regretting, advances towards a partner who would be deemed unattractive or inappropriate when sober. The "beer goggles" are considered to have distorted the "wearer's" vision, making unattractive people appear beautiful, or at least passably attractive.

A study published in 2003 supported the beer goggles hypothesis; however, it also found that another explanation is that regular drinkers tend to have personality traits that mean they find people more attractive, whether or not they are under the influence of alcohol at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6529">The '''Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung [[GmbH|m. b. H.]]''' (''English'': Berlin [[Electron]] [[Storage ring|Storage Ring]] Society for [[Synchrotron Radiation]]), abbreviated ''BESSY'', is a research establishment in the [[Adlershof]] district of [[Berlin]]. Founded on 5 March 1979, it currently operates one of Germany's 3rd generation [[synchrotron|synchrotron radiation facilities]], '''BESSY II'''. Originally part of the [[Leibniz Association]], BESSY now belongs to the [[Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin]] (since 1 January 2009).

Owing to the [[radiometry]] lab of the PTB [http://www.bessy.de/?idart=86&amp;changelang=5], BESSY is the European calibration standard for [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/user/photons/index_en.html |title=BESSY webpage: About BESSY - an ultimate space and time microscope |access-date=2010-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230071314/http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/user/photons/index_en.html |archive-date=2010-12-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BESSY supplies synchrotron light and provides support for science and industry. There are institutional long-time users, like the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max-Planck-Society]], the [[Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung|German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing]] (BAM) and the national [[metrology]] institute of Germany (the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]]). Furthermore, research groups from other institutes or universities can apply for utilization (so called ''beam time'') for certain projects.

== BESSY I ==
[[Image:BESSY I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The BESSY I building seen in 1996]]
This original synchrotron facility, costing the equivalent of 66.5 million [[Euro]], became operational on 19 December 1981. It was situated in [[Wilmersdorf]], then a [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|borough of Berlin]]. The storage ring had a circumference of approx. 60 m. The circulating electrons that provided the radiation were in the energy range of 200 to 800 [[Electron volt|MeV]] ([[Vacuum UV|Vacuum Ultraviolet]] through [[Extreme ultraviolet|Extreme Ultraviolet]]).

After its decommissioning in 1999, the component parts of the BESSY I machine were donated to the [[Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East|SESAME project]] by the German Authorities and have consequently been shipped to [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/science/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1957&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Transportation of BESSY I Component Parts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous achievements of BESSY I were the [[calibration]] of the [[spectrometers]] for the solar observatory probe [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] as well as for the detectors for the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]].

== BESSY II ==
Groundbreaking for the new improved BESSY II synchrotron source in Adlershof took place on 4 July 1994, and the facility was inaugurated on 4 September 1998. The project cost was an equivalent of approximately 100 million Euros.  The successor of BESSY I has a circumference of 240 m, providing 46 [[beam line]]s, and offers a multi-faceted mixture of experimental opportunities ([[undulator]], [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] and [[dipole magnet|dipole]] sources) with excellent energy resolution. The combination of [[brightness]] and time resolution enables both [[femtosecond]] time and [[picometer]] spatial resolutions.

Electrons can be accelerated to an energy of up to 1.7 [[Electron Volt|GeV]] ([[X-rays|X-ray regime]]), and are subsequently injected into the storage ring. Synchrotron radiation emerges from the dipole magnets that bend the beam on a circular path, as well as from undulators and wigglers. The total [[Power (physics)|power]] input during regular operation is 2.7 [[Watt|MW]].

BESSY II can be run in different modes, according to the time-distance between the electron [[wave packet]]s that circulate in the storage ring:
* '''multi bunch''': This is the most common mode. Around 350 equal packets are in the ring, with a time-distance of 2 [[nanosecond|ns]]
* '''single bunch''': This mode is in effect for two weeks each half-year. Only one single electron packet is in the ring, thus enabling the users to measure with the highest possible time resolution. Two light pulses arrive with a gap of 800 ns and can therefore be easily separated.
* '''low alpha''': This mode exists in single and multi bunch sub-modes. The spatial resolution of the electron packet is higher (it is compressed), which leads to a higher rate of Terahertz radiation and shorter light pulses.

Experiments at BESSY II are in the fields of [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]], [[Photoemission spectroscopy]], [[Photoemission electron microscopy]], [[X-ray microscope|X-ray microscopy]], [[laser cutting|femtosecond slicing]], [[X-ray lithography]], and [[X-ray crystallography|protein structure analysis]].

BESSY maintains a close co-operation with other synchrotron sources in the world, most notably with [[DESY]] in [[Hamburg]].

==Other facilities==
*In September 2008, the '''Metrology Light Source (MLS)''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ptb.de/mls/&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated. This facility in close proximity to BESSY II is run by PTB and provides synchrotron radiation in the energy range of [[far infrared]] and [[Terahertz radiation]]. The two facilities complement one another.
*In 2000, the construction of a [[free electron laser]] on the BESSY site was planned, which was dubbed '''BESSY-FEL''' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/aktuell/pm/pm-archiv/2006/bestnoten-fuer-das-bessy-fel-projekt_de.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It was supposed to create extremely short and bright ultraviolet and X-ray pulses. In the autumn of 2008, the project was cut, and only an extension to the [[FLASH]] free electron laser in Hamburg is now to be built.

'''Brownian dynamics (BD)''' can be used to describe the motion of [[molecule]]s for example in molecular [[simulation]]s or in reality. It is a simplified version of [[Langevin dynamics]] and corresponds to the limit where no average acceleration takes place. This approximation can also be described as '[[overdamped]]' Langevin dynamics, or as Langevin dynamics without [[inertia]].

In [[Langevin dynamics]], the equation of motion is

:&lt;math&gt;M\ddot{X} = - \nabla U(X) - \gamma \dot{X} + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} R(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where  
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[friction coefficient]],
*&lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the particle interaction potential,
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the gradient operator such that &lt;math&gt;- \nabla U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the force calculated from the particle interaction potentials
*the dot is a time derivative such that &lt;math&gt;\dot{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, and &lt;math&gt;\ddot{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration
*T is the temperature
*k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]
*&lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a delta-correlated stationary [[Gaussian process]] with zero-mean, satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle R(t) \right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle R(t)R(t') \right\rangle = \delta(t-t').&lt;/math&gt;

In Brownian dynamics, the &lt;math&gt;M\ddot{X}(t)&lt;/math&gt; term is neglected, and the sum of these terms is zero.

:&lt;math&gt;0 = - \nabla U(X) - \gamma \dot{X}+ \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T } R(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein relation]], &lt;math&gt;D = k_B T/\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it is often convenient to write the equation as,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{X}(t) = - \nabla U(X) D / k_B T + \sqrt{2 D} R(t).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|300px|right|thumb|Geocentric celestial spheres; [[Petrus Apianus|Peter Apian's]] ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539)]]

The '''celestial spheres''', or '''celestial orbs''', were the fundamental entities of the [[cosmology|cosmological]] models developed by [[Plato]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Copernicus]], and others. In these celestial models, the [[diurnal motion|apparent motions]] of the [[fixed stars]] and [[classical planet|planets]] are accounted for by treating them as embedded in rotating spheres made of an aetherial, transparent fifth element ([[aether (classical element)|quintessence]]), like jewels set in orbs.  Since it was believed that the fixed stars did not change their positions relative to one another, it was argued that they must be on the surface of a single starry sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern thought, the [[Orbit#Planetary orbits|orbits of the planets]] are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, considered the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, p. 251"&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; When scholars applied Ptolemy's [[epicycles]], they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, p. 251"/&gt; By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at the time for the distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and to the edge of the universe (about 73 million miles).&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 28–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[size of the universe]] is now known to be inconceivably large and continuously [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Van Helden has suggested that from about 1250 until the 17th century, virtually all educated Europeans were familiar with the Ptolemaic model of "nesting spheres and the cosmic dimensions derived from it".&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 37, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even following the adoption of Copernicus's heliocentric model of the universe, new versions of the celestial sphere model were introduced, with the planetary spheres following this sequence from the central Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth-Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Mainstream belief in the theory of celestial spheres did not survive the [[Scientific Revolution]].  In the early 1600s, Kepler continued to discuss celestial spheres, although he did not consider that the planets were carried by the spheres but held that they moved in elliptical paths described by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].  In the late 1600s, Greek and medieval theories concerning the motion of terrestrial and celestial objects were replaced by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which explain how Kepler's laws arise from the gravitational attraction between bodies.

==History==
{{details|topic=the causes of the motions of the celestial spheres|Dynamics of the celestial spheres}}

===Early ideas of spheres and circles===

In [[Ancient Greece|Greek antiquity]] the ideas of celestial spheres and rings first appeared in the cosmology of [[Anaximander]] in the early 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 4 of Heath's ''Aristarchus of Samos'' 1913/97 Oxford University Press/Sandpiper Books Ltd; see p.11 of Popper's ''The World of Parmenides'' Routledge 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, but there are so many such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original [[sphere of fire]] wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings.&lt;ref&gt;Heath  ''ibid'' pp26–8&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.

Following Anaximander, his pupil [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (c. 585–528/4) held that the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire. But whilst the stars are fastened on a revolving crystal sphere like nails or studs, the Sun, Moon, and planets, and also the Earth, all just ride on air like leaves because of their breadth.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 5 of Heath’s 1913 ''Aristarchus of Samos''&lt;/ref&gt;  And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere, the Sun, Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do, but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again. And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth. The most enduring feature of Anaximenes' cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a rigid frame, which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler.

After Anaximenes, [[Pythagoras]], [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]] all held that the universe was spherical.&lt;ref&gt;For Xenophanes' and Parmenides' spherist cosmologies see Heath ''ibid'' chapter 7 and chapter 9 respectively, and Popper ''ibid'' Essays 2 &amp; 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And much later in the fourth century BC Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' proposed that the body of the cosmos was made in the most perfect and uniform shape, that of a sphere containing the fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Cornford, ''Plato's Cosmology: The Timaeus of Plato'', pp. 54–7&lt;/ref&gt;  But it posited that the planets were spherical bodies set in rotating bands or rings rather than wheel rims as in Anaximander's cosmology.

===Emergence of the planetary spheres===

Instead of bands, Plato's student Eudoxus developed a [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|planetary model]] using [[concentric spheres]] for all the planets, with three spheres each for his models of the Moon and the Sun and four each for the models of the other five planets, thus making 26 spheres in all.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, vol. 2, pp. 677–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd p. 173"&gt;Lloyd, "Heavenly aberrations," p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Callippus]] modified this system, using five spheres for his models of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars and retaining four spheres for the models of Jupiter and Saturn, thus making 33 spheres in all.&lt;ref name="Lloyd p. 173"/&gt;  Each planet is attached to the innermost of its own particular set of spheres.  Although the models of Eudoxus and Callippus qualitatively describe the major features of the motion of the planets, they fail to account exactly for these motions and therefore cannot provide quantitative predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,'' vol. 2, pp. 677–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Although historians of Greek science have traditionally considered these models to be merely geometrical representations,&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, ''History of the Planetary Systems'', pp. 90–1, 121–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, ''Aristotle,'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; recent studies have proposed that they were also intended to be physically real&lt;ref&gt;Larry Wright, "The Astronomy of Eudoxus: Geometry or Physics," ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', 4 (1973): 165–72.&lt;/ref&gt; or have withheld judgment, noting the limited evidence to resolve the question.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. R. Lloyd, "Saving the Phenomena," ''Classical Quarterly,'' 28 (1978): 202–222, at p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] developed a physical cosmology of spheres, based on the mathematical models of Eudoxus.  In Aristotle's fully developed celestial model, the spherical Earth is at the centre of the universe and the planets are moved by either 47 or 55 interconnected spheres that form a unified planetary system,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1073b1–1074a13, pp. 882–883 in ''The Basic Works of Aristotle'' Richard McKeon, ed., The Modern Library 2001&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the models of Eudoxus and Callippus each planet's individual set of spheres were not connected to those of the next planet.  Aristotle says the exact number of spheres, and hence the number of movers, is to be determined by astronomical investigation, but he added additional spheres to those proposed by Eudoxus and Callippus, to counteract the motion of the outer spheres.  Aristotle considers that these spheres are made of an unchanging fifth element, the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Each of these concentric spheres is moved by its own god—an unchanging [[Unmoved mover|divine unmoved mover]], and who moves its sphere simply by virtue of being loved by it.&lt;ref&gt;"The final cause, then, produces motion by being loved, but all other things move by being moved" Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1072b4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|225px|right|thumb|Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn with [[epicycle]], eccentric [[deferent]] and [[equant]] point.  [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum'', 1474.]]

In his ''[[Almagest]]'', the astronomer [[Ptolemy]] (fl. ca. 150 AD) developed geometrical predictive models of the motions of the stars and planets and extended them to a unified physical model of the [[cosmos]] in his ''Planetary hypotheses''.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,''  pp. 111–12, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, ''[[#Pederson-1993|Early Physics and Astronomy]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, ''[[#Reference-Crowe-1990|Theories of the World]]'', pp.45, 49–50, 72,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton, ''[[#Reference-Linton-2004|From Eudoxus to Einstein]]'', pp.63–64, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  By using eccentrics and [[epicycles]], his geometrical model achieved greater mathematical detail and predictive accuracy than had been exhibited by earlier concentric spherical models of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Catesby Taliaferro|Taliaferro]], ''[[#taliaferro-1946|Translator's Introduction to the Almagest]]'', p,1; Dreyer, ''[[#dreyer-2007|History of the Planetary Systems]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/160/mode/1up/ pp.160], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/167/mode/1up/ 167].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ptolemy's physical model, each planet is contained in two or more spheres,&lt;ref name="Neugebauer, pp. 917"&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'', vol. 2, pp. 917–926.&lt;/ref&gt; but in Book 2 of his ''Planetary Hypotheses'' Ptolemy depicted thick circular slices rather than spheres as in its Book 1.  One sphere/slice is the [[deferent]], with a centre offset somewhat from the Earth; the other sphere/slice is an [[epicycle]] embedded in the deferent, with the planet embedded in the epicyclical sphere/slice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Murschel, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995JHA....26...33M "The Structure and Function of Ptolemy's Physical Hypotheses of Planetary Motion,"] ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 26(1995): 33–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's model of nesting spheres provided the general dimensions of the cosmos, the greatest distance of Saturn being 19,865 times the radius of the Earth and the distance of the fixed stars being at least 20,000 Earth radii.&lt;ref name="Neugebauer, pp. 917"/&gt;

The planetary spheres were arranged outwards from the spherical, stationary Earth at the centre of the universe in this order: the spheres of the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Sun]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]].  In more detailed models the seven planetary spheres contained other secondary spheres within them.  The planetary spheres were followed by the stellar sphere containing the fixed stars; other scholars added a ninth sphere to account for the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], a tenth to account for the supposed [[Trepidation (astronomy)|trepidation of the equinoxes]], and even an eleventh to account for the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis  R. Johnson, "Marlowe's "Imperiall Heaven," ''ELH'', 12 (1945): 35–44, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  In antiquity the order of the lower planets was not universally agreed. Plato and his followers ordered them Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, and then followed the standard model for the upper spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Eastwood, ''Ordering the Heavens: Roman Astronomy and Cosmology in the Carolingian Renaissance,'' (Leiden: Brill) 2007, pp. 36–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his ''De Revolutionibus'' Bk1.10 Copernicus claimed the empirical reason why Plato's followers put the orbits of Mercury and Venus above the Sun's was that if they were sub-solar, then by the Sun's reflected light they would only ever appear as hemispheres at most and would also sometimes eclipse the Sun, but they do neither. (See p521 ''Great Books of the Western World 16 Ptolemy–Copernicus–Kepler'')&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagreed about the relative place of the spheres of Mercury and Venus: Ptolemy placed both of them beneath the Sun with Venus above Mercury, but noted others placed them both above the Sun; some medieval thinkers, such as [[al-Bitruji]], placed the sphere of Venus above the Sun and that of Mercury below it.&lt;ref&gt;al-Biţrūjī.

===Middle Ages===

====Astronomical discussions====
[[File:Mappa Mundi 2 from Bede, De natura rerum.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Earth within seven celestial spheres, from [[Bede]], ''De natura rerum'', late 11th century]]
A series of astronomers, beginning with the Muslim astronomer [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|al-Farghānī]], used the Ptolemaic model of nesting spheres to compute distances to the stars and planetary spheres.  Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars was 20,110 Earth radii which, on the assumption that the radius of the Earth was 3,250 miles, came to 65,357,500 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  An introduction to Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', the ''Tashil al-Majisti'', believed to be written by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]], presented minor variations of Ptolemy's distances to the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Zij]]'', [[Muḥammad ibn Jābir al-Ḥarrānī al-Battānī|Al-Battānī]] presented independent calculations of the distances to the planets on the model of nesting spheres, which he thought was due to scholars writing after Ptolemy.  His calculations yielded a distance of 19,000 Earth radii to the stars.&lt;ref name="Van Helden pp. 31-2"&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the millennium, the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arabic astronomer]] and polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham#Astronomy|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)]] presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses'', al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it has been argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Tzvi Langermann (1990), ''Ibn al Haytham's On the Configuration of the World'', p. 11–25, New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapters 15–16 of his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of [[solid]] matter.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Rosen (1985), "The Dissolution of the Solid Celestial Spheres", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''46''' (1), p. 13–31 [19–20, 21].&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the twelfth century, the [[Al-Andalus|Spanish Muslim]] astronomer [[Nur Ed-Din Al Betrugi|al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius)]] sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ''Al-Bitrūjī: On the Principles of Astronomy,'' New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1971, vol. 1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ''Al-Bitrūjī: On the Principles of Astronomy,'' New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1971, vol. 1, pp. 40–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 563–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the thirteenth century the astronomer, [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi|al-'Urḍi]], proposed a radical change to Ptolemy's system of nesting spheres.  In his ''Kitāb al-Hayáh'', he recalculated the distance of the planets using parameters which he redetermined.  Taking the distance of the Sun as 1,266 Earth radii, he was forced to place the sphere of Venus above the sphere of the Sun; as a further refinement, he added the planet's diameters to the thickness of their spheres.  As a consequence, his version of the nesting spheres model had the sphere of the stars at a distance of 140,177 Earth radii.&lt;ref name="Van Helden pp. 31-2"/&gt;

About the same time, scholars in European [[medieval universities|universities]] began to address the implications of the rediscovered philosophy of Aristotle and astronomy of Ptolemy.  Both astronomical scholars and popular writers considered the implications of the nested sphere model for the dimensions of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 433–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Campanus of Novara]]'s introductory astronomical text, the ''Theorica planetarum'', used the model of nesting spheres to compute the distances of the various planets from the Earth, which he gave as 22,612 Earth radii or 73,387,747 100/660 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 434–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 33–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Opus Majus]]'', [[Roger Bacon]] cited Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars of 20,110 Earth radii, or 65,357,700 miles, from which he computed the circumference of the universe to be 410,818,517 3/7 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clear evidence that this model was thought to represent physical reality is the accounts found in Bacon's ''Opus Majus'' of the time needed to walk to the Moon&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the popular [[Middle English]] ''[[South English Legendary]]'', that it would take 8,000 years to reach the highest starry heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''The Discarded Image'', pp. 97–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; General understanding of the dimensions of the universe derived from the nested sphere model reached wider audiences through the presentations in Hebrew by [[Moses Maimonides]], in French by Gossuin of Metz, and in Italian by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 37–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical and theological discussions====

Philosophers were less concerned with such mathematical calculations than with the nature of the celestial spheres, their relation to revealed accounts of created nature, and the causes of their motion.

Adi Setia describes the debate among Islamic scholars in the twelfth century, based on the commentary of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] about whether the celestial spheres are real, concrete physical bodies or "merely the abstract circles in the heavens traced out… by the various stars and planets." Setia points out that most of the learned, and the astronomers, said they were solid spheres "on which the stars turn… and this view is closer to the apparent sense of the Qur'anic verses regarding the celestial orbits." However, al-Razi mentions that some, such as the Islamic scholar Dahhak, considered them to be abstract. Al-Razi himself, was undecided, he said: "In truth, there is no way to ascertain the characteristics of the heavens except by authority [of divine revelation or prophetic traditions]." Setia concludes: "Thus it seems that for al-Razi (and for others before and after him), astronomical models, whatever their utility or lack thereof for ordering the heavens, are not founded on sound rational proofs, and so no intellectual commitment can be made to them insofar as description and explanation of celestial realities are concerned."&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian and Muslim philosophers modified Ptolemy's system to include an unmoved outermost region, the [[empyrean]] heaven, which came to be identified as the dwelling place of [[God]] and all the elect.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 382–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical [[firmament]] and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', pp. 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; An outer sphere, inhabited by [[angels]], appeared in some accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Grant]], a historian of science, has provided evidence that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid in the sense of three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 328–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the [[mutakallim]] Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) rejected the principle of uniform and circular motion, following the [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of [[atomism]], which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes.&lt;ref name=Huff-175&gt;{{Cite book |first=Toby |last=Huff |year=2003 |title=The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-52994-8 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintained that the celestial spheres were "imaginary things" and "more tenuous than a spider's web".&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;55–57 of {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/649338| issn = 0369-7827| last = Ragep| first = F.

Medieval astronomers and philosophers developed diverse theories about the causes of the celestial spheres' motions. They attempted to explain the spheres' motions in terms of the materials of which they were thought to be made, external movers such as celestial intelligences, and internal movers such as motive souls or impressed forces. Most of these models were qualitative, although a few  incorporated quantitative analyses that related speed, motive force and resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the Middle Ages, the common opinion in Europe was that celestial bodies were moved by external intelligences, identified with the [[angel]]s of [[revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Primum Mobile|outermost moving sphere]], which moved with the daily motion affecting all subordinate spheres, was moved by an [[unmoved mover]], the [[Cosmological argument#History|Prime Mover]], who was identified with God. Each of the lower spheres was moved by a subordinate spiritual mover (a replacement for Aristotle's multiple divine movers), called an intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 526–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Thomas Digges' 1576 Copernican heliocentric model of the celestial orbs]]

Early in the sixteenth century [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] drastically reformed the model of astronomy by displacing the Earth from its central place in favour of the Sun, yet he called his great work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''). Although Copernicus does not treat the physical nature of the spheres in detail, his few allusions make it clear that, like many of his predecessors, he accepted non-solid celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Jardine, "The Significance of the Copernican Orbs," ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 13(1982): 168–194, esp. pp. 177–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus rejected the ninth and tenth spheres, placed the orb of the Moon around the Earth and moved the Sun from its orb to the center of the world.  The planetary orbs circled the center of the world in the order Mercury, Venus, the great orb containing the Earth and the orb of the Moon, then the orbs of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  Finally he retained the eighth starry sphere, which he held to be unmoving.&lt;ref&gt;Hilderich von Varel ([[:de:Edo Hildericus|Edo Hildericus]]), ''Propositiones Cosmographicae de Globi Terreni Dimensione,'' (Frankfurt a. d. Oder, 1576), quoted in Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, "Realism and Instrumentalism in Sixteenth Century Astronomy: A Reappraisal, ''Perspectives on Science'' 6.3 (1998): 232–258, pp. 242–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English almanac maker, [[Thomas Digges]], delineated the spheres of the new cosmological system in his ''Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes…'' (1576).  Here he arranged the "orbes" in the new Copernican order, expanding one sphere to carry "the globe of mortalitye", the Earth, the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|four elements]], and the Moon; and expanding the starry sphere infinitely upward to encompass all the stars, and also to serve as "the court of the Great God, the habitacle of the elect, and of the coelestiall angelles."&lt;ref&gt;Koyre, ''From the Closed World'', pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler Celestial Spheres.jpg|thumb|left|Johannes Kepler's diagram of the celestial spheres, and of the spaces between them, following the opinion of Copernicus (''Mysterium Cosmographicum'', 2nd ed., 1621)]]
In the course of the sixteenth century, a number of philosophers, theologians, and astronomers—among them [[Franciscus Patricius|Francesco Patrizi]], Andrea Cisalpino, [[Petrus Ramus|Peter Ramus]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Giordano Bruno]], Jerónimo Muñoz, [[Michael Neander]], Jean Pena, and [[Christoph Rothmann]]—abandoned the concept of celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Granada, "Did Tycho Eliminate the Celestial Spheres before 1586?" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 37 (2006): 126–145, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rothmann argued from the observations of the comet of 1585 that the lack of observed parallax indicated that the comet was beyond Saturn, while the absence of observed refraction indicated the celestial region was of the same material as air, hence there were no planetary spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein and Peter Barker, "The Role of Rothmann in the Dissolution of the Celestial Spheres," ''The British Journal for the History of Science'', 28 (1995): 385–403, pp. 390–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tycho Brahe]]'s investigations of a series of comets from 1577 to 1585, aided by Rothmann's discussion of the comet of 1585 and [[Michael Maestlin]]'s tabulated distances of the comet of 1577, which passed through the planetary orbs, led Tycho to conclude&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Granada, "Did Tycho Eliminate the Celestial Spheres before 1586?" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 37 (2006): 126–145, pp. 132–8.&lt;/ref&gt; that "the structure of the heavens was very fluid and simple." Tycho opposed his view to that of "very many modern philosophers" who divided the heavens into "various orbs made of hard and impervious matter." Edward Grant found relatively few believers in hard celestial spheres before Copernicus, and concluded that the idea first became common sometime between the publication of Copernicus's ''De revolutionibus'' in 1542 and Tycho Brahe's publication of his cometary research in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, "Celestial Orbs," 2000, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 345–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Johannes Kepler]]'s early ''Mysterium cosmographicum'', he considered the distances of the planets, and the consequent gaps required between the planetary spheres implied by the Copernican system, which had been noted by his former teacher, Michael Maestlin.&lt;ref&gt;Grasshoff, "Michael Maestlin's Mystery".&lt;/ref&gt;  Kepler's Platonic cosmology filled the large gaps with the five Platonic polyhedra, which accounted for the spheres' measured astronomical distance.&lt;ref&gt;See Judith Field, ''Kepler's geometric cosmology'' for details of Kepler's cosmology&lt;/ref&gt;  In his mature celestial physics, the spheres were regarded as the purely geometrical spatial regions containing each planetary orbit rather than as the rotating physical orbs of the earlier Aristotelian celestial physics. The eccentricity of each planet's orbit thereby defined the lengths of the radii of the inner and outer limits of its celestial sphere and thus its thickness. In Kepler's [[Celestial mechanics#Johannes Kepler|celestial mechanics]] the cause of planetary motion became the rotating Sun, itself rotated by its own motive soul.&lt;ref&gt;See p514–5 of Kepler's 1630 ''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' Vol.1 Bk4.2.3 for his arguments that the Sun has a driving soul on p896 of the Encyclopædia Britannica edition&lt;/ref&gt; However, an immobile stellar sphere was a lasting remnant of physical celestial spheres in Kepler's cosmology.

In [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]],'' the elder [[Scipio Africanus]] describes an ascent through the celestial spheres, compared to which the Earth and the Roman Empire dwindle into insignificance. A commentary on the ''Dream of Scipio'' by the Roman writer [[Macrobius]], which included a discussion of the various schools of thought on the order of the spheres, did much to spread the idea of the celestial spheres through the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,'' transl. by William Harris Stahl, New York: Columbia Univ. Pr., 1952; on the order of the spheres see pp. 162–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|right|thumb|Nicole Oresme, ''Le livre du Ciel et du Monde,'' Paris, BnF, Manuscrits, Fr. 565, f. 69, (1377)]]
Some late medieval figures noted that the celestial spheres' physical order was inverse to their order on the spiritual plane, where God was at the center and the Earth at the periphery. Near the beginning of the fourteenth century [[Dante]], in the ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', described God as a light at the center of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature,'' Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1964, p. 116. {{ISBN|0-521-09450-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the poet ascends beyond physical existence to the [[Empyrean]] Heaven, where he comes face to face with God himself and is granted understanding of both divine and human nature. Later in the century, the illuminator of [[Nicole Oresme]]'s ''Le livre du Ciel et du Monde'', a translation of and commentary on Aristotle's [[On the Heavens|''De caelo'']] produced for Oresme's patron, [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]], employed the same motif. He drew the spheres in the conventional order, with the Moon closest to the Earth and the stars highest, but the spheres were concave upwards, centered on God, rather than concave downwards, centered on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Oreseme, "Le livre du Ciel et du Monde", 1377, retrieved 2 June 2007.[http://expositions.bnf.fr/ciel/grand/1-025.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Below this figure Oresme quotes the [[Psalms]] that "The heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork."&lt;ref&gt;Ps. 18: 2; quoted in Nicole Oresme, ''Le livre du ciel et du monde,'' edited and translated by A, D. Menut and A. J. Denomy, Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1968, pp. 282–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

The late-16th-century Portuguese epic ''[[The Lusiads]]'' vividly portrays the celestial spheres as a "great machine of the universe" constructed by God.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz vaz de Camões, ''The Lusiads,'' translated by Landeg White. Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The explorer Vasco da Gama is shown the celestial spheres in the form of a mechanical model. Contrary to Cicero's representation, da Gama's tour of the spheres begins with the Empyrean, then descends inward toward Earth, culminating in a survey of the domains and divisions of earthly kingdoms, thus magnifying the importance of human deeds in the divine plan.

{{Over-quotation|date=December 2015}}
In [[philosophy of science]] and [[philosophy of mind]], '''cognitive closure''' is the proposition that human minds are constitutionally incapable of solving certain perennial philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Marsh (ed.), ''Hayek in Mind: Hayek's Philosophical Psychology'', Emerald Group Publishing, 2011, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Flanagan]] calls this position '''anti-constructive naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or the "[[new mysterianism]]" and the primary advocate of the hypothesis, [[Colin McGinn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Errol E | last = Harris | title = Reflections on the Problem of Consciousness | year = 2006 | page = 51 | quote = McGinn's stance, while he denies the possibility of ever understanding the causal connection, may be regarded as "naturalistic" in the sense that he does not reject the validity of neuro-physiological theory, and does not doubt that brain activity accompanies conscious states.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Wilson (ed.), ''The Meaning of "Life" in Romantic Poetry and Poetics'', Routledge, 2009, p. 88: "[McGinn] calls his stance "transcendental naturalism..."&lt;/ref&gt; calls it '''transcendental naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; acknowledging the possibility that solutions may be an intelligent non-human of some kind. According to McGinn, such philosophical questions include the [[mind-body problem]], [[personal identity|identity of the self]], [[meaning (philosophy of language)|foundations of meaning]], [[free will]], and [[epistemology|knowledge]], both ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and [[empiricism|empirical]].&lt;ref name = "McGinn1994"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Philosophical Studies |volume=76 |year=1994 | pages =133–56 | doi=10.1007/bf00989821 |url= http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/consciousness97/papers/ProblemOfPhilosophy.html |title= The Problem of Philosophy |first=Colin |last=McGinn | quote =it combines deep epistemic transcendence with the denial that what thus transcends is thereby non-natural.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colin McGinn==
{{quote|It cannot be simply taken for granted that the human reasoning faculty is naturally suited for answering philosophical questions: the questions and their subject matter are one thing; and rational faculty, as a human trait, is another. From the fact that it is the best faculty we have… for doing philosophy it does not follow that it is a remotely good or adequate faculty for that purpose.&lt;ref name = "lim"&gt;{{Citation | first = Colin | last = McGinn | title = Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry | year = 1993 | page = 31 | quote = There is, I believe, a systematic pattern to philosophical disputation, in which the same kinds of unsatisfying alternatives recur}}.&lt;/ref&gt; |Colin McGinn|''Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry''}}
{{quote |When human minds interact with philosophical problems, especially those of the form 'How is X possible?', they are apt to go into one of four possible states. Either (i) they try to domesticate the object of puzzlement by providing a reductive or explanatory theory of it; or (ii) they declare it irreducible and hence not open to any levelling account; or (iii) they succumb to a magical story or image of what seems so puzzling; or (iv) they simply eliminate the source of trouble for fear of ontological embarrassment... The topics on which it imprints itself, and which I have discussed in some diagnostic detail in the aforementioned book, include: consciousness and the mind-body problem, the nature and identity of the self, the foundations of meaning, the possibility of free will, the availability of a priori and empirical knowledge...  Basically what we find, quite generally, is the threat of magic or elimination in the face of the theoretical obduracy of the phenomenon that invites philosophical attention. The phenomenon presents initial problems of possibility... Free will, for instance, looks upon early inspection to be impossible, so we try to find some conception of it that permits its existence, but this conception always turns out to be dubiously reductive and distorting, leaving us with the unpalatable options of magic, elimination or quietism... so we hop unhappily from one unsatisfactory option to the next; or dig our heels (squintingly) into a position that seems the least intellectually unconscionable of the bunch... Science, then, might be aptly characterised as that set of questions that does not attract [these] options – where our cognitive faculties allow us to form the necessary concepts and theories. The distinction between science and philosophy is, on this view, at root a reflection of the cognitive powers we happen to possess or lack, and is therefore creature-relative: it does not correspond to any interesting real division within objective reality... It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that our brains would have to be made of something other than neurons in order for us to have the kinds of cognitive powers needed to solve the problems philosophy poses; at any rate, this is the sort of diagnosis [transcendental naturalism] offers for our philosophical retardation... The hardness of philosophy is thus an upshot of the particular way that natural selection has built our thinking organ, not an objective trait of the subject-matter of philosophical questions.&lt;ref name ="McGinn1994" /&gt;|Colin McGinn|"Problems in Philosophy" in ''Philosophical Studies''}}

==Friedrich Hayek==
For [[Friedrich Hayek]], "The whole idea of the mind explaining itself is a logical contradiction"... and "takes this incompleteness—the constitutional inability of mind to explain itself—to be a generalized case of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]... Hayek is ''not'' a naturalistic agnostic, that is, the view that science ''currently'' cannot offer an explanation of the mind-body relationship, but in principle it could."&lt;ref name ="Butos2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=W.N. | last =Butos |year=2010 |title=The Social Science of Hayek's The Sensory Order | series = Advances in [[Austrian Economics]] | publisher =Emerald |isbn=978-1-84950975-6 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo4pjUvVmHEC&amp;pg=PA127 | pages = 127–28 | quote=1.

==John Tyndall==
{{quote | [The] passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one to the other. They appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem, "How are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness?" The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable. Let the consciousness of love, for example, be associated with a right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and the consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should then know, when we love, that the motion is in one direction, and, when we hate, that the motion is in the other; but the "Why?" would remain as unanswerable as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tyndall | first = John | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hipQtHDerYQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=86#PPA86,M1 | title = Fragments of Science | date = 1871 | pages = 86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|John Tyndall (1871)|''Fragments of Science''}}

==Noam Chomsky==
[[Noam Chomsky]] argues that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology and that certain problems may be beyond our understanding:
{{quote |A Martian scientist, with a mind different from ours might regard this problem [of free will] as trivial, and wonder why humans never seem to hit on the obvious way of solving it.  This observer might also be amazed at the ability of every human child to acquire language, something that seems to him incomprehensible, requiring divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Noam | last = Chomsky | title = Language and problems of knowledge | year = 1988 | page = 152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|Noam Chomsky|''Language and problems of knowledge''}}

==Phenomena and noumena==
As argued in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', human thinking is unavoidably structured by [[categories of the understanding]]:
{{Quote | '''Quantity''' – Unity, Plurality, Totality.&lt;br&gt;
'''Quality''' – [[Reality]], Negation, Limitation.&lt;br&gt;
'''Relation''' – [[Inherence]] and Subsistence, [[Causality]] and Dependence, Community.&lt;br&gt;
'''Modality''' – [[Logical possibility|Possibility]] or Impossibility, [[Existence]] or Non-Existence, Necessity or Contingence.}}

These are ideas to which there is no escape, thus they pose a limit to thinking. What can be known through the categories is called [[phenomena]] and what is outside the categories is called [[noumena]], the unthinkable "things in themselves".

==New mysterians==
{{main|New mysterianism}}
In his (famous) essay "[[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?]]" [[Thomas Nagel]] mentions the possibility of cognitive closure to the [[subjective character of experience]] and the (deep) implications that it has for [[materialism|materialist]] [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[science]]. [[Owen Flanagan]] noted in his 1991 book ''Science of the Mind'' that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness will never be completely explained. Flanagan called them "the new mysterians" after the rock group [[Question Mark and the Mysterians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Flanagan |title=The Science of the Mind |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-262-56056-9 |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McGinn, the solution to the [[mind-body problem]] cannot be grasped, despite the fact that the solution is "written in our genes".

[[Emergent materialism]] is a similar but different claim that humans are not smart enough to determine "the relationship between [[mind]] and matter."{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

==Criticism==
While the nature of consciousness is complex, according to some philosophers, that does not imply closure, thus, McGinn's argument is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garvey|first1=James|title=What Does McGinn Think We Cannot Know?|quote=Nothing he says gets him the conclusion that we cannot solve the mind-body problem, given any of these interpretations of what is cognitively closed to us|journal=Analysis|date=July 1997|volume=57|issue=3|pages=196–201|doi=10.1111/1467-8284.00074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirk|first1=Robert|title=Why Shouldn't We Be Able to Solve the Mind-Body Problem?|quote=He recognizes that many will find this outrageous; and indeed I think that his reasoning is fundamentally flawed and his central thesis false.

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}
'''Computational complexity theory''' focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying their [[computational complexity]], i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The [[P versus NP problem]], one of the seven [[Millenium Prize Problems]], is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=P vs NP Problem {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem |website=www.claymath.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computability theory]]. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.

==Computational problems==
[[Image:TSP Deutschland 3.png|thumb|333px|A traveling salesman tour through 14 German cities.]]

===Problem instances===
A [[computational problem]] can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of [[primality testing]]. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is "yes" if the number is prime and "no" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is "no"). Stated another way, the ''instance'' is a particular input to the problem, and the ''solution'' is the output corresponding to the given input.

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the [[traveling salesman problem]]: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in [[Milan]] whose total length is at most 10&amp;nbsp;km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.

===Representing problem instances===
When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a [[string (computer science)|string]] over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are [[bitstring]]s. As in a real-world [[computer]], mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, [[integer]]s can be represented in [[binary notation]], and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s can be encoded directly via their [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]], or by encoding their [[adjacency list]]s in binary.

Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.

===Decision problems as formal languages===
[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A [[decision problem]] has only two possible outputs, ''yes'' or ''no'' (or alternately 1 or 0) on any input.]]
[[Decision problem]]s are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either ''yes'' or ''no'', or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a [[formal language]], where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an [[algorithm]], whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer ''yes'', the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.

An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

===Function problems===
A [[function problem]] is a computational problem where a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]]—that is, the output isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]].

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') such that the relation ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.

===Measuring the size of an instance===
To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2''n'' vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with ''n'' vertices?

If the input size is ''n'', the time taken can be expressed as a function of ''n''. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(''n'') is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size ''n''. If T(''n'') is a polynomial in ''n'', then the algorithm is said to be a [[polynomial time]] algorithm. [[Cobham's thesis]] argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.

==Machine models and complexity measures==

===Turing machine===
[[File:Turing machine 2b.svg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of a Turing machine]]
{{main|Turing machine}}
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a [[RAM machine]], [[Conway's Game of Life]], [[cellular automata]] or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.

Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as [[deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s, [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and [[alternating Turing machine]]s. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.

A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called [[randomized algorithm]]s. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see [[non-deterministic algorithm]].

===Other machine models===
Many machine models different from the standard [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machines]] have been proposed in the literature, for example [[random access machine]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Chapter 1: The computational model and why it doesn't matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all these models have in common is that the machines operate [[deterministic algorithm|deterministically]].

However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that [[non-deterministic time]] is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.

===Complexity measures===
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the [[deterministic Turing machine]] is used. The ''time required'' by a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' on input ''x'' is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" or "no"). A Turing machine ''M'' is said to operate within time ''f''(''n''), if the time required by ''M'' on each input of length ''n'' is at most ''f''(''n''). A decision problem ''A'' can be solved in time ''f''(''n'') if there exists a Turing machine operating in time ''f''(''n'') that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time ''f''(''n'') on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by [[DTIME]](''f''(''n'')).

Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any [[Complexity|complexity measure]] can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the [[Blum complexity axioms]]. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include [[communication complexity]], [[circuit complexity]], and [[decision tree complexity]].

The complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using [[big O notation]].

===Best, worst and average case complexity===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|250px|Visualization of the [[quicksort]] [[algorithm]] that has [[Best, worst and average case|average case performance]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The [[best, worst and average case]] complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size ''n'' may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
#Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size ''n''.
#Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a [[probability distribution]] over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size ''n''.
#[[Amortized analysis]]: Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.
#Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size ''n''.
The order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of [[discrete uniform distribution]]), amortized, worst.

For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm [[quicksort]]. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(''n'' log ''n''). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===
To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of [[analysis of algorithms]]. To show an upper bound ''T''(''n'') on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most ''T''(''n''). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase "all possible algorithms" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of ''T''(''n'') for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than ''T''(''n'').

Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the [[big O notation]], which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40, in big O notation one would write ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Complexity classes==
{{main|Complexity class}}

===Defining complexity classes===
A '''complexity class''' is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:
* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s, [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s, [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.
* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on non-deterministic Turing machines, [[Boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.
* The resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds: These two properties are usually stated together, such as "polynomial time", "logarithmic space", "constant depth", etc.

Some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:

:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time ''f''(''n''). (This complexity class is known as DTIME(''f''(''n'')).)

But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham-Edmonds thesis]] states that "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]], which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is [[FP (complexity)|FP]].

===Important complexity classes===

[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|250px|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among complexity classes]]
Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:

|}

The logarithmic-space classes (necessarily) do not take into account the space needed to represent the problem.

It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by [[Savitch's theorem]].

Other important complexity classes include [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]] and [[RP (complexity)|RP]], which are defined using [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s; [[AC (complexity)|AC]] and [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which are defined using Boolean circuits; and [[BQP]] and [[QMA]], which are defined using quantum Turing machines. [[Sharp-P|#P]] is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like [[IP (complexity)|IP]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]] are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s. [[ALL (complexity)|ALL]] is the class of all decision problems.

===Hierarchy theorems===
{{main|time hierarchy theorem|space hierarchy theorem}}
For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(''n'') is contained in DTIME(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

More precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DTIME}\big(f(n) \big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DTIME} \big(f(n) \sdot \log^{2}(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DSPACE}\big(f(n)\big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DSPACE} \big(f(n) \sdot \log(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

===Reduction===
{{main|Reduction (complexity)}}
Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.

The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems ''C'' if every problem in ''C'' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in ''C'' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in ''C''. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of [[NP-hard]] problems.

If a problem ''X'' is in ''C'' and hard for ''C'', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for ''C''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in ''C''. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in ''C''.) Thus the class of [[NP-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to another problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an [[NP-complete]] problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"/&gt;

==Important open problems==
[[Image:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP. The existence of problems in NP outside both P and NP-complete in this case was established by Ladner.&lt;ref name="Ladner75"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ladner|first=Richard E.|title=On the structure of polynomial time reducibility|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |volume=22|year=1975|pages=151–171|doi=10.1145/321864.321877|issue=1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===P versus NP problem===
{{Main|P versus NP problem}}

The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[vertex cover problem]]. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.

The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"&gt;See {{harvnb|Sipser|2006|loc= Chapter 7: Time complexity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions.

===Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete===
It was shown by Ladner that if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' then there exist problems in '''NP''' that are neither in '''P''' nor '''NP-complete'''.&lt;ref name="Ladner75" /&gt; Such problems are called [[NP-intermediate]] problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in '''P''' or to be '''NP-complete'''.

The [[graph isomorphism problem]] is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP-complete''', or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.&lt;ref name="AK06"&gt;{{Citation

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[László Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]] has run time &lt;math&gt;O(2^{\sqrt{n \log n}})&lt;/math&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices, although some recent work by Babai offers some potentially new perspectives on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Babai |first=László |date=2016 |title=Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time |eprint=1512.03547 |class=cs.DS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''co-NP''' (and even in UP and co-UP&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is '''NP-complete''', the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' will equal '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes time &lt;math&gt;O(e^{\left(\frac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}(\log n)^{1/3}(\log \log n)^{2/3}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram MathWorld: [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html Number Field Sieve]&lt;/ref&gt; to factor an integer ''n''. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

===Separations between other complexity classes===
Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance '''P''' ⊆ '''NP''' ⊆ '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' ⊆ '''PSPACE''', but it is possible that '''P''' = '''PSPACE'''. If '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', then '''P''' is not equal to '''PSPACE''' either. Since there are many known complexity classes between '''P''' and '''PSPACE''', such as '''RP''', '''BPP''', '''PP''', '''BQP''', '''MA''', '''PH''', etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

Along the same lines, '''[[co-NP]]''' is the class containing the [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] problems (i.e. problems with the ''yes''/''no'' answers reversed) of '''NP''' problems. It is believed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/ Boaz Barak's course on Computational Complexity] [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/lec2.pdf Lecture 2]&lt;/ref&gt; that '''NP''' is not equal to '''co-NP'''; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', since if '''P'''='''NP''' we would also have '''P'''='''co-NP''', since problems in '''NP''' are dual to those in '''co-NP'''.

Similarly, it is not known if '''L''' (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in '''P''' or equal to '''P'''. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as '''NL''' and '''NC''', and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

It is suspected that '''P''' and '''BPP''' are equal. However, it is currently open if '''BPP''' = '''NEXP'''.

A problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time), but for which in practice ''any'' solution takes too many resources to be useful, is known as an '''{{visible anchor|intractable problem}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, J.E., Motwani, R. and Ullman, J.D. (2007) [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], Addison Wesley, Boston/San Francisco/New York (page 368)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a '''{{visible anchor|tractable problem}}''', literally "a problem that can be handled". The term ''[[wikt:infeasible|infeasible]]'' (literally "cannot be done") is sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[wikt:intractable|intractable]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms and Complexity |first=Gerard |last=Meurant |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-08093391-7 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WriBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=computational+feasibility+tractability p. 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risks confusion with a [[feasible solution]] in [[mathematical optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;

Tractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions ('''P''', '''PTIME'''); this is known as the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then [[NP-hard]] problems are also intractable in this sense.

However, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in [[Presburger arithmetic]] has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete [[knapsack problem]] over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and [[SAT solver]]s routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations before halting. For small ''n'', say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations each second, the program would run for about 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years, which is the same order of magnitude as the [[age of the universe]]. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations is practical until ''n'' gets relatively large.

Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.

==History==
An early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]] done by [[Gabriel Lamé]] in 1844.

Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.

The beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper "On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms" by [[Juris Hartmanis]] and [[Richard E. Stearns]], which laid out the definitions of [[time complexity]] and [[space complexity]], and proved the hierarchy theorems.&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1965 [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]] suggested to consider a "good" algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Karp, "[http://cecas.clemson.edu/~shierd/Shier/MthSc816/turing-karp.pdf Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness]", 1985 Turing Award Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"/&gt; [[John Myhill]]'s definition of [[linear bounded automata]] (Myhill 1960), [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as [[Hisao Yamada]]'s paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = H. | title = Real-Time Computation and Recursive Functions Not Real-Time Computable | journal = IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers | volume = EC-11 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–760 | year = 1962 | doi = 10.1109/TEC.1962.5219459}}&lt;/ref&gt; on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]] (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenbrot, B.A.: Signalizing functions and tabular operators. Uchionnye Zapiski
Penzenskogo Pedinstituta (Transactions of the Penza Pedagogoical Institute) 4, 75–87 (1956) (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; As he remembers:

{{quote|However, [my] initial interest [in automata theory] was increasingly set aside in favor of computational complexity, an exciting fusion of combinatorial methods, inherited from [[switching theory]], with the conceptual arsenal of the theory of algorithms. These ideas had occurred to me earlier in 1955 when I coined the term "signalizing function", which is nowadays commonly known as "complexity measure".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Trakhtenbrot, "From Logic to Theoretical Computer Science – An Update". In: ''Pillars of Computer Science'', LNCS 4800, Springer 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, [[Manuel Blum]] formulated a set of [[axiom]]s (now known as [[Blum axioms]]) specifying desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions and proved an important result, the so-called [[Blum's speedup theorem|speed-up theorem]]. The field began to flourish in 1971 when the [[Stephen Cook]] and [[Leonid Levin]] [[Cook–Levin theorem|proved]] the existence of practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]]. In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Richard M. Karp | chapter = Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems | chapter-url = http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs172/karp.pdf | title = Complexity of Computer Computations | editor = R. E. Miller and J. W. Thatcher (editors) | publisher = New York: Plenum | pages = 85–103 | year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, much work was done on the average difficulty of solving NP-complete problems—both exactly and approximately. At that time, computational complexity theory was at its height, and it was widely believed that if a problem turned out to be NP-complete, then there was little chance of being able to work with the problem in a practical situation. However, it became increasingly clear that this is not always the case, and some authors claimed that general asymptotic results are often unimportant for typical problems arising in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1143|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11007">{{short description|A global agenda for action in marine conservation}}
'''''Defying Ocean's End''''' (DOE) is a global agenda for action in [[marine conservation]] compiled in a 2004 [[Island Press]] book.  It is also the title of a 2003 [[Los Cabos]] ([[Mexico]]) conference, where the agenda was formulated.

The ''DOE'' website describes itself as "a practical agenda of action to safeguard the ocean for future generations to come.  This dynamic strategy-including costs and recommendations-is a collective voice for those seeking to reverse the disturbing trends we are witnessing in the ocean today.  As never again, we have an opportunity now to respond to this crisis, by moving beyond localized and ''ad hoc'' initiatives - however good they might be - to coordinated global action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org ''Defying Ocean's End'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also lists a "DOE Office" charged with distributing the agenda.  The office is composed of Dr. [[Sylvia Earle]], [[Arlo Hemphill]], Tim Noviello and Linda K. Glover:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp ''Defying Ocean's End'' Office Biographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090309/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Defying Ocean's End'' book==
Published in 2004 by Island Press, ''Defying Ocean's End'' is now used{{By whom|date=August 2016}} as a university textbook for marine conservation. The book is a collaboration of over 70 authors and was edited by Linda K. Glover and Dr. [[Sylvia Earle]], along with assistant editor [[Arlo Hemphill]] and maps created by Debra Fischman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/D/bo3559385.html ''Defying Ocean's End'' book]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book also includes a [[foreword]] by [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]] founding director Graeme Kelleher.

==Los Cabos conference==
''Defying Ocean's End'' was launched at a conference held in Los Cabos, Mexico on May 29 to June 3, 2003.  The conference was organized by [[Conservation International]]; convened by American [[oceanographer]], Dr. Sylvia Earle, and [[Intel Corporation]] co-founder, [[Gordon Moore]]; and chaired by Graeme Kelleher. It included the participation of nearly 150 experts from more than 20 countries, representing the fields of [[ocean science]], finance, and conservation.  A select group of senior representatives from world governments, corporations and the media were also in attendance.  In addition to Conservation International, a number of large, international conservation organizations collaborated on the conference.  These included [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[The Ocean Conservancy]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp ''DOE'' Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201095229/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference was sponsored by the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], [[BP]], [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines]] and the Alexander Henry Foundation.

The conference was structured into 5 regional case studies, 7 thematic working groups, and a business team focused on developing Action Plans which addressed specific issues and outcomes - with priorities, and costs identified—for 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year timeframes. Five case studies were presented to all Conference participants, which addressed lessons learned and recommendations in very different regions: The [[Caribbean]], [[Seamounts]], [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Waters]], The [[Coral Triangle]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Break-out discussions were divided into seven Thematic Working Groups on widely ranging science, conservation, social, economic and legal topics:

*Ocean-Use Planning and [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]]
*Economic Incentives and Disincentives
*Land-Ocean Interface
*Maintaining/Restoring Functional [[Marine Ecosystems]]
*Communication
*Ocean Governance
*The Unknown Ocean

A Business Team led by Larry Linden of [[Goldman Sachs]] worked with all groups to identify key cost drivers and estimate reasonable total solution costs.

===Results===
The DOE website lists the following "high level" results:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp About DOE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201084945/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global Governance: Treat the 60% of the world ocean outside of national Exclusive Economic Zones as a World Ocean Public Trust. Establish legal and implementation approaches concerning ocean uses in the high seas - including fisheries - under coordinated, international multi-use zoning regimes.
* Fisheries Reform: Use market-based mechanisms and changes to subsidies to reform fisheries through development of [[sustainable fishing]] projects, and the establishment of a global fund to provide incentives for the adoption of sustainable practices.
* Communications: Implement global and regional communications plans; focus on educating the general public worldwide to ocean problems. Initiate global all-media campaigns on major issues. In developing nations, tailor the message to local cultural concerns, understanding and information networks (e.g., tribal elders), and build local capacity for disseminating the message.
* Marine Protected Areas/Large Marine Ecosystems: Create, consolidate, and strengthen marine protected areas (MPAs) into a globally representative network. Develop/implement coordinated, global large marine ecosystem (LME) programs in identified priority regions. Provide more robust multi-use zoning and enforcement mechanisms to protect these LMEs. Establish LME/MPA protections over 5% of the world ocean within the next 10 years (0.7% currently).
* Global Science: Develop an expanded applied research program focused on top priority marine environments high in endemism and biodiversity - seamounts, shallow- and deep-water reefs, continental slopes, caves and blue holes.

==Background==
The origins of DAH can be traced back to a 1955 study by [[Philip L. Townes]] and [[Johannes Holtfreter]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt; In this study Townes and Holtfreter placed the three [[germ layer]]s of an amphibian into an alkaline solution, allowing them to dissociate into individual cells, and mixed these different types of cells together. Cells of different species were used to be able to visually observe and follow their movements. Cells of similar types migrated to their correct location and reaggregated to form germ layers in their developmentally correct positions. This experiment demonstrated that tissue organization can occur independent of the path taken, implying that it is mediated by forces that are persistently present and doesn't arise solely from the chronological sequence of developmental events preceding it.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

From these results Holtfreter developed his concept of [[selective affinity]], and hypothesized that well-timed changes to selective affinity of cells to one another throughout development guided morphogenesis.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; Several hypotheses were introduced to explain these results including the "timing hypothesis" and the "differential surface contraction hypothesis".&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; In 1964 [[Malcolm Steinberg]] introduced the "differential adhesion hypothesis" which uses thermodynamic principles to describe and explain patterns of cell sorting and arrangement observed.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

==Overview==
According to DAH, cellular movement and [[Cell sorting|assortment]] is governed by the spontaneous rearrangement of cells—in much the same way as a liquid—to a more thermodynamically stable equilibrium. This is achieved by maximizing the amount of energy that is utilized adhering the cells together, which decreases the free energy available in the system. As cells with similar strengths of surface adhesion bond to one another, bonding energy in the overall system increases, and interfacial free energy decreases causing the system to be more thermodynamically stable. Liquids behave in a comparable manner, but with molecules moving around due to [[kinetic energy]] instead of motile cells moving around due to a combination of their kinetics and active movement.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

This allows examples of tissue arrangement to be corresponded to the behavior of liquids, such as one tissue spreading across another being corresponded to oil spreading across water; the oil spreads across the water to minimize weak oil-water interactions and maximize stronger water-water and oil-oil interactions, the cells similarly sort themselves to be near other cells of similar adhesive strength and bond with them.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; Other tissue interactions that DAH offers an explanation for includes tissue hierarchy, where tissues with weaker surface adhesion surround tissues with stronger surface adhesion, the rounding of irregular cell masses to become spherical, and the cell sorting and construction of anatomical structures that occurs independent of the path taken.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

DAH does not rely on qualitative differences in cell adhesion, only on quantitative differences in the strength of their surface adhesion.&lt;ref name=Forgacs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgacs|first=Gabor|author2=Foty, Ramsey A.|author3=Shafrir, Yinon|author4=Steinberg, Malcolm S.|title=Viscoelastic Properties of Living Embryonic Tissues: a Quantitative Study|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=May 1998|volume=74|issue=5|pages=2227–2234|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349598779329|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77932-9|bibcode=1998BpJ....74.2227F}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAH has been supported experimentally and by computational models.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

==Applications==
Since its original formulation in the context of vertebrate embryogenesis, DAH has been utilized to offer an explanation for several other morphogenic phenomena including [[wound healing]], and [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] in cancer progression and [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

Dissolved organic carbon is abundant in [[Marine ecosystem|marine]] and [[Freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]] systems and is one of the greatest cycled reservoirs of [[organic matter]] on [[Earth]], accounting for the same amount of [[carbon]] as the [[atmosphere]] and up to 20% of all organic carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedges|first=John I.|title=Global biogeochemical cycles: progress and problems|journal=Marine Chemistry|date=3 December 1991|volume=39|pages=67–93| url=http://www.ic.ucsc.edu/~mdmccar/ocea213/readings/discuss_2_Hedges/Hedges_1992_MarChem_global_biogeochem_cycles_progress_problems.pdf|doi=10.1016/0304-4203(92)90096-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[organic carbon]] compounds are the result of [[decomposition]] processes from dead organic matter including [[Plant|plants]] and [[Animal|animals]]. Dissolved organic carbon can originate from within or external to the [[body of water]]. DOC originating from within the body of water is known as autochthonous DOC and typically comes from [[Aquatic plant|aquatic plants]] or [[algae]], while DOC originating external to the body of water is known as allochthonous DOC and typically comes from [[Soil|soils]] or [[Plant|terrestrial plants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kritzberg|first=Emma S.|last2=Cole|first2=Jonathan J.|last3=Pace|first3=Michael L.|last4=Granéli|first4=Wilhelm|last5=Bade|first5=Darren L.|date=2004-03|title=Autochthonous versus allochthonous carbon sources of bacteria: Results from whole-lake13C addition experiments|url=https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0588|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=49|issue=2|pages=588–596|doi=10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0588|issn=0024-3590}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When water originates from land areas with a high proportion of organic soils, these components can drain into rivers and lakes as dissolved organic carbon.

== Measurement ==
The dissolved fraction of organic [[carbon]] is an operational classification. Many researchers use the term "dissolved" for compounds below 0.45 [[micrometer]]s, but 0.22 micrometers is also common, saving [[colloid]]al for higher concentrations. A practical definition of dissolved typically used in [[Ocean chemistry|marine chemistry]] is all substances that pass through a GF/F filter. The recommended measure technique is the [[Total organic carbon#High temperature catalytic oxidation|HTCO]] technique after filtration on pre-combusted glass fiber filters, typically GF/F filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ijgofs.whoi.edu/Publications/Report_Series/reports.html|title=Protocols for the Joint Global Ocean Flux studies (JGOFS) core measurements|author1=Knap, A. Michaels|author2=A. Close|author3=A. Ducklow|author4=H. Dickson, A.|publisher=JGOFS|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Dissolved organic carbon is a food supplement, supporting growth of [[microorganism]]s and plays an important role in the global [[carbon cycle]] through the [[microbial loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirchman |first1=David L. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Yoshimi |last3=Garside |first3=Christopher |last4=Ducklow |first4=Hugh W. |title=High turnover rates of dissolved organic carbon during a spring phytoplankton bloom |journal=Nature |date=15 August 1991 |volume=352 |issue=6336 |pages=612–614 |doi=10.1038/352612a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v352/n6336/abs/352612a0.html |bibcode=1991Natur.352..612K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some organisms (stages) that do not feed in the traditional sense, dissolved matter may be the only external food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaeckle | first1 = W.B. | last2 = Manahan | first2 = D.T. | year = 1989 | title = Feeding by a "nonfeeding" larva: uptake of dissolved amino acids from seawater by lecithotrophic larvae of the gastropod ''Haliotis rufescens'' | url = | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 87–94 | doi = 10.1007/BF00391067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, dissolved carbon is an indicator of organic loadings in streams, as well as supporting terrestrial processing (e.g., within soil, forests, and wetlands) of organic matter. Dissolved organic carbon has a high proportion of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in first order streams compared to higher order streams. In the absence of extensive [[wetland]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[swamp]]s, baseflow concentrations of DOC in undisturbed watersheds generally range from approximately 1 to 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L carbon. Carbon concentrations considerably vary across ecosystems. For example, the [[Everglades]] may be near the top of the range and the middle of oceans may be near the bottom. Occasionally, high concentrations of organic carbon indicate anthropogenic influences, but most dissolved organic carbon originates naturally.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

The ''BDOC fraction'' consists of organic [[molecule]]s that [[heterotrophic]] [[bacteria]] can use as a source of energy and carbon. Some subset of DOC constitutes the precursors of disinfection byproducts for drinking water. Biodegradable dissolved organic carbon can contribute to undesirable biological regrowth within water distribution systems.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

==Distribution==
[[File:Vertical Dissolved Organic Carbon Distribution.PNG|thumb|A diagram showing the basic composition of dissolved organic matter in the ocean.|alt=]]

More precise measurement techniques developed in the late 1990s have allowed for a good understanding of how dissolved organic carbon is distributed in marine environments both vertically and across the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharp|first=Jonathan H.|title=Marine dissolved organic carbon: Are the older values correct?|journal=Marine Chemistry|date=6 August 1996|volume=56|issue=3–4|pages=265–277|doi=10.1016/S0304-4203(96)00075-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420396000758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now understood that dissolved organic carbon in the ocean spans a range from very [[labile]] to very [[refractory]]. The labile dissolved organic carbon is mainly produced by marine organisms and is consumed in the surface ocean, and consists of sugars, proteins, and other compounds that are easily used by marine bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sondergaard|first=Morten|author2=Mathias Middelboe|title=A cross-system analysis of labile dissolved organic carbon|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|date=9 March 1995|volume=118|pages=283–294|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/118/m118p283.pdf|doi=10.3354/meps118283|bibcode=1995MEPS..118..283S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refractory dissolved organic carbon is evenly spread throughout the water column and consists of high molecular weight and structurally complex compounds that are difficult for marine organisms to use such as the lignin, pollen, or humic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=David F.|author2=Jean-Paul Simjouw |author3=Sybil P. Seitzinger |author4= Gary L. Taghon |title=Dynamics and Characterization of Refractory Dissolved Organic Matter Produced by a Pure Bacterial Culture in an Experimental Predator-Prey System|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=June 2006|volume=72|issue=6|pages=4184–4191|doi=10.1128/AEM.02882-05|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/72/6/4184.full |pmid=16751530 |pmc=1489638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the observed vertical distribution consists of high concentrations in the upper water column and low concentrations at depth.

In addition to vertical distributions, horizontal distributions have been modeled and sampled as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansell|first=Dennis A.|author2=Craig A. Carlson |author3=Daniel J. Repeta |author4= Reiner Schlitzer |title=Dissolved Organic Matter in the Ocean: A Controversy Stimulates New Insights|journal=Oceanography|date=2009|volume=22|issue=4|pages=202–211|doi=10.5670/oceanog.2009.109|url=https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/3183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the surface ocean at a depth of 30 meters, the higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations are found in the South Pacific Gyre, the South Atlantic Gyre, and the Indian Ocean. At a depth of 3000 meters, highest concentrations are in the North Atlantic Deep Water where dissolved organic carbon from the high concentration surface ocean is removed to depth. Since the time scales of horizontal motion along the ocean bottom are in the thousands of years, the refractory dissolved organic carbon is slowly consumed on its way from the North Atlantic and reaches a minimum in the North Pacific.

== Interaction with metals ==
Dissolved organic carbon is also extremely important in the transport of [[metal]]s in aquatic systems.  Metals form extremely strong [[Coordination complex|complexes]] with dissolved organic carbon, enhancing metal solubility while also reducing metal [[bioavailability]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9813">In [[astrophysics]], '''dynamical friction''' or '''Chandrasekhar friction''', sometimes called ''gravitational drag'', is loss of [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]] of moving bodies through [[gravitation]]al interactions with surrounding [[matter]] in space. It was first discussed in detail by [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = S. | last = Chandrasekhar | authorlink = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | date = 1943 | bibcode = 1943ApJ....97..255C | title = Dynamical Friction.

==Intuitive account==

An intuition for the effect can be obtained by thinking of a massive object moving through a cloud of smaller lighter bodies. The effect of gravity causes the light bodies to accelerate and gain momentum and kinetic energy (see [[slingshot effect]]). By conservation of energy and momentum, we may conclude that the heavier body will be slowed by an amount to compensate. Since there is a loss of momentum and kinetic energy for the body under consideration, the effect is called ''dynamical friction''.

Another equivalent way of thinking about this process is that as a large object moves through a cloud of smaller objects, the gravitational effect of the larger object pulls the smaller objects towards it. There then exists a concentration of smaller objects behind the larger body (a ''gravitational wake''), as it has already moved past its previous position. This concentration of small objects behind the larger body exerts a collective gravitational force on the large object, slowing it down.

Of course, the mechanism works the same for all masses of interacting bodies and for any relative velocities between them. However, while the most probable outcome for an object moving through a cloud is a loss of momentum and energy, as described intuitively above, in the general case it might be either loss or gain. When the body under consideration is gaining momentum and energy the same physical mechanism is called [[slingshot effect]], or ''gravity assist''. This technique is sometimes used by interplanetary probes to obtain a boost in velocity by passing close by a planet.

==Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula==
The full Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula for the change in velocity of the object involves integrating over the [[phase space]] density of the field of matter and is far from transparent. The Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula reads as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{v}_M}{dt} = -16 \pi^2 \ln \Lambda G^2 m (M+m) \frac{1}{v_M^3}\int_0^{v_M}v^2 f(v)  d v \mathbf{v}_M&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass under consideration
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of each star in the star distribution
* &lt;math&gt; {v_M} &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object under consideration, in a frame where the center of gravity of the matter field is initially at rest
* &lt;math&gt; \mbox{Ln}(\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt; is the "[[Coulomb collision|Coulomb logarithm]]"
*&lt;math&gt;f(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number density distribution of the stars

===Maxwell's distribution===

A commonly used special case is where there is a uniform density in the field of matter, with matter particles significantly lighter than the major particle under consideration i.e., &lt;math&gt;M\gg m&lt;/math&gt; and with a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian distribution]] for the velocity of matter particles i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;f(v) = \frac{N}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{3/2}}e^{-\frac{v^2}{2\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of stars and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the dispersion. In this case, the dynamical friction formula is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | url = http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\mathbf{v}_M}{dt} = -\frac{4\pi \ln (\Lambda) G^2  \rho M}{v_M^3}\left[\mathrm{erf}(X)-\frac{2X}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-X^2}\right]\mathbf{v}_M&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; X = v_M/(\sqrt{2} \sigma) &lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the velocity of the object under consideration to the modal velocity of the Maxwellian distribution. 
* &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{erf}(X) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[error function]].
* &lt;math&gt; \rho= mN &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the matter field.

In general, a simplified equation for the force from dynamical friction has the form

&lt;math&gt;F_{dyn} \approx C \frac{G^2 M^2 \rho}{v^2_M}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[dimensionless]] numerical factor &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; depends on how &lt;math&gt;v_M&lt;/math&gt; compares to the velocity dispersion of the surrounding matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Density of the surrounding medium==
The greater the density of the surrounding medium, the stronger the force from dynamical friction.  Similarly, the force is proportional to the square of the mass of the object.  One of these terms is from the gravitational force between the object and the wake.  The second term is because the more massive the object, the more matter will be pulled into the wake.  The force is also proportional to the inverse square of the velocity.  This means the fractional rate of energy loss drops rapidly at high velocities. Dynamical friction is, therefore, unimportant for objects that move relativistically, such as photons.  This can be rationalized by realizing that the faster the object moves though the media, the less time there is for a wake to build up behind it.

==Applications==
Dynamical friction is particularly important in the formation of planetary systems and interactions between galaxies.

===Protoplanets===
During the formation of planetary systems, dynamical friction between the [[protoplanet]] and the [[protoplanetary disk]] causes energy to be transferred from the protoplanet to the disk.  This results in the inward migration of the protoplanet.

===Galaxies===
When galaxies interact through collisions, dynamical friction between stars causes matter to sink toward the center of the galaxy and for the orbits of stars to be randomized.  This process is called [[violent relaxation]] and can change two [[spiral galaxies]] into one larger [[elliptical galaxy]].

===Galaxy Clusters===
The effect of dynamical friction explains why the brightest (more massive) galaxy tends to be found near the center of a galaxy cluster. The effect of the two body collisions slows down the galaxy, and the drag effect is greater the larger the galaxy mass. When the galaxy loses kinetic energy, it moves towards the center of the cluster.
However the observed velocity dispersion of galaxies within a galaxy cluster does not depend on the mass of the galaxies. The explanation is that a galaxy cluster relaxes by  [[violent relaxation]], which sets the velocity dispersion to a value independent of the galaxy's mass.

===Photons===

[[Fritz Zwicky]] proposed in 1929 that a gravitational drag effect on photons could be used to explain [[cosmological redshift]] as a form of [[tired light]].&lt;ref name=Zwicky1929&gt;{{Citation | title = ON THE REDSHIFT OF SPECTRAL LINES THROUGH INTERSTELLAR SPACE
| first = F. | last = Zwicky | authorlink = Fritz Zwicky
| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
| volume = 15
|date=October 1929 | issue = 10

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his analysis had a mathematical error, and his approximation to the magnitude of the effect should actually have been zero, as pointed out in the same year by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]. Zwicky promptly acknowledged the correction,&lt;ref name=Zwicky1929B&gt;{{Citation | title = On the Possibilities of a Gravitational Drag of Light | bibcode = 1929PhRv...34.1623Z | journal = Physical Review | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = 1623&amp;ndash;1624| date = 1929 | first = F. | last = Zwicky | authorlink = Fritz Zwicky | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.34.1623.2 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he continued to hope that a full treatment would be able to show the effect.

It is now known that the effect of dynamical friction on photons or other particles moving at relativistic speeds is negligible, since the magnitude of the drag is inversely proportional to the square of velocity. Cosmological redshift is conventionally understood to be a consequence of the [[metric expansion of space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16674">'''Earth section paths''' are paths on the earth defined by the intersection of a [[reference ellipsoid]] and a plane. Common examples of earth sections include the great ellipse and normal sections. This page provides a unifying approach to all earth sections and their associated [[geodesy|geodetic problems]].

== The Indirect Problem ==
The indirect problem for earth sections is: given two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; on the surface of the reference ellipsoid, find the length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, of the short arc of a spheroid section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; and also find the departure and arrival (true north referenced) [[azimuth]]s of that curve, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; have geodetic latitude  &lt;math&gt;\phi_k&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; (k=1,2). This problem is best solved using [[analytic geometry]] in [[ECEF]] coordinates.
Let &lt;math&gt;R_1=ECEF(P_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2=ECEF(P_2)&lt;/math&gt; be the ECEF coordinates of the two points, computed using the geodetic to ECEF transformations discussed [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

=== Section plane ===
To define the section plane select any third point &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; not on the line from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to be on the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; will define the normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the origin then the earth section is the great ellipse. (The origin would be co-linear with 2 antipodal points so a different point must be used in that case). Since there are infinitely many choices for &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;, the above problem is really a class of problems (one for each plane). Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be given. To put the equation of the plane into the standard form, &lt;math&gt;lx + my + nz = d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\ l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, requires the components of a [[unit vector]], &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;, normal to the section plane. These components may be computed as follows: The vector from &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_0=R_1 - R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_1=R_2 - R_1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;unit(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The orientation convention used here is that &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; points to the left of the path. If this is not the case then redefine &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; = -&lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the parameter d for the plane may be computed using the [[dot product]] of &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; with a vector from the origin to any point on the plane, such as &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. d = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}\cdot{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of the plane (in vector form) is thus &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; ⋅ &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = d, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]] of (x, y, z).

=== Azimuth ===
A unit vector pointing up at any point on the ellipsoid is: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(\cos\phi\cos\lambda,\cos\phi\sin\lambda,\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, a unit vector pointing north is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\phi\cos\lambda,-\sin\phi\sin\lambda,\cos\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and east is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\lambda,\cos\lambda,0)&lt;/math&gt;. A vector tangent to the path is:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}= \hat{N} \times \mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; so the east component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the north component is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the azimuth may be obtained from a [[atan2|two-argument arctangent function]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}},\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}})&lt;/math&gt;. Use this method at both &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Section Ellipse ===
The (non-trivial) intersection of a plane and ellipsoid is an ellipse. Therefore, the arc length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, on the section path from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[elliptic integral]] that may be computed to any desired accuracy using a truncated series. Before this can be done the ellipse must be defined and the limits of integration computed.
Let the ellipsoid given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt; p=\sqrt{l^2+m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
If p=0 then the section is a horizontal circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

If p&gt;0 then Gilbertson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbertson|first1=Charles|title=Earth Section Paths|journal=Navigation|date=Spring 2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1-7|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/navi.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the ECEF coordinates of the center of the ellipse is &lt;math&gt;{R_c}=\frac{d}{C}(la^2, ma^2, nb^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C=a^2p^2+b^2n^2&lt;/math&gt;,

the semi-major axis is &lt;math&gt;a^*=a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}=(\frac{m}{p}, \frac{-l}{p}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, and
the semi-minor axis is &lt;math&gt;b^*=\frac{b}{\sqrt{C}}a^*&lt;/math&gt;,  in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}=(\frac{ln}{p}, \frac{mn}{p}, -p)&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;\sqrt{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arc Length ===
The polar form relative to center for the equation of an ellipse is &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)= \frac{b^*}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e^2=1-\frac{(b^*)^2}{(a^*)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, relates to the ellipse eccentricity,  not the spheroid eccentricity (see [[ellipse]]). Let P be a point on the ellipse and &lt;math&gt;R=ECEF(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then the vector from &lt;math&gt;{R_c}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;R-R_c&lt;/math&gt;. Using an argument similar to the one for azimuth above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}=unit(R-R_c)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta =\operatorname{atan2}(\sin\theta,\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we obtain the central angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Care must be taken to ensure that 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt; \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1  + \pi &lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[arc length]] along the ellipse is given by &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; =&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{R^2+(R^')^2}d\theta.&lt;/math&gt; Substituting &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; above into this formula, performing the indicated operations, using one more term than Gilbertson's expression and regrouping, results in 
&lt;math&gt;s_{12} = ArcLength(\theta_1,\theta_2) = b^*({c_0}\Delta\theta + {c_1}\Delta s2 + {c_2}\Delta s4 + {c_3}\Delta s6)&lt;/math&gt;, where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta\theta&amp;=\theta_2-\theta_1,\\[6pt]
\Delta s2&amp;=\sin(2\theta_2)-\sin(2\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s4&amp;=\sin(4\theta_2)-\sin(4\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s6&amp;=\sin(6\theta_2)-\sin(6\theta_1),\\[6pt]
{c_0}&amp;=1+e^2(4096 + 3328e^2 + 2880e^4 + 2577e^6 + 16860e^8)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_1}&amp;=e^2(512 + 384e^2 + 380e^4 + 385e^6 + 3408e^8)/4096,\\[6pt]
{c_2}&amp;=-e^4(64 + 80e^2 + 19e^4 - 3516e^6)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_3}&amp;=-e^6(60 + 105e^2 - 528e^4)/12288.\\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, expansions for the [[Meridian arc]] may be used here by replacing the spheroid eccentricity with the section ellipse eccentricity.

== The Direct Problem ==
The direct problem is given &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, the distance, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and departure azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; and the arrival azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Section plane ===
Construct the tangent vector at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}= \mathbf\hat{n_1}\cos{\alpha_1} + \mathbf{\hat{e_1}}\sin{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors pointing north and east (respectively) at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Pick a vector,  &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;, to define the section plane, paying attention to orientation. Observe that &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; must not be in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1} ,\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt;} (otherwise the plane would be tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, so no path would result). The normal vector &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}&lt;/math&gt;),  together with &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; defines the plane.
=== Locate &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;===
This is a 2-d problem in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{i^*} , \mathbf\hat{j^*}&lt;/math&gt;},  which will be solved with the help of the arc length formula above. The basic approach is to use Newton-Raphson iteration to arrive at &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;. The basis of the estimate is that the position vector of any point on the section ellipse may be expressed in terms of the position vector of the center and the central angle as 
&lt;math&gt;V={V_c} + {r(\theta)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
To get an initial estimate of &lt;math&gt;{\theta_2}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;{V_1}={R_1}-R{_c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\theta_1}&lt;/math&gt;=Central_Angle&lt;math&gt;({V_1})&lt;/math&gt; (see the arc length section above),
&lt;math&gt;{r_1}=r({\theta_1})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta=\frac{\delta}{r_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now initialize &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 + \Delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and iterate the following steps:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= ArcLength({\theta_1}, {\theta_2}),\\[6pt]
Err &amp;= \delta - s,\\[6pt]
s'({\theta}) &amp;= \frac{b^*}{(1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta)}\sqrt{\frac{(1-(2-e^2) e^2 \cos^2 \theta}{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}},\\[6pt]
\Delta\theta &amp;= \frac{Err}{s'({\theta_2})}, \\[6pt]
\theta_2 &amp;= \theta_2 + \Delta\theta, \\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
exit when &lt;math&gt;abs(\Delta\theta) &lt; 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt;

No more than three iterations are usually necessary, although nearly antipodal cases can be problematic.
Finally, let &lt;math&gt;{V_2}={V_c} + {r(\theta_2)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta_2+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; = ECEF_to_Geo&lt;math&gt;({V_2})&lt;/math&gt; using Bowring’s 1985 algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The accuracy of geodetic latitude and height equations|journal=Survey Review|date=1985|volume=28|issue=218|pages=202-206}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the algorithm [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

Alternatively, inversion of the arc length series may be used to avoid iterations.

=== Azimuth ===
Azimuth may be obtained by the same method as the indirect problem: &lt;math&gt;{\alpha_2}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e_2}},\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n_2}})&lt;/math&gt;, where the subscript 2 indicates evaluation of the associated quantity at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
=== The great ellipse ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be the origin, so that &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; = the position vector of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;. The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The Direct and Inverse Solutions for the Great Elliptic Line on the Reference Ellipsoid|journal=Bulletin Geodesique|date=1984|volume=58|issue=1|pages=101-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normal sections ===
The normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; (the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;). The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The normal section -- forward and inverse formulae at any distance|journal=Survey Review|date=1971|volume=XXI|issue=161|pages=131-136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The mean normal section ===
The mean normal section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;0.5(\mathbf\hat{u_1}+\mathbf\hat{u_2})&lt;/math&gt;. This is a good approximation to the geodesic from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; for aviation or sailing.

=== A class of sections ===
A class of sections may be imagined by rotating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; about the chord connecting &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2.&lt;/math&gt; All of these may be solved with the single approach above.

== Intersections ==
Let two section planes be given: &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the two planes are not parallel, the line of intersection is on both planes. Hence orthogonal to both normals, i.e. in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = \hat{N_1} \times \hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; are not colinear &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there exist constants &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; such that the line of intersection of the 2 planes is given by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, where t is an independent parameter.

Since this line is on both section planes, it satisfies both: 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving these equations for &lt;math&gt;{C_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{C_2}&lt;/math&gt; gives 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;), and 
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;).

Define the “dihedral angle”, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_1}}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_1- d_2  \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; ,  and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_2- d_1 \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2 \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the intersection line we have &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;,  where &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;l_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;m_3&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;C_1l_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2l_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1m_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2m_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1n_1&lt;/math&gt; +&lt;math&gt;C_2n_2&lt;/math&gt;.
and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_i}&lt;/math&gt;=(&lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;), for i=1,2,3.

To find the intersection of this line with the earth, plug the line equations into &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, to get
&lt;math&gt;At^2 + 2Bt + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;l_3^2 + m_3^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}n_3^2&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0l_3 + y_0m_3 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0n_3&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 + y_0^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0^2 - a^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the line intersects the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{{B}^2-AC}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 &lt; AC&lt;/math&gt;, then there is no intersection. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;, then the line is tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = -B/A&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the sections intersect at that single point).

Observe that &lt;math&gt;A\ne0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;are not colinear.  Plugging t into
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections.

=== Examples ===
==== Maximum or Minimum Latitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = (m, -l, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;d_2 = z_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging t into &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0 + t\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections. Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm b^*\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Maximum or Minimum Longitude ====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3387">'''Environmental stewardship''' refers to responsible use and protection of the [[natural environment]] through [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[Sustainability|sustainable]] practices. [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1949) championed environmental stewardship based on a [[land ethic]] "dealing with man's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo. 1949. ''A Sand County Almanac''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilience-Based Ecosystem Stewardship==
Resilience-Based Ecosystem Stewardship emphasizes [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] as a basic feature of the changing world as well as [[ecosystems]] that provide a suite of [[ecosystem services]] rather than a single [[resource]], and [[stewardship]] that recognizes [[Resource management|resource managers]] as an integral part of the systems they manage.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F. Stuart III, Gary P. Kofinas, and Carl Folke (eds). 2009. ''Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship: Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in a Changing World''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-0387730325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience refers to the ability of a system to absorb [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and still maintain its basic function and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Brian, and David Salt. 2006.

==Different types of environmental stewards==
{{tone|Section|date=January 2018}}
One author suggests that there are 3 types of environmental stewards: doers, donors, and practitioners. Doers go out and help the cause by taking action. For example, the doers in an oil spill would be the volunteers that go along the beach and help clean up the oil from the beaches. A donor is the person that financially helps the cause. They can do anything from donating their money, to hosting public events to raise funds. They are typically governmental agencies. Lastly there are practitioners. They work on a day-to-day basis to  steer governmental agencies, scientists, stakeholder groups, or any other group toward a stewardship outcome. Together these 3 groups make up environmental stewards and with the help keep the ecosystem running healthily.&lt;ref&gt;Increasing Capacity for Stewardship of Oceans and Coasts, P. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Anybody can be an environmental steward by being aware and knowledgeable of the world around them and making sure they do as little as possible to negatively impact our world. Without these groups it would be hard to get any sort of sustainability in our increasingly industrially based world. &lt;ref&gt;[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]]. (2008). ''Increasing Capacity for Stewardship of Oceans and Coasts.'' The National Academic Press, 500 Fifth Street, NW Washington DC 20001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "escagraph" &lt;ref name=SMITH&gt;'''Smith, Dr. Larry R.'''	''[http://www.escagraph.com/ Mouthful of Words]''  Copyright© 2012.  ''[http://www.escagraph.com/mediawiki/index.php/Escagraph_Introduction Escagraph]''&lt;/ref&gt; was first used&lt;ref name=SSU&gt;'''SSU Weekly'''	[http://www.uis.edu/archives/campus_news/SSU%20Weekly%20v01%201984-85.pdf Volume 1, Number 31], ''Edible Language'', page 61, '''April 18, 1985'''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s by [[Dr. Larry R. Smith]] to identify and describe the many forms, past and present, of ''writing on food'' and ''letters as food''.  The term is a concatenation of ''esca'' (from Latin meaning "victuals" or "things to be eaten") and ''graph'' (after the Greek meaning: "mark" or the infinitive verb "to write").

== History ==
Research has identified examples of escagraphs as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]] &lt;ref name=BREASTED&gt;'''[[James Henry Breasted]]''' 1962	''Ancient Records of Egypt'' (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref name=GUSMAN&gt;'''Gusman, Pierre''' 1900	''Pompeii: The City, Its Life and Art'' (London, William Heinemann).&lt;/ref&gt; primarily bread with words stamped into them prior to baking.   Use of escagraphs waned a bit during periods of [[early Christianity]] &lt;ref name=GALAVARIS&gt;'''Galavaris, George''' 1970	''Bread and the Liturgy: The Symbolism of Early Christian and Byzantine Bread Stamps'' (Madison, University of Wisconsin Press). {{ISBN|0-299-05310-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-05310-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the 19th century, though some interesting examples exist in [[Assize of Bread and Ale|bread assizes]] and [[Subtlety|sotelties]].

== Examples ==
=== Sweet ===
Most forms of escagraphs today are sweet, either molded into or drawn onto the surface of the food.  Cakes with "Happy Birthday" are extremely common.  Heart-shaped candies&lt;ref name=NECCO&gt;'''Necco Sweatheart'''
New England Confectionery Company. http://www.necco.com&lt;/ref&gt; with mottoes on them have been produced since about 1901 and are often shared at [[Valentine's Day]].  Many chocolate bars bear the name of their maker imprinted on their surface.&lt;ref name=HERSHEY&gt;'''Hershey's Chocolate Bar with Almonds'''&lt;br&gt;
''[http://www.hersheys.com/ The Hershey Company]''  http://www.hersheys.com/happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawful ===
Only a few lawful examples remain, since the bread assizes of the 15th century.  However, the [http://www/usda.gov/ United States Department of Agriculture] does mark&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;
'''USDA''' United States Department of Agriculture ''[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Inspection_&amp;_Grading/index.asp Inspection &amp; Grading - What Are The Differences?]'' http://www.usda.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; certain meat products with certifications and grades in an edible ink.

=== Moveable Type ===
From alphabet cookies to cereal to pasta, letters and moveable type are very common even today.  Throughout the western world, cookies shaped as letters are made both as edible toys and ostensibly to help children learn their letters.  Many manufacturers provide alphabet pasta letters (and numbers) in both ready-to-eat and dry forms.

The '''European Law Students' Association''' ('''ELSA''') is an international, independent, non-political, non-profit, [[non-governmental organisation]] run by and for law students. ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA.

==History==
Five law students from [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[West Germany]] founded ELSA on 4 May 1981. It claims to be the world's largest independent law students association and to be represented at nearly 375 law faculties in 44 countries&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/network/&lt;/ref&gt; across Europe with membership of some 50,000 students and young lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/#home&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA and in order to provide its members opportunities to enhance their skills and to interact with each other.

==Organization==
ELSA is organized into local member groups active at university level (Local Group), national member groups active on a national level (National Group), and ELSA International active on an international level. 

Membership of ELSA for individual law students is possible through the Local Groups (for instance ELSA Leiden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsaleiden.nl/nl/&lt;/ref&gt;). The Local Groups are member of a National Group (for instance ELSA the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;http://elsa-thenetherlands.org/&lt;/ref&gt;). The National Groups are part of the international ELSA network, which is managed by ELSA International with headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. ELSA International consists of the International Board, the ELSA International Team, and the Auditors of ELSA.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/team/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Board is the supreme executive body of the association. Its members are elected at an International Council Meeting (ICM) (which consists of all the National Groups) for a one-year period. The International Board's responsibilities include the overall co-ordination of the organisation as a whole including the support of member groups both locally and nationally. The International Board also co-ordinates and develops ELSA's collaboration with various international organisations and institutions, governments, law firms, and companies across Europe.

==Identity==
ELSA's 350 university-based local groups and 44 national groups as well as the international board are entirely student-managed and administered. Similar to a small franchise, each group creates its own plan of operation in line with the overall goals of the association. Each group recruits and trains its volunteer executives and markets ELSA's programmes to the academic and business community. In combination with the university curriculum, ELSA prepares its members for their future entry into professional life, especially when working in an international environment. The philosophy of ELSA is defined by the following statements regarding its vision, purpose, and means&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;: 

''Vision:''&lt;br&gt;"A just world in which there is respect for human dignity and cultural diversity".

''Purpose:''&lt;br&gt;"To contribute to legal education, to foster mutual understanding and to promote social responsibility of law students and young lawyers".

''Means:''&lt;br&gt;
*Providing opportunities for law students and young lawyers to learn about other cultures and legal systems in a spirit of critical dialogue and scientific co-operation.
*Assisting law students and young lawyers to be internationally minded and professionally skilled.
*Encouraging law students and young lawyers to act for the good of society.

==Institutional relations==
ELSA has gained consultative status with several United Nations bodies. In 1994, ELSA was granted Consultative Status in Category C in [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/non-governmental-organizations/european-law-students-association&lt;/ref&gt;, and in 1997 ELSA obtained Special Consultative Status with [[ECOSOC]] (United Nations Economic and Social Council)&lt;ref&gt;See section II http://undocs.org/E/2016/INF/5&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition [[UNCITRAL]] (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) is inviting ELSA delegations to participate in their sessions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

ELSA was part of the Diplomatic Conference of 1998 in [[Rome]] where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted to establish the [[International Criminal Court]]. ELSA participated with a delegation as an NGO represented by an observer.&lt;ref&gt;See Annex IV http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/finalfra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ELSA was granted Participatory Status with the [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;http://coe-ngo.org/#/ingos&lt;/ref&gt;. This cooperation was further widened with the signing of a Human Rights Partnership between Council of Europe and ELSA in 2008&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/human-rights-channel/elsa&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, ELSA has a co-operation agreement with [[UNHCR]] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In October 2005, ELSA obtained Observer Status with [[WIPO]] (World Intellectual Property Organization)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/members/en/organizations.jsp?type=ngo_int&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2002, ELSA organizes the [[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (formerly known as ELSA Moot Court Competition) with the support of the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/emc2_maps_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The final round is held at the WTO headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/disp_06jun17_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
ELSA's activities include the organization of:

*[[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (previously called ELSA Moot Court Competition) on WTO Law.
*Lectures, seminars, and conference (both local and international)
*Study visits
*Institutional visits
*[[Essay]] competitions
*[[Moot court|Moot courts]]
*Participation in international delegations (see [[European Law Students' Association#Delegations|Delegations]])
*[[Trainee|Traineeships]] for students 
*Trainings
*Intensive legal courses (ELSA Law Schools&lt;ref&gt;https://lawschools.elsa.org/about-law-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;)

==ELSA Network==
ELSA has members and observers in [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Iceland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/network/&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, ELSA co-operates with other student organisations across the world, for instance the Asian Law Students' Association (ALSA) in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://alsainternational.org/elsa-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

'''Synergy'''&lt;br&gt;Synergy is a biannual publication that is printed in 10,000 copies and distributed throughout the network.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/synergy-magazine/&lt;/ref&gt; It contains articles written by members, academics and institutions. The magazine was first published as a newsletter back in 1987.

==Patrons==

      <comment>c/e. Power plants &amp; factories with once-through cooling systems don't use cooling towers or intake towers; see the diagram. Fish screens are used in all kinds of intake systems.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8203">[[File:Fish screen-Redlands Canal.jpg|thumb|right|Fish screen at Redlands Canal, near [[Grand Junction, Colorado]]]]
A '''fish screen''' is designed to prevent [[fish]] from swimming or being drawn into an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water intake]], [[intake tower]], [[dam]] or other diversion on a [[river]], [[lake]] or waterway where water is taken for human use. They are intended to supply debris-free water without harming aquatic life. Fish screens are typically installed to protect [[endangered species]] of fishes that would otherwise be harmed or killed when passing through industrial facilities such as [[steam electric power plant]]s, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[electrical generator|generator]]s, [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, farm [[irrigation]] water and municipal [[water purification|drinking water treatment]] plants. However, many fish are killed or injured on screens or elsewhere in the intake structures.

==Design==
Fish screens may be '''positive barriers''' (devices such as a perforated metal plate that physically prevents fish from passing) or '''behavioral barriers''' (devices that encourage fish to swim away). Most behavioral barriers are experimental and of unproven effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD"&gt;{{cite report |date=2004 |title=Technical Development Document for the Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule |chapter=Chapter 4. Efficacy of Cooling Water Intake Structure Technologies |url=https://www.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes/support-documents-phase-ii-cooling-water-intake-rule-2004-withdrawn |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 821-R-04-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 4–19}}

[[File:Cooling water intake &amp; travelling screens.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of typical vertical traveling screens used with industrial cooling water intake structures]]
Positive barriers are often effective at keeping aquatic organisms from entering a cooling system, but may also kill them by impinging them on the screens.&lt;ref name="Schmitz"&gt;{{cite news |title=One Fish, Two Fish, 46 Million Lake Erie Dead Fish |author=Schmitz, Christy |url= |newspaper=Toledo City Paper |publisher=Adams Street Publishing Co. |location=Toledo, OH |date=2009-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These barrier types are widely used and include:
* Modified traveling screens
* Fish handling and return systems
* Horizontal, flat-plate screens with bypass water return systems
* Cylindrical wedgewire screens
* Fine-mesh screens
* Fish net barriers.
Besides simply preventing fish from passing, fish screens are designed to minimize stress and injury that occur when fish impact the screen or are subjected to changes in water velocity and direction caused by the diversion.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD" /&gt;{{rp|pp.4-3ff}}

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has evaluated other barrier technologies and identified some as potentially effective, although not widely demonstrated (as of 2004):
* Aquatic microfiltration barriers
* Angled and modular inclined screens
* Velocity caps.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD" /&gt;{{rp|pp.4–15ff}}

Some fish screens are designed to protect a single species of fish (for example, [[salmon]]) and are not necessarily effective at protecting other fish species. Some screens are capable of protecting more than one species or type of life. Additionally, some screens may effectively protect juvenile and adult fish, but not fish eggs and [[larva]]e.&lt;ref name="EPA 2002"&gt;EPA (2002). "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System—Proposed Regulations to Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Phase II Existing Facilities; Proposed Rule." {{USFR|67|17136}}. 2002-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a fish screen varies from thousands of US dollars for small, low-flow-rate screens to millions of US dollars in the case of very large custom-designed systems that filter a large flow of water. Maintenance costs can be significant, including repairs, removing trash, and adjusting the equipment for changes in stream conditions.

For some low volume, non-industrial water diversion applications, there are screens available that have no moving parts, do not require electricity, and have very little need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Farmers Screen |url=http://farmerscreen.org/farmers-screen/about/intro/|publisher=Farmers Conservation Alliance |location=Hood River, OR |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal requirements==
In the [[United States]], the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], a division of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], mandates positive-barrier fishscreens in most new diversions from waterways where endangered or threatened fish species occur. Some existing unscreened diversions whose construction pre-dates fish-screen mandates are allowed to continue operating by [[grandfather clause|grandfather rule]].

[[Gender]] has been an important theme explored in [[speculative fiction]]. The genres that make up speculative fiction (SF){{Ref label|Note1|a|a}}, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[supernatural fiction]] [[horror fiction|horror]], [[superhero fiction]], [[science fantasy]] and related genres (utopian/dystopian literature), have always offered the opportunity for writers to explore social conventions, including gender, [[gender roles]], and beliefs about gender.  Like all literary forms, the science fiction genre reflects the popular perceptions of the eras in which individual creators were writing; and those creators' responses to gender stereotypes and gender roles.

Many writers have chosen to write with little or no questioning of gender roles, instead effectively reflecting their own cultural gender roles onto their fictional world.  However, many other writers have chosen to use science fiction and non-realistic formats in order to explore cultural conventions, particularly gender roles.  This article discusses works that have explored or expanded the treatment of gender in science fiction.

In addition to the traditional human genders, science fiction has extended the idea of gender to include transgender humans and hypothetical alien species and robots, and imagined trans-real genders, such as with aliens that are truly hermaphroditic or have a "third" gender, or robots that can change gender at will or are without gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferrando | first = Francesca | year = 2015 | chapter = Of Posthuman Born: Gender, Utopia and the Posthuman | editor-last1 = Hauskeller | editor-first1 = M. | editor-last2 = Carbonell | editor-first2 = C. | editor-last3 = Philbeck | editor-first3 = T. | title =  Handbook on Posthumanism in Film and Television | location = London | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | isbn = 978-1-137-43032-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
Science fiction has been described as a useful tool for examining society attitudes to and conceptions of gender;&lt;ref name=DGinSF1&gt;Attebery, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; this is particularly true of literature, more so than for other media.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4/&gt; The conventions of speculative fiction genres encourage writers to explore the subject of biological sex and present alternative models for societies and characters with different beliefs about gender.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4&gt;Attebery, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolation of an initial speculative premise can as easily start from an idea about marriage customs or chromosomes as a technological change.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4/&gt; In spite of this potential, SF has been said to present only ideas about sex and gender that are fashionable or controversial in the present day, which it then projects into a future or fantasy setting.&lt;ref name=spreadmisand108/&gt;

Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre orientated toward a male readership,&lt;ref name=EoSF1088&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', "Sex" p. 1088, 2nd Ed., (1999), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as being by men for men, or sometimes for boys.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', [[Lisa Tuttle]], "Women as portrayed in Science Fiction" p. 1343, 2nd Ed., (1999), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stereotypical tropes of science fiction, such as [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[robots]] or [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] can be employed in such a way as to be metaphors for gender.&lt;ref name=DGinSF5&gt;Attebery, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy has been perceived as more accepting of women compared to science fiction or horror (and offering more roles than historical fiction or romance), yet seldom attempts to question or subvert the bias toward male superiority.&lt;ref name=EoF393&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Gender" p. 393, 1st Ed., (1997), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction's tendency to look to the future and imagine different societies gives it the potential to examine gender roles and preconceptions, whereas the use of archetypes and quasi-historical settings in fantasy has often included patriarchy.&lt;ref name=EoF393/&gt;

===Portrayal of women===
{{See also|Women in speculative fiction}}
[[File:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|''The Princess and the Dragon'', [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470, a classic image of a damsel in distress.]]
The portrayal of women, or female-identified characters in the speculative genres, has varied widely throughout the genres' history. Some writers and artists have challenged their society's gender norms in producing their work; others have not. Among those who have challenged conventional understandings and portrayals of gender and sexuality, there have been of course significant variations. The common perception of the role of female-identified characters in SF works has long been dominated by one of two stereotypes: a woman who is evil ([[villainess]]) or one who is helpless ([[damsel in distress]]). These characters are usually physically attractive and provocatively dressed, often in [[Gender representation in video games#Women in scanty armor|scanty armor]],&lt;ref name="Adweek 4 June 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Griner|first=David|title=Will the Fantasy Genre Ever Grow Up and Ditch the Chainmail Bikini?

Viewers are seeing [[femininity]] in a new light as more female-identified Authors and fans come into the speculative fiction world. There have been female-identified characters in forms of strong woman warriors, or even as a main character who can think for herself.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Melissa McCrory. “Finding Woman&amp;Apos;s Role in The Lord of the Rings.” Mythlore: A Journal of J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and Mythopoeic Literature, vol. 25, no. 3-4, 2007, pp. 43–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these gender rules being broken can be seen in many texts such as “[[The Lord of the Rings]]” by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and even “[[The Man in the High Castle]]” by [[Philip K. Dick]]. As more and more readers and fans of science fiction become female identified, the portrayal of female characters changes just as speculative fiction changes.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William. “Women in Science Fiction.” Sex Roles, vol. 8, no. 10, 1982, pp. 1081–1093.&lt;/ref&gt;


The first critical work focusing on women in SF was  ''Symposium: Women in Science Fiction''  (1975), edited by Jeffrey D. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Symposium: Women in Science Fiction|last= Smith|first= Jeffrey D.|authorlink= |year= 1975|publisher= Fantasmicon Press|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other influential works include ''Future Females:A Critical Anthology'' (1981) edited by [[Marleen S. Barr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Future Females: A Critical Anthology|last= Barr|first= Marleen S.|authorlink= |year= 1981|publisher= Bowling Green Popular Press|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/freedman81.htm |title=Carl Freedman- Science Fiction and the Triumph of Feminism |publisher=Depauw.edu |accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robots and cyborgs and the portrayal of women===
{{Main article|Android (robot)|Gynoid}}
A gynoid is a [[robot]] designed to look like a human female, as compared to an [[android (robot)|android]] modeled after a male (or genderless) human. Gynoids are "irresistibly linked" to men's lust, and are mainly designed as sex-objects, having no use beyond "pleasing men's violent sexual desires".&lt;ref&gt;Melzer, Patricia  ''Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought'', p.204 University of Texas Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-292-71307-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A long tradition exists in fiction of men attempting to create the stereotypical "perfect woman".&lt;ref name="melzer202"&gt;Melzer, Patricia  ''Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought'', p. 202 University of Texas Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-292-71307-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Greek myth]] of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], and the female robot Maria in [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]. Female cyborgs have been similarly used in fiction, in which natural bodies are modified to become objects of fantasy.&lt;ref name="melzer202" /&gt; Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs reinforce "essentialist ideas of feminity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last=Grebowicz|first=Margret|author2=L. Timmel Duchamp|author3=Nicola Griffith|author4=Terry Bisson|publisher=Open Court|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8126-9630-1|page=xviii|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal of men===
Many male protagonists of science fiction are reflections of a single heroic archetype, often having scientific vocations or interests, and being  "cool, rational, competent", "remarkably sexless", interchangeable, and bland.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Annette (1990). ''Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema''. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annkuhn107&gt;Kuhn, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annette Kuhn]] posits that these asexual characters are attempts to gain independence from women and mother figures, and that this and their unfailing mechanical prowess is what gives them fans.&lt;ref name=annkuhn108&gt;Kuhn, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The "super-male" and [[boy genius]] are also common stereotypes  frequently embodied by male characters.&lt;ref name=annkuhn25&gt;Kuhn, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annkuhn28&gt;Kuhn, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that much of science fiction fetishizes masculinity, and that incorporation of technology into science fiction provides a metaphor for imagined futuristic masculinity. Examples are the use of "hypermasculine cyborgs and console-cowboys". Such technologies are desirable as they reaffirm the readers' masculinity and protect against feminisation.&lt;ref name=SSF27p234&gt;The Fetishization of Masculinity in Science Fiction: The Cyborg and the Console Cowboy, Amanda Fernbach, ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2 (Jul., 2000), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; This fetishisation of masculinity via technology in science fiction differs from typical fetishisation in other genres, in which the fetishised object is always feminine.&lt;ref name=SSF27p234/&gt;

The book ''Spreading Misandry'' argues that science fiction is often used to make unfounded political claims about gender, and attempt to blame men for all of society's ills.&lt;ref name=spreadmisand108&gt;{{cite book |title= Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture|last= Nathanson|first= Paul |authorlink= |author2=Katherine K. Young|year= 2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |page=108 |isbn=978-0-7735-2272-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portrayal of transgender humans ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

While the ability to shift gender is common in Speculative and Science fiction, there is very little representation of trans identified human characters that are used as little more than a plot device for the author.  Male authors use the ability to change gender either speculate about medical technology or to act out an ideal of femininity.  Female authors use shifting gender to discuss the condition of being woman identified.  Both create trans-identified characters as caricatures of women, rather than full humans.  This is beginning to shift as more trans and queer identified authors are writing within the Sci-Fi/Speculative Fiction/Fantasy genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cheryl-morgan.com/?page_id=9294|title=Changing Images of Trans People in Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature|date=2010-08-16|work=Cheryl's Mewsings|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=December 2017}}

===Single-gender worlds: utopias and dystopias===
{{Main article|Single-gender worlds}}
{{See also|Utopian and dystopian fiction}}
Single-gender worlds or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical methods that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]]. The resulting society is often shown to be [[utopian]] by feminist writers. Many influential feminist utopias of this sort were written in the 1970s;&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;Gaétan Brulotte &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature', "Science Fiction and Fantasy", p.1189, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =utopfantast101/&gt; the most often studied examples include Joanna Russ's ''The Female Man'', [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[Walk to the End of the World]]'' and ''[[Motherlines]]'', and [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]''.&lt;ref name=utopfantast101&gt;Bartter, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Utopias imagined by male authors have generally included equality between sexes, rather than separation.&lt;ref name=utopfantast102/&gt;  Such worlds have been portrayed most often by lesbian or feminist authors; their use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may not necessarily be lesbian, or sexual at all—a famous early sexless example being ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].&lt;ref name=erotic1189/&gt; Men-only societies are much less common; one example is Athos in ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'' (1986) by [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]. [[Joanna Russ]] suggests men-only societies are not commonly imagined, because men do not feel oppressed, and therefore imagining a world free of women does not imply an increase in freedom and is not as attractive.&lt;ref name=commungender329&gt;Romaine, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopias have been used to explore the ramification of gender being either a societal construct, or a hard-wired imperative.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's studies encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1442 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'', gender is not chosen until maturity, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann-Borgese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex—genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; Charlene Ball writes in ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia'' that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt;

Eric Leif Davin, for instance, documented almost 1,000 stories published in science fiction magazines by over 200 female-identified authors between 1926 and 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Leif Davin, ''Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto SF===
In the early twentieth century, some women writers rebelled against the novels in which valiant men rescued weak women or fought against humourless, authoritarian female regimes.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] wrote ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'', an important early feminist utopia,&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1443&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's studies encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1443 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote ''[[Orlando (novel)|Orlando]]''. Both Perkins and Woolf identified strongly with the [[first wave feminism]] of the period,and its call for equal rights and suffrage for women.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;

===The Pulp Era and the Golden Age (1920–1950s)===
SF portrayals of future societies remained broadly patriarchal, and female characters continued to be gender stereotyped and relegated to standardised roles that supported the male protagonists. Early feminist SF visions of all-women utopias were inverted by pulp writers to tell cautionary tales about the "sex war", in which brave men had to rescue society from joyless and dictatorial women, usually to the satisfaction of both sexes.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' was unusual in its covers not depicting men with ray guns and women with large breasts.&lt;ref name="pontin20081020"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Pontin |first=Mark Williams |date=November-December 2008 |title=The Alien Novelist |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/411039/the-alien-novelist/ |magazine=MIT Technology Review |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Knoles wrote in his 1960 ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' article on the era, "Girls of the Slime God", that&lt;ref name="knoles1960"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Girls for the Slime God |last=Knoles |first=William |publisher=Obscura Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-9659569-0-3 |editor-last=Resnick |editor-first=Mike |location=Ames, IA |language=English |orig-year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A quivering bosom was no novel sight for a thirties s-f hero. Space Girls expressed most of their emotions through their pectoral muscle. Bosoms swayed, trembled, heaved, shivered, danced or pouted according to their owners' moods. In fact, if a hero in those days had been a little more observant and had carried a tape measure, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. When he opened an air lock and a gorgeous stowaway fell out, uniform ripping, it usually took him five or six pages to find out whether she was a Venusian spy or not, whereas the reader knew at once. If her torn uniform revealed pouting young breasts, she was OK—probably someone's kid sister. If she had eager, straining breasts, she was the heroine. But a girl with proud, arrogant breasts was definitely a spy—while a ripe, full bosom meant she was a Pirate Queen and all hell would soon break loose.}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] disagreed, stating in 1969 that "until 1960 there was no branch of literature anywhere (except perhaps for the children's stories in Sunday school bulletins) as puritanical as science fiction", and that Knoles had to get his quotes from one "[[Marvel Science Stories|1938-39 magazine]]" which, Asimov said, published "spicy" stories for its "few readers" before "a deserved death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/306/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Floyd C.

In the 1940s, post-WWII, female writers like Judith Merril and Leigh Brackett emerged, reclaiming female characters and carving out respect in their own right.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[C. L. Moore]] is an example of a woman successfully writing pulp speculative fiction tales under a genderless pen-name. Her story "No Woman Born" (1944),{{Ref label|Note1|b|b}} in which a female character's mind is transferred into a powerful robot body with feminine attributes is an early example of a work that challenged gender stereotypes of its day by combining femininity with power. Brian Attebery suggest that if the robot had appeared male, the gender would have been unremarkable or even invisible to readers, as masculine figures could be expected to be powerful.&lt;ref name=DGinSF5/&gt;

During the pulp era, unfavorable presentations of matriarchal societies, even [[dystopia]]s were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Decoding Gender in Science Fiction|last=  Attebery|first= Brian|authorlink= Brian Attebery|page=13 |year= 2002|publisher= Routledge|location= |isbn=978-0-415-93950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[John Wyndham]]'s ''[[Consider Her Ways]]'' (1956), for example, male rule is described as repressive to women, but freedom from patriarchy was achieved through an authoritarian female-only society modelled on [[ant]]s society.&lt;ref name=battle72&gt;Larbalestier,  "Mama Come Home; Parodies of the Sex-War" p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930s saw the beginnings of fantasy as a distinct publishing genre. Reacting against the hard, scientific, dehumanizing trends of contemporary science fiction, this new branch of SF drew on mythological and historical traditions and Romantic literature, including [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythologies, [[Norse sagas]], the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and Adventure stories such as [[Alexandre Dumas]]’ ''[[Three Musketeers]]''.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;  The conventions brought with them a tendency toward patriarchy and cast women in restrictive roles defined as early as in the plays of Euripides.  These roles included that of the "helper-maiden" or of "reproductive demon".&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;

The 1930s also saw the advent of the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre of pulp tales, which brought overt sexualisation to the representation of women in fantasy. Although physically more capable, female characters frequently continued to act as helpers to the male leads, but were now depicted as extremely attractive and very briefly clothed.  The first female lead character of a sword and sorcery story was [[Jirel of Joiry]], created by C. L. Moore and first appearing in "Black God's Kiss" (''[[Weird Tales]]'', volume 24, number 4, October 1934).

===New Wave (1960-1970s)===
Whereas the 1940s and 50s have been called the Golden Age of science fiction in general, the 1960s and 1970s are regarded as the most important and influential periods in the study of gender in speculative fiction.&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;

This creative period saw the appearance of many influential novels by female authors, including [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), described as the book with which SF "lost its innocence on matters of sex and gender", and ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Joanna Russ]]'s most important works, particularly ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975), regarded by many as the central work of women's SF;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; and ''[[The Two of Them]]'' (1978); [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s prescient cyborg novel, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;  [[Vonda McIntyre]]'s two most influential novels, ''[[The Exile Waiting]]'' (1975) and ''[[Dreamsnake]]'' (1978);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Marge Piercy]]’s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' (1976), the most important contribution to feminist sf by an author known mainly for realistic work;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; and several novels by [[Octavia Butler]], especially ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'' (1980), which have been described as groundbreaking, and established an African-American female voice in SF.

Important short stories included many by [[James Tiptree Jr.]] (a male pseudonym used by Alice Sheldon),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Alien plots: female subjectivity and the divine in the light of James Tiptree's "A momentary taste of being"|last= Van der Spek|first= Inez |authorlink= |year= 2000|publisher=Liverpool University Press |pages=7–8 |isbn=978-0-85323-814-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance ''[[The Women Men Don't See]]'' (1973), ''[[The Girl Who Was Plugged In]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Screwfly Solution]]'' (1977).{{Ref label|Note1|c|c}}&lt;ref name=triumffeminism3&gt;Freedman&lt;/ref&gt;

These works coincided with the beginnings of application of feminist theory to SF,.&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;  creating a self-consciously [[feminist science fiction]]. Feminist SF has been distinguished from earlier feminist utopian fiction by its greater attention to characterisation and inclusion of gender equality.&lt;ref name=utopfantast102&gt;Bartter, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Male writers also began to approach depiction of gender in new ways, with [[Samuel R. Delany]] establishing himself as the most radical voice among male SF figures for representations of alternative sexualities and gender-models in a series of major works, most importantly (with respect to gender), in ''[[Triton (novel)|Triton]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Gary Westfahl]] points out that "Heinlein is a problematic case for feminists; on the one hand, his works often feature strong female characters and vigorous statements that women are equal to or even superior to men; but these characters and statements often reflect hopelessly stereotypical attitudes about typical female attributes. It is disconcerting, for example, that in ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'' Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate." &lt;ref&gt;Gary Westfahl, 'Superladies in Waiting: How the Female Hero Almost Emerges in Science Fiction', ''Foundation'', vol. 58, 1993, pp. 42-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern SF (1980–2000s)===
By the 1980s the intersection of feminism and SF was already a major factor in the production of the literature itself.&lt;ref name=triumffeminism3/&gt;

Authors such as [[Nicola Griffith]] and [[Sheri S. Tepper]] frequently write on gender-related themes. Tepper's work has been described as "the definition of feminist science fiction", and her treatment of gender has varied from early optimistic science fantasies, in which women were equally as capable as men, to more pessimistic works, including ''[[The Gate to Women's Country]]'', in which men are the cause of war and pollution and true equality can only be achieved by transcending humanity altogether.&lt;ref name=utopfantast103--104&gt;Bartter, pp.103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke Award|Arthur C. Clarke award]] winning [[Ancillary Justice]] by [[Ann Leckie]] (2013) portrays a society where gender is an unimportant detail in people's lives. It refers to most characters as female, unless they're talking in a different language than the dominant one. This leaves the gender of most characters unclear. The reader, used to books that consistently use male pronouns, is constantly slightly on edge, because of the consistent use of 'she', 'her' etc.

The September 2017 anthology, [http://topsidepress.com/ Meanwhile, Elsewhere], is a collection of short stories written by trans-identified authors about trans-identified characters.  While these authors are well known to Queer audiences, they are new to Speculative, Sci-Fi and Fantasy readers. The anthology covers multiple genres, from [[Ryka Aoki]]'s "The Gift", in which the main character identifies as trans and everything is fine, to [[Jeanne Thornton]]'s "Angels Are Here To Help Us", which explores access to technology, money and privilege in relation to trans identity.  The book was edited by Cat Fitzpatrick and [[Casey Plett]] and was published by Topside Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topsidepress.com/|title=The Post-Reality Expeditionist's Supply Store|website=The Post-Reality Expeditionist's Supply Store|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/meanwhile-elsewhere-book-review|title=“Meanwhile, Elsewhere” Envisions a New World for Trans Readers|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics==

{{See also|Portrayal of women in American comics{{!}}Women in comics}}
There was a time when more girls read comics than boys,{{When|date=January 2014}} but these comics were generally [[realism (arts)|realist]], with a focus on romance and crime stories.&lt;ref name=Robbins7&gt;[[Trina Robbins|Robbins, Trina]]. ''From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines'' (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1999), p. 7; {{ISBN|0-7567-8120-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for most of their existence, comic books audiences have been assumed to be mostly male. The female characters and superheroes were targeted towards this male demographic, rather than towards women readers.&lt;ref name=CBnation250&gt;Wright, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Although many female superheroes were created, very few starred in their own series or achieved stand-alone success. It has been debated whether the lack of female readership was due to male writers being uncomfortable with writing about or for women, or whether the comic book industry is male dominated due to the lack of intinsic interest of women in comics.&lt;ref name=CBnation250&gt;Wright, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known female superhero is writer-artist [[Fletcher Hanks]]'s minor character [[Fantomah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Fantomah]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66moryli6?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm |date=2012-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an ageless, [[ancient Egypt]]ian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in 1940 in [[Fiction House]]s ''Jungle Comics''.

In the early 1940s the DC line was dominated by superpowered male characters such as the [[Green Lantern]], [[Batman]], and its flagship character, [[Superman]]. The first widely recognizable female superhero is [[Wonder Woman]], created by [[William Moulton Marston]] for [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would merge to form [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref name="Who Was Wonder Woman"&gt;'[http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ Who Was Wonder Woman?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104060542/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ |date=January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marston intended the character to be a strong female role-model for girls,  with "all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman."&lt;ref&gt;Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History,'' (DC Comics, 2000), pp.  28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==

===Film===
[[File:PlanNine 07.jpg|thumb|[[Maila Nurmi]] as Vampira in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'']]
Female characters in early science fiction films such as [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]] (1968) were often portrayed as simple sex kittens.&lt;ref name=toughgirls102&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 102|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sherrie Inness has said that the portrayals of tough women in later science fiction embody women's fantasies of empowerment,&lt;ref name=toughgirls23&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 23|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the characters of Sharrow in the [[Iain M. Banks]]' novel ''[[Against a Dark Background]]'' (1993) or Alex in the film ''[[Nemesis 2: Nebula|Nemesis 2]]'', who both physically overpower male attackers.&lt;ref name=toughgirls23/&gt;&lt;ref name=toughgirls25&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 25|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Early television depicted women primarily as idealized "perfect housewives" or (often [[black (race)|black]]) domestic workers.&lt;ref name=fantgirls1&gt;Helford, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s and 1970s, cultural mores had relaxed, and sexual objectification of women became more commonplace. This period also saw diversification in women's roles, with blurring between the roles of middle-class housewife and working mother and the representations of women of different age, race, class, sexual orientation. The appearance of strong female characters, such as in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', remained limited by associations of power with male approval.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2&gt;Helford, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 70s also saw the beginnings of SF and fantasy elements being incorporated into television programming.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt;

Popular early SF programming in the 1960s reconciled the use of SF tropes that empowered women with stereotypes of women's social domains and femininity. This was seen in popular series such as ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]'', both of which have female protagonists with magical abilities.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt;  ''Bewitched'''s Samantha is a witch who chooses to use her abilities as a home-maker, and her husband prefers that she limits such displays of power as much as possible, particularly when they could challenge his ego. Most of her uses of magic were to save her husband appearing foolish in front of his peers or undoing interference from her more empowered and feminist mother, Endora.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt; In contrast, the titular character of ''I Dream of Jeannie'' was inept in her house-wifely duties and was more likely to use her magic when she felt it appropriate. However, this was always in the service of her "Master", who demanded her nature as a [[genie]] be kept secret. Jeannie's subservience and skimpy clothing also identified her primarily as a sex object.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3&gt;Helford, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Both programs showed women gaining more power and prominence through the metaphor of magic, but that this power was limited by women's willingness to obey male authority.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

The 1960s also saw the first speculative presentations of women outside the realm of domestic life.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt; ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Nyota Uhura|Lt. Uhura]] is a famous early example of a woman space explorer, and her race made her a role-model for black women in particular. Her inclusion in the series is credited with bringing more women into science fiction fandom. The character [[Uhura#Role_model|was seen]] as a success of the feminist and [[civil rights movement]]s of the era, representing the ideal of racial equality and women's ability to find meaningful employment outside of marriage and family. However, her role never rose beyond that of futuristic [[receptionist]], and her uniform and prominent but generally silent placement in the background of scenes made her the series primary eye candy.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

SF series of the 1970s followed in a similar vein, with speculative elements used to physically empower women, while society required that they pretend to be typical and non-threatening. Examples include ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' and the television adaption of ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">A '''glass code''' is a method of classifying [[glass]]es for [[optics|optical]] use, such as the manufacture of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[prism (optics)|prisms]]. There are many different types of glass with different compositions and optical properties, and a glass code is used to distinguish between them.

There are several different glass classification schemes in use, most based on the catalogue systems used by glass manufacturers such as [[Pilkington]] and [[Schott Glass]]. These tend to be based on the material composition, for example ''BK7'' is the Schott Glass classification of a common [[borosilicate glass|borosilicate]] [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]].

The '''international glass code''' is based on [[U.S. military standard]] MIL-G-174, and is a six-digit number specifying the glass according to its [[refractive index]] ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; at the [[Fraunhofer line|Fraunhofer]] d- (or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-) line, and its [[Abbe number]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; also taken at that line.

The resulting glass code is the value of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-1 rounded to three digits, followed by ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; rounded to three digits, with all decimal points ignored. For example, BK7 has ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5168 and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 64.17, giving a six-digit glass code of 517642.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newportglass.com/GeneCd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows some example glasses and their glass code. Note that the glass properties can vary slightly between different manufacturer types.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oharacorp.com/pdf/cross-ref-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grooveshark University''' was a free, [[semester]]-long [[Education|program]] offered by [[software engineer]]s at [[Grooveshark.com]] to intermediate [[Computer programmer|programmer]]s at the [[college]] level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grooveshark offered the initiative to help programmers gain the experience needed to develop their own technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment was by application only, and was not limited to college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grooveshark University was developed to help ease new [[intern]]s into Grooveshark's work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, the program grew into a hub for idea creation, technical learning, and [[prototype]] development, as Grooveshark saw "potential for other ideas developed in Gainesville to grow into full-fledged businesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooveshark University was part of an ongoing process to promote innovation in the [[Gainesville, Florida]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's mission was to provide an environment where interested developers, young and old, can hone their skills or work with other developers to create new projects and pursue great ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesvillechamber.com/Tech_Entrepreneurs_Give_Back.aspx|url=http://www.gainesvillechamber.com/Tech_Entrepreneurs_Give_Back.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes==
The GSU lectures focused on a variety of different technical topics, including: [[Mobile application development|mobile]] and [[web development]], web standards, and specific [[programming languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weekly sessions were held in the evening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://grooveshark.com/university|url=http://grooveshark.com/university|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   at Santa Fe College's downtown Center for Innovation and Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13247">'''Harold D. Roth''' is a professor of [[religious studies]] and the Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative at Brown University. Roth is a specialist in Methods of [[Textual Criticism]] and Textual History, Classical Chinese Religious Thought, [[Daoism|Classical Daoism]], the Comparative Study of Mysticism and one of the pioneers of the new interdisciplinary academic field of Contemplative Studies.

==Biography==
During an academic career spanning over three decades, Roth has done ground- breaking work in three major intellectual fields. In the first, textual criticism, following the lead of the late SOAS professor Paul Thompson, Roth did the first complete textual history of a major Classical Chinese philosophical work, which he published in his first book, ''The Textual History of the Huai-nan Tzu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=The Textual History of the Huainanzi|date=1992|publisher=Association for Asian Studies Monograph No. 46|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working towards the goal of establishing modern critical editions of all the major extant works of the classical period, Roth developed a distinctive method he called "Filiation Analysis", a technique for determining the broadest range of possibly authentic textual variants using the bare minimum number of editions. This is detailed in his very first publication,  "Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu|journal=Transactions of the Conference  of Orientalists in Japan|date=1982|volume=27|issue=December|pages=60–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further developed as a model for all classical Chinese philosophical texts in a later publication, "Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 1993|volume=113|issue=2|pages=18–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major area in which Roth has done pioneering work is in reconstructing the lost history and contemplative dimensions of the late Warring States and early Han dynasty tradition that he dubbed "inner cultivation". It is this tradition that was given the moniker "Daoism" by the Grand Historian [[Sima Tan]] circa 110 BCE.  Beginning with three publications in the early to mid 1990s, "Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|date=December 1991|volume=51|issue=2|pages=599–650|doi=10.2307/2719289}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?|editor1-last=Rosemont, Jr.|editor1-first=Henry|title=Chinese Texts and Philosophical Contexts: Essays Dedicated to Angus C. Graham|date=1991|publisher=Open Court Press|location=London|pages=79–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Daoism|journal=Early China|date=1994|volume=19|pages=1–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth began a detailed textual analysis of classical Chinese texts on inner cultivation demonstrating that they contained a distinctive set of technical terms that could be organized under three philosophical categories: cosmology, psychology/inner cultivation, and political thought. Expanding the work of [[A.C. Graham]], he further determined that these extant sources of inner cultivation could be organized into three distinctive philosophical groupings, "Individualist", Primitivist, and Syncretist and argued these could be considered different phases in the development of this classical Daoist tradition. Roth systematized these arguments in providing the intellectual context for his translation of a short and distinctive text entitled ''[[Neiye]]'' ("Inward Training"), one of 76 works in the Guanzi 管子 compendium, published in his second book, ''Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism|date=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to them in a recent article detailed the contributions to the development of the foundational philosophical idea of li 理 (Pattern, Principle) made by this classical Daoist tradition in "The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Chinese Cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Daoist Cosmology|journal=Early China|date=2012–2013|volume=35-36|issue=Studies in Honor of Li Xueqin|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing these theories about the inner cultivation tradition Roth broke new ground in systematically applying the methods of the philosophical analysis of different traditions of mystical experience to the classical Chinese religious traditions. In addition to being summarized in Original Tao, his work in this area is detailed in a number of important other publications: "Evidence for Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Evidence for the Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|date=June 1997|volume=60|issue=2|pages=295–314|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00036405}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Praxis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Practice|editor1-last=Csikszentmihalyi|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Ivanhoe|editor2-first=P.J.|title=Essays on Religious and Philosophical Aspects of the Lao Tzu|date=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=59–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  "Bimodal Mystical Experience in the 'Qiwulun' of Zhuangzi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Bimodal Experience in the 'Qiwulun' of Zhuangzi|journal=Journal of Chinese Religions|date=2000|volume=28|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting when he entered the Ph.D. program at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1975, Roth began a fascination with the early [[Han dynasty]]  (139 BCE) philosophical compendium, the [[Huainanzi]]  淮南子, until recently the last great untranslated work of classical Chinese philosophy. Intended as a comprehensive multi-authored text detailing all the fields of knowledge with which the Chinese emperor needed to be conversant, the Huainanzi contains chapters on cosmology and cosmogony, astronomy, geography, rulership, and warfare, to name a few of its major topics. Roth has argued that while the Huainanzi is inclusive of a very wide range philosophical ideas from many traditions, that its overarching intellectual context is provided by the inner cultivation tradition of classical Daoism. After working on the textual history of this major work in his first book, in the mid 1990s Roth developed a project for the first complete English translation with colleague John Major and, eventually, a small cohort of additional scholars that included, most importantly, Sarah Queen and Andrew Meyer. Together they succeeded in finally publishing a complete translation, The Huainanzi:  A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Major|first1=John, et. al.|title=The Huainanzi: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an abridged translation, The Essential Huainanzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Major|first1=John, et. al.|title=The Essential Huainanzi|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his work on these translations and to his first book, Roth has published his ideas on the philosophy of the Huainanzi  in a number of publications, including "The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu|journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy|date=April 1985|volume=12|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6253.1985.tb00425.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roth, Harold D.|authorlink1=Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way'|editor1-last=Chandler|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Littlejohn|editor2-first=Ronnie|title=Polishing the Chinese Mirror: Essays in Honor of Henry Rosemont|date=2007|publisher=Global Scholarly Publications|location=New York|pages=270–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Daoist Inner Cultivation Thought and the Textual Structure of the Huainanzi",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Daoist Inner Cultivation Thought and the Textual Structure of the Huainanzi|editor1-last=Queen|editor1-first=Sarah|editor2-last=Puett|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Huainanzi and Textual Production in Early China|date=2014|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|pages=40–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Huainanzi 淮 南 子and Early Han Daoism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Daoism in the Guanzi|editor1-last=Liu|editor1-first=Xiaogan|title=Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy|date=2014|publisher=Springer Press|location=New York|pages=265–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth has not only been a leader in developing the new academic field of "Contemplative Studies", he is also the person who first coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaleem|first1=Jaweed|title=Contemplative Studies Grow at Brown University- And Beyond|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/contemplative-studies-brown_n_6124030.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the disciplines of the relevant Brain Sciences, Humanities, and Creative Arts around the systematic third and first-person study of contemplative experiences, across cultures and across time, this new field presents bold new pedagogies and research techniques that return the unbiased perspective of the experiencing subject to both classroom and laboratory. Inspired by the work of scientists such as Francisco Varela, James Austin, and Richard Davidson, philosophers such as William James and Evan Thompson, and educators such as John Dewey and Parker Palmer, Brown Contemplative Studies has served as a model for research institutes and academic programs at many institutions of higher education throughout North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Emma|title=Contemplating a New Major? Try Contemplative Studies|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/06/03/contemplating-a-new-major-try-contemplative-studies/|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth has helped pioneer the field through such publications as "Contemplative Studies: Prospects for a New Field", Columbia Teacher's College Record (2006); "Against Cognitive Imperialism", Religion East and West (2008); "Contemplative Studies:  Can It Flourish in the Religious Studies Classroom?" Meditation and  the Classroom: Contemplative Pedagogy for Religious Studies (2011);  and "A Pedagogy for the New Field of Contemplative Studies", Contemplative Approaches to Learning and Inquiry across Disciplines (2014). In 2014 Brown University became the first major North American Research University to establish a formal undergraduate concentration (major) in Contemplative Studies. This pioneering multi-disciplinary concentration requires 14 courses including a core set of 5 required courses in relevant Brain Sciences and Humanities. Students then choose a Sciences track that features Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience or a Humanities Track that features Philosophy of Mind and Contemplative Religious Traditions. Art concentrations within the Humanities Track are also possible.

Additionally, Roth has served these academic fields in a variety of ways. He served on the Board of Directors of the Society for the Study of Chinese Religions for a decade starting in 1993, during which time he has also served on the editorial boards of four international journals of Daoism and Early Chinese Studies. In addition to this he was the founder and Co-Organizer of the New England Symposium on Chinese Thought (1988–93), the organizer of four academic panels at the Association for Asian Studies and American Oriental Society, and the Co-Organizer of the Second American-Japanese Conference on Taoist Studies (1998).  He has been a member of the initial Steering Committees for two groups within the American Academy of Religion, the Daoist Studies Section and the Contemplative Studies Group. He has been on the planning committees for the Mind and Life Institute Summer Research Institutes and the first and second International Symposia on Contemplative Studies (2012 and 2014).

Finally, a long time student of the Rinzai Zen Master Kyozan Joshu Sasaki (1907-2014), Roth was recently named to Chair the Publications Committee for Sasaki's teaching materials.

All tea leaves contain [[fluoride]]; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.&lt;ref name="pmid17410113"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lung SC, Cheng HW, Fu CB |title=Potential exposure and risk of fluoride intakes from tea drinks produced in Taiwan |journal=J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=158–66 |year=2008 |pmid=17410113 |doi=10.1038/sj.jes.7500574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18078704"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malinowska E, Inkielewicz I, Czarnowski W, Szefer P |title=Assessment of fluoride concentration and daily intake by human from tea and herbal infusions |journal=Food Chem.

The fluoride content of a tea leaf depends on the leaf picking method used and the fluoride content of the soil from which it has been grown; tea plants absorb this element at a greater rate than other plants. Care in the choice of the location where the plant is grown may reduce the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Accumulation of Fluoride and Aluminium Related to Different Varieties of Tea Plant |author1=Jianyun Ruan |author2=Ming H.

A 2013 British study of 38 teas found that cheaper UK supermarket tea blends had the highest levels of fluoride with about 580&amp;nbsp;mg per kilogram, green teas averaged about 397&amp;nbsp;mg per kg and pure blends about 132&amp;nbsp;mg per kg. The researchers suggested that economy teas may use older leaves which contain more fluoride. They calculated a person drinking a litre of economy tea per day would consume about 6&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride, above the recommended average dietary intake level of 3-4&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride per day, but below the maximum tolerable amount of 10&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride per day.&lt;ref&gt;(25 July 2013) [http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/07July/Pages/do-fluoride-levels-in-cheap-tea-pose-a-health-risk.aspx Do fluoride levels in cheap tea pose a health risk?] British National Health Service "Choices, Retrieved 26 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxalates ===
Tea contains [[oxalate]], overconsumption of which can cause [[kidney]] stones, as well as binding with free [[calcium]] in the body. The [[bioavailability]] of oxalate from tea is low, thus a possible negative effect requires a large intake of tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Theanine and caffeine ===
{{see also|Health effects of caffeine}}
Tea also contains [[theanine]] and the stimulant [[caffeine]] at about 3% of its dry weight, translating to between 30&amp;nbsp;mg and 90&amp;nbsp;mg per 8 oz (250 ml) cup depending on type, brand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bennett Alan Weinberg |author2=Bonnie K. Bealer |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&amp;dq= |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92722-2 |accessdate=2008-09-20 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brewing method.&lt;ref&gt;M. B. Hicks, Y-H. P. Hsieh, L. N. Bell, ''Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration'', Food Research International 29(3-4) 325-330 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Tea also contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham H. N.; Green tea composition, consumption, and polyphenol chemistry; ''Preventive Medicine'' '''21'''(3):334-50 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Dry tea has more caffeine by weight than dry [[coffee]]; nevertheless, more dry coffee than dry tea is used in typical drink preparations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stashtea.com/caffeine+and+tea+information.aspx |title=Caffeine and Tea Information |publisher=Stash Tea |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which results in a cup of brewed tea containing significantly less caffeine than a cup of [[health effects of coffee|coffee]] of the same size.

The caffeine in tea is a mild [[diuretic]]. However, the [[British Dietetic Association]] has suggested that tea can be used to supplement normal [[water]] consumption, and that "the style of tea and coffee and the amounts we drink in the UK are unlikely to have a negative effect [on hydration]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bda.uk.com/news/110610DehydrationWeek.pdf  BDA Supports Dehydration Awareness Week with some Handy Tips (PDF)].

== By conditions ==

===Cognitive effects===
Drinking caffeinated tea may improve mental alertness.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; There is preliminary evidence that the [[caffeine]] from long-term tea (or coffee) consumption provides a small amount of protection against the progression of [[dementia]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]] during aging, although the results across numerous studies were inconsistent.&lt;ref name="PanzaSolfrizzi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panza|first1=Francesco|last2=Solfrizzi|first2=V.|last3=Barulli|first3=M.

=== Cancer ===
In 2011, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) reported that there was very little evidence to support the claim that green tea consumption may reduce the risk of breast and prostate cancer.&lt;ref name="FDA2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Qualified Health Claims Subject to Enforcement Discretion|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073992.htm#gtea|author=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=24 February 2011|accessdate= 9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[National Cancer Institute]] reports that in [[Epidemiology#Types of studies|epidemiological studies]] and the few [[clinical trial]]s of tea for the prevention of cancer, the results have been inconclusive.  The institute "does not recommend for or against the use of tea to reduce the risk of any type of cancer." ... "Inconsistencies in study findings regarding tea and cancer risk may be due to variability in tea preparation, tea consumption, the bioavailability of tea compounds (the amounts that can be absorbed by the body), lifestyle differences, and individual genetic differences."&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;{{cite web|title=Tea and Cancer Prevention: Strengths and Limits of the Evidence|author=National Cancer Institute|url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/tea|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is some positive evidence for risk reduction of breast, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancers with green tea, it is weak and inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson R, Bryant S, Huntley AL |title=Green tea and green tea catechin extracts: an overview of the clinical evidence |journal=Maturitas |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=280–7 | date=December 2012 |pmid=22986087 |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.08.008 |type=Review |quote=Green tea consumption does help reduce body weight and aid weight management as shown in short term RCTs (12 weeks) but not to a clinically relevant level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analyses of observational studies have concluded that black tea consumption does not appear to protect against the development of [[oral cancer]]s in Asian or Caucasian populations, the development of [[esophageal cancer]] or [[prostate cancer]] in Asian populations, or the development of [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="OralCancer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang W, Yang Y, Zhang W, Wu W |title=Association of tea consumption and the risk of oral cancer: a meta-analysis|journal=Oral Oncol|volume=50|issue=4|pages=276–81|date=April 2014|pmid=24389399|doi=10.1016/j.oraloncology.2013.12.014|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LungCancer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang Y, Yu X, Wu Y, Zhang D |title=Coffee and tea consumption and risk of lung cancer: a dose-response analysis of observational studies|journal=Lung Cancer|volume=78|issue=2|pages=169–70|date=November 2012|pmid=22964413|doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2012.08.009|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProstateCancer2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zheng J, Yang B, Huang T, Yu Y, Yang J, Li D |title=Green tea and black tea consumption and prostate cancer risk: an exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Nutr Cancer|volume=63|issue=5|pages=663–72|date=June 2011|pmid=21667398|doi=10.1080/01635581.2011.570895|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProstateCancer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lin YW, Hu ZH, Wang X, Mao QQ, Qin J, Zheng XY, Xie LP |title=Tea consumption and prostate cancer: an updated meta-analysis|journal=World J Surg Oncol|volume=12|issue=|pages=38|date=February 2014|pmid=24528523|pmc=3925323|doi=10.1186/1477-7819-12-38|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EsophagealCancer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zheng JS, Yang J, Fu YQ, Huang T, Huang YJ, Li D |title=Effects of green tea, black tea, and coffee consumption on the risk of esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Nutr Cancer|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–16|date=January 2013|pmid=23368908|doi=10.1080/01635581.2013.741762|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular disease===
In [[Prospective cohort study|preliminary long-term clinical studies]], black tea consumption showed evidence for providing a small, reduced risk of stroke,&lt;ref name="Stroke2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shen L, Song LG, Ma H, Jin CN, Wang JA, Xiang MX |title=Tea consumption and risk of stroke: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies|journal=J Zhejiang Univ Sci B|volume=13|issue=8|pages=652–62|date=August 2012|pmid=22843186|pmc=3411099|doi=10.1631/jzus.B1201001|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stroke2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larsson SC|title=Coffee, tea, and cocoa and risk of stroke|journal=Stroke|volume=45|issue=1|pages=309–14|date=January 2014|pmid=24326448|doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.003131|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, in another review, green tea and black tea did not have significant effects on the risk of [[coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Ze-Mu|last2=Zhou|first2=Bo|last3=Wang|first3=Yong-Sheng|last4=Gong|first4=Qing-Yue|last5=Wang|first5=Qi-Ming|last6=Yan|first6=Jian-Jun|last7=Gao|first7=Wei|last8=Wang|first8=Lian-Sheng|date=2011-03-01|title=Black and green tea consumption and the risk of coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=93|issue=3|pages=506–515|doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.005363|issn=1938-3207|pmid=21248184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two reviews of [[randomized controlled trial]]s concluded that long-term consumption of black tea slightly lowers [[Blood pressure|systolic and diastolic blood pressures]] (about 1–2 mmHg), a finding based on limited evidence.&lt;ref name="Hartley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hartley L, Flowers N, Holmes J, Clarke A, Stranges S, Hooper L, Rees K |title=Green and black tea for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=6|issue=6|pages=CD009934|date=June 2013|pmid=23780706|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu G, Mi XN, Zheng XX, Xu YL, Lu J, Huang XH |title=Effects of tea intake on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials|journal=Br J Nutr|volume=112|issue=7|pages=1043–54|date=October 2014|pmid=25137341|doi=10.1017/S0007114514001731|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 Cochrane review found some evidence of benefit from tea consumption on cardiovascular disease, though more research is needed. &lt;ref name="Hartley2013"/&gt;

===Fracture risk===
Tea consumption does not appear to affect the risk of [[bone fracture]] including [[hip fracture]]s or fractures of the [[humerus]] in men or women.&lt;ref name="Chen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen B, Shi HF, Wu SC |title=Tea consumption didn't modify the risk of fracture: a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Diagn Pathol|volume=9|issue=|pages=44|date=March 2014|pmid=24588938|pmc=4017777|doi=10.1186/1746-1596-9-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight loss ===
Although green tea is commonly believed to be a weight loss aid, there is no good evidence that its long-term consumption has any meaningful benefit in helping overweight or obese people to lose weight, or that it helps to maintain a healthy body weight.&lt;ref name=coch-gt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jurgens TM, Whelan AM, Killian L, Doucette S, Kirk S, Foy E |title=Green tea for weight loss and weight maintenance in overweight or obese adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |issue= |pages=CD008650 |year=2012 |pmid=23235664 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008650.pub2 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of green tea for attempted weight loss carries a small risk of [[adverse effect]]s, such as [[nausea]], [[constipation]], and [[stomach]] discomfort.&lt;ref name=coch-gt/&gt;

A '''High Assurance Guard''' (HAG) is a [[Multilevel security]] computer device which is used to communicate between different [[Security Domains]], such as [[NIPRNet]] to [[SIPRNet]]. A HAG is one example of a [[Controlled Interface]] between security levels. HAGs are approved through the [[Common Criteria]] process.

==Operation==
A HAG runs multiple [[virtual machines]] or physical machines - one or more subsystems for the lower classification, one (or more) subsystems for the higher classification. The hardware runs a type of [[Knowledge Management]] software that examines data coming out of the higher classification subsystem and rejects any data that is classified higher than the lower classification. In general, a HAG allows lower classified data that resides on a higher classified system to be moved to another lower classified system. For example, in the US, it would allow unclassified information residing on a Secret classified system to be moved to another Unclassified system. Through various rules and filters, the HAG ensures that data is of the lower classification and then allows the transfer.

On the application layer, the HAG runs an "evaluated mandatory integrity policy" that provides sensitive files, data and applications protection from inadvertent disclosure.  At the operating system level, the HAG must have a multi-level kernel that ensures sensitive information, processes, and devices stored and running on the system at different sensitivity levels cannot intermingle in violation of the system's mandatory security model.

The systems are certified via the Common Criteria; depending on the classification, the system may require Common Criteria Evaluated Assurance Level (EAL) 3 or higher.  For examples, in the US, an evaluation at the EAL 5 or EAL 5+ (EAL 5 Augmented) or higher is required to export from a Secret domain to an Unclassified domain.

Some manufacturers may use "Trusted Computer System" or "Trusted Applications with High Assurance" as an equivalent term to HAG.

==Importance, risks==
The HAG is mostly used in email and [[Defense Message System|DMS]] environments as certain organizations may only have unclassified network access, and they need to send a message to an organization that has only secret network access. The HAG provides them this ability.

[[Image:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|right|thumb|230px|[[Herodotus]] ({{c.}} 484–{{c.}} 425 BC) was a Greek historian who lived in the 5th century BC and one of the earliest historians whose work survives.]]

A '''historian''' is a person who studies and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name="wordnetprinceton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding [[recorded history|written history]], the individual is a historian of [[prehistory]].  Some historians are recognized by publications or training and experience.&lt;ref name="HermanAM"&gt;Herman, A. M. (1998). Occupational outlook handbook: 1998-99 edition. Indianapolis: JIST Works. Page 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Historian" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.

==Objectivity==
During the ''[[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt]]'' trial, it became evident that the court needed to identify what was an "objective historian" in the same vein as the [[reasonable person]], and reminiscent of the standard traditionally used in English law of "[[the man on the Clapham omnibus]]".{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1531}} This was necessary so that there would be a legal bench mark to compare and contrast the scholarship of an objective historian against the illegitimate methods employed by [[David Irving]], as before the ''Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt'' trial, there was no legal precedent for what constituted an objective historian.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1531}}

[[Charles Gray (English judge)|Justice Gray]] leant heavily on the research of one of the expert witnesses, [[Richard J. Evans]], who compared [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Revisionist techniques|illegitimate distortion of the historical record]] practice by [[holocaust denier]]s with established historical methodologies.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1534}}

By summarizing Gray's judgement, in an article published in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Wendie E. Schneider distils these seven points for what he meant by an objective historian:{{sfn|Schneider|2001|pp=1534, 1535}}
{{quote|
#The historian must treat sources with appropriate reservations;
#The historian must not dismiss counter evidence without scholarly consideration;
#The historian must be even-handed in treatment of evidence and eschew "cherry-picking";
#The historian must clearly indicate any speculation;
#The historian must not mistranslate documents or mislead by omitting parts of documents;
#The historian must weigh the authenticity of all accounts, not merely those that contradict his or her favored view; and
#The historian must take the motives of historical actors into consideration.
}}

Schneider uses the concept of the "objective historian" to suggest that this could be an aid in assessing what makes an historian suitable as an expert witnesses under the [[Daubert standard]] in the United States. Schneider proposed this, because, in her opinion, Irving could have passed the standard Daubert tests unless a court was given "a great deal of assistance from historians".{{sfn|Schneider|2001|pp=1534, 1538}}

Schneider proposes that by testing an historian against the criteria of the "objective historian" then, even if an historian holds specific political views (and she gives an example of a well-qualified historian's testimony that was disregarded by a United States court because he was a member of a feminist group), providing the historian uses the "objective historian" standards, he or she is a "conscientious historian". It was Irving's failure as an "objective historian" not his right wing views that caused him to lose his libel case, as a "conscientious historian" would not have "deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence" to support his political views.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1539}}&lt;ref&gt;"deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence" Justice Charles Gray {{harv|Schneider|2001|p=1533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History analysis==
{{Main article|Historical method}}

The process of historical analysis involves investigation and analysis of competing ideas, facts, and purported facts to create coherent [[narrative]]s that explain "what happened" and "why or how it happened". Modern historical analysis usually draws upon other social sciences, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[linguistics]]. While ancient writers do not normally share modern historical practices, their work remains valuable for its insights within the cultural context of the times. An important part of the contribution of many modern historians is the verification or dismissal of earlier historical accounts through reviewing newly discovered sources and recent scholarship or through parallel disciplines like [[archaeology]].

==Historiography==
{{Main article|Historiography}}

===Ancient===
[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]
Understanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the telling of history has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. What constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]). The earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], though no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name.

[[Greek historiography|Systematic historical thought]] emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development that became an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484 – {{annum|c.&amp;nbsp;425|[[Before Common Era|BCE]]}}) who later became known as the "father of history" ([[Cicero]]). Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events. [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element that set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}} – {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].

[[Image:Leonardo Bruni - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.1370–1444), the historian who first divided history into the three eras of [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], the [[Middle Ages]], and [[Modern history|Modern times]].]]
The [[Roman historiography|Romans adopted the Greek tradition]]. While early Roman works were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234–149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. [[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}} – {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the Greco-Roman tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}} – {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese historiography]], the ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China.  The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|BCE}}, is among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles. [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jörn Rüsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian historiography began early, perhaps as early as [[Luke-Acts]], which is the [[primary source]] for the [[Apostolic Age]]. Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the [[Middle Ages]]. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the [[early medieval|Early Middle Ages]] historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or [[chronicle]]s recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type of writing is the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s, which were the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late 9th&amp;nbsp;century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.

[[Muslim]] [[Historiography of early Islam|historical writings]] first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death. With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] from various sources, scholars had to verify which sources were more reliable. To evaluate these sources, they developed various methodologies, such as the ''[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]'', ''[[science of hadith]]'' and ''[[Isnad]]'' (chain of transmission). They later applied these methodologies to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Famous historians in this tradition include [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwah]] (d.&amp;nbsp;712), [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d.&amp;nbsp;728), [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d.&amp;nbsp;761), [[al-Waqidi]] (745–822), [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.&amp;nbsp;834), [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810–870) and [[Ibn Hajar Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] (1372–1449).

===Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the modern development of historiography through the application of scrupulous methods began.

[[File:Voltaire-Baquoy.gif|thumb|[[Voltaire]]'s works of history are an excellent example of [[Enlightenment era]] history writing. Painting by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]].]]
French ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) had an enormous influence on the art of history writing. His best-known histories are ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), and ''Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations'' (1756). "My chief object," he wrote in 1739, "is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization – in a word, – of the human mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Sreedharan|title=A Textbook of Historiography: 500 BC to AD 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history, and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture, and political history.

[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) was a masterpiece of late 18th-century history writing.]]
At the same time, philosopher [[David Hume]] was having a similar impact on history in [[Great Britain]]. In 1754, he published the ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|History of England]]'', a six-volume work that extended from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688. Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wertz | first1 = S.

B., ''Church and Society in the Scottish Enlightenment: The Moderate Literati of Edinburgh'', Princeton, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarship was painstaking for the time and he was able to access a large number of documentary sources that had previously been unstudied. He was also one of the first historians who understood the importance of general and universally applicable ideas in the shaping of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/committees/commissions/centennial/history/021hoebel.pdf|title=William Robertson: An 18th Century Anthropologist-Historian|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apex of Enlightenment history was reached with [[Edward Gibbon]]'s, monumental six-volume work, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', published on 17 February 1776. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of [[primary source]]s, at the time its methodology became a model for later historians. This has led to Gibbon being called the first "modern historian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yH9rdaF1CckC|title=Theorists of the Modernist Novel: James Joyce, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf|author=Deborah Parsons|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold impressively, earning its author a total of about £9000. Biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen|Leslie Stephen]] wrote that thereafter, "His fame was as rapid as it has been lasting."

===19th century===
The tumultuous events surrounding the [[French Revolution]] inspired much of the historiography and analysis of the early 19th century. Interest in the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] was also rekindled by the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 in [[England]].

[[Thomas Carlyle]] published his magnum opus, the three-volume ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.E. |last=Marshall |chapter-url=http://marshall.thefreelibrary.com/English-Literature-For-Boys-And-Girls/82-1 |chapter=Carlyle – The Sage Of Chelsea |title=English Literature For Boys And Girls |via=Farlex Free Library |access-date=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=8890 |title=Thomas Carlyle| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-09-20|work=Professional Works|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work had a passion new to historical writing. [[Thomas Macaulay]] produced his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'', in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Thomas Babington, ''History of England''. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., 1878. Vol. V, title page and prefatory "Memoir of Lord Macaulay".&lt;/ref&gt;  His writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Western, ''Monarchy and Revolution. The English State in the 1680s'' (London: Blandford Press, 1972), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Jules Michelet, later in his career.]]
In his main work ''Histoire de France'', French historian [[Jules Michelet]] coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning "Re-birth" in [[French language]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nineteen-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. Michelet was one of the first historians to shift the emphasis of history to the common people, rather than the leaders and institutions of the country. Another important French historian of the period was [[Hippolyte Taine]]. He was the chief theoretical influence of French [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], a major proponent of [[sociological positivism]] and one of the first practitioners of [[Historicism|historicist]] criticism. Literary historicism as a critical movement has been said to originate with him.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, R. Gordon, ''"Literature and the Historian"'', American Quarterly, Vol. 26, No. 2 (1974), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major progenitors of the history of [[cultural history|culture]] and [[art history|art]], was the Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/historian/Jacob_Burckhardt.html Jakob Burckhardt Renaissance Cultural History &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Burckhardt's best-known work is ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' (1860). According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed. Mark G Malvasi and Jeffrey O. Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change, particularly the development of constitutional government. [[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874–78) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. Previous historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]s in the 19th century, resulted with separation of "one's own" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.&lt;ref name = "laboratory"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f52rawP96lYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22nationalisation+of+history%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalisation%20of%20history%22&amp;f=false|title=A Laboratory of Transnational History Ukraine and recent Ukrainian historiography|accessdate=October 18, 2010|author=Georgiy Kasianov, Philipp Terr|pages=7|quote=This essay deals with, what I call, "nationalized history", meaning a way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that requires separation of "one's own" history from "common" history and its construction as history of a nation.|isbn=978-1-84545-621-4|date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new discipline, [[sociology]], emerged in the late 19th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.

===Professionalization in Germany===
[[Image:Leopold Von Ranke 1877.jpg|thumb|200x200px|right|[[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] established history as a professional academic discipline in Germany.]]
The modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in 19th-century German universities. [[Leopold von Ranke]] was a pivotal influence in this regard, and is considered as the founder of modern source-based [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Beiser (2011) ''The German Historicist Tradition'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=w2c6YaKf9usC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janelle G. Reinelt, Joseph Roach (2007), ''Critical Theory and Performance'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=asORYuvznpQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=rankean+positivism&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kH2XUI65MuTc4QTU8YHwBw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6wEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rankean%20positivism&amp;f=false p. 193]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern (ed.), ''The Varieties of History'', p. 54: "Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886) is the father as well as the master of modern historical scholarship."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green and Troup (eds.), ''The Houses of History'', p. 2: "Leopold von Ranke was instrumental in establishing professional standards for historical training at the University of Berlin between 1824 and 1871."&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom, and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for an historian of the age, including "memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s ([[empiricism]]), an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''[[political history|aussenpolitik]]'').&lt;ref&gt;E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&amp;nbsp;BC to AD&amp;nbsp;2000'' (2004) p 185&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources had to be hard, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Boldt, "Ranke: objectivity and history." ''Rethinking History'' 18.4 (2014): 457-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The term [[Whig history]] was coined by [[Herbert Butterfield]] in his short book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' in 1931, (a reference to the British [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s, advocates of the power of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]) to refer to the approach to historiography that presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater [[liberty]] and [[wikt:enlightenment|enlightenment]], culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s, and [[scientific progress]]. The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based, and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr, "When Is Historiography Whiggish?" ''Journal of the History of Ideas,'' April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301–309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfield's antidote to Whig history was "...to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Wilson and T. G. Ashplant, "Whig History and Present-Centred History," ''The Historical Journal'', 31 (1988): 1–16, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfield's formulation received much attention, and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalised terms is no longer academically respectable.&lt;ref&gt;''G. M. Trevelyan'' (1992), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marc Bloch.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|The 20th century saw the creation of a huge variety of historiographical approaches. [[Marc Bloch]]'s focus on social history rather than traditional political history was of tremendous influence.]]
The French [[Annales School]] radically changed the focus of historical research in France during the 20th century by stressing long-term social history, rather than political or diplomatic themes. The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ Editions.ehess.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; An eminent member of this school, [[Georges Duby]], described his approach to history as one that &lt;blockquote&gt;relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society, and civilisation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marxist historiography]] developed as a school of historiography influenced by the chief tenets of [[Marxism]], including the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]]. [[R. H. Tawney]]'s ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rose Benét]] (1988) p.&amp;nbsp;961&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. A [[Communist Party Historians Group|circle of historians]] inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. Members included [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[E. P. Thompson]].

[[World history]], as a distinct field of historical study, emerged as an independent academic field in the 1980s. It focused on the examination of [[history]] from a global perspective and looked for common [[pattern]]s that emerged across all cultures. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''A Study of History'', written between 1933 and 1954, was an important influence on this developing field. He took a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations and demonstrated that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''The Rise of the West'' (1965) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNeill | first1 = William H. | year = 1995 | title = The Changing Shape of World History | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 8–26 | doi=10.2307/2505432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An undergraduate history degree is often used as a stepping stone to graduate studies in business or law. Many historians are employed at universities and other facilities for post-secondary education.&lt;ref name="blsgov"&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos054.htm Bls.gov : Social Scientists, Other] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051426/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos054.htm |date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is normal for colleges and universities to require the PhD degree for new full-time hires, and a master's degree for part-timers. Publication is increasingly required by smaller schools, so graduate papers become journal articles and PhD dissertations become published monographs. The graduate student experience is difficult—those who finish their doctorate in the United States take on average 8 or more years; funding is scarce except at a few very rich universities. Being a teaching assistant in a course is required in some programs; in others it is a paid opportunity awarded a fraction of the students. Until the 1970s it was rare for graduate programs to teach how to teach; the assumption was that teaching was easy and that learning how to do research was the main mission.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen, "Some Reminiscences and Reflections on Graduate Education in History, ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 36, Number 3, Sept 2008 pp. 468-484 {{doi|10.1353/rah.0.0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Nugent, "Reflections: "Where Have All the Flowers Gone . . .

Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B.

Townsend and Julia Brookins, "The Troubled Academic Job Market for History." ''Perspectives on History'' (2016) 54#2 pp 157-182 echoes Robert B.

[[Image:IPMtrap4854.JPG|right|thumb|An IPM [[boll weevil]] [[Insect trap|trap]] in a cotton field ([[Manning, South Carolina]]).]]

'''Integrated pest management''' ('''IPM'''), also known as '''integrated pest control''' ('''IPC''') is a broad-based approach that integrates practices for economic control of [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s. IPM aims to suppress pest populations below the economic injury level (EIL). The UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] defines IPM as "the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AGP - Integrated Pest Management | url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/core-themes/theme/pests/ipm/en/ |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entomologist]]s and [[ecologist]]s have urged the adoption of IPM pest control since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=knipling&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knipling | first1 = EF | year = 1972 | title = Entomology and the Management of Man's Environment | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Entomology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 153–167 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.1972.tb01618.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPM allows for safer pest control.{{clarify|reason=safer than what?|date=April 2013}}

The introduction and spread of [[invasive species]] can also be managed with IPM by reducing risks while maximizing benefits and reducing costs.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = M.

== History ==

Shortly after World War II, when synthetic [[insecticide]]s became widely available, entomologists in California developed the concept of "supervised insect control".&lt;ref name=Smith&amp;Smith&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.F.|author2=Smith, G.L.|title=Supervised control of insects: Utilizes parasites and predators and makes chemical control more efficient|journal=California Agriculture|date=May 1949|volume=3|issue=5|pages=3–12|url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca305p3-71369.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430102123/http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca305p3-71369.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, entomologists in the US [[Cotton Belt (region)|Cotton Belt]] were advocating a similar approach. Under this scheme, insect control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and natural-enemy populations. This was viewed as an alternative to calendar-based programs. Supervised control was based on knowledge of the ecology and analysis of projected trends in pest and natural-enemy populations.

Supervised control formed much of the conceptual basis for the "integrated control" that University of California entomologists articulated in the 1950s. Integrated control sought to identify the best mix of chemical and biological controls for a given insect pest. Chemical insecticides were to be used in the manner least disruptive to biological control. The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.

IPM extended the concept of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all tactics. Controls such as pesticides were to be applied as in integrated control, but these now had to be compatible with tactics for all classes of pests. Other tactics, such as host-plant resistance and cultural manipulations, became part of the IPM framework. IPM combined entomologists, [[plant pathologist]]s, [[nematologist]]s and weed scientists.

In the United States, IPM was formulated into national policy in February 1972 when President [[Richard Nixon]] directed federal agencies to take steps to advance the application of IPM in all relevant sectors. In 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] established an interagency IPM Coordinating Committee to ensure development and implementation of IPM practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acosta|first=EW|title=The History of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)|year=1995–2006|publisher = BioControl Reference Center |url=http://www.biconet.com/reference/IPMhistory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Perry Adkisson]] and [[Ray F. Smith]] received the 1997 [[World Food Prize]] for encouraging the use of IPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/laureates/19871999_laureates/1997_smith_and_adkisson/ |title=1997: Smith and Adkisson |publisher=The World Food Prize Foundation |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

IPM is used in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], forestry, human habitations, [[preventive conservation]] and general pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management.

== Principles ==

An American IPM system is designed around six basic components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|title=Integrated Pest Management (IMP) Principles|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/ipm.htm |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Acceptable pest levels'''—The emphasis is on ''control'', not ''eradication''. IPM holds that wiping out an entire pest population is often impossible, and the attempt can be expensive and unsafe. IPM programmes first work to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls if those thresholds are crossed.  These thresholds are pest and site specific, meaning that it may be acceptable at one site to have a weed such as [[white clover]], but not at another site. Allowing a pest population to survive at a reasonable threshold reduces selection pressure. This lowers the rate at which a pest develops resistance to a control, because if almost all pests are killed then those that have [[Pesticide resistance|resistance]] will provide the genetic basis of the future population. Retaining a significant number of unresistant specimens dilutes the prevalence of any resistant genes that appear. Similarly, the repeated use of a single class of controls will create pest populations that are more resistant to that class, whereas alternating among classes helps prevent this.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* '''Preventive cultural practices'''—Selecting varieties best for local growing conditions and maintaining healthy crops is the first line of defense. Plant [[quarantine]] and 'cultural techniques' such as [[crop  sanitation]] are next, e.g., removal of diseased plants, and cleaning pruning shears to prevent spread of [[infection]]s. Beneficial [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] are added to the potting media of [[horticultural]] crops vulnerable to root diseases, greatly reducing the need for [[fungicide]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* '''Monitoring'''—Regular observation is critically important. Observation is broken into inspection and identification.{{sfn|Bennett|Owens|Corrigan|2010}} Visual inspection, insect and spore traps, and other methods are used to monitor pest levels. Record-keeping is essential, as is a thorough knowledge of target pest behavior and reproductive cycles. Since insects are cold-blooded, their physical development is dependent on area temperatures. Many insects have had their development cycles modeled in terms of [[Growing degree-day|degree-days]]. The degree days of an environment determines the optimal time for a specific insect outbreak. Plant pathogens follow similar patterns of response to weather and season.
* '''Mechanical controls'''—Should a pest reach an unacceptable level, mechanical methods are the first options. They include simple hand-picking, barriers, traps, vacuuming and [[tillage]] to disrupt breeding.
* '''[[Biological pest control|Biological controls]]'''—Natural biological processes and materials can provide control, with acceptable environmental impact, and often at lower cost. The main approach is to promote [[beneficial insects]] that eat or parasitize target pests. [[Biological insecticide]]s, derived from naturally occurring [[microorganism]]s (''e.g.''—[[Bacillus thuringiensis|''Bt'']], [[entomopathogenic fungi]] and [[entomopathogenic nematode]]s), also fall in this category. Further 'biology-based' or '[[Ecologic pesticides and herbicides|ecological]]' techniques are under evaluation.
* '''[[Pesticide application|Responsible use]]'''—Synthetic [[pesticides]] are used as required and often only at specific times in a pest's life cycle. Many newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances (''e.g.''—[[nicotine]], [[pyrethrum]] and insect [[juvenile hormone]] analogues), but the [[toxophore]] or active component may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Applications of pesticides must reach their intended targets. Matching the application technique to the crop, the pest, and the pesticide is critical. The use of low-volume spray equipment reduces overall pesticide use and labor cost.

An IPM regime can be simple or sophisticated. Historically, the main focus of IPM programmes was on agricultural insect pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPM Guidelines|url=http://www.umass.edu/umext/ipm/publications/guidelines/index.html|publisher=UMassAmherst—Integrated Pest Management, Agriculture and Landscape Program|accessdate=13 March 2012|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312110559/http://www.umass.edu/umext/ipm/publications/guidelines/index.html|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds and other pests that interfere with management objectives for sites such as residential and commercial structures, [[lawn]] and [[Grass|turf]] areas, and home and [[community garden]]s.

== Process ==

IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic, ecological and social consequences&lt;ref name=Sandler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandler|first=Hilary A.|title=Integrated Pest Management|journal=Cranberry Station Best Management Practices|year=2010|volume=1|issue=1|pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is applicable to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations. The IPM process starts with monitoring, which includes inspection and identification, followed by the establishment of economic injury levels.  The economic injury levels set the economic threshold level.  That is the point when pest damage (and the benefits of treating the pest) exceed the cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Pest Control, Mallis, Arnold, 10th edition, Hedges, Stoy, Editor. pp.1499-1500&lt;/ref&gt;  This can also be an action threshold level for determining an unacceptable level that is not tied to economic injury.  Action thresholds are more common in structural pest management and economic injury levels in classic agricultural pest management. An example of an action threshold is one fly in a hospital operating room is not acceptable, but one fly in a pet kennel would be acceptable.  Once a threshold has been crossed by the pest population action steps need to be taken to reduce and control the pest.  Integrated pest management employ a variety of actions including cultural controls, including physical barriers, biological controls, including adding and conserving natural predators and enemies to the pest, and finally chemical controls or pesticides.  Reliance on knowledge, experience, observation and integration of multiple techniques makes IPM appropriate for [[organic farming]] (excluding synthetic  pesticides). These may or may not include materials listed on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI)&lt;ref&gt;Organic Materials Review Institute, "The OMRI Product List," http://www.omri.org/OMRI_about_list.html approved product list.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in organic farming and [[organic gardening]] are generally safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.&lt;ref name=pot&gt;Pottorff LP. [http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4DMG/VegFruit/organic.htm Some Pesticides Permitted in Organic Gardening]. Colorado State University Cooperative Extension.&lt;/ref&gt; For conventional farms IPM can reduce human and environmental exposure to [[hazard]]ous chemicals, and potentially lower overall costs.

Risk assessment usually includes four issues: 1) characterization of biological control agents, 2) health risks, 3) environmental risks and 4) efficacy.&lt;ref name=consoli&gt;{{cite book|first1=Fernando L. |last1=Consoli|first2=José Roberto Postali |last2=Parra|first3=Roberto Antônio |last3=Zucchi|title=Egg Parasitoids in Agroecosystems with Emphasis on ''Trichogramma''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtlhlYFH9RgC|date=28 September 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9110-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistaken identification of a pest may result in ineffective actions. E.g., plant damage due to over-watering could be mistaken for [[fungal infection]], since many fungal and viral infections arise under moist conditions.

Monitoring begins immediately, before the pest's activity becomes significant. Monitoring of agricultural pests includes tracking soil/planting media fertility and water quality. Overall plant health and resistance to pests is greatly influenced by [[pH]], [[alkalinity]], of dissolved mineral and oxygen reduction potential. Many diseases are waterborne, spread directly by irrigation water and indirectly by splashing.

Once the pest is known, knowledge of its lifecycle provides the optimal intervention points.&lt;ref name=Metcalf&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Insect Pest Management|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|location=New York|page=266|first1=Robert Lee |last1=Metcalf|first2=William Henry |last2=Luckmann&lt;!-- |accessdate=13 March 2012 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, weeds reproducing from last year's seed can be prevented with mulches and pre-emergent herbicide.

Pest-tolerant crops such as [[soybeans]] may not warrant interventions unless the pests are numerous or rapidly increasing. Intervention is warranted if the expected cost of damage by the pest is more than the cost of control. Health hazards may require intervention that is not warranted by economic considerations.

Specific sites may also have varying requirements. E.g., white clover may be acceptable on the sides of a tee box on a [[golf course]], but unacceptable in the [[fairway (golf)|fairway]] where it could confuse the field of play.&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University Turf Pest Management Correspondence Course, Introduction, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible interventions include mechanical/physical, cultural, biological and chemical. Mechanical/physical controls include picking pests off plants, or using netting or other material to exclude pests such as [[bird]]s from [[grape]]s or [[rodent]]s from structures. Cultural controls include keeping an area free of conducive conditions by removing waste or diseased plants, flooding, sanding, and the use of disease-resistant crop varieties.&lt;ref name=Sandler /&gt;  Biological controls are numerous. They include: conservation of natural predators or augmentation of natural predators, [[sterile insect technique]] (SIT).&lt;ref name=Klassen /&gt;

Augmentation, inoculative release and inundative release are different methods of biological control that affect the target pest in different ways. Augmentative control includes the periodic introduction of predators.&lt;ref name=linda&gt;{{cite book|first1=Linda |last1=Thomson |first2=David |last2=Bennett |first3=DeAnn |last3=Glenn |first4=Ary |last4=Hoffman |title=Developing Trichogramma as a Pest Management Tool |editor1=Opender Koul|editor2=G.

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an area-wide IPM program that introduces sterile male pests into the pest population to trick females into (unsuccessful) breeding encounters, providing a form of [[birth control]] and reducing reproduction rates.&lt;ref name=Klassen&gt;{{cite book|title=Sterile Insect Technique: Principles and Practice in Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|pages=4–28|author=W.

Robinson|chapter=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological controls mentioned above only appropriate in extreme cases, because in the introduction of new species, or supplementation of naturally occurring species can have detrimental ecosystem effects. Biological controls can be used to stop invasive species or pests, but they can become an introduction path for new pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babendreier|first=Dirk|title=Biological Invasion: Pros and Cons of Biological Control|journal=Ecological Studies|year=2007|volume=193|issue=7|pages=403–414|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36920-2_23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical controls include [[horticultural oil]]s or the application of insecticides and herbicides. A [[green pest management]] IPM program uses pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring materials.

Pesticides can be classified by their modes of action. Rotating among materials with different modes of action minimizes pest resistance.&lt;ref name=Sandler /&gt;

Evaluation is the process of assessing whether the intervention was effective, whether it produced unacceptable side effects, whether to continue, revise or abandon the program.{{sfn|Bennett|Owens|Corrigan|2010|p=12}}

== Southeast Asia ==

The [[Green Revolution]] of the 1960s and '70s introduced sturdier plants that could support the heavier grain loads resulting from intensive fertilizer use. Pesticide imports by 11 [[Southeast Asia]]n countries grew nearly sevenfold in value between 1990 and 2010, according to FAO statistics, with disastrous results. Rice farmers become accustomed to spraying soon after planting, triggered by signs of the leaf folder moth, which appears early in the growing season. It causes only superficial damage and doesn't reduce yields. In 1986, Indonesia banned 57 pesticides and completely stopped subsidizing their use. Progress was reversed in the 2000s, when growing production capacity, particularly in China, reduced prices. Rice production in Asia more than doubled. But it left farmers believing more is better—whether it's seed, fertilizer, or pesticides.&lt;ref name=s1308&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Normile | first1 = D. | title = Vietnam Turns Back a 'Tsunami of Pesticides' | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.737 | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6147 | pages = 737–738 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23950527| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[brown planthopper]], ''Nilaparvata lugens'', the farmers' main target, has become increasingly resistant. Since 2008, outbreaks have devastated rice harvests throughout Asia, but not in the Mekong Delta. Reduced spraying allowed natural predators to neutralize planthoppers in Vietnam. In 2010 and 2011, massive planthopper outbreaks hit 400,000 hectares of Thai rice fields, causing losses of about $64 million. The Thai government is now pushing the "no spray in the first 40 days" approach.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

By contrast early spraying kills frogs, spiders, wasps and dragonflies that prey on the later-arriving and dangerous planthopper and produced resistant strains. Planthoppers now require pesticide doses 500 times greater than originally. Overuse indiscriminately kills beneficial insects and decimates bird and amphibian populations. Pesticides are suspected of harming human health and became a common means for rural Asians to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

In 2001, scientists challenged 950 Vietnamese farmers to try IPM. In one plot, each farmer grew rice using their usual amounts of seed and fertilizer, applying pesticide as they chose. In a nearby plot, less seed and fertilizer were used and no pesticides were applied for 40 days after planting. Yields from the experimental plots was as good or better and costs were lower, generating 8% to 10% more net income. The experiment led to the "three reductions, three gains" campaign, claiming that cutting the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticide would boost yield, quality and income. Posters, leaflets, TV commercials and a 2004 radio soap opera that featured a rice farmer who gradually accepted the changes. It didn't hurt that a 2006 planthopper outbreak hit farmers using insecticides harder than those who didn't. [[Mekong Delta]] farmers cut insecticide spraying from five times per crop cycle to zero to one.

The Plant Protection Center and the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) have been encouraging farmers to grow flowers, [[okra]] and beans on [[rice paddy]] banks, instead of stripping vegetation, as was typical. The plants attract bees and a tiny wasp that eats planthopper eggs, while the vegetables diversify farm incomes.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

Agriculture companies offer bundles of pesticides with seeds and fertilizer, with incentives for volume purchases. A proposed law in Vietnam requires licensing pesticide dealers and government approval of advertisements to prevent exaggerated claims. Insecticides that target other pests, such as ''[[Scirpophaga incertulas]]'' (stem borer), the larvae of moth species that feed on rice plants allegedly yield gains of 21% with proper use.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

'''Ionizing radiation''' ('''ionising radiation''') is [[radiation]] that carries enough [[energy]] to knock [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, thereby [[ionization|ionizing]] them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic [[subatomic particle]]s, [[ion]]s or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and [[electromagnetic wave]]s on the high-energy end of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

[[Gamma ray]]s, [[X-rays]], and the higher [[vacuum ultraviolet|ultraviolet]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing, whereas the lower [[ultraviolet]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum and all the spectrum below UV, including visible [[light]] (including nearly all types of [[laser]] light), [[infrared]], [[microwave]]s, and [[radio wave]]s are considered ''[[non-ionizing radiation]]''. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation that occurs in the ultraviolet is not sharply defined, since different molecules and atoms ionize at [[Ionization energies of the elements (data page)|different energies]]. Conventional definition places the boundary at a [[photon energy]] between 10&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] and 33&amp;nbsp;eV in the ultraviolet (see [[Ionizing radiation#Definition boundary for lower-energy photons|definition boundary]] section below).

Typical ionizing subatomic particles from radioactivity include [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s and [[neutron]]s. Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize. Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are [[muon]]s, [[meson]]s, [[positron]]s, and other particles that constitute the secondary [[cosmic ray]]s that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Woodside"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as [[supernova]] explosions. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, [[carbon-14]]), which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation. [[Cosmic ray]]s and the decay of [[radioactive]] isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as [[background radiation]]. Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially by [[X-ray tube]]s, [[particle accelerators]], and any of the various methods that produce [[radioisotopes]] artificially.

Ionizing radiation is not detectable by human senses, so radiation detection instruments such as [[Geiger counter]]s must be used to indicate its presence and measure it. However, high intensities can cause emission of visible light upon interaction with matter, such as in [[Cherenkov radiation]] and [[radioluminescence]]. Ionizing radiation is used in a wide variety of fields such as [[medicine]], [[nuclear power]], research, manufacturing, construction, and many other areas, but presents a health hazard if proper measures against undesired exposure aren't followed. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living [[tissue (anatomy)|tissue]], and can result in [[radiation burn]]s, [[cell damage]], [[radiation sickness]], [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]], and [[death]].

==Types==
{{main article|Particle radiation}}
[[Image:Alfa beta gamma neutron radiation.svg|thumb|Alpha ('''α''') radiation consists of a fast-moving [[helium-4]] ([[Helium-4|{{SimpleNuclide|Helium|4}}]]) nucleus and is [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopped]] by a sheet of paper. Beta ('''β''') radiation, consisting of [[electron]]s, is halted by an aluminium plate. Gamma ('''γ''') radiation, consisting of energetic [[photon]]s, is eventually absorbed as it penetrates a dense material. Neutron ('''n''') radiation consists of free neutrons that are blocked by light elements, like hydrogen, which slow and/or capture them. Not shown: [[galactic cosmic rays]] that consist of energetic charged nuclei such as [[proton]]s, [[helium]] nuclei, and high-charged nuclei called [[HZE ions]].]]
[[File:Cloud chambers played an important role of particle detectors.jpg|thumb|[[Cloud chamber]]s are one of few ways of visualizing ionizing radiation. They were employed mainly in [[research]] in the early days of [[particle physics]], but remain an important education tool today.]]
Ionizing radiation is categorized by the nature of the particles or electromagnetic waves that create the ionizing effect. These have different ionization mechanisms, and may be grouped as directly or indirectly ionizing.

===Directly ionizing===
Any charged massive particle can ionize atoms directly by [[fundamental interaction]] through the [[Coulomb force]] if it carries sufficient kinetic energy. This includes [[atomic nuclei]], [[electron]]s, [[muon]]s, charged [[pion]]s, [[proton]]s, and energetic charged nuclei stripped of their electrons. When moving at relativistic speeds these particles have enough kinetic energy to be ionizing, but relativistic speeds are not required. For example, a typical alpha particle is ionizing, but moves at about 5% c, and an electron with 33 eV (enough to ionize) moves at about 1% c.

The first two ionizing sources to be recognized were given special names used today: Helium nuclei ejected from atomic nuclei are called [[alpha particle]]s, and electrons ejected usually (but not always) at relativistic speeds, are called [[beta particle]]s.

Natural [[cosmic ray]]s are made up primarily of relativistic protons but also include heavier atomic nuclei like [[helium]] ions and [[HZE ions]]. In the atmosphere such particles are often stopped by air molecules, and this produces short-lived charged pions, which soon decay to muons, a primary type of cosmic ray radiation that reaches the ground (and also penetrates it to some extent). Pions can also be produced in large amounts in particle accelerators.

====Alpha particles====
{{Main article|Alpha particle}}
Alpha particles consist of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together into a particle identical to a [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Alpha particle emissions are generally produced in the process of [[alpha decay]], but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the [[Greek alphabet]], [[Alpha|α]]. The symbol for the alpha particle is α or α&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as {{chem|He|2+}} or {{chem|4|2|He|2+}} indicating a Helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the ion gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle can be written as a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom {{chem|4|2|He}}.

Alpha particles are a hugely ionizing form of particle radiation. When they result from radioactive alpha decay they have low penetration depth. In this case they can be [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|absorbed]] by a few centimeters of air, or by the skin. More powerful, long range alpha particles from [[ternary fission]] are three times as energetic, and penetrate proportionately farther in air. The helium nuclei that form 10-12% of cosmic rays, are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes, and when encountered in space, are thus able to traverse the human body and dense shielding. However, this type of radiation is significantly attenuated by the Earth's atmosphere, which is a radiation shield equivalent to about 10 meters of water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf One kg of water per cm squared is 10 meters of water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101094421/http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beta particles====
{{Main article|Beta particles}}
Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s emitted by certain types of [[radioactive]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[potassium-40]]. The production of beta particles is termed [[beta decay]]. They are designated by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] beta (β).
There are two forms of beta decay, β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta Decay|url=http://www.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|work=Lbl.gov|date=9 August 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195332/http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When something is said to have [[radioactive contamination]], it often means that there are beta particles being emitted from its surface, detectable with a [[Geiger counter]] or other radiation detector. When brought into proximity to the beta emitter, the detector will indicate a dramatic increase in radioactivity. When the detector probe is covered with a shield to block the beta rays, the indication will be reduced dramatically.

High-energy beta particles may produce X-rays known as [[bremsstrahlung]] ("braking radiation") or [[secondary electron]]s ([[delta ray]]) as they pass through matter. Both of these can cause an indirect ionization effect.

Bremsstrahlung is of concern when shielding beta emitters, as the interaction of beta particles with the shielding material produces Bremsstrahlung. This effect is greater with material of high atomic numbers, so material with low atomic numbers is used for beta source shielding.

====Positrons and other types of antimatter====
{{Main article|Positron|Antimatter}}
The '''positron''' or '''antielectron''' is the [[antiparticle]] or the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]]. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, [[annihilation]] occurs, resulting in their conversion into the energy of two or more [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s (see [[electron–positron annihilation]]).

Positrons may be generated by [[positron emission]] nuclear decay (through [[weak interaction]]s), or by [[pair production]] from a sufficiently energetic [[photon]]. Positrons are common artificial sources of ionizing radiation used in medical [[PET scan|positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans.

As positrons are positively charged particles they can also directly ionize an atom through Coulomb interactions.

====Charged nuclei====
Charged nuclei are characteristic of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events and except for alpha particles (charged helium nuclei) have no natural sources on the earth. In space, however, very high energy protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions can be initially stopped by relatively thin layers of shielding, clothes, or skin. However, the resulting interaction will generate secondary radiation and cause cascading biological effects. If just one atom of tissue is displaced by an energetic proton, for example, the collision will cause further interactions in the body. This is called "[[linear energy transfer]]" (LET), which utilizes [[elastic scattering]].

LET can be visualized as a billiard ball hitting another in the manner of the [[conservation of momentum]], sending both away with the energy of the first ball divided between the two unequally. When a charged nucleus strikes a relatively slow-moving nucleus of an object in space, LET occurs and neutrons, alpha particles, low-energy protons, and other nuclei will be released by the collisions and contribute to the total absorbed dose of tissue.&lt;ref name="NASA/TP-1999-209320"&gt;[[hdl:2060/19990051001|Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989]] Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirectly ionizing ===
Indirect ionizing radiation is electrically neutral and therefore does not interact strongly with matter. The bulk of the ionization effects are due to secondary ionizations.

An example of indirectly ionizing radiation is [[neutron radiation]].

====Photon radiation====
{{see also|Gamma rays|X-rays}}
[[Image:EM-spectrum.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Different types of [[electromagnetic radiation]]]]
[[File:Pb-gamma-xs.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here, the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production starts to dominate.]]

Even though photons are electrically neutral, they can ionize atoms directly through the [[photoelectric effect]] and the [[Compton effect]]. Either of those interactions will cause the ejection of an electron from an atom at relativistic speeds, turning that electron into a beta particle (secondary beta particle) that will ionize many other atoms. Since most of the affected atoms are ionized directly by the [[secondary beta]] particles, photons are called indirectly ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Centre of Technological Safety|title=Interaction of Radiation with Matter|url=http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|work=Radiation Hazard|accessdate=5 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170010/http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photon radiation is called [[gamma ray]]s if produced by a [[nuclear reaction]], [[subatomic particle]] decay, or [[radioactive decay]] within the nucleus. It is otherwise called [[x-ray]]s if produced outside the nucleus. The generic term photon is therefore used to describe both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

X-rays normally have a lower energy than gamma rays, and an older convention was to define the boundary as a wavelength of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; m or a photon energy of 100 keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; That threshold was driven by limitations of older X-ray tubes and low awareness of [[isomeric transition]]s. Modern technologies and discoveries have resulted in an overlap between X-ray and gamma energies. In many fields they are functionally identical, differing for terrestrial studies only in origin of the radiation. In astronomy, however, where radiation origin often cannot be reliably determined, the old energy division has been preserved, with X-rays defined as being between about 120 eV and 120 keV, and gamma rays as being of any energy above 100 to 120 keV, regardless of source. Most astronomical "[[gamma-rays|gamma-ray astronomy]]" are known ''not'' to originate in nuclear radioactive processes but, rather, result from processes like those that produce astronomical X-rays, except driven by much more energetic electrons.

Photoelectric absorption is the dominant mechanism in organic materials for photon energies below 100 keV, typical of classical X-ray tube originated [[X-ray]]s. At energies beyond 100 keV, photons ionize matter increasingly through the [[Compton effect]], and then indirectly through [[pair production]] at energies beyond 5 MeV. The accompanying interaction diagram shows two Compton scatterings happening sequentially. In every scattering event, the gamma ray transfers energy to an electron, and it continues on its path in a different direction and with reduced energy.

====Definition boundary for lower-energy photons====
{{see also|Ultraviolet}}
The lowest ionization energy of any element is 3.89 eV, for [[caesium]]. However, US Federal Communications Commission material defines ionizing radiation as that with a [[photon energy]] greater than 10 eV (equivalent to a far [[ultraviolet]] wavelength of 124 [[nanometer]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Documents/bulletins/oet56/oet56e4.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020131849/http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Documents/bulletins/oet56/oet56e4.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-20 |author1=Robert F.

Thus, X-ray radiation is always ionizing, but only extreme-ultraviolet radiation can be considered ionizing under all definitions.

As noted, the biological effect of ionizing radiation on cells somewhat resembles that of a broader spectrum of '''molecularly damaging''' radiation, which overlaps ionizing radiation and extends beyond, to somewhat lower energies into all regions of UV and sometimes visible light in some systems (such as photosynthetic systems in leaves). Although [[DNA]] is always susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation, the DNA molecule may also be damaged by radiation with enough energy to excite certain [[molecular bond]]s to form [[thymine dimer]]s. This energy may be less than ionizing, but near to it. A good example is ultraviolet spectrum energy which begins at about 3.1 eV (400&amp;nbsp;nm) at close to the same energy level which can cause [[sunburn]] to unprotected skin, as a result of [[photochemistry|photoreactions]] in [[collagen]] and (in the [[UV-B]] range) also damage in DNA (for example, [[pyrimidine dimers]]). Thus, the mid and lower ultraviolet electromagnetic spectrum is damaging to biological tissues as a result of electronic excitation in molecules which falls short of ionization, but produces similar non-thermal effects. To some extent, visible light and also ultraviolet A (UVA) which is closest to visible energies, have been proven to result in formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] in skin, which cause indirect damage since these are electronically excited molecules which can inflict reactive damage, although they do not cause sunburn (erythema).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Liebel F, Kaur S, Ruvolo E, Kollias N, Southall MD |title=Irradiation of skin with visible light induces reactive oxygen species and matrix-degrading enzymes |journal=J.

[[File:Strahlenarten en.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Radiation interaction: gamma rays are represented by wavy lines, charged particles and neutrons by straight lines. The small circles show where ionization occurs.]]

====Neutrons====
{{main article|Neutron|neutron radiation}}
[[Neutron]]s have zero electrical charge and thus often do not ''directly'' cause ionization in a single step or interaction with matter. However, fast neutrons will interact with the protons in hydrogen via [[linear energy transfer|LET]], and this mechanism scatters the nuclei of the materials in the target area, causing direct ionization of the hydrogen atoms. When neutrons strike the hydrogen nuclei, proton radiation (fast protons) results. These protons are themselves ionizing because they are of high energy, are charged, and interact with the electrons in matter.

Neutrons that strike other nuclei besides hydrogen will transfer less energy to the other particle if LET does occur. But, for many nuclei struck by neutrons, [[inelastic scattering]] occurs. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether [[Neutron temperature|fast]] or [[Neutron temperature|thermal]] or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nuclei it strikes and its [[neutron cross section]].

In inelastic scattering, neutrons are readily absorbed in a process called [[neutron capture]] and attributes to the [[neutron activation]] of the nucleus. Neutron interactions with most types of matter in this manner usually produce [[radioactive]] nuclei. The abundant [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen-16]] nucleus, for example, undergoes neutron activation, rapidly decays by a proton emission forming [[isotopes of nitrogen|nitrogen-16]], which decays to oxygen-16. The short-lived nitrogen-16 decay emits a powerful beta ray. This process can be written as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O (n,p) &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N (fast neutron capture possible with &gt;11 MeV neutron)
&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N → &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (Decay t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.13 s)
This high-energy β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; further interacts rapidly with other nuclei, emitting high-energy γ via [[Bremsstrahlung]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While not a favorable reaction, the &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O (n,p) &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N reaction is a major source of X-rays emitted from the cooling water of a [[pressurized water reactor]] and contributes enormously to the radiation generated by a water-cooled [[nuclear reactor]] while operating.

For the best shielding of neutrons, hydrocarbons that have an abundance of [[hydrogen]] are used.

In [[fissile]] materials, secondary neutrons may produce [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, causing a larger amount of ionization from the [[daughter product]]s of fission.

Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 14 minutes, 42 seconds. Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as [[beta decay]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W.-M. Yao |display-authors=etal |url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf |title=Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons |journal=J. Phys. G |volume=33 |issue=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910125729/http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-10 |year=2007 |access-date=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the adjacent diagram, a neutron collides with a proton of the target material, and then becomes a fast recoil proton that ionizes in turn. At the end of its path, the neutron is captured by a nucleus in an (n,γ)-reaction that leads to the emission of a [[neutron capture]] photon. Such photons always have enough energy to qualify as ionizing radiation.

==Physical effects==
{{main article|Radiation damage}}
[[File:Cyclotron with glowing beam.jpg|thumb|right|Ionized air glows blue around a beam of particulate ionizing radiation from a [[cyclotron]]]]

===Nuclear effects===
Neutron radiation, alpha radiation, and extremely energetic gamma (&gt; ~20 MeV) can cause [[nuclear transmutation]] and [[induced radioactivity]]. The relevant mechanisms are [[neutron activation]], [[alpha absorption]], and [[photodisintegration]]. A large enough number of transmutations can change macroscopic properties and cause targets to become radioactive themselves, even after the original source is removed.

===Chemical effects===
{{main article|Radiation chemistry}}
Ionization of molecules can lead to [[radiolysis]] (breaking chemical bonds), and formation of highly reactive [[free radicals]]. These free radicals may then react chemically with neighbouring materials even after the original radiation has stopped. (e.g., [[ozone cracking]] of polymers by ozone formed by ionization of air). Ionizing radiation can disrupt crystal lattices in metals, causing them to become amorphous, with consequent swelling, [[material creep]], and embrittlement. Ionizing radiation can also accelerate existing chemical reactions such as polymerization and corrosion, by contributing to the activation energy required for the reaction. Optical materials darken under the effect of ionizing radiation.

High-intensity ionizing radiation in air can produce a visible [[ionized air glow]] of telltale bluish-purplish color. The glow can be observed, e.g., during [[criticality accident]]s, around [[mushroom cloud]]s shortly after a [[nuclear explosion]], or inside of a damaged nuclear reactor like during the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

Monatomic fluids, e.g. molten [[sodium]], have no chemical bonds to break and no crystal lattice to disturb, so they are immune to the chemical effects of ionizing radiation. Simple diatomic compounds with very negative [[enthalpy of formation]], such as [[hydrogen fluoride]] will reform rapidly and spontaneously after ionization.

===Electrical effects===
Ionization of materials temporarily increases their conductivity, potentially permitting damaging current levels. This is a particular hazard in [[semiconductor]] microelectronics employed in electronic equipment, with subsequent currents introducing operation errors or even permanently damaging the devices. Devices intended for high radiation environments such as the nuclear industry and extra atmospheric (space) applications may be made [[radiation hardening|''radiation hard'']] to resist such effects through design, material selection, and fabrication methods.

Proton radiation found in space can also cause [[single-event upset]]s in digital circuits.

The electrical effects of ionizing radiation are exploited in gas-filled radiation detectors, e.g. the [[Geiger-Muller counter]] or the [[ion chamber]].

==Health effects==
{{main article|Radiobiology}}
In general, ionizing radiation is harmful and potentially lethal to living beings but some types have medical applications in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]].

Most adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation may be grouped in two general categories:
*deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to killing or malfunction of cells following high doses from [[radiation burn]]s
*stochastic effects, i.e., [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]] and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to [[mutation]] of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraph 55}}

The most common impact is stochastic [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a latent period of years or decades after exposure. For example, ionizing radiation is the sole cause of [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Understanding pathophysiology |publisher=Elsevier |last=Huether |first=Sue E. |last2=McCance |first2=Kathryn L. |isbn=9780323354097 |edition=6th |location=St. Louis, Missouri |pages=530 |oclc=740632205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with [[effective radiation dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per [[sievert]].{{sfn | ICRP | 2007}} If this [[Linear no-threshold model|linear model]] is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second. Other stochastic effects of ionizing radiation are [[teratogenesis]], [[Radiation-induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]], and [[heart disease]].

==Uses==
{{main article|Nuclear technology|Radiobiology}}
Ionizing radiation has many industrial, military, and medical uses. Its usefulness must be balanced with its hazards, a compromise that has shifted over time. For example, at one time, assistants in shoe shops [[Shoe-fitting fluoroscope|used X-rays to check a child's shoe size]], but this practice was halted when the risks of ionizing radiation were better understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Shoe-fitting Fluoroscope as a Radiation Hazard |journal=California Medicine |first=Leon |last=Lewis |first2=Paul E |last2=Caplan |volume=72 |issue=1 |pmid=15408494 |date=January 1, 1950 |pmc=1520288 |pages=26–30 [27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutron radiation is essential to the working of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The penetrating power of x-ray, gamma, beta, and positron radiation is used for [[medical imaging]], [[nondestructive testing]], and a variety of industrial gauges. [[Radioactive tracers]] are used in medical and industrial applications, as well as biological and [[radiation chemistry]]. Alpha radiation is used in [[static eliminator]]s and [[smoke detectors]]. The sterilizing effects of ionizing radiation are useful for cleaning medical instruments, [[food irradiation]], and the [[sterile insect technique]]. Measurements of [[carbon-14]], can be used to [[radiocarbon dating|date]] the remains of long-dead organisms (such as wood that is thousands of years old).

==Sources of radiation==
Ionizing radiation is generated through nuclear reactions, nuclear decay, by very high temperature, or via acceleration of charged particles in electromagnetic fields. Natural sources include the sun, lightning and supernova explosions. Artificial sources include nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, and [[x-ray tube]]s.

The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) itemized types of human exposures.

The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] manages the International System of Radiological Protection, which sets recommended limits for dose uptake.

===Background radiation===
{{main article|Background radiation}}
Background radiation comes from both natural and man-made sources.

The global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is about 3&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.3&amp;nbsp;rem) per year, 80% of which comes from nature. The remaining 20% results from exposure to man-made radiation sources, primarily from [[medical imaging]]. Average man-made exposure is much higher in developed countries, mostly due to [[CT scans]] and [[nuclear medicine]].

Natural [[background radiation]] comes from five primary sources: cosmic radiation, solar radiation, external terrestrial sources, radiation in the human body, and [[radon]].

The background rate for natural radiation varies considerably with location, being as low as 1.5&amp;nbsp;mSv/a (1.5&amp;nbsp;mSv per year) in some areas and over 100&amp;nbsp;mSv/a in others. The highest level of purely natural radiation recorded on the Earth's surface is 90&amp;nbsp;µGy/h (0.8&amp;nbsp;Gy/a) on a Brazilian black beach composed of [[monazite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]]|title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation|year=2000|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|page=121|volume=vol. 1|chapter=Annex B|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804174956/http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], primarily due to naturally radioactive limestone used as a building material. Some 2000 of the most exposed residents receive an average [[radiation dose]] of 10&amp;nbsp;[[mGy]] per year, (1&amp;nbsp;[[rad (unit)|rad]]/yr) ten times more than the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources.&lt;ref name="Mortazavi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortazavi|first=S.M.J.|author2=P.A. Karamb|title=Apparent lack of radiation susceptibility among residents of the high background radiation area in Ramsar, Iran: can we relax our standards?|journal=Radioactivity in the Environment|year=2005|volume=7|pages=1141–1147|doi=10.1016/S1569-4860(04)07140-2|issn=1569-4860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Record levels were found in a house where the [[effective radiation dose]] due to external radiation was 135&amp;nbsp;mSv/a, (13.5&amp;nbsp;rem/yr) and the [[committed dose]] from [[radon]] was 640&amp;nbsp;mSv/a (64.0&amp;nbsp;rem/yr).&lt;ref name="Sohrabi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sohrabi|first=Mehdi|author2=Babapouran, Mozhgan|title=New public dose assessment from internal and external exposures in low- and elevated-level natural radiation areas of Ramsar, Iran|journal=Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on High Levels of Natural Radiation and Radon Areas|year=2005|volume=1276|pages=169–174 |doi=10.1016/j.ics.2004.11.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique case is over 200 times higher than the world average background radiation. Despite the high levels of background radiation that the residents of Ramsar receive there is no compelling evidence that they experience a greater health risks. The ICRP recommendations are conservative limits and may represent an over representation of the actual health risk. Generally radiation safety organization recommend the most conservative limits assuming it is best to err on the side of caution. This level of caution is appropriate but should not be used to create fear about background radiation danger. Radiation danger from background radiation may be a serious threat but is more likely a small overall risk compared to all other factors in the environment.

====Cosmic radiation====
{{see also|Cosmic ray}}
The Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outside our solar system. This cosmic radiation consists of relativistic particles: positively charged nuclei (ions) from 1 [[Atomic mass unit|amu]] [[proton]]s (about 85% of it) to 26 amu [[iron]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and even beyond. (The high-atomic number particles are called [[HZE ions]].) The energy of this radiation can far exceed that which humans can create, even in the largest [[particle accelerator]]s (see [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]). This radiation interacts in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation that rains down, including [[x-rays]], [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[antiproton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[neutron]]s.

The [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, with a dose rate that varies in different parts of the world and based largely on the geomagnetic field, altitude, and solar cycle. The cosmic-radiation dose rate on airplanes is so high that, according to the United Nations UNSCEAR 2000 Report (see links at bottom), airline flight crew workers receive more dose on average than any other worker, including those in nuclear power plants. Airline crews receive more cosmic rays if they routinely work flight routes that take them close to the North or South pole at high altitudes, where this type of radiation is maximal.

Cosmic rays also include high-energy gamma rays, which are far beyond the energies produced by solar or human sources.

====External terrestrial sources====
Most materials on Earth contain some radioactive atoms, even if in small quantities. Most of the dose received from these sources is from gamma-ray emitters in building materials, or rocks and soil when outside. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern for '''terrestrial radiation''' are isotopes of [[potassium]], [[uranium]], and [[thorium]]. Each of these sources has been decreasing in activity since the formation of the Earth.

====Internal radiation sources====
{{see also|Committed dose}}
All earthly materials that are the building-blocks of life contain a radioactive component. As humans, plants, and animals consume food, air, and water, an inventory of radioisotopes builds up within the organism (see [[banana equivalent dose]]). Some radionuclides, like [[potassium-40]], emit a high-energy gamma ray that can be measured by sensitive electronic radiation measurement systems. These internal radiation sources contribute to an individual's total radiation dose from [[natural background radiation]].

====Radon====
An important source of natural radiation is [[radon]] gas, which seeps continuously from bedrock but can, because of its high density, accumulate in poorly ventilated houses.

[[Radon]]-222 is a gas produced by the decay of [[radium]]-226. Both are a part of the natural [[uranium]] decay chain. Uranium is found in soil throughout the world in varying concentrations. Among non-smokers, radon is the largest cause of lung cancer and, overall, the second-leading cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |title=Health Risks |website=Radon |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2012-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020231845/http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |archivedate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation exposure==
[[File:Exposure chart-XKCD.svg|thumb|Various doses of radiation in sieverts, ranging from trivial to lethal.]]
{{main article|Radiation protection}}
There are three standard ways to limit exposure:
# '''Time''': For people exposed to radiation in addition to natural background radiation, limiting or minimizing the exposure time will reduce the dose from the radiation source.
# '''Distance''': Radiation intensity decreases sharply with distance, according to an [[inverse-square law]] (in an absolute vacuum).&lt;ref name=Camphausen&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515031929/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 |date=2009-05-15 }} in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224102/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ |date=2013-10-04 }}. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Shielding''': Air or skin can be sufficient to substantially attenuate alpha and beta radiation. Barriers of [[lead]], [[concrete]], or water are often used to give effective protection from more penetrating particles such as gamma rays and [[neutrons]]. Some radioactive materials are stored or handled underwater or by [[remote control]] in rooms constructed of thick concrete or lined with lead. There are special [[plastic]] shields that stop beta particles, and air will stop most alpha particles. The effectiveness of a material in shielding radiation is determined by its [[half-value layer|half-value thicknesses]], the thickness of material that reduces the radiation by half. This value is a function of the material itself and of the type and energy of ionizing radiation. Some generally accepted thicknesses of attenuating material are 5&amp;nbsp;mm of aluminum for most beta particles, and 3&amp;nbsp;inches of lead for gamma radiation.

These can all be applied to natural and man-made sources. For man-made sources the use of '''Containment''' is a major tool in reducing dose uptake and is effectively a combination of shielding and isolation from the open environment. Radioactive materials are confined in the smallest possible space and kept out of the environment such as in a [[hot cell]] (for radiation) or [[glove box]] (for contamination). [[Radioactive isotope]]s for medical use, for example, are dispensed in closed handling facilities, usually gloveboxes, while [[nuclear reactor]]s operate within closed systems with multiple barriers that keep the radioactive materials contained. Work rooms, hot cells and gloveboxes have slightly reduced air pressures to prevent escape of airborne material to the open environment.

In nuclear conflicts or civil nuclear releases [[civil defense]] measures can help reduce exposure of populations by reducing ingestion of isotopes and occupational exposure . One is the issue of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets, which blocks the uptake of [[iodine-131|radioactive iodine]] (one of the major radioisotope products of [[nuclear fission]]) into the human [[thyroid]] gland.

===Occupational exposure===
Occupationally exposed individuals are controlled within the regulatory framework of the country they work in, and in accordance with any local nuclear licence constraints. These are usually based on the recommendations of the ICRP.
The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation. For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}

The radiation exposure of these individuals is carefully monitored with the use of [[dosimeter]]s and other radiological protection instruments which will measure radioactive particulate concentrations, area gamma dose readings and [[radioactive contamination]]. A legal record of dose is kept.

Examples of activities where occupational exposure is a concern include:
*Airline crew (the most exposed population)
*[[Industrial radiography]]
*Medical [[radiology]] and [[nuclear medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0952-4746/16/4/004|vauthors = Pattison JE, Bachmann DJ, Beddoe AH|title=Gamma Dosimetry at Surfaces of Cylindrical Containers|journal=Journal of Radiological Protection|volume= 16|issue=4|pages=249–261|year=1996|bibcode = 1996JRP....16..249P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00004032-199911000-00006|author=Pattison, J.E.|title= Finger Doses Received during Samarium-153 Injections|journal=Health Physics|volume=77|issue=5|pages=530–5|year=1999|pmid=10524506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Uranium mining
*[[Nuclear power plant]] and [[nuclear fuel reprocessing plant]] workers
*Research laboratories (government, university and private)

Some human-made radiation sources affect the body through direct radiation, known as [[effective dose (radiation)]] while others take the form of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[irradiate]] the body from within. The latter is known as [[committed dose]].

===Public exposure===
Medical procedures, such as diagnostic [[X-ray]]s, [[nuclear medicine]], and [[radiation therapy]] are by far the most significant source of human-made radiation exposure to the general public. Some of the major [[radionuclide]]s used are [[I-131]], [[Tc-99m]], [[Co-60]], [[iridium|Ir-192]], and [[caesium|Cs-137]]. The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as [[tobacco]] ([[polonium]]-210), combustible fuels (gas, [[coal]], etc.), [[television]]s, luminous [[watch]]es and dials ([[tritium]]), airport [[X-ray]] systems, [[smoke detector]]s ([[americium]]), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles ([[thorium]]).

Of lesser magnitude, members of the public are exposed to radiation from the [[nuclear fuel]] cycle, which includes the entire sequence from processing [[uranium]] to the disposal of the spent fuel. The effects of such exposure have not been reliably measured due to the extremely low doses involved. Opponents use a cancer per dose model to assert that such activities cause several hundred cases of cancer per year, an application of the widely accepted [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT).

The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation to the public to an average of 1&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}

In a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], gamma rays from both the initial weapon explosion and [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] would be the sources of radiation exposure.

====Spaceflight====
Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the [[earth's magnetic field]] who would receive solar particles from [[solar proton event]]s (SPE) and [[galactic cosmic rays]] from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|major health concern]] for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit. Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging, although protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays. Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts|publisher=New Scientist|date=21 March 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327023245/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|archivedate=27 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air travel====
Air travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space as compared to sea level, including [[cosmic rays]] and from [[solar flare]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Effective Dose Rate |url=http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html |website=NAIRAS (Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System) |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html |archive-date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6hymYAgC6MC&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;f=false |author1=Jeffrey R.

===Radiation hazard warning signs===
Hazardous levels of ionizing radiation are signified by the trefoil sign on a yellow background. These are usually posted at the boundary of a radiation controlled area or in any place where radiation levels are significantly above background due to human intervention.

The red ionizing radiation warning symbol (ISO 21482) was launched in 2007, and is intended for [[IAEA]] Category 1, 2 and 3 sources defined as dangerous sources capable of death or serious injury, including food irradiators, teletherapy machines for cancer treatment and industrial radiography units. The symbol is to be placed on the device housing the source, as a warning not to dismantle the device or to get any closer. It will not be visible under normal use, only if someone attempts to disassemble the device. The symbol will not be located on building access doors, transportation packages or containers.&lt;ref name=radiationsymbol&gt;{{cite web |title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers |date=February 15, 2007 |url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2007/radiationsymbol.html |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA} |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217075115/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html |archive-date=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ordronaux''' (1830 - January 20, 1908) was an [[American Civil War]] army surgeon, a professor of [[medical jurisprudence]], a pioneering [[mental health]]  commissioner and a generous [[patron]] of university [[Financial endowment|endowments]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1859 and 1901 Ordronaux published at least fifteen books and articles about subjects as diverse as heroes of the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, [[military medicine]], medical jurisprudence, mental health, United States constitutional law and historical treatises. He left an estate worth $2,757,000 much of which he gave in endowments to several US universities and other institutions.&lt;ref name="ordwill2" /&gt; He did not marry.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

==Early life==
Ordronaux was the only son of Captain [[John Ordronaux (privateer)|John Ordronaux]] (a notable [[privateer]] of the [[War of 1812]]), and his wife Jean Marie Elizabeth Ordronaux (née Charretton). This is supported by the younger Ordronaux's will&lt;ref name="nytwill1"&gt;

Capt. Reader was the great grandson-in-law of Dr Ordronaux's father. Ref. Nav-2-LM DD617/S6-2(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1850, from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1852, and from the [[National Medical School]] in 1859.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; In 1859 he published his first book a "Eulogy on the life and character of Rev. Zachariah Greene", who, before taking [[Holy Orders]], had fought under Washington in the revolution of 1776 at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name="ordongreene"&gt;Ordronaux, J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1861 he had also been a lecturer at [[Dartmouth College]], [[The University of Vermont]] and [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

==American Civil War==
During the [[American Civil War]] Ordronaux served as an army surgeon stationed in New York.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks on the health of armies,&lt;ref name="hints1"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Hints on the preservation of health in armies. Appleton, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hints2"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Hints on health in armies. D. Van Nostrand, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits.&lt;ref name="ordmanual"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Manual of Instructions for Military Surgeons on the Examination of Recruits. D Van Nostrand, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to the latter,&lt;ref name="hints2" /&gt; which was written for the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], he said, "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose ; and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, in order to be able to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared."

In 1863 he  wrote a historical treatise in French (with Reinaud) on the commercial and political relations between the [[Roman Empire]] and the countries of Oriental [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="ordrelations"&gt;Ordronaux, J. (with Reinaud, J.T.). Relations Politique et Commerciales de l'Empire Romain avec l'Asie Orientale. Imprimerie imperiale, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 he wrote a second report for the [[United States Sanitary Commission]]. This concerned pensions for the war wounded and was subtitled, "On a system for the economical relief of disabled soldiers, and on certain proposed amendments to our present pension laws".&lt;ref name="ordreport"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Report to the U.S. Sanitary Commission. Sanford, Harroun &amp; Co., 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==
After the war he returned to Columbia Law School and began writing again. Between 1867 and 1871 he produced a book on preventative medicine&lt;ref name="ordprophylaxis"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Prophylaxis, an anniversary oration. Baillière brothers; London, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; and two textbooks on medical jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="ordjurisp"&gt;Ordronaux, J. The jurisprudence of medicine in its relation to the law of contracts, torts, and evidence. T. &amp; J.W. Johnson, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordwinter"&gt;Ordronaux, J. In re William Winter. s.n., 1870.&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into English verse the medieval Latin text of [[Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum]], the medical encyclopedia of the [[Scuola Medica Salernitana]].&lt;ref name="ordrss"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Translation into English verse of Regimen Sanitatis Salerni. Scuola Medica Salernitana. Lippincott, 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:it:Scuola medica salernitana|This school]] in [[Salerno]], [[Italy]] was the pre-eminent medical school in Europe in the 11th century. This was not the first English translation but an attempt to make a medically accurate one. He appears to have done this as a tribute to former members of his profession and in an introduction to his work he said, "''Regimen Sanitatis Salerni'' was a work of transcendent merit. Though written in the early twilight of the Middle Ages and in inferior Latin, it at once took its place alongside of such classic productions as the [[Hippocratic Corpus#List of works of the Corpus|Aphorisms of Hippocrates]]. No secular work, indeed, ever met with more popular favor, nor infused its canons so radically into the dogmas of any science. It was for ages the medical Bible of all Western Europe, and held undisputed sway over the teachings of its schools, next to the writings of [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]]".&lt;ref name="ordrss" /&gt;

==Work on mental health==
Ordronaux developed an interest in mental health and between 1872 and 1882 he was a member of the [[New York State Commission in Lunacy]] writing two books on the subject.&lt;ref name="ordstatus"&gt;Ordronaux, J. The proper legal status of the insane &amp; feeble-minded. McDivitt, Campbell &amp; Co., 1875&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordcommentaries"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Commentaries on the lunacy laws of New York. J. D. Parsons, Jr., 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these books mentions the opening of a ground breaking mental hospital and in his preface to the book he says, "The recent establishment of a department of Lunacy supervision by the State of New York, has turned public attention to it as a source for consultation, in the application of our [[Statutory law|Statute]] and [[Common law|Common Law]] to the legal relations of the insane......Insanity is a subject which touches our civil rights at so many different points, that it may be said to have a place in every problem involving human responsibility. It begins with man in the cradle, and follows him to the grave. It is often part of his physical heritage, and may become a qualifying element in all his civil acts. To collect and embody in one treatise the principles of law by which courts govern their adjudications in questions of mental incapacity, and to expound through commentaries both the philosophy of these decisions and the rules of procedure under which they are rendered, is the object aimed at in this manual of Lunacy practice".&lt;ref name="ordcommentaries" /&gt;

Ordronaux's activity as a Commissioner was frequently mentioned in the press. In 1875, he was called in to adjudicate whether a man, who was under sentence of death for murder, was insane.&lt;ref name="nytstaudermann"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1882 his forward thinking and outspokenness had made him some enemies and in 1882 his salary of $4000 as [[Commissioner in Lunacy]] was temporarily opposed in debate in the finance committee of the [[New York State Senate]].&lt;ref name="nytsalary"&gt;

Johnson, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; About this book of more than 600 pages, Ordonaux said in the preface, "The accompanying work is an attempt to present in a concrete form the entire system of Federal and State legislation, as practised under a written Constitution in the United States. Its object is to expound those administrative powers which, in our dual form of representative government, are sovereign within their several spheres of action.....A written Constitution is a political grammar to whose rules administrative laws must conform, in order to give them judicial validity.....The government of forty four independent States, dwelling in harmonious relations under a supervisory Federal sovereignty, would seem, therefore, to justify the treatment of Legislation as a
department of jurisprudence meriting more textual consideration than it has yet received.....the present treatise has been prepared to meet the wants of those who, desiring to practise or interpret the canons of representative government in the United States, may seek to master the secrets of its architecture through a study of the labors of its founders, and to trace its genesis and development to a providential origin in the Spartan Commonwealths of our colonial period."

==Later life==
In 1898 Ordronaux wrote a biography of a Leonice Sampson Moulton,&lt;ref name="ordmoulton"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Memoir of Leonice Marston Sampson Moulton. C.A. Hack &amp; Son, printers, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; a presumed relative of his foster father, possibly his foster mother.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; She was born in 1811 and descended from the original [[Mayflower]] [[List of passengers on the Mayflower|settlers]] to America. As Miss Sampson, she was sent on a secret mission to the US embassy in [[Buenos Aires]] to enquire into the sovereignty dispute between [[Great Britain]] and [[Argentina]] over the [[Falkland Islands]]. She is interesting according to Ordronaux for, among other things, keeping a very detailed diary which was far more comprehensive than the logs of the ships upon which she travelled.

On 27 June 1901 Ordronaux addressed the graduate students of The [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref name="ordtuv"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Address delivered to the medical graduates of the University of Vermont. Free Press Association, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  Reading like a tribute to his own life's work he  says, "A strange feeling possesses me as I rise to address you......I am here to perform, with much surprise to myself, the same duty which devolved upon me, on a similar occasion, thirty six years ago.......I stand in the presence of two distinct periods with all their differing and  startling results. In this long interval, too long to be measured by the standard of months, and falling more properly in the category of cycles, the drama of human society has moved with accelerated pace. A generation has acted its part of good and evil, then passed to its final account. Science, the industrial art,  Education, Commerce, Navigation, have all spread their wings as never before. Our country has added nine states to the framework of our Federal Union, and buttressed its [[Constitution]] with armor plated Amendments whose necessity had never been contemplated. Our very name, the United States, has changed its former significance and been adjudicated by our highest Appellate Tribunal to be no longer a plural substantive, but a noun in the singular number describing a nation of political equals, and not a league or partnership of States."

Ordronaux died of "[[apoplexy]]" at his home, Glen Head, in [[Roslyn, New York]] on 20 January 1908.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; His estate was initially valued at nearly $1,000,000.&lt;ref name="nytwill1" /&gt; A large part of his bequests were to hospitals, universities, churches and other public institutions. These included $30,000 to Dartmouth College and $10,000 each to [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], [[Hartford, Connecticut]], The [[University of Vermont]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Long Island]].&lt;ref name="nytwill1" /&gt; However, the New York Times reported on 8 August 1908 that Ordronaux's total estate amounted to $2,757,000, the bulk of which was left to his three surviving sisters.&lt;ref name="ordwill2"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Khutu''' was the name given to a material used by [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval]] [[Islam]]ic [[Bladesmith|cutlers]] for knife handles. The ultimate source of the material has been a matter of conjecture for more than a thousand years; Islamic [[polymath]] [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] was among the first to investigate it and debate about the material—especially its source—continues to this day. The hypothesized sources for the material have included [[narwhal]], [[Walrus ivory|walrus]], and [[mammoth]] ivory, the [[frontal bone]]s of bulls, goats, and birds, the teeth of snakes, fish, and [[hippopotamus]]es, and the root of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; The most recent investigation, by [[natural history|natural historian]] Chris Lavers, has pointed to the frontal [[wikt:boss#Noun|boss]] of the horns of the [[muskox]].

Khutu has been ascribed properties other than those of a work material.  It was, for example, described as an [[wikt:alexipharmic|alexipharmic]]—a property that eventually was attached to [[Unicorn#Alicorn|alicorn]], the supposed horn of the [[unicorn]].

==Medieval scholarship==

===Abu Rayhan Biruni===
Islamic polymath [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] (973–1048) was among the first to investigate khutu, which he referred to as ''al-chutww''. He described it as being from the land of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]] in the northern part of the Turkish territory and mentioned that it was in great demand in Egypt. He noted that the material came in a variety of colours, with yellowish-green being best, followed by those coloured [[camphor]], [[white]], "like the sun", and dark grey.&lt;ref name="Laufer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laufer |first1=Berthold |last2=Pelliot |first2=Paul |year=1913 |title=Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory |journal=T'oung Pao (second series) |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=315–370 |doi=10.1163/156853213x00213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned the beliefs that the material came from the forehead of the [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] (an enormous bird from Arabic and Persian myths which was said to carry off and eat elephants) or the forehead of a hippopotamus, but did not seem to attach much weight to these ideas, noting that it was much more similar to the frontal bone of a bull or goat.&lt;ref name="Lavers"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Natural History of Unicorns |last=Lavers |first=Chris |year=2009 |publisher=William Morris |location=USA |isbn=978-0-06-087414-8 |pages=112–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "It originates from an animal; it is much in demand, and preserved in the treasuries among the Chinese who assert that it is a desirable article because the approach of poison causes it to exude."&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

In another work he described it as "bigger than the hand in size"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and "thicker than two fingers"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and mentioned that "Amir Abu Ja'far bin Banu has a large box-like case made of long and broad khutu planks."&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; Because the material gave off a fishy smell when burned, he felt that it was probably a marine creature of some kind, but he specifically noted an instance where someone was able to pass off walrus ivory for proper khutu, strongly implying that the two materials were distinct – at least to him.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Lavers: "A Khwarazmian happened to find a tooth which was very white on the sides... the natural patterns described upon it were very thin, white and pale. It resembled the down of a cucumber if peeled in such a manner that the seed grains are also cut off. This Khwarazmain carried it to [Mecca], passed it off as the khutu and sold it at a high price to the Egyptians." As Lavers points out, this description could only refer to the osteodentine portion of walrus ivory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn al-Husayn Kashgari===
Writing shortly after al-Biruni, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Kashgari]] mentioned khutu in his work ''Diwan Lughat at-Turk'' (c. 1075): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Horn of a sea fish imported from China. It is (also) said that it is the root of a tree. It is used for knife handles. The presence of poison in food is put to the test by it because when broth or other dishes in the bowl are stirred with it the food cooks without fire (if poison is present in it), or if the horn is placed on a bowl it (the horn) sweats without steam."&lt;ref name="Dankoff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dankoff |first1=Robert |year=1973 |title=A Note on khutu and chatuq |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=542–543 |url= |doi=10.2307/600173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ibn al-Akfani===
The next investigation of khutu was by [[Ibn al-Akfani]] (1286–ca. 1348-49&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4274/ |title = The Selection of Treasures Regarding Precious Stones |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1700–1800 |accessdate = 2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who called the material ''chartut''. Although he cited al-Biruni's earlier work, he disagreed with a number of Al-Biruni's conclusions. For example, he favoured the theory that khutu came from the forehead of a large bird. He also offered a slightly different spectrum of possible colours for khutu (yellow, red, [[apricot (color)|apricot]], dust, black), though he did agree that the quality of the material varied with the colour.&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

==Modern scholarship==

===Berthold Laufer===
The era of modern scholarship on the identity of khutu began with the work of the [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Berthold Laufer]]. The first paper was titled "Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" and published in the journal ''T'oung Pao'' in 1913. Laufer provided a brief overview of the medieval scholarship and provided detailed information regarding the trade of narwhal and walrus ivory on the basis that khutu referred to one or both of those items. A second paper, titled "Supplementary Notes on Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" was published in 1916 in the same journal and provided some corrections and clarifications of his earlier work.

===Richard Ettinghausen===
While Laufer had detailed the Chinese end of the narwhal and walrus [[ivory trade]], Richard Ettinghausen focused on the Arabic side. Like Laufer, he felt that khutu was probably walrus ivory, with perhaps some samples being narwhal ivory.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt;

===Chris Lavers===
The most recent work on khutu has been done by [[Chris Lavers]]. In contrast to the early 20th century scholars, Lavers does not believe khutu to have been either walrus or narwhal ivory, but rather the frontal bone and associated horn material of the [[muskox]], with some specimens perhaps coming from mammoth ivory. His primary evidence for this was the work of al-Biruni, particularly where he mentions that knowledgeable people could differentiate walrus ivory from proper khutu (a fact that Laufer could not have known in his earlier work, as the al-Biruni text mentioning it had not yet been translated).&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; In ''The Natural History of Unicorns'' he acknowledges that Asian muskoxen were supposed to have become extinct about a thousand years before al-Biruni's investigations (see [[Muskox#Habitat and range|muskox]] for information regarding their extinction and reintroduction), but points out that there could well have been an isolated [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] of muskoxen existing in Asia until more modern times, that it was possible that there was trade in material goods between Asian arctic and North American arctic peoples, and also that frozen or fossilized muskoxen material could have been harvested in the same way that mammoth ivory was.

'''Legal education''' is the education of individuals in the principles, practices, and theory of [[law]]. It may be undertaken for several reasons, including to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for [[Admission to practice law|admission to legal practice]] in a particular jurisdiction, to provide a greater breadth of knowledge to those working in other professions such as politics or business, to provide current lawyers with advanced training or greater specialisation, or to update lawyers on recent developments in the law.

Legal education can take the form of a variety of programs, including: 
* Primary [[Law degree|degrees in law]], which may be studied at either undergraduate or graduate level depending on the country.
* Advanced academic degrees in law, such as [[Master of Laws|masters]] and doctoral degrees. 
* Practice or training courses, which prospective lawyers are required to pass in some countries before they may enter practice. 
* Applied or specialised law accreditation, which are less formal than degree programs but which provide specialised certification in particular areas. 
* [[Continuing legal education]], which do not lead to a qualification but provide practicing lawyers with updates on recent legal developments.

== History ==
Early Western legal education emerged in Republican Rome. Initially those desiring to be advocates would train in schools of [[rhetoric]]. Around the third century BC [[Tiberius Coruncanius]] began teaching law as a separate discipline.&lt;ref&gt;George Long article, p. 655 of ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anqiquities'' by William Smith. John Murray, London 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (''jurisprudentes''), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown. "legal education." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 4 March 2007  &lt;http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9106475&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students to attend consultations with citizens in which he provided legal advice. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oo-U8MDJVJAJ:www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon and ecclesiastical law were studied in universities in medieval Europe. However, institutions providing education in the domestic law of each country emerged later in the eighteen century.

In England, legal education emerged in the late thirteenth century through apprenticeships. The Inns of Court controlled admission to practice and also provided some legal training. English universities had taught Roman and canon law for some time, but formal degrees focused on the native common law did not emerge until the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Boon and Julian Webb, '[http://letr.org.uk/references/storage/U7RC3RR2/Boon%20%26%20Webb,%20back%20to%20the%20future.pdf Legal Education and Training in England and Wales: Back to the Future?]' (2008) 58(1) ''Journal of Legal Education'' 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of legal education ==

=== Primary degrees in law ===
[[File:Uppsala Gustavianum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Gustavianum]]'', The Swedish [[Uppsala University]] built 1622–1625 and now a museum, was one of the pioneers in formal legal education]]
In many countries, including most of those in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the principal law degree is an [[undergraduate degree]], usually known as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB). Graduates of such a program are eligible to become lawyers by passing the country's equivalent of a [[bar exam]]. In these countries, graduate law programs are advanced degrees which allow for more in-depth study or specialisation.

In the [[Law school in the United States|United States]], the primary law degree is a graduate degree known as the [[Juris Doctor]] (JD). Students may pursue such a degree only after completing an undergraduate degree, usually a [[bachelor's degree]]. The undergraduate degree can be in any field, though most American lawyers hold bachelor's degrees in the humanities and social sciences. American law schools are usually an autonomous entity within a larger university.

Primary degrees in law are offered by [[law school]]s, known in some countries as faculties of law. Law schools may have varying degrees of autonomy within a particular university or, in some countries, can be entirely independent of any other post-secondary educational institution.

=== Advanced degrees in law ===
Higher degrees allow for more advanced academic study. These include the Masters of Law (LLM) by coursework or research, and doctoral degrees such as the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or SJD.

Practitioners may undertake a Masters of Law by coursework to obtain greater specialisation in an area in which they practice. In many common law countries, a higher degree in law is common and expected for legal academics. In addition, incorporating practical skills is beneficial for practitioners seeking higher degrees to better prepare them in their respective legal area of practice.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3021333 SSRN 3021333].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, higher degrees in law are uncommon in the United States, even within the academy.

=== Practice or training courses ===
In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada and some states of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Law Society, [https://www.lawsociety.com.au/about/StudentHub/BecomingAdmitted/PLT/index.htm#1 'Practical Legal Training'], retrieved 8 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the final stages of vocational legal education required to qualify to practice law are carried out outside the university system. The requirements for qualification as a [[barrister]] or as a [[solicitor]] are covered in those articles.

=== Applied law programs or specialist accreditation ===
Legal education providers in some countries offer courses which lead to a certificate or accreditation in applied legal practice or a particular specialisation.

=== Continuing legal education ===
[[Continuing legal education]] (also known as continuing professional development) programs are informal seminars or short courses which provide legal practitioners with an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills throughout their legal career. In some jurisdictions, it is mandatory to undertake a certain amount of continuing legal education each year.

==Legal education in different countries==
{{Main article|Law school}}
===Australia===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Australia}}

In Australia most universities offer law as an undergraduate-entry course (LLB, 4 years), or combined degree course (e.g., BSc/LLB, BCom/LLB, BA/LLB, BE/LLB, 5–6 years). Some of these also offer a three-year postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) program. [[Bond University]] in Queensland runs three full semesters each year, teaching from mid-January to late December. This enables the Bond University Law Faculty to offer the LLB in the usual 8 semesters, but only 2{{fraction|2|3}} years. They also offer a JD in two years. The [[University of Technology, Sydney]] will from 2010 offer a 2-year accelerated JD program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111235355/http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html |date=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[University of Melbourne]] introduced the [[Melbourne Model]], whereby Law is only available as a graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor's degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible.&lt;ref name="law.harvard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Program on the Legal Profession Comparative Analyses of Legal Education, Law Firms, and Law and Legal Procedure|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/comparative_analyses.php|publisher=Law.harvard.edu|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor's degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2–3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor's degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for [[graduate entry|graduate-entry]] into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Australian Catholic University]], [[Australian National University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Bond University]], [[Macquarie Law School|Macquarie]], [[Monash University Faculty of Law|Monash]], [[Deakin University School of Law|Deakin]], [[UNSW Faculty of Law|UNSW]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[Adelaide Law School|Adelaide]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]], [[Sydney Law School|Sydney]], [[Melbourne University Law School|Melbourne]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], the [[TC Beirne School of Law|University of Queensland]], the [[University of Western Australia]] and the [[University of Canberra]].

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Canada}}

The professional law degree in Canada is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), for [[common law]] jurisdictions, and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|Bachelor of Laws, Licentiate of Law or Bachelor of Civil Law]] for Quebec, a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction. Admittance to an LL.B. or J.D. program requires at least two years of [[undergraduate]] education, although, a completed undergraduate degree is usually required. In practice, the vast majority of those who are admitted have already earned at least an undergraduate [[Bachelor's degree|(bachelor's) degree]]. The change in academic [[nomenclature]] redesignating the common law degree as a J.D. rather than an LL.B., currently completed or under consideration at a number of Canadian schools, has not affected the level of instruction—because it is the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawiscool.com/2007/11/13/to-jd-or-not-to-jd/ To JD or Not JD — Law is Cool], November 13, 2007.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main article|Legal education in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong law can be studied as a four-year undergraduate degree [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), a two-year postgraduate degree (Juris Doctor), or the [[Common Professional Examination]] conversion course for non-law graduates. One must then pass the one-year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (PCLL) currently offered at the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU), [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and [[City University of Hong Kong]], before starting vocational training: a year's [[pupillage]] for [[barrister]]s or a two-year [[training contract]] for [[solicitor]]s.

The move to a four-year LLB was recent and, in the case of HKU, was aimed at shifting some of the more theoretical aspects of the HKU PCLL into the LLB, leaving more room for practical instruction.

===India===
{{Main article|Legal education in India}}
{{See also|Autonomous law schools in India|Common Law Admission Test|List of law schools in India}}

The [[Bar Council of India]] prescribes and supervises standard of legal education in India. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961], which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Various regional universities or specialised national law universities offer Law graduate degrees through various law schools.

In India law can be studied, as LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law), a three-year graduate degree after completion of [[Bachelor's degree]]. Alternatively after standard 12 one can join an integrated five-year law course which provides option to avail B.A. LL.B. or B.B.A. LLB. or B.Sc. LL.B. In India applied legal education for specific branches of law is also offered such as, Business law, Human resource and Labour laws, Property laws, Family laws, Human rights &amp; Legal awareness, Taxation law and many more.

=== Italy and France ===
Law in Italy and France is studied in a jurisprudence school which is an entity within a larger university. Legal education can be started immediately after obtained a Diploma. Italian and French law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. As a consequence, law schools are required to admit anyone holding the baccalaureate. However, the failure rate is extremely high (up to 70%) during the first two years of the "licenza in diritto". There are no vast disparities in the quality of Southern European law schools. Many schools focus on their respective city and region.

The law school program is divided following the European standards for university studies ([[Bologna process]]):
* first a license of law program (''Licence de droit''): three-year period
* Then a Master of law program (''Master de droit''): two-year period
* Ph.D. in Law (''Doctorat en droit''): three-year period (often more).

The first year of the master program (M1) is specialized : public law, private law, business law, European and international law, etc.

The second year of the master of law program (M2) can be work-oriented or research oriented (the students write a substantial thesis and can apply to doctoral programs, e.g., a PhD in Law).

The second year is competitive (entry is based on the student's grades and overall score and on extracurricular activities) and generally more specialized (IP law, contract law, civil liberties, etc.).

Students must pass a specific examination to enter bar school (CRFPA, école du barreau). They must successfully finish the first year of a Master of law (M1 or maitrise de droit) to be able to attend.

If they succeed, then after 18 months (school, practical aspects, ethics and internship) they then take the CAPA exam and diploma(Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat). Successful students also take the Oath in order to practice law.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice opened the [[University of Tokyo]] Faculty of Law in 1877 (changed to Imperial University in 1886). To matriculate to the University of Tokyo, students had to finish ten to fifteen years of compulsory education; acceptance was therefore available to only a small elite. The law program produced politically-dependable graduates to fill fast-track administrative positions in government, also known as high civil servants (koto bunkan), and to serve as judges and prosecutors.

Private law schools opened around 1880. These lacked the government funding given to the University of Tokyo, so the quality of education there lagged behind. Students only had to pass an examination to matriculate to private law schools, so many of them had not completed middle school. The private law schools produced a large portion of private attorneys because their graduates were often ineligible to apply for government positions.

The Imperial University Faculty of Law was given supervisory authority over many private law schools in 1887; by the 1920s, it promulgated a legal curriculum comprising six basic codes: Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Criminal Procedure. The same basic structure survived in Japanese legal education to the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|title=Legal Education and the Reproduction of the Elite in Japan, 1 Asian-Pac. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 2|year=1999|publisher=Hawaii.edu|author=Setsuo Miyazawa|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081700/http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the implementation of the "law school system" in 2004, the legal education system was driven more by examinations than by formal schooling. The passage rate for the bar exam was historically around three percent, and nearly all those who sat for the exam took it several times. A number of specialized "cram schools" trained prospective lawyers for the exam, and these schools remain prevalent today. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers were required to train for 16 months at the Legal Research and Training Institute of the [[Supreme Court of Japan]]. The training period has traditionally been devoted to litigation practice and virtually no training is given for other aspects of legal practice, e.g., contract drafting, [[legal research]]. During this period, the most "capable trainees" are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed a law allowing for the creation of graduate level law school {{nihongo|law schools|法科大学院|hōka daigakuin}} that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from "elite" Japanese universities such as the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]] or [[Hitotsubashi University]]. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40–50% passage rate which is capped by a numerical quota. Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

A number of other law-related professions exist in Japan, such as patent agents (''[[benrishi]]''), tax accountants (''[[zeirishi]]''), [[scrivener]]s, etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination. Attorneys ("bengoshi"), being qualified to practice any law, can automatically be qualified as patent agents and tax accountants with no additional examination, but not vice versa.

=== Korea ===
{{Main article|Law school in Korea}}

Legal education in Korea is driven by examination. The profession of barristers, is highly regulated, and the pass rate for the bar exam is around five percent. Prospective attorneys who do pass the exam usually take it two or three times before passing it, and a number of specialized "private educational institutes" exist for prospective lawyers. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers undergo a two-year training period at the [[Judicial Research and Training Institute]] of the [[Supreme Court of Korea]]. During this period, the most capable trainees are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2007, the Korean government passed a law allowing for the creation of three-year law schools (''법학전문대학원''). According to the new law, the old system of selecting lawyers by examination will be phased out by 2013 and the U.S.-style law schools will be the sole route to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

In February 2008, the Ministry of Education of Korea selected 25 universities to open law schools. The total enrollment for all law schools is capped at 2,000, which is a source of contention between the powerful Korea Bar Association, and citizen groups and school administrators. There is an uproar among the schools which failed to get the government's approval and even among the schools that did get the approval, there is dissatisfaction due to an extremely low enrollment number. Several law schools are permitted to enroll 40 students per year, which is far below the financially sustainable number. Beginning in 2012, passage of the Lawyer Admission Test (which is distinct from the old bar exam) will be required for qualification to practice.

A number of other legal professions exist in Korea, such as patent attorneys (''변리사''), tax attorneys (''세무사''), [[solicitor]]s(''법무사''), etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|Legal education in Malaysia}}
As a Commonwealth country, the Malaysian legal education system is rooted from the United Kingdom. Legal qualifications offered by the local law faculties require students to have a pre-university qualification such as the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Malaysian Higher School Certificate]], [[A-Level]], [[International Baccalaureate]], Foundation Course or a Diploma. Generally, the law degree programmes in Malaysia consist of civil law subjects, but there are institutions such as The National University of Malaysia, [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin]] that include [[Sharia]] or Islamic law courses as requirements for admission and graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iium.edu.my/aikol/programmes-courses/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-law-llb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuha.unisza.edu.my/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072652/http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian law graduates from universities in the UK, Australia or New Zealand are allowed to practice law in Malaysia. However, they are required to obtain a Certificate of Legal Practice in Laws of Malaysia.

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the Philippines}}
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.
Legal education in the Philippines is regulated and supervised by the LEGAL EDUCATION BOARD, a statutorily created independent Body chaired by a retired member of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals.  Its first chairman is Justice Hilarion Aquino.  Sitting as members of the Board are a representative of the law professors, a representative of the law deans and a representative of the Commission on Higher Education.  The membership of a student representative has been subject to continuing debate and resistance on the part of law schools.
Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examinations, administered by the Supreme Court during the month of September every year.

In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete either of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. The degrees Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Legal Studies are available in only a handful of Philippine universities and colleges, among these San Beda College Graduate School of Law, the University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University.  The Doctor of Civil Law degree (DCL) is offered only by the University of Santo Tomas and the Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) degree is offered by the San Beda College Graduate School of Law.  Graduate programs in law are also regulated by the Legal Education Board

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
[[Law degree]] – jurist (often compared to an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], but in fact equivalent to the degree of Specialist specific to the Soviet educational system) is awarded in Russia and [[Ukraine]] after 5 years of study at a university. Jurist degree may also be awarded in a shorter period of time if a law student has already completed Bachelor or Specialist degree in another field of studies or has previously earned a basic law degree (comparable to Paralegal, an associate degree in U.S.) from a specialized law college. Bachelor jurist degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)) may be earned concurrently with another bachelor's or master's degree in some universities (comparable to a double-major). Note that this fused, one-degree (Specialist) educational scheme has coexisted with the two-degree (bachelor's – master's) scheme since Russia and Ukraine launched their higher education reforms to bring the domestic educational systems in closer compliance with the [[Bologna accords]]. See also [[academic degree]]. The latest educational reforms created new system where a four-year law program is offered at the universities for earning bachelor's degree, and a five-year law program is offered for master's degree. The degree of Specialist is no longer awarded and is renamed into master's degree.

=== Serbia ===
{{See also|History of legal education in Serbia|University of Belgrade Faculty of Law}}

To become a lawyer in Serbia, students must graduate from an accredited faculty of law. Studies last for five years (ten semesters) in accordance to the [[Bologna process|Bologna Convention]]. To become a student of the faculty of law, a candidate must pass the admission test. Students are divided into full-time students and part-time students. The practical training for students is organized at courts of law, and local and international [[moot court]] competitions. A lawyer must pass the national bar examination to become an attorney, a judge, or a [[prosecutor]].

Since 1998, LL.B. programmes may be entered directly at the [[undergraduate]] level; at the same time, the LLB. continues to be offered [[postgraduate]] and may then be accelerated dependent on the [[bachelor's degree]]. The programme lasts between two and four years correspondingly&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726092702/http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm |date=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Legal education#Australia|Australia, above]]).  See [[Bachelor of Laws #South Africa]].

Although not formally required for specialised practice, further training, e.g. [[Master of Science in Taxation|in tax]], is usually via [[postgraduate diploma]]s or focused, coursework-based [[LL.M.]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llm-guide.com/south-africa |title=Master of Laws (LL.M.)

See [[Master of Laws #South Africa]]; [[Doctor of Law #South Africa]].

Historically, the B.Proc. and B.Juris were the legal degrees offered at the undergraduate level. The four-year BProc qualified one to practice as an attorney, or become a prosecutor or [[magistrate]] in the [[South African Law#Court System in South Africa|lower courts]], but did not allow for admission as an advocate. The three-year B.Juris was the basic requirement for prosecutors and magistrates in the lower courts, but on its own, did not qualify one to practice as an attorney. Both offered admission to the LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Law_DoL_Report.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For admission as an attorney, one serves "[[Articled clerk|articles]]" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for two years, and then writes a "board exam" set by the relevant [http://www.lssa.org.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.page&amp;PageID=6402073 provincial Law Society]. See [[Attorneys in South Africa]]. The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing [[community service]].

Attorneys may additionally qualify as [[Notary public|Notaries]] and [[Conveyancer]]s, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssalead.org.za/upload/CONVEYANCING%20COURSE%20AND%20NOTARIAL%20PRACTICE%20COURSE%202012%20v7.pdf |title=Courses in Conveyancing and Notarial Practice |publisher=Lssalead.org.za |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys – see [[Patent attorney #South Africa]].

The requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to become members of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination. On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate "of proven experience and skill" with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a [[Senior Counsel]] (SC; also referred to as a "silk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |title=A Career at the Bar in South Africa – The General Council of the Bar (GCB) |publisher=Sabar.co.za |date=1998-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Advocates in South Africa]].

=== South American countries ===
{{Main article|Law in South America}}
The law of South America is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

=== Sri Lanka ===
{{main|Legal education in Sri Lanka}}
In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be 'admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]]. To be admitted to the bar a law student must complete law exams held by the [[Sri Lanka Law College]] and undergo a six-month period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer. There are two routes taken by students:

# Those who have gained a law degree, an [[LL.B.]] (which is 3–4 years long in Sri Lankan State Universities of [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Jaffna]], [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] and [[University of Peradeniya]]) are given direct entry to undertake law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College.
# Those who don't hold a law degree, could gain entrance to the Sri Lanka Law College via a competitive entrance exam to study law and prepare for the law exams.

Both groups of students must undergo a period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer who has at least 8 years of practicing experience. To become a judge one must be admitted as an Attorney-at-Law.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}
In England and Wales, law can be studied as an undergraduate degree or in a [[Graduate Diploma in Law]] where students complete the Common Professional Examination. After obtaining the degree which is necessary to complete certain vocational courses and to serve a period of on the job training before one is able to qualify to practice as a [[barrister]], [[legal executive]], or [[solicitor]]. [[Bar Professional Training Course]] is regarded as one of the hardest degrees and presently it is the most expensive law-related degree.

===United States===
[[File:WilliamandMaryLawSchoolStatue.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[William &amp; Mary School of Law]], established in 1779, is the oldest law school in the USA]]
{{Main article|Legal education in the United States|Law school in the United States}}
{{See also|Law School Admission Council}}

The education of lawyers in the United States is generally undertaken through a [[law school]] program, although in some states (such as California and Virginia) applicants who have not attended law school may qualify to take the bar exam.&lt;ref&gt; http://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readerrules.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Legal education in the United States normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 3 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a state's bar exam)
* Legal practice

In the United States,in most cases, the degree awarded by American law schools is the [[Doctor of Jurisprudence]] or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), a [[Doctoral]] degree, the pursuit of which students undertake only after having completed an undergraduate degree in some other field (usually a [[bachelor's degree]]). The law school program is considered to be a [[professional school]] program and upon graduation you receive the distinct title of Doctor (although most states strictly regulate the ability of attorneys to style themselves "doctor").

Research degrees that are awarded include the [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degrees (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are post-undergraduate and research and academic-based level degrees. In the U.S. the [[Legum Doctor]] (LL.D.) is only awarded as an honorary degree.

A number of law students apply for an optional [[Law clerk#United States|judicial clerkship]] (less than 10% end up in such position), to be taken after law school and before legal practice. Clerkships usually last one year with appellate courts, but trial level courts (including federal district court) are increasingly moving towards two-year clerkships.

Once a student has graduated from law school, he or she is expected to pursue [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in order to practice. Requirements for membership in the [[bar association|bar]] vary across the United States. In almost every state, the only way to be admitted to the bar is to pass a (usually multi-day) written examination. Once admitted, most States require attorneys to must meet certain [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) requirements.

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Such a degree is not required to enter a J.D. program.

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a J.D., often seek to obtain a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) (or other degrees similar to the LL.M., such as the Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.) and Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.)).

'''The Mathematical Institute''' is the [[mathematics]] department at the [[University of Oxford]], England. It forms one of the twelve departments of the [[Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division]] in the University. The department is located between [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] and [[Green Templeton College, Oxford|Green Templeton College]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], next to the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]].

==Overview==
The Oxford Mathematical Institute includes both pure and applied mathematics (Statistics is a separate department) and is one of the largest and most respected mathematics departments in the UK with about 100 faculty members, and was ranked as the top mathematics department in the UK in the 2014 UK Research Evaluation Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/Attachments/2014/12/17/g/o/l/sub-14-01.pdf Research Excellence Framework 2014 ranking]&lt;/ref&gt; Research at the Mathematical Institute covers all branches of mathematical sciences ranging from, for example, algebra, number theory, and geometry to the application of mathematics to a wide range of fields including industry, finance, climate modelling, networks and the brain. It has over 850 undergraduates, over 250 postgraduates and around 150 MSc students. 

==History==
[[File:Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.jpg|thumb|Former Mathematical Institute building, built in 1966.]]
The first Mathematical Institute was built in 1966 and was located at the northern end of [[St Giles' Street, Oxford|St Giles']] near the junction with [[Banbury Road]] in central north [[Oxford]]. The building of an institute was originally proposed by [[G.H. Hardy]] at least 30 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/OxfordPeople.html The British Society for the History of Mathematics Gazetteer], [[University of Warwick]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Institute had two annexes: one in Dartington House, on [[Little Clarendon Street]], and the other in the Gibson Building, on the site of the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about-us About], Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of [[Michaelmas term]] 2013 Oxford Mathematics has been unified and is now housed in the purpose-built [[Andrew Wiles]] Building in the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in [[North Oxford]], near the original Radcliffe Infirmary. Wiles, the Regius Professor of Mathematics at the university, is known for proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].&lt;ref name="Short History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.maths.ox.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/OxfordMathematics_ROQ_leaflet.pdf|title=The Andrew Wiles Builkding - a Short History|publisher=maths.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12735">'''Minimum message length''' (MML) is a formal [[information theory]] restatement of [[Occam's Razor]]: even when models are equal in goodness of fit accuracy to the observed data, the one generating the shortest overall message is more likely to be correct (where the message consists of a statement of the model, followed by a statement of data encoded concisely using that model). MML was invented by [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Chris Wallace]], first appearing in the seminal paper "An information measure for classification" {{harvcoltxt|Wallace|Boulton|1968}}.

MML is intended not just as a theoretical construct, but as a technique that may be deployed in practice. It differs from the related concept of [[Kolmogorov complexity]] in that it does not require use of a [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] language to model data.  The relation between Strict MML (SMML) and [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is outlined in {{harvcoltxt|Wallace|Dowe|1999}}. Further, a variety of mathematical approximations to "Strict" MML can be used{{snd}} see, e.g., [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/mml/toc.pdf Chapters 4 and 5] of {{harvnb|Wallace (posthumous)|2005}}.

==Definition==
[[Claude E. Shannon|Shannon]]'s ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'' (1949) states that in an optimal code, the message length (in binary) of an event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{length}(E)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has probability &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{length}(E) = -\log_2(P(E))&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Bayes's theorem]] states that the probability of a (variable) hypothesis &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; given fixed evidence &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;P(E|H) P(H)&lt;/math&gt;, which, by the definition of [[conditional probability]], is equal to &lt;math&gt;P(H \land E)&lt;/math&gt;. We want the model (hypothesis) with the highest such [[posterior probability]]. Suppose we encode a message which represents (describes) both model and data jointly. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{length}(H \land E) = -\log_2(P(H \land E))&lt;/math&gt;, the most probable model will have the shortest such message. The message breaks into two parts: &lt;math&gt;-\log_2(P(H \land E)) = -\log_2(P(H)) + -\log_2(P(E|H))&lt;/math&gt;. The first part encodes the model itself. The second part contains information (e.g., values of parameters, or initial conditions, etc.) that, when processed by the model, outputs the observed data.

MML naturally and precisely trades model complexity for goodness of fit. A more complicated model takes longer to state (longer first part) but probably fits the data better (shorter second part).  So, an MML metric won't choose a complicated model unless that model pays for itself.

==Continuous-valued parameters==
One reason why a model might be longer would be simply because its various parameters are stated to greater precision, thus requiring transmission of more digits. Much of the power of MML derives from its handling of how accurately to state parameters in a model, and a variety of approximations that make this feasible in practice. This allows it to usefully compare, say, a model with many parameters imprecisely stated against a model with fewer parameters more accurately stated.

==Key features of MML==
* MML can be used to compare models of different structure. For example, its earliest application was in finding [[mixture model]]s with the optimal number of classes. Adding extra classes to a mixture model will always allow the data to be fitted to greater accuracy, but according to MML this must be weighed against the extra bits required to encode the parameters defining those classes. 
* MML is a method of [[Bayesian model comparison]]. It gives every model a score.
* MML is scale-invariant and statistically invariant. Unlike many Bayesian selection methods, MML doesn't care if you change from measuring length to volume or from Cartesian co-ordinates to polar co-ordinates.
* MML is statistically consistent.  For problems like the [[#{{harvid|Dowe|Wallace|1997}}|Neyman-Scott]] (1948) problem or factor analysis where the amount of data per parameter is bounded above, MML can estimate all parameters with [[statistical consistency]].
* MML accounts for the precision of measurement. It uses the [[Fisher information]] (in the Wallace-Freeman 1987 approximation, or other hyper-volumes in [[#{{harvid|Wallace (posthumous)|2005}}|other approximations]]) to optimally discretize continuous parameters. Therefore the posterior is always a probability, not a probability density.
* MML has been in use since 1968. MML coding schemes have been developed for several distributions, and many kinds of machine learners including unsupervised classification, decision trees and graphs, DNA sequences, [[Bayesian network]]s, neural networks (one-layer only so far), image compression, image and function segmentation, etc.

'''NABERS''', the '''National Australian Built Environment Rating System''', is an initiative by the government of Australia to measure and compare the [[Environmentally friendly|environmental performance]] of [[Global warming in Australia|Australian]] buildings and tenancies. There are NABERS rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=21&amp;template=2&amp;id=210&amp;include=Dashboard.htm commercial office buildings] to measure [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[water efficiency]], [[Waste|waste efficiency]] and [[Building science|indoor environment quality]]. There are also energy/greenhouse and water rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=22&amp;template=2&amp;id=211&amp;include=Dashboard.htm hotels], [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=23&amp;template=2&amp;id=212&amp;include=Dashboard.htm shopping centres] and [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=27&amp;template=2&amp;id=216&amp;include=Dashboard.htm data centres].

== Accredited Assessors ==
A key feature of the initiative is the use of independent 'Accredited Assessors' to conduct ratings. Assessors are required to attend training, pass an exam and complete two supervised assessments before they receive full accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is an Accredited Assessor?|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=30&amp;template=3&amp;include=AccreditAssessor.htm&amp;side=AssessorTertiary.htm|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no formal pre-requisites to attend the training, most Assessors have experience in the building services, property or energy management industries. Building owners and tenants can use the online 'self-assessment' tool, however they cannot promote these results. Only ratings that have been certified by the NABERS National Administrator can be promoted using the NABERS [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trademark trademark].

== Calculating a rating ==
The vision statement of NABERS is 'To support a more [[sustainable]] [[built environment]] through a relevant, reliable and practical measure of [[building performance]]'.

=== Offices ===
The NABERS tools attempt to provide an [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] [[measurement]] of how [[Efficiency|efficiently]] building owners and tenants are providing their services ''without penalising them for factors that are beyond their control''. 

For example if the primary service that an [[Office|office building]] owner provides is [[Safety|safe]], [[Light|lit]] and [[comfortable]] office space the NABERS Energy for offices tool would consider how much space is being used, how much energy is being used to supply services to the space, and then statistically adjusts for factors like the climate - which will influence [[Energy conservation|how much energy is used for heating and cooling]].

To obtain a NABERS Energy for offices rating, consumption data for the building (such as electricity and gas bills) is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about a number of other aspects of the building such as its size, hours of occupation, climate location and density of occupation. Data requirements are set out in a document called [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0 'The NABERS Energy and Water for Offices Rules for Collecting and Using Data v.3.0']. This data is then input into the NABERS rating calculator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rating calculator – NABERS|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/RatingCalculator.aspx?module=40|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which statistically adjusts for these factors so that the building can have its consumption fairly [[Benchmarking|benchmarked]] against its peers. The result of this calculation is a star rating on a six star scale, where zero is very poor performance and six is market leading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy and Water for offices - Rules for collecting and using data|date = February 2013|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = www.nabers.gov.au|publisher = NABERS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water ====
The procedure for an office water rating is similar to conducting an office energy rating. The main differences are that it is water rather than energy bills that are used, and some data such as the hours of operation are not required. Unlike office energy ratings, which can either be for the base building, tenancies or whole building, office water ratings are only available for whole buildings.

=== Data centres ===

==== Energy ====
Like NABERS for offices, NABERS Energy for [[Data center|data centres]] has three distinct rating types to reflect the different interests and responsibilities from data centres owners, operators and tenants - Infrastructure (co-location owner), Whole Facility (data centre owner) and IT Equipment (data centre tenant) ratings. The tool is designed to rate the majority of data centres in Australia, provide a direct comparison with other rateable data centres, and allow an individual data centre to measure and compare performance over time.

The NABERS Data Centre IT Equipment Rating is designed for organisations that control and manage their own [[IT]] equipment ([[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Computer Storage|storage]] and [[networking devices]]). The IT Equipment rating measures feastures that are closely related to the primary functions of a data centre ([[Computer performance|processing]], [[Computer data storage|storage]] and [[Computer network|networking]]) and that all data centres provide, regardless of how they provide them. NABERS uses two IT equipment metrics:
* [[Processing power|Processing capacity]]: number of server cores × clock speed in gigahertz (GHz) and
* [[Computer data storage|Storage capacity]] (total unformatted storage capacity in [[terabytes]]).
The NABERS performance benchmark model predicts the industry median [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for a given amount of data centre processing and storage capacity. This means that if a data centre consumes more energy than the benchmark model predicts, the site is less energy efficient than the industry median (set at 3 stars), while if it consumes less energy it is more efficient than the median. 
To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres IT Equipment rating, [[Energy in Australia|energy consumption]] data for the IT equipment over a 28- to 40-day period is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about the total unformatted storage capacity and total processing capacity as above.

The Infrastructure Rating measures the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in delivering support services to the IT equipment, using the widely accepted industry [[Power usage effectiveness|Power Usage Effectiveness]] (PUE) ratio that is converted into kilogram of emissions with some modification for climate and shared cooling services. To obtain an infrastructure rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for IT equipment and infrastructure services is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the climate location of the data centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=3&amp;id=85&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy for data centres - Rules for collecting and using data|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whole Facility rating measures the energy efficiency of the whole data centre by assessing the processing and storage capacity and the industry median energy efficiency for infrastructure services compared with the overall energy consumption of the data centre. It is a combination of both the IT Equipment and Infrastructure rating benchmarks To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres Whole Facility rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for the data centre is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the processing and storage capacity and climate location of the data centre.

==Comparison to other building rating systems==
There are a number of building environmental certification systems across the world, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]], [[BREEAM|BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)]] and [[Display Energy Certificate|Display Energy Certificates (DECs)]]. The key features of NABERS as a system are that it is based on performance rather than design, assessments are carried out by third party 'Accredited Assessors', it is based on third party verifiable data (such as utility bills), ratings undergo government quality assurance checks and it distinguishes between the environmental impact of a building's shared services and its tenancies. While other rating systems across the world share some of these features, none share all of them.

== Program Success ==
NABERS Energy for offices is considered by many to have been successful, as over 82% of the Australian national office market has now been rated with either a base building or whole building rating. Factors behind the success of the tool are largely attributed to its ability to differentiate between the base building and tenants energy end uses and strong government support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.buildingrating.org/graphic/australias-nabers-energy-rating-label|title = Australia's NABERS Energy Rating Label|date = 2014-05-01|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = Building Rating|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far fewer tenancy energy ratings have been conducted however and there has also been far less uptake of the other tools.

== Use in Australian Energy Programs &amp; Policy ==
While NABERS Energy is a voluntary rating scheme for buildings, its success has been at least partly driven by its extensive use in energy initiatives by government and industry throughout Australia.  Some programs include:

* '''[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/government/140567NSWGREP.pdf The NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)]:''' The most recent iteration of a series of NSW government procurement policies that set out NABERS targets in government leasing criteria. In the GREP, government tenants require a building to have a 4.5 star NABERS rating. It also states a 4.5 star energy rating as a minimum criteria for government data centres. Similar policies are in place other states and territories, as well as the Australian government (the 'Energy Efficiency in Government Operations' policy).
* '''[http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction-fund Emissions Reduction Fund]:''' the centrepiece of Australia's carbon abatement strategy, to begin operating in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emissions Reduction Fund to begin allocating money next year|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-02/emissions-reduction-fund-direct-action-begin-allocating-money/5860762|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2016-01-09|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NABERS Energy is used in the commercial buildings methodology, to calculate and ensure the carbon abatement achieved by project proponents is real &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emissions Reduction Fund methods|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction-fund/methods|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09|language = en|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[http://www.ess.nsw.gov.au/Home Energy Savings Scheme (ESS)]:''' a New South Wales state energy program where commercial buildings can obtain Energy Saving Certificates (ESC) for energy efficiency projects, which can be sold to the market.  A NABERS Energy ratings are used to demonstrate the energy savings achieved by the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Energy Savings Scheme - Commercial buildings (NABERS)|url = http://www.ess.nsw.gov.au/Projects_and_equipment/Commercial_buildings_NABERS|website = www.ess.nsw.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[http://www.business.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/closed-programs/gbf/Pages/default.aspx Green Building Fund]:''' a former Australian Government program, where commercial buildings could obtain up to 50% of capital funding for energy efficiency projects.  The program used NABERS Energy ratings to ensure the savings effectively occurred, as well as to calculate the total amount of energy and emissions saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Green Building Fund (GBF)|url = http://www.business.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/closed-programs/gbf/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.business.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09|language = en|first = c=AU;o=Australian Government;ou=Department of Industry, Innovation and|last = Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[http://www.cityswitch.net.au/ City Switch]:''' an initiative that supports commercial office tenants to improve energy efficiency, run by a coalition of local councils throughout Australia.  City Switch uses NABERS Energy as its key indicator of energy performance, and provides assistance to its members to achieve a rating of 4 stars or higher &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CitySwitch NABERS Energy financial assistance|url = http://www.cityswitch.net.au/Nabers/Howmuchdoesitcost/CitySwitchNABERSEnergyGrantprogram.aspx|website = www.cityswitch.net.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Australian Legislation ==

* '''[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010A00067 The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010]:''' Australian government legislation that requires owners of office buildings to disclose the energy efficiency of the building to prospect tenants or buyers. Known operationally as the Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) program, a certified NABERS Energy rating is the main energy efficiency indicator required of building owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NABERS Energy for Offices star ratings {{!}} CBD - Commercial Building Disclosure|url = http://www.cbd.gov.au/get-and-use-a-rating/nabers-energy-for-offices-star-ratings|website = www.cbd.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09|first = CBD, enquiries@climatechange.gov.au, Tel: 02 6159|last = 7000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use Internationally ==

* '''[http://www.nabersnz.govt.nz/ NABERSNZ]:''' The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) in New Zealand licensed NABERS in 2013 to create NABERSNZ.
* '''[https://www.gresb.com/ The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)]:''' The GRESB is a global standard for portfolio-level sustainability assessment in real estate.The GRESB benchmark addresses issues including corporate sustainability strategy, policies and objectives, environmental performance monitoring, and the use of high-quality voluntary rating tools such as NABERS.

Since its establishment in 1958, NASA has conducted research on a range range of topics. Because of its unique structure, work happens at various 'centers of excellence' and different research areas are concentrated in those centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/plans/99nsp/9.html|title=3|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the technology, hardware and expertise needed, research may be conducted across a range of centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/strahand/roles.htm|title=NASA Strategic Management Handbook|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the research conducted by the United States space agency include:

A variety of large-scale medical studies are being conducted in space by the [[National Space Biomedical Research Institute]] (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study, in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. Usually there is no physician on board the International Space Station, and [[Medical treatment during spaceflight|diagnosis of medical conditions]] is challenging. Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including [[decompression sickness]], barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, [[Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight|sleep disturbances]], and radiation injury. [[Ultrasound]] offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |title=NASA—Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |publisher=NASA |date=July 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rao |first1=S |last2=Van Holsbeeck |first2=L|last3=Musial|first3=JL|last4=Parker|first4=A|last5=Bouffard|first5=JA|last6=Bridge|first6=P|last7=Jackson|first7=M|last8=Dulchavsky|first8=SA|title=A pilot study of comprehensive ultrasound education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine: a pioneer year review|journal=Journal of ultrasound in medicine|volume=27|issue=5|pages=745–9|date=2008|pmid=18424650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fincke|first1=E.

NASA has started Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation Program as an agency-wide program directed to prevent pollution and reduce energy and water utilization. It helps to ensure that NASA meets its federal stewardship responsibilities for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oim.hq.nasa.gov/oia/emd/energy.html|title=Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation|accessdate=May 1, 2008|publisher=NASA|date=2007|author=Tina Norwood|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117130103/http://oim.hq.nasa.gov/oia/emd/energy.html |archivedate= January 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earth science==
[[File:ISS-38 Hawaiian Island chain.jpg|thumb|right|Earth from the International Space Station]]

Understanding of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment (such as [[global warming]]) is the main objective of NASA's [[Earth science]]. NASA currently has more than a dozen Earth science spacecraft/instruments in orbit studying all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere, [[biosphere]], [[cryosphere]]), with several more planned for launch in the next few years.&lt;ref name="Climate Change: NASA's Role"&gt;{{cite news |title= Taking a global perspective on Earth's climate|publisher=Global Climate Change: NASA's Eyes on the Earth |url= https://climate.nasa.gov/NasaRole/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230304/https://climate.nasa.gov/NasaRole/ |archivedate= July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth science research program was created and funded in the 1980s under the administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W.

===Ozone depletion===
In 1975, NASA was directed by legislation to research and monitor the upper atmosphere.

In [[computing]], '''NaN''', standing for '''not a number''', is a numeric [[data type]] value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in [[floating point|floating-point]] calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like [[Infinity|infinities]].

Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed ''quiet NaNs'' and ''signaling NaNs''.  Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and [[symbolic computation]] or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic.  For example, [[Indeterminate form|0/0]] is undefined as a [[real number]], and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is [[imaginary number|imaginary]], and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.&lt;ref name=idl&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=Kenneth|date=2006|title=An introduction to programming with IDL: Interactive Data Language|publisher=Academic Press|page=26|isbn=978-0-12-088559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Press|first1=William H.|last2=Teukolsky|first2=Saul A.|last3=Vetterling|first3=William T.|last4=Flannery|first4=Brian P.|date=2007|title=Numerical recipes: the art of scientific computing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-88068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Floating point ==
{{Floating-point}}
In floating-point calculations, NaN is not the same as [[Extended real number line|infinity]], although both are typically handled as special cases in floating-point representations of real numbers as well as in floating-point operations.  An invalid operation is also not the same as an [[arithmetic overflow]] (which might return an infinity) or an [[arithmetic underflow]] (which would return the smallest [[normal number (computing)|normal number]], a [[denormal number]], or [[0 (number)|zero]]).

[[IEEE 754]] NaNs are represented with the exponent field filled with ones (like infinity values), and some non-zero number in the [[significand]] (to make them distinct from infinity values); this representation allows the definition of multiple distinct NaN values, depending on which bits are set in the significand, but also on the value of the leading sign bit (but applications are not required to provide distinct semantics for those distinct NaN values).

For example, a bit-wise [[IEEE floating-point]] standard single precision (32-bit) NaN would be: &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap;"&gt;s111 1111 1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx&lt;/span&gt; where ''s'' is the sign (most often ignored in applications) and the ''x'' sequence represents a non-zero number (the value zero encodes infinities). The first bit from ''x'' is used to determine the type of NaN: "quiet NaN" or "signaling NaN". The remaining bits encode a ''payload'' (most often ignored in applications).

Floating-point operations other than ordered comparisons normally propagate a quiet NaN (''qNaN''). Most floating-point operations on a signaling NaN (''sNaN'') signal the invalid operation exception, the default exception action is then the same as for qNaN operands and they produce a qNaN if producing a floating-point result.

The propagation of quiet NaNs through arithmetic operations allows errors to be detected at the end of a sequence of operations without extensive testing during intermediate stages. However, note that depending on the language and the function, NaNs can silently be removed in expressions that would give a constant result for all other floating-point values e.g. NaN^0, which may be defined as 1, so in general a later test for a set ''invalid'' flag is needed to detect all cases where NaNs are introduced &lt;ref name=LectureNotes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF|title=Lecture Notes on the Status of IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic| author=William Kahan |date=1 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Function definition|Function definition]] below for further details).

In section 6.2 of the current [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]] standard there are two anomalous functions (the ''maxnum'' and ''minnum'' functions that return the maximum of two operands that are expected to be numbers) that favor numbers&amp;nbsp;— if just one of the operands is a NaN then the value of the other operand is returned. For the next revision of the IEEE 754 standard, it is planned to replace these functions as they are not [[associative property|associative]] (when a signaling NaN appears in an operand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://754r.ucbtest.org/minutes/2017-05-19-minutes.txt|title=754R Minutes|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with NaN ===
A comparison with a NaN always returns an ''unordered result'' even when comparing with itself. The comparison predicates are either signaling or non-signaling on quiet NaN operands; the signaling versions signal the invalid operation exception for such comparisons. The equality and inequality predicates are non-signaling so ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' returning false can be used to test if ''x'' is a quiet NaN. The other standard comparison predicates are all signaling if they receive a NaN operand, the standard also provides non-signaling versions of these other predicates. The predicate ''isNaN(x)'' determines if a value is a NaN and never signals an exception, even if ''x'' is a signaling NaN.

=== Operations generating NaN ===

There are three kinds of operations that can return NaN:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.39.2736|author=David Goldberg|title= What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Most operations with a NaN as at least one operand.
* [[Indeterminate forms]]:
** The divisions {{math|(±0) / (±0)}} and {{math|(±∞) / (±∞)}}.
** The multiplications {{math|(±0) × (±∞)}} and {{math|(±∞) × (±0)}}.
** Remainder {{math|''x'' % ''y''}} when {{math|''x''}} is an infinity or {{math|''y''}} is zero.
** The additions {{math|(+∞) + (&amp;minus;∞)}}, {{math|(&amp;minus;∞) + (+∞)}} and equivalent subtractions {{math|(+∞) &amp;minus; (+∞)}} and {{math|(&amp;minus;∞) &amp;minus; (&amp;minus;∞)}}.
** The standard has alternative functions for powers:
*** The standard &lt;tt&gt;pow&lt;/tt&gt; function and the integer exponent &lt;tt&gt;pown&lt;/tt&gt; function define [[zero to the power of zero|{{math|0⁰}}]], {{math|1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|∞⁰}} as {{math|1}}.
*** The &lt;tt&gt;powr&lt;/tt&gt; function defines all three indeterminate forms as invalid operations and so returns NaN.
* Real operations with [[complex number|complex]] results, for example:
** The square root of a negative number.
** The logarithm of a negative number.
** The inverse sine or cosine of a number that is less than −1 or greater than 1.

NaNs may also be explicitly assigned to variables, typically as a representation for missing values. Prior to the IEEE standard, programmers often used a special value (such as −99999999) to represent undefined or missing values, but there was no guarantee that they would be handled consistently or correctly.&lt;ref name=idl/&gt;

NaNs are not necessarily generated in all the above cases. If an operation can produce an exception condition and traps are not masked then the operation will cause a trap instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm
|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture
|date=April 2008
|pages=118–125, 266–267, 334–335
}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an operand is a quiet NaN, and there isn't also a signaling NaN operand, then there is no exception condition and the result is a quiet NaN. Explicit assignments will not cause an exception even for signaling NaNs.

=== Quiet NaN ===
Quiet NaNs, or qNaNs, do not raise any additional exceptions as they propagate through most operations. The exceptions are where the NaN cannot simply be passed through unchanged to the output, such as in format conversions or certain comparison operations (which do not "expect" a NaN input).

=== Signaling NaN ===
Signaling NaNs, or sNaNs, are special forms of a NaN that when consumed by most operations should raise the invalid operation exception and then, if appropriate, be "quieted" into a qNaN that may then propagate. They were introduced in [[IEEE 754]]. There have been several ideas for how these might be used:

* Filling uninitialized memory with signaling NaNs would produce the invalid operation exception if the data is used before it is initialized
* Using an sNaN as a placeholder for a more complicated [[object (computer science)|object]], such as:
** A representation of a number that has [[arithmetic underflow|underflowed]]
** A representation of a number that has [[arithmetic overflow|overflowed]]
** Number in a higher precision format
** A [[complex number]]
When encountered, a trap handler could decode the sNaN and return an index to the computed result. In practice, this approach is faced with many complications. The treatment of the [[sign bit]] of NaNs for some simple operations (such as [[absolute value]]) is different from that for arithmetic operations. Traps are not required by the standard. There are other approaches to this sort of problem that would be more portable.

== Function definition ==

There are differences of opinion about the proper definition for the result of a numeric [[subroutine|function]] that receives a quiet NaN as input. One view is that the NaN should propagate to the output of the function in all cases to propagate the indication of an error. Another view, and the one taken by the [[C99|ISO C99]] and [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]] standards in general, is that if the function has multiple arguments and the output is uniquely determined by all the non-NaN inputs (including infinity), then that value should be the result. Thus for example the value returned by hypot(±∞,qNaN) and hypot(qNaN,±∞) is +∞.

The problem is particularly acute for the [[exponentiation]] function pow(x,y) = x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;. The expressions 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ∞&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; are considered [[indeterminate form]]s when they occur as limits (just like ∞&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0), and the question of whether [[Zero to the power of zero|zero to the zero power]] should be defined as 1 has divided opinion.

If the output is considered as undefined when a parameter is undefined, then pow(1,qNaN) should produce a qNaN. However, [[Math.h|math libraries]] have typically returned 1 for pow(1,y) for any [[real number]] y, and even when y is an [[Extended real number line|infinity]]. Similarly, they produce 1 for pow(x,0) even when x is 0 or an infinity. The rationale for returning the value 1 for the indeterminate forms was that the value of functions at singular points can be taken as a particular value if that value is in the limit the value{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} for all but a vanishingly small part of a ball around the limit value of the parameters.  The 2008 version of the [[IEEE 754]] standard says that pow(1,qNaN) and pow(qNaN,0) should both return 1 since they return 1 whatever else is used instead of quiet NaN. Moreover, ISO C99, and later IEEE 754-2008, chose to specify pow(−1,±∞) = 1 instead of qNaN; the reason of this choice is given in the C rationale:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf |title=Rationale for International Standard—Programming Languages—C, Revision 5.10 |date=April 2003 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Generally, C99 eschews a NaN result where a numerical value is useful. [...] The result of pow(−2,∞) is +∞, because all large positive floating-point values are even integers."

To satisfy those wishing a more strict interpretation of how the power function should act, the 2008 standard defines two additional power functions: pown(x,n), where the exponent must be an integer, and powr(x,y), which returns a NaN whenever a parameter is a NaN or the exponentiation would give an [[indeterminate form]].

== Integer NaN ==
Most fixed-size [[integer]] formats do not have any way of explicitly indicating invalid data. Converting NaN to an integer type, or performing an integer operation whose floating-point equivalent would produce NaN, usually throws an [[exception handling|exception]]. In [[Java programming language|Java]], such operations throw instances of &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ArithmeticException.html|title=ArithmeticException (Java Platform SE 8 )|author=|date=|website=docs.oracle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[C programming language|C]], they lead to [[undefined behavior]].

[[Perl]]'s {{mono|Math::BigInt}} package uses "NaN" for the result of strings that don't represent valid integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math::BigInt|url=http://perldoc.perl.org/Math/BigInt.html#Input|website=perldoc.perl.org|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; perl -mMath::BigInt -e "print Math::BigInt-&gt;new('foo')"
NaN
&lt;/source&gt;

== Display ==
Different operating systems and programming languages may have different string representations of NaN.

  nan
  NaN
  NaN%
  NAN
  NaNQ
  NaNS
  qNaN
  sNaN
  1.#SNAN
  1.#QNAN
  -1.#IND

Since, in practice, encoded NaNs have a sign, a quiet/signaling bit and optional 'diagnostic information' (sometimes called a ''payload''), these will often be found in string representations of NaNs, too, for example:

  -NaN
   NaN12345
  -sNaN12300
  -NaN(s1234)

(other variants exist).

== Encoding ==
In [[IEEE 754]] standard-conforming floating-point storage formats, NaNs are identified by specific, pre-defined bit patterns unique to NaNs. The sign bit does not matter. Binary format NaNs are represented with the exponential field filled with ones (like infinity values), and some non-zero number in the significand field (to make them distinct from infinity values). The original IEEE 754 standard from 1985 ([[IEEE 754|IEEE 754-1985]]) only described binary floating-point formats, and did not specify how the signaling/quiet state was to be tagged. In practice, the most significant bit of the significand field determined whether a NaN is signaling or quiet. Two different implementations, with reversed meanings, resulted:
* most processors (including those of the [[Intel]] and [[AMD]]'s [[x86]] family, the [[Motorola 68000 family]], the [[AIM alliance|AIM]] [[PowerPC]] family, the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] family, the [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] family, and optionally new [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processors) set the signaling/quiet bit to non-zero if the NaN is quiet, and to zero if the NaN is signaling. Thus, on these processors, the bit represents an 'is_quiet' flag;
* in NaNs generated by the [[PA-RISC]] and old MIPS processors, the signaling/quiet bit is zero if the NaN is quiet, and non-zero if the NaN is signaling. Thus, on these processors, the bit represents an 'is_signaling' flag.
The former choice has been preferred as it allows the implementation to quiet a signaling NaN by just setting the signaling/quiet bit to 1. The reverse is not possible with the latter choice because setting the signaling/quiet bit to 0 could yield an infinity.

The 2008 revision of the IEEE 754 standard ([[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]]) makes formal recommendations for the encoding of the signaling/quiet state.
* For binary formats, the most significant bit of the significand field should be an 'is_quiet' flag. I.e. this bit is non-zero if the NaN is quiet, and zero if the NaN is signaling.
* For decimal formats, whether binary or decimal encoded, a NaN is identified by having the top five bits of the combination field after the sign bit set to ones. The sixth bit of the field is the 'is_quiet' flag. The standard follows the interpretation as an 'is_signaling' flag. I.e. the signaling/quiet bit is zero if the NaN is quiet, and non-zero if the NaN is signaling. A signaling NaN is quieted by clearing this sixth bit.

For IEEE 754-2008 conformance, the meaning of the signaling/quiet bit in recent MIPS processors is now configurable via the NAN2008 field of the FCSR register. This support is optional in MIPS Release&amp;nbsp;3 and required in Release&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn2.imgtec.com/documentation/MD00083-2B-MIPS64INT-AFP-05.04.pdf|title=MIPS® Architecture For Programmers – Volume I-A: Introduction to the MIPS64® Architecture|date=20 November 2013|publisher=MIPS Technologies, Inc.|page=79|format=PDF|access-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state/value of the remaining bits of the significand field are not defined by the standard. This value is called the 'payload' of the NaN. If an operation has a single NaN input and propagates it to the output, the result NaN's payload should be that of the input NaN (this is not always possible for binary formats when the signaling/quiet state is encoded by an 'is_signaling' flag, as explained above). If there are multiple NaN inputs, the result NaN's payload should be from one of the input NaNs; the standard does not specify which.

The '''National Renewable Energy Laboratory''' ('''NREL'''), located in [[Golden, Colorado]], specializes in [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] [[research and development]]. NREL is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility, and is funded through the [[United States Department of Energy]]. This arrangement allows a private entity to operate the lab on behalf of the federal government. NREL receives funding from Congress to be applied toward research and development projects. NREL also performs research on [[photovoltaics]] (PV) under the National Center for Photovoltaics. NREL has a number of PV research capabilities including research and development, testing, and deployment. NREL's campus houses several facilities dedicated to PV research.

NREL's areas of research and development are renewable electricity, energy productivity, [[energy storage]], systems integration, and sustainable transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Mission and Programs| url=https://www.nrel.gov/about/mission-programs.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Established in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy02/30845.pdf NREL—25 Years of Research Excellence 1977–2002], July 2002 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6TPuwdQ5K archive])&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|NREL was established by the ''Solar Energy Research Development and Demonstration Act'' of 1974, [http://www.gc.energy.gov/1127.htm TITLE 42, CHAPTER 71, SUBCHAPTER II]|group=Note}} NREL began operating in 1977 as the '''Solar Energy Research Institute'''. Under the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter administration]], its activities went beyond research and development in solar energy as it tried to popularize knowledge about already existing technologies, like passive solar. During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan administration]] the institute's budget was cut by nearly 90%; many employees were "reduced in force" and the laboratory's activities were reduced to R&amp;D.

In later years, renewed interest in the energy problem improved the institute's position, but funding has fluctuated. In 2011, anticipated congressional budget shortfalls led to a voluntary buyout program for 100 to 150 staff reductions.&lt;ref name="DenverPost-2011.10.04"&gt;Plunkett, Chuck. [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19034058 National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden to cut 100–150 jobs through buyouts], [[The Denver Post]], October 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for fiscal 2016 was $427.4 million, down from a peak of $536.5 million five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/about/funding-history.html| title=Funding History| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the budget have sometimes forced NREL to cut staffing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Wallace| first=Alicia| url=http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/07/nrel-cutting-four-percent-of-workforce-lays-off-solar-researchers/| title=NREL cutting four percent of workforce, lays off solar researchers| date=October 7, 2017| work=Denver Post| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 1977 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, it has been operated under contract by [[MRIGlobal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mriglobal.org/Pages/About-us.aspx#hist| work=MRIGlobal| title=About Us| accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1991, the NREL was designated a [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy]] by President George H.W. Bush and its name was changed to NREL. Currently, NREL is managed for the DOE by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC. The Alliance was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between [[MRIGlobal]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]].&lt;ref name="EERE: Golden Field Office Public Reading Room - FOIA Proactive Disclosures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC Documents| url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/golden/FOIAPD.aspx | work=Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC Documents|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Martin Keller became NREL's ninth director in November 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2015/21583| title=Dr. Martin Keller Named Director of National Renewable Energy Laboratory| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently serves as both the director of the lab and the president of the Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Martin Keller - Laboratory Director|url=http://www.nrel.gov/about/director.html|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded Dan Arvizu, who retired in September 2015 after 10 years in those roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Storum| first=Doug| url=http://bizwest.com/nrel-director-dan-arvizu-to-retire-in-september/| title=NREL director Dan Arvizu to retire in September| work=BizWest| date=March 20, 2015| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercialization and technology transfer ==

NREL works closely with a number of private partners to transfer technological developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the marketplace and social arena.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL Commercialization &amp; Technology Transfer|url=http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/about.html|work=About Technology Transfer|publisher=NREL|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL's technologies have been recognized with 61 R&amp;D 100 Awards. The engineering and science behind these technology transfer successes and awards demonstrates NREL's commitment to a sustainable energy future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/about/rd-awards.html| title=R&amp;D 100 Awards| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of technology transfer was added to the mission of NREL as a means of enhancing commercial impact and societal benefit, ultimately justifying the use of tax dollars to in part fund the projects in the lab.&lt;ref name="Ampluse Corp Case Study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ampulse Corporation: A Case Study on Technology Transfer in U.S. Department of Energy Laboratories|url=http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/pdfs/46860.pdf|work=Success Stories: Commercialization &amp; Technology Transfer|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many of these technologies are young and often just emerging, NREL aims to reduce the risk of private sector investment and adoption of their developments.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer"/&gt; Three key pieces of federal legislation laid the policy framework to enact technology transfer: The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, The Bayh-Dole Act or The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980, and The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986.&lt;ref name="Ampluse Corp Case Study" /&gt;

Ultimately, many of the deployed technologies help mitigate the oil dependence of the United States, reduce [[carbon emissions]] from [[fossil fuel]] use, and maintain U.S. industry competitiveness. Deployment of technologies is accomplished by developing technology partnerships with private industry. NREL serves as a reduced-risk platform for research, and through partnerships those advances can effectively be translated into serving the interest of both the private sector and the public sector. The energy goals set by the DOE are at the forefront of the research done in the laboratory, and the research reflects the energy goals, which are designed with the interest of "U.S. industry competitiveness" in mind.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer" /&gt; The challenge to achieving these goals is investment security.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

Part of the technology transfer process is to form partnerships that not only focus on financial security, but also to consider partners who have demonstrated core values that reflect the integrity to manage the introduction and assimilation of the technological developments. NREL focuses on the core values of the partnering entity, the willingness to set and meet timely goals, dedication to transparency, and a reciprocating intent to further development.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer" /&gt; Under these partnership agreements, NREL does not fund projects conducted by their private partners. NREL does provide funding opportunities through their competitively placed contracts. In order to form a Technology Partnership Agreement with NREL, there are essentially seven steps:&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

# Discuss the project proposal with the appropriate NREL technical contact
# Determine if the project meets qualifications
# Develop statement of work
# Review and/or negotiate
# Sign agreement
# Send funds and start work
# Manage commitment&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

The process is estimated to require 45 business days, subject to negotiations. Technology Partnership Agreements provide only the technical services of NREL.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

NREL also has a user access program that allows outside researchers to use the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) and rely on its staff of scientists and engineers to develop and evaluate energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/esif/user-access.html| title=Energy Systems Integration Facility: User Access| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other ways exist for universities and industry to work with NREL, including a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), a Funds-In Agreement (FIA), and a Technical Services Agreement (TSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/workingwithus/assets/pdfs/agreement-matrix.pdf| title=Partnering with NREL| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| format=PDF| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperative Research and Development Agreement===

A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is a partnership between NREL and an outside company. This type of agreement protects the intellectual property of both NREL and the outside company, and allows the investing company to negotiate for an exclusive field-of-use license for any inventions that come out of the CRADA.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

A CRADA between NREL and DuPont helped the chemical company develop two key technologies for processing cellulosic ethanol and lead to the opening of a 30 million gallon refinery in Iowa in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Harrington| first=Kent| url=https://www.aiche.org/chenected/2015/11/duponts-new-cellulosic-ethanol-plant-open-business| title=Dupont's New Cellulosic Ethanol Plant Is Open for Business| work=AIChE| date=November 19, 2015| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic Partnership Projects Agreements ===
NREL offers technical services to partners who require resources that are not available to them through the form of a Strategic Partnership Projects agreement, which formerly was known as a Work-for-Others agreement. This agreement differs from a CRADA in that they are not for the purpose of performing joint research. The partner covers the entire cost of the project.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/workingwithus/technology-partnership-agreements.html| title=Technology Partnership Agreements| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of Strategic Partnership Projects agreements:

# Interagency Agreement-Government: A partnership formed between the DOE and a second U.S. federal agency. The outside agency funds the project directly.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;
# Funds-In Agreement (FIA): A non-federal entity funds the project and research conducted by NREL. In some occasions, the partner can obtain title to inventions.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;
# Technical Services Agreement (TSA): A non-federal entity pays NREL for services related to an analytical problem. NREL provides consultation and basic technical assistance.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

=== Technology licensing ===

NREL offers licensing for many of its technologies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy development. Licensing of NREL's intellectual property is available to businesses of any size, from start-up to [[Fortune 500]]. The available technologies fall under the categories of: renewable electricity conversion and delivery systems, renewable fuels formulation and delivery, efficient and integrated energy systems, and strategic energy analysis. "NREL-developed technologies include vehicles and fuels, basic sciences, biomass, concentrating solar power, electric infrastructure systems, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cells, photovoltaics, and wind energy." &lt;ref name="Tech Available for Licensing"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://techportal.eere.energy.gov/lab/NREL| work=Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy| title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory Technologies Available for Licensing| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL has a list of 150 market summaries available for licensing, and the list includes information about the descriptions of the technologies, their benefits, potential applications, and their current stage in development.&lt;ref name="Tech Available for Licensing" /&gt;

== National Center for Photovoltaics ==

The goals of the [[photovoltaics]] (PV) research done at NREL are to decrease the "nation's reliance on [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] generated electricity by lowering the cost of delivered electricity and improving the [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]] of PV [[Solar panel|modules]] and [[Photovoltaic system|systems]]."&lt;ref name="PV Research Home"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL Photovoltaic Research Home|url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/|work=Photovoltaic Research|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic research at NREL is performed under the National Center for Photovoltaics (NCPV). A primary mission of the NCPV is to support ongoing efforts of the DOE's SunShot Initiative, which wants to increase the availability of solar power at a cost competitive with other energy sources. The NCPV coordinates its research and goals with researchers from across the country, including the Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST) Center and the Bay Area PV Consortium. The NCPV also partners with many universities and other industry partners. NREL brings in dozens of students annually through the Solar University-National lab Ultra-effective Program (SUN UP), which was created to facilitate existing and new interactions between universities and the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/sunup.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Solar University-National Lab Ultra-Effective Program| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab maintains a number of research partnerships for PV research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/work-with-us.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Work With Us| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and development===


Some of the areas of PV R&amp;D include the physical properties of PV panels, performance and reliability of PV, junction formation, and research into photo-electrochemical materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/research.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Photovoltaic Research: Research| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this research, NREL hopes to surpass current technologies in efficiency and cost-competitiveness and reach the overall goal of generating electricity at $0.06/[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] for [[Electrical grid|grid]]-tied PV systems.

NREL identifies the following as cornerstones to its PV R&amp;D program: the Thin-Film Partnership and the PV Manufacturing R&amp;D Project.&lt;ref name="PV Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL PV Research|url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/projects.html|work=Projects|publisher=NREL|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thin Film Partnership Program at NREL coordinates national research teams of manufacturers, academics, and NREL scientists on a variety of subjects relating to thin-film PV. The research areas of the Thin Film Partnership Program include amorphous silicon (a-Si), copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2 or CIGS) and, [[cadmium telluride]] (CdTe), and module reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/thin-film-partnership.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Thin Film Photovoltaic Partnership Project| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL's PV Manufacturing Research and Development Project is an ongoing partnership between NREL and private sector solar manufacturing companies. It started in 1991 as the Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) project and was extended and renamed in 2001 due to its success as a project. The overall goal of research done under the PV Manufacturing R&amp;D Project is to help maintain a strong market position for US solar companies by researching ways to reduce costs to manufacturers and customers and improving the manufacturing process. It is estimated that the project has helped to reduce manufacturing cost for PV panels by more than 50%.&lt;ref name="pv_manufacturing"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/pv-manufacturing.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Photovoltaic Manufacturing R&amp;D Project| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of achievements under the PV Manufacturing Research and Development Project include the development of a manufacturing process that increase the production of silicon solar modules by 8% without increasing costs and the development of a new boron coating process that reduces solar costs over traditional processes.&lt;ref name="pv_manufacturing" /&gt;

===Testing===


NREL is capable of providing testing and evaluation to the PV industry with indoor, outdoor, and field testing facilities. NREL is able to provide testing on long-term performance, reliability, and component failure for PV systems. NREL also has accelerated testing capabilities from both PV cells and system components to identify areas of potential long-term degradation and failure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/accreditation.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=ISO Accreditation| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Photovoltaic Device Performance group at NREL is able to measure the performance of PV cells and modules with regard to a standard or customized reference set. This allows NREL to serve as independent facility for verifying device performance. NREL allows industry members to test and evaluate potential products, with the hope that it will lead to more cost effective and reliable technology. The overall goal is to help improve the reliability in the PV industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/device-performance.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Device Performance| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deployment ===


NREL also seeks to raise public awareness of PV technologies through its deployment services. NREL provides a number of technical and non-technical publications intended to help raise consumer awareness and understanding of solar PV. Scientists at NREL perform research into energy markets and how to develop the solar energy market. They also perform research and outreach in the area of [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated PV]]. NREL is also an active organizer and sponsor in the DOE's [[Solar Decathlon]].&lt;ref name="PV Dep."&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/tech_deployment/solar.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Technology Deployment: Solar Deployment and Market Transformation| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL provides information on solar energy, beyond the scientific papers on research done at the lab. The lab provides publications on solar resources and manuals on different applications of solar technology, as well as a number of different solar resource models and tools. The lab also makes available a number of different solar resource data sets in its Renewable Resource Data Center.&lt;ref name="NREL RReDC"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL Renewable Resource Data Center|url=http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/|work=Solar Resource Data|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
[[File:National Renewable Energy Laboratory.jpg|thumb|The Energy Systems Integration Facility in Golden, Colorado.]]
NREL's [[Golden, Colorado]] campus houses several facilities dedicated to PV and biomass research.  In the recently opened Science and Technology Facility, research is conducted on solar cells, thin films, and nanostructure research.  NREL's Outdoor Test Facility allows researchers to test and evaluate PV technologies under a range of conditions, both indoor and outdoor.  Scientists at NREL work at the Outdoor Test Facility to develop standards for testing PV technologies.  At the Outdoor Test Facility NREL researchers calibrate primary reference cells for use in a range of applications.  One of the main buildings for PV research at NREL is the Solar Energy Research Facility (SERF).  Examples of research conducted at the SERF include semiconductor material research, prototype solar cell production, and measurement and characterization of solar cell and module performance. Additionally, the roof at the SERF is able to house ten PV panels to evaluate and analyze the performance of commercial building-integrated PV systems.  Additionally, R&amp;D in PV materials and devices, measurement and characterization, reliability testing are also conducted at the SERF.&lt;ref name="NREL PV Facilities" /&gt; At the Solar Radiation Research Laboratory, NREL has been measuring solar radiation and meteorological data since 1984.&lt;ref name="NREL PV Facilities"&gt;{{cite web |title=Photovoltaics Research - Facilities |url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/facilities.html |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Bioenergy Center==

The National Bioenergy Center (NBC) was established in October 2000. "The National Bioenergy Center is composed of four technical groups and a technical lead for partnership development with industry. Partnership development includes work performed at NREL under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), Technical Service Agreements (TSA), Analytical Service Agreements (ASA), and Work for Others (WFO) contract research for DOE's industry partners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/national_bioenergy.html The National Bioenergy Center Homepage ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the research is to convert biomass into biofuels/biochemical intermediates via both biochemical and thermochemical processes.

The National Bioenergy Center is currently divided into certain technology and research areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/projects.html NREL's biomass research, development, and deployment projects]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applied Science
* Catalysis and Thermochemical Sciences and Engineering R&amp;D
* Biochemical Process R&amp;D
* Biorefinery Analysis

Some of the current projects are in the following areas:
* Biomass characteristics
* Biochemical conversion
* Thermochemical conversion
* Chemical and catalyst science
* Integrated biorefinery processes
* Microalgal biofuels
* Biomass process and sustainability analysis

The Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility (IBRF) houses multiple pilot-scale process trains for converting biomass to various liquid fuels at a rate of 450–900&amp;nbsp;kg (0.5–1 ton) per day of dry biomass. Unit operations include feedstock washing and milling, pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, distillation, and solid-liquid separation.  The heart of the Thermochemical Users Facility (TCUF) is the 0.5-metric-ton-per-day Thermochemical Process Development Unit (TCPDU), which can be operated in either a pyrolysis or gasification mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/facilities.html| title=Biomass Research - Facilities| publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Wind Technology Center ==

[[Image:NREL Windmills.jpg|thumb|right|The main research [[wind turbine]]s at NREL]]

NREL has produced many technologies that impact the wind industry at a global level. The center is home of 20 patents and has created software such as (FAST), simulation software that is used to model wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63254.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

==Examples of Principled Distance==
{{Essay-like|section|date=November 2014}}
Article 29 &amp; 30 in [[Constitution of India]] seeks a principled distance between minorities as well as majority to protect, preserve and propagate their cultural, linguistic and religious identity through establishment of cultural and education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncm.nic.in/Constitutional_provisions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://realitycheck.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/article30-series/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy and taxpayer funded arrangements initially applied to Muslim Indian pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Since 1973, pilgrims applying through the [[Haj Committee of India]] are offered a concessionary fare on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;Press Information Bureau, [http://www.indianmuslims.info/book/export/html/14454 "Hajj operation in India 2006"], December 2006.

[[File:Lennard-Jones Radial Distribution Function.svg|thumb|300px|Radial distribution function for the [[Lennard–Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model fluid]] at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T^* = 0.71, \; n^* = 0.844&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''radial distribution function''', (or '''pair correlation function''') &lt;math&gt;g(r)&lt;/math&gt; in a system of [[particles]] (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from a reference particle.

If a given particle is taken to be at the origin O, and if &lt;math&gt;\rho =N/V&lt;/math&gt; is the average number density of particles, then the local time-averaged density at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from O is &lt;math&gt;\rho g(r)&lt;/math&gt;. This simplified definition holds for a [[homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] system. A more general case will be considered below.

In simplest terms it is a measure of the probability of finding a particle at a distance of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; away from a given reference particle, relative to that for an ideal gas. The general algorithm involves determining how many particles are within a distance of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r+dr&lt;/math&gt; away from a particle. This general theme is depicted to the right, where the red particle is our reference particle, and blue particles are those which are within the circular shell, dotted in orange.

The radial distribution function is usually determined by calculating the distance between all particle pairs and binning them into a histogram. The histogram is then normalized with respect to an ideal gas, where particle histograms are completely uncorrelated. For three dimensions, this normalization is the number density of the system &lt;math&gt;( \rho )&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell, which symbolically can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\rho \, 4\pi r^2 dr&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a [[potential energy]] function, the radial distribution function can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the [[Monte Carlo method]], or via the [[Ornstein-Zernike equation]], using approximative closure relations like the [[Percus-Yevick approximation]] or the [[Hypernetted-chain equation|Hypernetted Chain Theory]]. It can also be determined experimentally, by radiation scattering techniques or by direct visualization for large enough (micrometer-sized) particles via traditional or confocal microscopy.

The radial distribution function is of fundamental importance since it can be used, using the [[Kirkwood–Buff solution theory]], to link the microscopic details to macroscopic properties. Moreover, by the reversion of the Kirkwood-Buff theory, it is possible to attain the microscopic details of the radial distribution function from the macroscopic properties.

==Definition==

Consider a system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles in a volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (for an average number density &lt;math&gt;\rho =N/V&lt;/math&gt;) and at a temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (let us also define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta = \frac{1}{kT}&lt;/math&gt;). The particle coordinates are &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i = 1, \, \ldots, \, N&lt;/math&gt;. The [[potential energy]] due to the interaction between particles is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle U_{N} (\mathbf{r}_{1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{N})&lt;/math&gt; and we do not consider the case of an externally applied field.

The appropriate [[Ensemble average|averages]] are taken in the [[canonical ensemble]] &lt;math&gt;(N,V,T)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Z_{N} = \int \cdots \int \mathrm{e}^{-\beta U_{N}} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_N&lt;/math&gt; the configurational integral, taken over all possible combinations of particle positions. The probability of an elementary configuration, namely finding particle 1 in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, particle 2 in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc. is given by

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt; P^{(N)}(\mathbf{r}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_N ) \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_N = \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\beta U_{N}}}{Z_N} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_N\, &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The total number of particles is huge, so that &lt;math&gt; P^{(N)}&lt;/math&gt; in itself is not very useful. However, one can also obtain the probability of a reduced configuration, where the positions of only &lt;math&gt;n &lt; N&lt;/math&gt; particles are fixed, in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{r}_{1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, with no constraints on the remaining &lt;math&gt;N-n&lt;/math&gt; particles. To this end, one has to integrate ({{EquationNote|1}}) over the remaining coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{n+1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{N}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; P^{(n)}(\mathbf{r}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_n) =\frac{1}{Z_N} \int \cdots \int \mathrm{e}^{-\beta U_N} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_{n+1} \cdots \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_N \, &lt;/math&gt;.

The particles being identical, it is more relevant to consider the probability that ''any'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of them occupy positions &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{r}_{1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; in ''any'' permutation, thus defining the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-''particle density''

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\rho^{(n)}(\mathbf{r}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_n) =\frac{N!}{(N-n)!} P^{(n)} (\mathbf{r}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

For &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, ({{EquationNote|2}}) gives the one-particle density which, for a crystal, is a periodic function with sharp maxima at the lattice sites. For a (homogeneous) liquid, it is independent of the position &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt; and equal to the overall density of the system:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{V} \int \rho^{(1)}(\mathbf{r}_1) \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1 = \rho^{(1)} = \frac{N}{V} = \rho  \,&lt;/math&gt;

It is now time to introduce a correlation function &lt;math&gt; g^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; by

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\rho^{(n)}(\mathbf{r}_{1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{n}) = \rho^{n}g^{(n)}(\mathbf{r}_{1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{n}) \, &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

&lt;math&gt;g^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is called a correlation function, since if the atoms are independent from each other &lt;math&gt;\rho^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; would simply equal &lt;math&gt;\rho^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;g^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; corrects for the correlation between atoms.

From ({{EquationNote|3}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) it follows that

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;g^{(n)}(\mathbf{r}_{1}\, \ldots, \, \mathbf{r}_{n}) = \frac{V^{n}N!}{N^{n}(N-n)!} \cdot \frac{1}{Z_N} \, \int \cdots \int \mathrm{e}^{-\beta U_N} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_{n+1} \cdots \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_N \, &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

==Relations involving ''g''(r)==

===The structure factor===

The second-order correlation function &lt;math&gt;g^{(2)}(\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2})&lt;/math&gt; is of special importance, as it is directly related (via a [[Fourier transform]]) to the [[structure factor]] of the system and can thus be determined experimentally using [[X-ray diffraction]] or [[neutron diffraction]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

If the system consists of spherically symmetric particles, &lt;math&gt;g^{(2)}(\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2})&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the relative distance between them, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{12} = \mathbf{r}_{2} - \mathbf{r}_{1} &lt;/math&gt;. We will drop the sub- and superscript: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle g(\mathbf{r})\equiv g^{(2)}(\mathbf{r}_{12})&lt;/math&gt;. Taking particle 0 as fixed at the origin of the coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho g(\mathbf{r}) d^3r = \mathrm{d} n (\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is the ''average'' number of particles (among the remaining &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt;) to be found in the volume &lt;math&gt;\textstyle d^3r&lt;/math&gt; around the position &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can formally count these particles and take the average via the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{\mathrm{d} n (\mathbf{r})}{d^3r} = \langle \sum_{i \neq 0} \delta  ( \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i) \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \langle \cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; the ensemble average, yielding:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\rho} \langle \sum_{i \neq 0} \delta  ( \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i) \rangle = V \frac{N-1}{N} \left \langle \delta ( \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_1) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

where the second equality requires the equivalence of particles &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1, \, \ldots, \, N-1&lt;/math&gt;. The formula above is useful for relating &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; to the static structure factor &lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S(\mathbf{q}) = \langle \sum_{ij} \mathrm{e}^{-i \mathbf{q} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)} \rangle /N&lt;/math&gt;, since we have:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S(\mathbf{q}) &amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \langle \sum_{i \neq j} \mathrm{e}^{-i \mathbf{q} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)} \rangle = 1 + \frac{1}{N} \left \langle \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, \mathrm{e}^{-i \mathbf{q} \mathbf{r}} \sum_{i \neq j} \delta \left [ \mathbf{r} - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right ] \right \rangle \\ &amp;= 1+ \frac{N(N-1)}{N} \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}\, \mathrm{e}^{-i \mathbf{q} \mathbf{r}} \left \langle \delta ( \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_1 ) \right \rangle
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
, and thus:

&lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{q}) = 1 + \rho \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, \mathrm{e}^{-i \mathbf{q} \mathbf{r}} g(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, proving the Fourier relation alluded to above.

This equation is only valid in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], since &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is not normalized: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{r \rightarrow \infty} g(\mathbf{r}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} g(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; diverges as the volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a Dirac peak at the origin for the structure factor. Since this contribution is inaccessible experimentally we can subtract it from the equation above and redefine the structure factor as a regular function:

: &lt;math&gt;S'(\mathbf{q}) = S(\mathbf{q}) - \rho \delta (\mathbf{q})= 1 + \rho \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, \mathrm{e}^{-i \mathbf{q}\mathbf{r}} [g(\mathbf{r}) - 1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, we rename &lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{q}) \equiv S'(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; and, if the system is a liquid, we can invoke its isotropy:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;S(q) = 1 + \rho \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, \mathrm{e}^{-i  \mathbf{q}\mathbf{r}} [g(r) - 1] = 1 + 4\pi\rho\frac{1}{q} \int \mathrm{d} r \, r\, \mathrm{sin}(qr) [g(r) - 1]&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

===The compressibility equation===
Evaluating ({{EquationNote|6}}) in &lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt; and using the relation between the isothermal [[compressibility]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \chi _T&lt;/math&gt; and the structure factor at the origin yields the [[compressibility equation]]:
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\rho kT \chi _T= kT\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial p}\right)=1 + \rho \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, [g(r) - 1] &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

===The potential of mean force===
It can be shown&lt;ref name="Chandler1987"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[David Chandler (chemist)|Chandler, D.]] |year=1987 |title=Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics |publisher=Oxford University Press |section=7.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the radial distribution function is related to the two-particle [[potential of mean force]] &lt;math&gt;w^{(2)}(r)&lt;/math&gt; by:
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt; g(r) = \exp \left [ -\frac{w^{(2)}(r)}{kT} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

===The energy equation===
If the particles interact via identical pairwise potentials: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle U_{N} = \sum_{i &gt; j = 1}^N u(\left | \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j \right |)&lt;/math&gt;, the average internal energy per particle is:&lt;ref name="HansenMcDonald2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jean-Pierre Hansen|Hansen, J. P.]] and McDonald, I. R. |year=2005 |title=Theory of Simple Liquids |edition=3rd |publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Section 2.5}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left \langle E \right \rangle}{N} = \frac{3}{2} kT + \frac{\left \langle U_{N} \right \rangle}{N} = \frac{3}{2} kT + \frac{\rho}{2}\int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, u(r)g(r, \rho, T) &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

===The pressure equation of state===
Developing the [[virial equation]] yields the pressure equation of state:
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;p = \rho kT - \frac{\rho^2}{6}  \int_V \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, r g(r, \rho, T) \frac{\mathrm{d} u(r)}{\mathrm{d} r}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

===Thermodynamic properties===
The radial distribution function is an important measure because several key thermodynamic properties, such as potential energy and pressure can be calculated from it.

For a 3-D system where particles interact via pairwise potentials, the potential energy of the system can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=softmatter&gt;{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=Daan; Smit, Berend|title=Understanding molecular simulation from algorithms to applications|year=2002|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0122673511|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;PE=\frac{N}{2}4\pi\rho\int^{\infty}_0r^2u(r)g(r)dr &lt;/math&gt;

Where N is the number of particles in the system, &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the number density, &lt;math&gt; u(r)&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[pair potential]].

The pressure of the system can also be calculated by relating the 2nd [[virial coefficient]] to &lt;math&gt; g(r)&lt;/math&gt; .  The pressure can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=softmatter/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = \rho k_BT-\frac{2}{3}\pi\rho^2\int_{0}^{\infty}dr\frac{du(r)}{dr}r^3g(r)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is Boltzmann's constant.  Note that the results of potential and pressure will not be as accurate as directly calculating these properties because of the averaging involved with the calculation of &lt;math&gt;g(r)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Approximations==

For dilute systems (e.g. gases), the correlations in the positions of the particles that &lt;math&gt;g(r)&lt;/math&gt; accounts for are only due to the potential &lt;math&gt;u(r)&lt;/math&gt; engendered by the reference particle, neglecting indirect effects. In the first approximation, it is thus simply given by the Boltzmann distribution law:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;g(r) = \exp \left [ -\frac{u(r)}{kT} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

If &lt;math&gt;u(r)&lt;/math&gt; were zero for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ndash; i.e., if the particles did not exert any influence on each other, then &lt;math&gt;g(r) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the mean local density would be equal to the mean density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;: the presence of a particle at O would not influence the particle distribution around it and the gas would be ideal. For distances &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(r)&lt;/math&gt; is significant, the mean local density will differ from the mean density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the sign of &lt;math&gt;u(r)&lt;/math&gt; (higher for negative interaction energy and lower for positive &lt;math&gt;u(r)&lt;/math&gt;).

As the density of the gas increases, the low-density limit becomes less and less accurate since a particle situated in   &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; experiences not only the interaction with the particle in O but also with the other neighbours, themselves influenced by the reference particle. This mediated interaction increases with the density, since there are more neighbours to interact with: it makes physical sense to write a density expansion of &lt;math&gt;g(r)&lt;/math&gt;, which resembles the [[virial equation]]:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;g(r) = \exp \left [ -\frac{u(r)}{kT} \right ] y(r) \quad \mathrm{with} \quad y(r) = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \rho ^n y_n (r)&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

This similarity is not accidental; indeed, substituting ({{EquationNote|12}}) in the relations above for the thermodynamic parameters (Equations {{EquationNote|7}}, {{EquationNote|9}} and {{EquationNote|10}}) yields the corresponding virial expansions.&lt;ref name="Barker:1976"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Barker | first1 = J. | last2 = Henderson | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.48.587 | title = What is "liquid"?

One can determine &lt;math&gt;g(r)&lt;/math&gt; indirectly (via its relation with the structure factor &lt;math&gt;S(q)&lt;/math&gt;) using [[neutron scattering]] or [[x-ray scattering]] data. The technique can be used at very short length scales (down to the atomic level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yarnell | first1 = J. | last2 = Katz | first2 = M. | last3 = Wenzel | first3 = R. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = S. | title = Structure Factor and Radial Distribution Function for Liquid Argon at 85 °K | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.7.2130 | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 2130 | year = 1973 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1973PhRvA...7.2130Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;) but involves significant space and time averaging (over the sample size and the acquisition time, respectively).

==Higher-order correlation functions==

Higher-order distribution functions &lt;math&gt;\textstyle g^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; were less studied, since they are generally less important for the thermodynamics of the system; at the same time, they are not accessible by conventional scattering techniques. They can however be measured by [[coherent scattering|coherent X-ray scattering]] and are interesting insofar as they can reveal local symmetries in disordered systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wochner | first1 = P. | last2 = Gutt | first2 = C. | last3 = Autenrieth | first3 = T. | last4 = Demmer | first4 = T. | last5 = Bugaev | first5 = V. | last6 = Ortiz | first6 = A.

In [[mathematics]] and its applications, the '''signed distance function''' (or '''oriented distance function''') of a set ''Ω'' in a [[metric space]] determines the distance of a given point ''x'' from the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''Ω'', with the sign determined by whether ''x'' is in ''Ω''. The function has positive values at points ''x'' inside ''Ω'', it decreases in value as ''x'' approaches the boundary of ''Ω'' where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of ''Ω''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1467575 | title=Level set based shape prior segmentation | author1=Chan, T. | author2=Zhu, W. | year=2005 | conference=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside ''Ω'' and positive outside).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=368173 | title=Shape modeling with front propagation: a level set approach | author1=Malladi, R. | author2=Sethian, J.A. | author3=Vemuri, B.C. | journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=1995 | doi = 10.1109/34.368173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of a [[metric space]], ''X'', with metric, ''d'', then the ''signed distance function'', ''f'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
   d(x, \partial \Omega) &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega \\
  -d(x, \partial \Omega)&amp;  \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega^c
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt; d(x, \partial \Omega) := \inf_{y \in \partial \Omega}d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''inf'' denotes the [[infimum]].

==Properties in Euclidean space==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[piecewise]] [[smooth function|smooth]] boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable [[almost everywhere]], and its [[gradient]] satisfies the [[eikonal equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;|\nabla f|=1.&lt;/math&gt;

If the boundary of ''Ω'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k''≥2 (see [[differentiability classes]]) then ''d'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on points sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω''.{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Lemma 14.16}} In particular, '''''on''''' the boundary ''f'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x) = N(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the inward normal vector field. The signed distance function is thus a differentiable extension of the normal vector field. In particular, the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the signed distance function on the boundary of ''Ω'' gives the [[Weingarten map]].

If, further, ''Γ'' is a region sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω'' that ''f'' is twice continuously differentiable on it, then there is an explicit formula involving the Weingarten map ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; for the Jacobian of changing variables in terms of the signed distance function and nearest boundary point. Specifically, if ''T''(∂''Ω'',''μ'') is the set of points within distance ''μ'' of the boundary of ''Ω'' (i.e. the [[tubular neighbourhood]] of radius ''μ''), and ''g'' is an absolutely integrable function on ''Γ'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{T(\partial\Omega,\mu)} g(x)\,dx = \int_{\partial\Omega}\int_{-\mu}^\mu g(u+\lambda N(u))\, \det(I-\lambda W_u) \,d\lambda \,dS_u,&lt;/math&gt;

where det indicates the [[determinant]] and ''dS''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that we are taking the [[surface integral]].{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Equation (14.98)}}

==Algorithms==
[[Algorithm]]s for calculating the signed distance function include the efficient [[fast marching method]], [[fast sweeping method]]&lt;ref&gt;[ZHAO, Hongkai. A fast sweeping method for eikonal equations. Mathematics of Computation, 2005, 74. Jg., Nr. 250, S. 603-627.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the more general [[level-set method]].

== Applications ==
Signed distance functions are applied, for example, in [[computer vision]].

They have also recently been used in a method (advanced by [[Valve Corporation]]) to render [[smooth font]]s at large sizes (or alternatively at [[Pixel density#Named pixel densities|high DPI]]) using [[GPU]] acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1281500.1281665 | title=Improved alpha-tested magnification for vector textures and special effects | journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 courses on - SIGGRAPH '07 | pages=9 | date=2007 | first=Chris | last=Green| isbn=9781450318235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve's method computed signed [[distance field]]s in [[Raster graphics|raster space]] in order to avoid the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently piece-wise approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a Bézier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for [[real-time rendering]], and it has to be assisted by grid-based [[discretization]] techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tHv6mcIIeo&lt;/ref&gt;

"Suzanne Briet, 1894-1989: 'Madame Documentation'." http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/briet.html. Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was a librarian, author, historian, poet, and visionary best known for her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' (''What is Documentation?''), a foundational text in the modern study of [[information science]]. She is also known for her writings on the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' offers a vision of documentation that moves beyond [[Paul Otlet]]'s emphasis on fixed forms of documents, such as the book, toward "an unlimited horizon of physical forms and aesthetic formats for documents and an unlimited horizon of techniques and technologies (and of 'documentary agencies' employing these) in the service of multitudes of particular cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many early [[Information science#European documentation|European Documentalists]], Briet embraced [[modernism|modernity]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; However, her work made a difference to modernism and science through the influence of [[French people|French]] [[post-structuralist]] theorists and her strong orientation toward humanistic scholarship. She subsequently ushered in a second generation of European Documentation and introduced humanistic methods and concerns, especially [[semiotics]] and [[cultural studies]], to [[information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in ''What Is Documentation?''." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Briet had been highly regarded throughout much of her career—the Grand Cross of the [[Légion d'honneur]] was conferred on her in 1950 — she was largely forgotten in her later life, until her death in 1989, when scholars found a renewed interest in her ideas. Today scholars often credit Briet as a visionary, having laid the foundation for contemporary frameworks and methodologies in information science roughly 50 years earlier. "Her modernist perspective," writes [[Michael Buckland]], "combined with semiotics, deserves attention now because it is different from, and offers an alternative to, the scientific, [[Positivism|positivist]] view that has so dominated information science and which is increasingly questioned."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Suzanne Briet was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 1 February 1894, coming of age at a time of great social change and economic loss in France after [[World War I]]. Although Briet grew up in [[Paris]], she remained attached to her birthplace and ancestral home. Briet was only 20 at the outbreak of the war. Ardennes was the pathway of German armies invading France, and during the hostilities her uncle was deported, his village was invaded, and her grandfather's house was destroyed. Historians have suggested that perhaps because of her experiences during the war, as well as her travels to [[England]] as a child, Briet took an early interest in the [[League of Nations]], sitting in on some of the sessions held in Paris, and the founding of other international organizations.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Briet's mother expected her to become a teacher. Briet's family sent her to Ecole de Sèvres, an elite women's school for training secondary school teachers, where she earned a degree in history and qualified to teach English and history. After teaching in Algeria from 1917 to 1920, Briet pursued a career in librarianship.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied with Louis Barrau-Dihigo at the [[Sorbonne]], who was apparently so taken with Briet's talents that "when Briet explained that she could only participate on Saturday, he changed the time of the course to accommodate her."&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At age 30 in 1924, Briet was one of the first of three women appointed as professional librarians at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]].&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"/&gt;

==Career==
Briet's career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale witnessed major changes in the library profession. Briet played a central role in the "modern library" movement, which eschewed elitist traditions that had dominated many libraries in favor of "modern" ideas of librarianship. In addition to technological innovations, Briet saw the emergence of documentation as a distinct profession with its own techniques, standards and training.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Women also entered the professional classes in France in increasing numbers during [[World War II]], growing from only 10% of the library profession in 1927 to 50% by the end of the war.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Her main achievements during these years were symbolic of her interest in service and moderninzation. Between 1934 and 1954, Briet created and supervised the Salle des Catalogues et Bibliographies, making available materials throughout France that had been previously restricted to most patrons. By 1931 she co-founded (with chemist [[Jean Gérard]]) the Union Française des Organismes de Documentation, the French analogue of the American Documentation Institution, today known as the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]].

During [[World War II]], Briet witnessed many of her colleagues deported during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of Paris]] and others arrested as communists. Despite a climate of fear, censorship, oppression and physical hardship, Briet made sure to carry out the catalog and bibliographic services of the Bibliothèque  Nationale. During the war, Briet continued her interest in Documentation, even attending a conference in [[Salzburg]], [[Germany]], which was organized by German Documentalists.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At the end of the war, Briet took on a larger role in a growing international documentation movement. In 1950, she prepared an international survey of education for librarians and documentalists commissioned by [[UNESCO]] and was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]]. In 1951 Briet helped establish the Institut National de Techniques de la Documentation at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]]. She was the founding Director of Studies and eventually the Vice-President of the [[International Federation for Documentation]].

That same year, Briet published her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'', in which she outlines, in 48 pages, her philosophy of documentation, "pushing boundaries of the field beyond texts to include any material form of evidence. ('Is a living animal a document?' she asked.)"&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Her thirty-year career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale often put Briet in close contact with major French thinkers of the day, including scientists, historians, linguists, and philosophers, which had a significant impact on her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Briet retired from the Bibliothèque  Nationale in 1954 at age 60. She wrote her last essays on documentation in 1955.&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Checklist of Writings" http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/Brietwebbib.pdf Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her retirement concentrating on other interests, including the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. Her memoirs were published in 1979.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"/&gt; She died in [[Boulogne]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt;

==Impact on information science==
Briet published roughly 100 essays, books, and reports on documentation, [[library science]], and [[history]]&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"/&gt; She took up many of the pressing issues of documentation in her day: [[internationalization]], [[institutionalization]], [[information overload|information or documentary overload]], [[scholarly communication]], [[science and technology studies]], [[world peace]], and [[international development]]. Briet had been deeply engaged in the documentation movement from the 1920s onward, bringing to it a deep understanding of culture and the humanities. Expanding on the techniques and technological ideas of earlier European Documentalists, such as [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]], "Briet understood that technology and culture were deeply connected. She saw society and, therefore, culture, as being re-shaped by technology. The techniques of documentation in aiding and shaping intellectual work were, in her view, both a symptom of, and contributing force within the 'industrialization' of knowledge workers. We can now see, in the impact of computers and telecommunications, how right she was."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar notes, "Not again -- until [[Actor-network theory]] at the end of the twentieth century -- would a social network account of technical production, and specifically, documentary production, be articulated."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Briet's body of work points to the necessity to understand cultural categories, historical lineages, and the social forces that create and sustain information, urging scholars and information professionals to explore beyond the boundaries of their cultural specialization. Paul Otlet problematized the definition of document when he opened the possibility of any object, independent of the human intention behind its creation, to be a considered a document. Briet solves this problem with her argument that a document must be defined by its intentional use as such. She gives the example of an antelope -- running wild in the plains, it is not a document, but captured and placed in a zoo, it becomes an object of study and thus a document. It operates, as Briet says it must, as “evidence in support of a fact”.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a 'document'?" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 48, no. 9 (Sept 1997): 804-809.&lt;/ref&gt; An object’s treatment as evidence is contingent not only on its own properties but on its very framing as a source of information. It must be organized into a meaningful relationship with other evidence in order to have the indexical power of evidence.

According to one scholar, "One of Briet's most important insights was that individual documents may be interpreted in different ways by different people wishing to put them to different uses for different purposes. This variability of interpretation is characteristic of documents even at the level of individual words, and the different decisions made by different translators at the word level can have significant consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Furner, Jonathan. (2008). "Review: What Is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. By Suzanne Briet. Translated and edited by Ronald E. Day and Laurent Martinet with Hermina G. B. Anghelescu." Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record 43.1, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Briet developed the notion of ''indice'' (literally "index") as not only pointing to an object but also reflective of the networks in which that object appears as a named thing, leading to a semiotics-inspired definition of "document." Furthermore, Briet argued that techniques and technologies are expressions of a networked culture. One scholar explains the idea this way: "Information and communication technologies may introduce a 'new rhythm' to society and culture, but they themselves are a "symptom" of Western social development."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, technique and technology are historically specific and symptomatic of culture. Briet argues that documentation must respond by incorporating these symptoms and specificities of Western culture but also must incorporate "Western modernity's opposite trend toward global expansion."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"/&gt; Briet also saw knowledge as embedded and emergent in cultural and social production and saw modernity as the growth of networks of knowledge. Indeed, in an increasingly globalized world, Briet argued for documentation to take up the call of material necessity rather than be put into the service of culture or any one culture; that is, "documentation marks the importance of particular, more 'localized' or specialized cultures in terms of their material needs, their specialized vocabularies, and the techniques and technologies needed to provide documentary services to these groups."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Technical Cooperation Program''' ('''TTCP''') is a long-standing international organisation concerned with cooperation on defence science and technology matters, including national security and civil defence. Its membership comprises [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US).

==History==

===Declaration Of Common Purpose===

TTCP commenced in 1957 as a bilateral activity between the United Kingdom and the United States when the US President and the UK Prime Minister made the following Declaration of Common Purpose:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/ttcp/|title=TTCP website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The arrangements which the nations of the free world have made for collective defense and mutual help are based on the recognition that the concept of national self sufficiency is now out of date. The countries of the free world are interdependent and only in genuine partnership, by combining their resources and sharing tasks in many fields, can progress and safety be found. For our part we have agreed that our two countries will henceforth act in accordance with this principle.}}

===Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program===

Immediately following the Declaration of Common Purpose, the Canadian government subscribed to the principle of interdependence and was admitted by the UK and the US. The resulting arrangement was known as the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program (or TTCP for short).

===Australia and New Zealand===

Australia joined TTCP in 1965; the organisation's name was changed from '''''Tripartite''' Technical Cooperation Program'' to '''''The''' Technical Cooperation Program'', which allowed the abbreviation for the organisation to be kept as '''TTCP'''. New Zealand joined TTCP in 1969.

==Organisation==

===Top level===

The organisation of TTCP is headed up by a senior official from each of the five participating nations, known collectively as the Principals. Supporting the Principals are their TTCP Deputies, based in Washington, and a secretariat.

===Technical organisation===

Reporting to the Principals are a number of multilateral&lt;!-- What is a "multilateral" group?? --&gt; "TTCP Groups", each comprising Technical Panels and time limited Action Groups. In April 2009 there were 11 TTCP Groups:
*Aerospace Systems Group
*Chemical, Biological &amp; Radiological Defence Group (CBR)
*Conventional Weapons Technology Group
*Command, Control, Communications &amp; Information Systems Group (C3I)&lt;ref&gt;Note that although C3I is more commonly used as an abbreviation for Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence, in the case of TTCP, the I abbreviates "Information". Two reasons for this are that there is a separate group of Five Eyes organisations that address cooperation in the Intelligence domains, and Intelligence is NOT part of the TTCP domain.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Electronic Warfare Systems Group (EW)
*Human Resources &amp; Performance Group (HUM)
*Joint Systems &amp; Analysis Group (JSA)
*Land Systems Group
*Maritime Systems Group
*Materials &amp; Processing Technology Group
*Sensors Group

Each Technical Panel is expected to establish and monitor major collaborative projects in priority areas of defined mutual national interest. An Action Group is more limited in scope than a Technical Panel and has clearly stated objectives and preset milestones. It is formed by a "TTCP Group" to address a specific high priority problem and is terminated on completion of its assignment.

With the cutbacks in US and Australian defense/defence spending at the start of the 2010s, international [[face-to-face interaction]] in TTCP has been severely reduced.

==The "Five Eyes" and other international organisations==

Three TTCP nations (Canada, UK and the US) are also members of the [[NATO Research and Technology Organisation]]. Four of the nations (Australia, Canada, UK and US) are also members of the twenty seven nation [[Multilateral Interoperability Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mip-site.org/010_Public_Home_News.htm Multilateral Interoperability Programme website]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five TTCP nations, only the UK is a member of the [[European Defence Agency]].

Collectively the five nations comprising TTCP are often referred to as the "[[Five Eyes]]" community for intelligence and also participate in the following related activities:
* [[ABCA Armies]]: Australian, British, Canadian, United States and New Zealand Armies - originally '''A'''ustralian, '''B'''ritish, '''C'''anadian and '''A'''merican Armies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abca-armies.org/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=ABCA website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thermomonosporaceae'' represents a [[Family (biology)|Family]] of bacteria that share similar [[Genotype|genotypic]] and [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics. The Family ''Thermomonosporaceae''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Int. J. Syst. Evol.

They produce a branched substrate [[mycelium]] bearing aerial [[hyphae]] that undergo differentiation into single or short chains of [[spore|arthrospores]]. Thermomonosporaceae contains four genera, ''Thermomonospora'', ''[[Actinomadura]]'', ''[[Actinocorallia]]'' and ''Spirillospora''.&lt;ref name="Zhang2001"&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Int. J. Syst.

All species of Thermomonosporaceae share the same [[cell wall]] type (type III; meso-diaminopimelic acid), a similar menaquinone profile in which MK-9(H6)is predominant, and [[Fatty acid methyl ester|fatty acid profile]] type 3a. The presence of the diagnostic sugar madurose is variable, but can be found in most species of this family. The polar lipid profiles are characterized as phospholipid type PI for most species of ''Thermomonospora'', ''Actinomadura'' and ''Spirillospora''.

'''Tony (Anthony) Steuer''', CLU, LA, CPFFE (born 1964) is an American financial [[author]], blogger, insurance consumer [[advocate]] and founder of the Insurance Bill of Rights Movement. He is best known for his ''Questions and Answers on Life Insurance'' book series. He has written five books since 2010, two of which have received the Excellence in Financial Literacy Education Award.

He is currently a regular contributor to websites including: [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/10/your-money/10money.html]''The New York Times'', reviews.com, bankrate.com, foxbusiness.com, yahoo.com, black enterprise.com, usnews.com, nytimes.com, washingtonpost.com, wisebread.com, forbes.com and mint.com. He also appears regularly on Bottom Line Personal, investopedia.com, A.M Best Review, insurancethoughtleadership.com, thinkadvisor.com, financialfinesse.com, ''[[Nolo.com]]'', ''The Nest'', and ''Love to Know''., beyondtype1.org and insulinnation.com.

He is currently a frequent guest contributor on national radio shows, including ''The Prudent Money Show'' and ''Your Financial Editor'', where he provides non-biased advice on life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prudentmoney.com/podcast/112409-PrudentMoney.mp3/]''Prudent Money Radio Show''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeinsurancetoolbook.com/slideshare/podcasts]''Podcast from Your Financial Editor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written and published free financial literacy tools available on his blog and website.

== Activism ==

Steuer is known as a spokesperson and leader in the financial literacy movement. In 2016, Steuer’s son (age 11) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Faced with a chronic illness that requires constant maintenance, Steuer realized his own son could be denied insurance coverage under the health care plan proposed by President Donald Trump. This led him to author the petition Fair Health Insurance For All, described as a petition to the U.S. Senate to seek a “solution” to health insurance costs. And that “any solution should simplify and seek to reduce costs while maintaining and increasing benefits.”

Steuer also authored The Insurance Bill of Rights, which is designed to empower consumers, and provides a Best Practices Roadmap for members of the insurance industry.

== Early life and education ==

Steuer was born on March 8, 1964, in [[San Francisco]], California.  He was raised in San Francisco and later moved to Marin County where attended Redwood High School.  He attended [[California State University Chico]] where he received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business (Finance) and was an intern for a free legal information service on campus, C.L.I.C. (Community Legal Information Center).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aschico.com/CLIC] Community Legal Information Center&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) Designation in the late 1980s and the Certified Personal and Family Finance Educator (CPFFE) from the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences in 2012. Steuer is one of 40 licensed Life and Disability Insurance agents from the California Department of Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0200-industry/0050-renew-license/0200-requirements/life-disability.cfm]''California Department of Insurance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Prior to becoming an author and insurance consumer advocate, Steuer was an assistant vice president with Acordia-Lloyd, a multi-line insurance brokerage firm.  He started his own practice in 1995.

== Writing ==
Tony is the award-winning author of five books, including two consecutive Excellence in Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Awards: Questions and Answers on Life Insurance and The Questions and Answers on Life Insurance Workbook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifleawards.org/hall-of-fame/2011-winners/] 2011 Excellence In Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifleawards.org/hall-of-fame/2012-winners/] 2012 Excellence In Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopian studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that researches utopianism in all its forms, including utopian politics, utopian literature and art, utopian theory, and intentional communities. The term utopia was created by [[Thomas More]] in [[Utopia (book)|a book with the same name]] in 1516.

[[File:Proton Prevé RESS (Reinforced Safety Structure) (03).jpg|thumb|right| [[Proton Prevé]] with unibody construction]]

A '''vehicle frame''', also known as its ''[[chassis]]'', is the main supporting [[structure]] of a [[motor vehicle]], to which all other components are attached, comparable to the [[skeleton]] of an [[organism]].

Until the 1930s virtually every car had a structural frame, separate from its body. This construction design is known as ''[[body-on-frame]]''. Over time, nearly all passenger cars have migrated to [[Coachbuilder#Unibody construction|unibody construction]], meaning their chassis and bodywork have been integrated into one another. 

Nearly all [[truck]]s, buses, and most [[Pickup truck|pickups]] continue to use a separate frame as their chassis.

==Functions==
The main functions of a frame in motor vehicles are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nBVefxD_0agC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=The+main+functions+of+an+automobile+frame |page=410 |title=A textbook of automobile engineering |first=R. K. |last=Rajput |publisher=Laxmi Publications |year=2007 |isbn= 9788170089919 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To support the vehicle's mechanical components and body
# To deal with static and dynamic loads, without undue deflection or distortion.
:These include:
::*Weight of the body, passengers, and cargo loads.
::*Vertical and torsional twisting transmitted by going over uneven surfaces.
::*Transverse lateral forces caused by road conditions, side wind, and steering the vehicle.
::*Torque from the engine and transmission.
::*Longitudinal tensile forces from starting and acceleration, as well as compression from braking.
::*Sudden impacts from collisions.

Types of frame according to the construction:
::* Ladder type frame 
::*X-Type frame
::*Off set frame
::* Off set with cross member frame
::*Perimeter Frame

==Frame rails==

[[File:1956truckframe.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pickup truck]] frame. Notice hat-shaped crossmember in the background, c-shape rails and cross member in center, and a slight arc over the axle.]]
Typically the material used to construct vehicle chassis and frames is [[Steel#Carbon steels|carbon steel]]; or aluminum alloys to achieve a more light-weight construction. In the case of a separate chassis, the frame is made up of [[structural element]]s called the ''rails'' or [[Beam (structure)|''beams'']]. These are ordinarily made of steel ''channel'' sections, made by folding, rolling or pressing steel plate.

There are three main designs for these. If the material is folded twice, an open-ended cross-section, either C-shaped or hat-shaped (U-shaped) results.
"Boxed" frames contain chassis rails that are closed, either by somehow welding them up, or by using premanufactured [[Hollow structural section|metal tubing]].

&lt;big&gt;'''C-shape'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By far the most common, the C-channel rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle at one time or another. It is made by taking a flat piece of steel (usually ranging in thickness from 1/8" to 3/16") and rolling both sides over to form a c-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hat'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hat frames resemble a "U" and may be either right-side-up or inverted with the open area facing down. Not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust, however they can be found on 1936–1954 [[Chevrolet]] cars and some [[Studebaker]]s.
[[File:Chassis (4689544258).jpg|thumb|High performance custom frame, using boxed rails and tube sections]]
Abandoned for a while, the hat frame gained popularity again when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars, in effect creating a boxed frame.

&lt;big&gt;'''Boxed'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Originally, boxed frames were made by welding two matching C-rails together to form a rectangular tube. Modern techniques, however, use a process similar to making C-rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet.

In the 1960s, the boxed frames of conventional American cars were spot-welded here and there down the seam; when turned into NASCAR "stock car" racers, the box was continuously welded from end to end for extra strength.

===Design features===
[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|right|thumb|Pickup truck chassis holding the vehicle's engine, drivetrain, suspension, and wheels]]
While appearing at first glance as a simple form made of metal, frames encounter great amounts of stress and are built accordingly. The first issue addressed is '''beam height''', or the height of the vertical side of a frame. The taller the frame, the better it is able to resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame. This is the reason [[truck|semi-trucks]] have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker.

As looks, ride quality, and handling became more important to consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames. The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups. Instead of running straight over both [[axle]]s, arched frames sit lower—roughly level with their axles—and curve up over the axles and then back down on the other side for bumper placement. Kick-ups do the same thing, but don't curve down on the other side, and are more common on front ends.

Another feature seen are tapered rails that narrow vertically and/or horizontally in front of a vehicle's cabin. This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much of a load as the back. Design developments include frames that use more than one shape in the same frame rail. For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame in front of the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed.

On ''perimeter'' frames, the areas where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating what is known as ''torque boxes''.

==Types==

===Ladder frame===
[[File:Developed ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and lightening holes (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and [[lightening holes]]]]
So named for its resemblance to a ladder, the ladder frame is one of the simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks.  This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the [[floor pan]] sitting above the frame instead of inside it.

The term '''unibody''' or '''unit body''' is short for '''unitized body''', or alternatively ''unitary construction'' design. It is &lt;blockquote&gt;A type of body/frame construction in which the body of the vehicle, its floor plan and chassis form a single structure. Such a design is generally lighter and more rigid than a vehicle having a separate body and frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=unit body |work=engineering-dictionary.org |url= http://www.engineering-dictionary.org/Unit_body  |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Traditional [[body-on-frame]] architecture has shifted to the lighter unitized body structure that is now used on most cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/shift-unitized-body-no-slam-dunk |title=Shift to Unitized Body No Slam Dunk |date=1 September 2008 |first=Bill |last=Visnic |work=Wards Auto |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last UK mass-produced car with a separate chassis was the [[Triumph Herald]], which was discontinued in 1971.

Integral frame and body construction requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame. In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle—forces from driving as well as cargo loads. Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together, by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or by a combination of these techniques. Although this is sometimes also referred to as a [[monocoque]] structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are still ribs, bulkheads and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description [[semi-monocoque]] more appropriate.

The first attempt to develop such a design technique was on the 1922 [[Lancia Lambda]] to provide structural stiffness and a lower body height for its [[Torpedo (car)|torpedo car]] body.&lt;ref name="Genta"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KxTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Probably+the+first+attempt+to+develop+such+an+architecture+was+done+with+the+1922+Lancia+Lambda |pages=23–26 |title=The Motor Car Past, Present and Future |first=Giancarlo |last=Genta |first2=Lorenzo |last2=Morello |first3=Francesco |last3=Cavallino |first4=Luigi |last4=Filtri |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=9789400785519 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lambda though its open layout, with unstressed roof, made it less a ''monocoque'' shell and more a bowl - 11,000 were produced.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/news/a17656/from-the-carriage-trade-to-carbon-fiber/ |title=From the Carriage Trade to Carbon Fiber All about an automobile's body/chassis |publisher=Road and Track |first=Dennis |last=Simanaitis |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key role in developing the unitary body was played by the American firm the Budd Company, now [[Budd Company#Automobiles|ThyssenKrupp Budd]].&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt; Budd supplied pressed-steel bodywork, fitted to separate frames, to automakers [[Dodge]], [[Ford]], [[Buick]], and the French company, [[Citroën]].  

In 1930, [[Joseph Ledwinka]], an engineer with Budd, designed an automobile prototype with full unitary construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagley.org/librarynews/automobile-engineer-joseph-ledwinka |publisher=Hagley Museum and Library  |title=Joseph Ledwinka |author= |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citroën]] purchased this fully unitary body design for the [[Citroën Traction Avant]]. This high volume, mass production car was introduced in 1934 and sold 760,000 units over the next 23 years of production.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt; This application was the first iteration of the modern structural integration of body and chassis, using spot welded deep stamped steel sheets into a structural cage, including sills, pillars and roof beams.&lt;ref name="Genta"/&gt; In addition to a unitary body with no separate frame, the Traction Avant also featured other innovations such as four-wheel [[independent suspension]], and [[front-wheel drive]]. The result was a low-slung vehicle with an open, flat-floored interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiconline.com/news/20-cars-changed-automotive-industry-forever |title=20 Cars that Changed the Automotive Industry Forever|publisher=Magic Online|author= |date=13 October 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Chrysler Airflow]] (1934–1937) Budd supplied a variation - three main sections from the Airflow's body were welded into what Chrysler called a bridge-truss construction. For the Chrysler Airflow unfortunately, this method was not ideal - panel fits were poor.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt; To convince a skeptical public of the strength of ''unibody'' both Citroën and Chrysler created advertising films showing cars surviving after being pushed off a cliff.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt;

[[Opel]] was the second European and the first German car manufacturer to produce a car with unibody structure - production of the compact [[Opel Olympia|Olympia]] started in 1935. A larger [[Opel Kapitän|Kapitän]] went into production in 1938, although its front longitudinal beams were stamped separately and then attached to the main body.

The streamlined 1936 [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] with conventional [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] utilized a unibody structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://theoldmotor.com/?p=131195 |title=The Designs of John Tjaarda Result in the 1936 Lincoln Zephyr |date=27 December 2014 |publisher=The Old Motor |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, unit construction was no longer a new idea for cars, "but it was unheard of in the [American] low-price field [and] [[Nash Motors|Nash]] wanted a bigger share of that market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3dBsrwHxxq8C&amp;q=Unit+construction+wasn't+a+new+idea+in+1941,+but+it+was+unheard+of+in+the+low-price+field.+Nash+wanted+a+bigger+share+of+that+market,+and+its+all-new+unibody+600+series |page=54|title=Great cars of the forties |author=''Consumer Guide'' Auto Editors |publisher=Louis Weber |date=1985 |isbn=9780881762808 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://retrorambling.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/great-american-cars-of-the-forties-1941-nash-600/ |title=Great American Cars Of The Forties – 1941 Nash 600 |date=8 July 2014 |first=Tidious |last=Ted |work=Retrorambling |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single unit body construction of the [[Nash 600]] provided weight savings and Nash's Chairman and CEO, [[George W. Mason]] was convinced "that unibody was the wave of the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BkBWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22single+unit%22+body+construction.+Weight+savings+realized+on+the+1941+Nash+600+convinced+Mason+that+unibody+was+the+wave+of+the+future.+He+wanted+real+and+distinct+product+advantages |page=33 |title=My Mother's Compact Car: Twenty Years Of Rambler |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=2 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narus"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E7KhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Unibody+was+the+big+news.+The+600+was+unique |page=27 |title=Nash, 1939-1954 |first=Donald J. |last=Narus |publisher=New Albany Books |year=2012 |isbn=9781467521246 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then more cars were redesigned to the unibody structure, which is now "considered standard in the industry".&lt;ref name="Narus"/&gt; By 1960, unitized body design was used by Detroit's Big Three on their compact cars ([[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Plymouth Valiant]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair]]). After Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form [[American Motors]], its Rambler-badged automobiles continued exclusively building variations of the unibody.

Although the 1934 [[Chrysler Airflow]] had a weaker than usual frame and body framework welded to the chassis to provide stiffness, in 1960, Chrysler moved from body-on-frame construction to a unit-body design for most of its cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/body/unit-body.html |title=Chrysler moves to Unibody (unit-body construction): 1960 |work=allpar.com |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the American-manufactured unibody automobiles used [[torque boxes]] in their vehicle design to reduce vibrations and chassis flex, with the exception of the [[Chevy II]] which had a bolt-on front apron (erroneously referred to as a subframe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ask.cars.com/2008/10/what-is-unibody.html |title=What is unibody construction? |work=Ask.Cars.com |first=Joe |last=Bruzek |date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Motors (with its partner [[Renault]]) during the late-1970s incorporated unibody construction when designing the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] platform using the manufacturing principles (unisides, floorpan with integrated frame rails and crumple zones, and roof panel) used in its passenger cars, such as the [[AMC Hornet|Hornets]] and all-wheel-drive [[AMC Eagle|Eagles]] for a new type of frame called the "Uniframe ... a robust stamped steel frame welded to a strong unit-body structure, giving the strength of a conventional heavy frame with the weight advantages of Unibody construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Iem-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=In+engineering+the+XJ+Jeeps,+Roy+Lunn+and+his+team+came+up+with+a+new+type+of+frame+called+the+Uniframe+a+strong+unit-+body+structure,+giving+the+strength+of+a+conventional+heavy+frame+with+the+weight+advantages+of+Unibody+construction |page=124 |title=Jeep: The History of America's Greatest Vehicle |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |year=2014 |isbn=9781627882187 |publisher=Motorbooks |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was also used with the XJC concept developed by American Motors prior to its absorption by Chrysler, which later became the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)]]. —including modern day sport utility vehicles ([[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] et al.).  

The ''unibody'' is now the preferred construction for mass market automobiles and [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]]. This design provides weight savings, improved space utilisation, and ease of manufacture. Acceptance grew dramatically in the wake of the two [[energy crises]] of the 1970s and the [[2000s energy crisis|2000s]] where compact SUVs using a truck platform (primarily the USA market) were subjected to CAFE standards after 2005 (by the late-2000s truck-based compact SUVs were phased out and replaced with crossovers). An additional advantage of a strong-bodied car lies in the improved crash protection for its passengers.

===Backbone tube===
{{main article|Backbone chassis}}
A backbone chassis is a type of automobile construction chassis that is similar to the body-on-frame  design. Instead of a two-dimensional ladder type structure, it consists of a strong tubular backbone (usually rectangular in cross section) that connects the front and rear suspension attachment areas. A body is then placed on this structure.

===X-frame===
[[File:Chassis (4689544886).jpg|thumb|Rolling X-frame chassis]]
This is the design used for the full-size American models of General Motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s in which the rails from alongside the engine seemed to cross in the passenger compartment, each continuing to the opposite end of the crossmember at the extreme rear of the vehicle. It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps, since each row had to cover frame rails as well. Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame, but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame.

The X-frame was claimed to improve on previous designs, but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side-impact and collision protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-an-x-ray-look-at-gms-x-frame-1957-1970/ |title=Automotive History: An X-Ray Look At GM's X Frame (1957 – 1970) |first=Paul |last=Niedermeyer |date=19 January 2012 |website=Curb Side Classic |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This design was replaced by perimeter frames.

===Perimeter frame===
[[File:Anadol FW11 prototype chassis.jpg|thumb|[[Reliant FW11|Anadol FW11]] prototype with perimeter frame]]
Similar to a ladder frame, but the middle sections of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and rear rails just behind the rocker / sill panels. This was done to allow for a lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for [[body-on-frame]] cars in the United States, but not in the rest of the world, until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. As of 2014, there are no perimeter frame automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the perimeter frame passenger car in the United States (the Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the perimeter frame since 1963, but its fourth generation variant to its current generation as of 2016 has elements of the perimeter frame integrated with an internal endoskeleton which serves as a clamshell).

In addition to a lowered roof, the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety in the event of a side impact. However, the design lacks stiffness, because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance, and is used in combination with torque boxes and soft suspension settings.

===Platform frame===

}}
This is a modification of the perimeter frame, or of the backbone frame, in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes also the luggage compartment floor, have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts, for extra strength and rigidity. Neither floor pieces are simply sheet metal straight off the roll, but have been stamped with ridges and hollows for extra strength.

Platform chassis were used on several successful European cars. The most well-known of this is the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], on which it is called body on pan construction. Another German example are the [[Mercedes-Benz Ponton|Mercedes-Benz "Ponton"]] cars of the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?4743728-Mercedes-Benz-190SL-the-Teutonic-T-bird-is-born-1954 |title=Thread: Mercedes Benz 190SL, the "Teutonic T-bird" is born, 1954... |publisher=vwvortex.com |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was called a "frame floor" in English-language advertisements.

The French [[Renault 4]] of which over eight million were made, also used a platform frame. The frame of the [[Citroen 2CV]] represents a more minimal interpretation of a platform chassis.

===Space frame===
{{main article|Space frame#Cars}}
In a (tubular) spaceframe chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a three-dimensional skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have little or no structural function. In order to maximise rigidity and minimise weight, the design makes maximum use of triangles, and all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compressive, never bending, so they can be kept as thin as possible.
[[File:Jaguar C-Type Frame.JPG|thumb|right|Jaguar C-Type frame]]
The first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the  1930s by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[William Bushnell Stout]] (the [[Dymaxion car|Dymaxion]] and the [[Stout Scarab]]) who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 150" &gt;{{Cite book |title=Colin Chapman: Inside the Innovator |last=Ludvigsen |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen |publisher=Haynes Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=1-84425-413-5 |ref={{harvid|Ludvigsen|Colin Chapman}} |pages=150–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1951 [[Jaguar C-Type]] [[sports car racing|racing sports car]] that won the [[Le Mans 24 hours]] twice, had a lightweight multi-tubular, triangulated frame, over which an aerodynamic aluminium body was crafted.

The Italian term ''[[Superleggera]]'' (meaning "super-light") was trademarked by [[Carrozzeria Touring]] for lightweight sports-car body construction that ''only resembles'' a space-frame chassis. Using a three-dimensional frame that consists of a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the radiator, cowl, and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure. A skin is attached to the outside of the frame and is often made of aluminium. This body construction is however ''not'' stress-bearing, and still requires the addition of a chassis.

===Subframe===
{{main article|Subframe}}
A subframe is a distinct structural frame component, to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle's structure. Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque, the rigid subframe can handle high chassis forces and can transfer them evenly to a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a unitized body shell. Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars, and are used to attach the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] to the vehicle.  A subframe may also contain the [[Engine#Modern|engine]] and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. It is normally of box steel construction, but may be tubular.

Examples of passenger car use include the 1967–1981 [[GM F platform]], the numerous years and models built on the [[GM X platform (1962)]], GM's M/L platform vans(Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, which included an all-wheel drive variant), and the unibody [[AMC Pacer]] that incorporated a front subframe to isolate the passenger compartment from engine, suspension, and steering loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5gSgvG7JNp0C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Subframe+cars |pages=123–124 |title=Hot rodder's bible |first=Gerry |last=Burger |first2=Steve |last2=Hendrickson |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=9780760307670 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hpRWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=AMC+Pacer+smooth+and+quiet+ride+can+probably+be+attributed+to+a+front+subframe+that+isolates+the+passenger+capsule+from+engine,+suspension+and+steering+loads |page=24 |title=AMC Pacer station wagon |journal=Car and Driver |volume=22 |year=1977 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3323">In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''word RAM''' (word random access machine) model is a [[model of computation]] that is a [[random access machine]] able to do bitwise operations on a single word of {{mvar|w}} bits. The model was created by [[Michael Fredman]] and [[Dan Willard]] in 1990 to simulate programming languages like [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref name="Fredman90"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredman|first1=Michael|author1-link=Michael Fredman|last2=Willard|first2=Dan|author2-link=Dan Willard|title=Blasting through the information theoretic barrier with fusion trees|journal=[[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]|pages=1–7|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==
The word RAM model is an [[abstract machine]] similar to a [[random access machine]], but with additional capabilities. It works with words of size up to {{mvar|w}} bits, meaning it can store [[integer (computing)|integers]] up to size &lt;math&gt;2^w&lt;/math&gt;. Because the model assumes that the [[word size]] matches the problem size, that is, for a problem of size {{mvar|n}}, &lt;math&gt;w \ge \log n&lt;/math&gt;, the word RAM model is a [[transdichotomous model]]. The model allows [[bitwise operations]] such as [[arithmetic]] and [[logical shift]]s to be done in [[constant time]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilkinson|first= Bryan|year= 2015|title= Exploring the Problem Space of Orthogonal Range Searching|type= PhD|publisher= Aarhus University|url= http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/96602370/Bryan_Wilkinson_dissertation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of possible values is {{mvar|U}}, where &lt;math&gt;U \le 2^w&lt;/math&gt;.

== Algorithms and data structures ==
In the word RAM model, [[integer sorting]] can be done fairly efficiently. Yijie Han and [[Mikkel Thorup]] created a [[randomized algorithm]] to sort integers in [[expected time]]  of (in [[Big O notation]]) &lt;math&gt;O(n \sqrt{\log \log n})&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Han02"&gt;{{citation

 | title = Deterministic sorting in {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}} time and linear space
 | volume = 50
 | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dynamic predecessor problem]] is also commonly analyzed in the word RAM model, and was the original motivation for the model. [[Dan Willard]] used [[y-fast trie]]s to solve this in &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log U)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; [[Michael Fredman]] and Willard also solved the problem using [[fusion tree]]s in &lt;math&gt;O(\log_w n)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;ref name="Fredman90"/&gt;
