'''Aalto University''' ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopisto}}, {{lang-sv|Aalto-universitetet}}) is a [[university]] primarily located in [[Greater Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (established 1849), the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (established 1904), and the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (established 1871). The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that fosters innovation, merging the three institutions into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |title=EU Policy Blog |publisher=Microsoft |work=EU Policy Blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170729/http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is composed of six schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff members, making it Finland's second largest university. The main campus of Aalto University is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]], where the engineering schools as well as the bachelor programs of the School of Business operate. Other functions of the [[Aalto University School of Business|School of Business]] are located in [[Töölö]]. The [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|School of Arts, Design and Architecture]] is mainly located in [[Arabianranta]]. All of the university's activities will be located in the Otaniemi campus by 2020. In addition to the Greater Helsinki area, the university also operates in [[Mikkeli]] and [[Pori]].

Aalto University's operations showcase Finland’s experiment in higher education. The Aalto Design Factory, Aalto Ventures Program and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society (Aaltoes), among others, drive the university's mission for a radical shift towards multidisciplinary learning and have contributed substantially to the emergence of Helsinki as a hotbed for startups.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Aaltoes is Europe’s largest and most active student run entrepreneurship community that has founded major concepts such as the Startup Sauna accelerator program and [[Slush|Slush (event)]] startup event.

The university is named in honour of [[Alvar Aalto]], a prominent Finnish architect, designer and [[alumnus]] of the former Helsinki University of Technology, who was also instrumental in designing a large part of the university's main campus in Otaniemi.

== History ==
In 2004, a workgroup led by Anne Brunila of the Finnish Ministry of Finance concluded that Finland had too many universities and other institutes of tertiary education which should be consolidated. Following this, [[Yrjö Sotamaa]], president of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] at the time, proposed the merger of Aalto University's founding schools in his president's opening speech in 2005. Sotamaa's line of reasoning was that this move would create a unique interdisciplinary university that was needed to create new innovative thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The idea received attention within the Finnish Ministry of Education, which appointed Raimo Sailas, a leading official at the Ministry of Finance, to investigate the possibility of a merger. After Sailas' group reported that it considered the merger to be beneficial to the Finnish academic world and economy, the Finnish government decided to go on with the project on November 11, 2007.

On May 29, 2008, the government announced that the new university would be named after the Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]] in honor of his achievements in technology, economics and art. The Finnish Minister of Education at the time, Ms. [[Sari Sarkomaa]], together with representatives of Finnish industries and professional organisations, signed the Aalto University charter on June 25, 2008 in [[Helsinki]]. On December 19, 2008, Prof. [[Tuula Teeri]] was selected by the Board to be the first President of Aalto University.

Aalto University started operating on January 1, 2010. In the process of creating the university the university law of Finland was rewritten for the university to be allowed to collect endowment. The university managed to reach its goal of collecting 200 million euros in private donations. The sum was augmented by 2.5 times by the Finnish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123144055/https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Aalto AlumniNET|author=Mira Network AB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helsinki University of Technology ===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|Surveying students with professor in the early days of the university of technology.]]
{{main|Helsinki University of Technology}}

As the Aalto University was founded the four schools of science and engineering were formed out of the departments of the '''[[Helsinki University of Technology]]''' (TKK), founded in 1849 by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas I]]. It received university status in 1908. In 1966, the University of Technology moved from [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] in downtown Helsinki to its current Otaniemi campus, designed by [[Alvar Aalto]]. At the time of creation of Aalto University, TKK had about 250 professors and approximately 15,000 students. This means the largest part of the Aalto University is formed from the former Helsinki University of Technology.

In 2011, the former University of Technology (then known as ''Aalto University School of Science and Technology'') was split up into four schools, corresponding to the former TKK faculties: [[Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|School of Chemical Technology]] (CHEM), [[Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|School of Electrical Engineering]] (ELEC), [[Aalto University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] (ENG), and [[Aalto University School of Science|School of Science]] (SCI).

=== Helsinki School of Economics ===
{{main|Helsinki School of Economics}}

The '''Helsinki School of Economics''' ('''HSE''') was established in [[Helsinki]] in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974, when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university.

Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed ''Aalto University School of Economics'', and is currently known as ''Aalto University School of Business'' (Aalto BIZ).

=== University of Art and Design Helsinki ===
{{main|University of Art and Design Helsinki}}
[[File:Leo Mechelin (cropped).png|thumb|[[Leo Mechelin]] served as one of the first presidents of the school of art and design.]]

The '''University of Art and Design Helsinki''' has been the largest [[art university]] in the [[Nordic countries]]. It was founded in 1871. Media Centre Lume - the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media - is also located in the university. The university awarded the following academic degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Arts]].

The university has been active in establishing research projects and industrial collaborations via the private sector. During the rectorship of [[Yrjö Sotamaa]] the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation networks.

Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Art and Design. In 2012, the Department of Architecture, which historically has been a part of the Helsinki University of Technology, was moved to the school, and the name was changed to ''Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture'' (Aalto ARTS).

== Administration and organisation ==

=== Governance ===
The university, which is incorporated as ''Aalto University Foundation'', is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board. The Board decides on the Foundation's strategy, operation and financial issues, is responsible for any far-reaching plans and appoints the University president and vice rectors. Formerly working as the Provost of Aalto University, Ilkka Niemelä was elected President of Aalto University in 2017. The first President of Aalto University was [[Tuula Teeri]]. The university is organized into six schools with their respective deans and administrative structures.

=== Schools ===

=== Studies ===

==== Study in Science and Technology ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|Aalto University School of Engineering|Aalto University School of Science}}

[[File:Mathematics lecture at the Helsinki University of Technology.jpg|thumb|A lecture of mathematics for undergraduates inside the main building.]]

All engineering programmes offered by the schools of science and technology lead to the degree of ''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'' (M.Sc.(Tech.), Master of Science in Technology), a five-year taught master's degree, which is fairly similar to the German {{Interlanguage link multi|Diplom-Ingenieur|de}} degrees. From 2005, according to the [[Bologna process]], all students must also complete a bachelor's degree (B.Sc.(Tech), [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science in Technology]]), in Finnish ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' or ''TkK'', before the DI or architect's degree. However, the schools of science and technology do not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student may only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. The schools of science and technology require a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies are offered completely in English.

Undergraduate studies are generally quite similar in between different programs with a considerable part being taken by a tuition of a solid base in mathematics and physics.

Apart from numerous programs in Finnish/Swedish, various international Master's programs are offered exclusively for studies in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/technology/|title=Aalto Game Changers. Change the world.|author=|date=11 July 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[postgraduate]] degrees given are ''tekniikan lisensiaatti'' (Lic.Sc.(Tech.), [[Licentiate (degree)|Licenciate of Science in Technology]]) and ''tekniikan tohtori'' (D.Sc.(Tech.), [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science in Technology]]).

Finnish students are accepted mainly on the basis of result in the national DIA entrance exam. The exam variant taken by most entrants mainly tests quantitative ability in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but specialized tests are available for students applying to a number of programs. The score required for entry to the Aalto University varies much depending on the intended field of study, however, in general the scores required for the Aalto University are higher than for any other university granting entry through the DIA exam. For example, the mean sum of mathematics and physics DIA exam scores was 7.2 in the year 2010, whereas the mean minimum sum of mathematics and physics exam scores for gaining admission to an Aalto program was 17.1-20.1, depending on the priority point distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Valintaopas|url = http://dia.fi/media/4005/dia_hakuopas270111_fi_fk_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aalto also contains five of the most selective programs with respect to the matriculation exam scores, out of approximately total of 50 [[Diplomi-insinööri|university technology programs]] in the nation, of which approximately 30 are outside of Aalto, and the three most selective programs with respect to entrance exam and combined scores. The minimum scores required for these top programs are in the 95th-99th percentile range of the whole applicant pool, and approximately 98th-99.8th percentile of what would be the score distribution of the whole age group.

==== Study in Arts, Design and Architecture ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture}}
The School of Arts, Design and Architecture has been a leader in art and design education in Finland for over 138 years. It is an international postgraduate university institution with students from over 50 countries. It offers doctorate, master and bachelor's degrees in a wide range of disciplines - fine art, design, new media, art education, visual culture, motion picture and production design. School of Arts, Design and Architecture is a pioneer in research and in developing interdisciplinary study programmes.

The school received its current name in the beginning of 2012 when the architecture department moved in from the School of Engineering (previously part of Helsinki University of Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.aalto.fi/en/current/news/view/2012-01-02/|title=School of Arts, Design and Architecture began operations at the start of the year|publisher=Aalto University|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture programmes lead to the Master of Science degrees in architecture and landscape architecture.

==== Study in Business ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Business}}
The School of Business offers degrees in economics and business administration at the Bachelor, Master, Licentiate and Doctoral levels, along with MBA programs targeted to business professionals. Many of the degrees and programs are offered in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/business/|title=Aalto University Gets You More Than a Degree|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its degree programs, the school has a two-step program structure with a three-year bachelor's degree followed by a two-year master's degree. A doctoral degree normally takes four additional years. Financial Times ranked Aalto University School of Business 29th in the European Business school rankings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/european-business-school-rankings-2013#european-business-school-rankings-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of the Aalto University School of Business is located in Töölö, in the center of Helsinki. The school offers two Bachelor of Science Programs (one in Finnish at the Otaniemi campus and the other in English at the Mikkeli campus) and 13 Master of Science Programs (12 are offered in English).

The Aalto University School of Business is the first business school in Finland and the first business school in the Nordic countries to have received all three labels of excellence from the world’s leading business school accreditation bodies: [[AACSB]], [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]], [[EQUIS]]. This Triple Crown status is an honor held by only few business schools worldwide. The school is also an active member of the [[CEMS - The Global Alliance in Management Education|CEMS]] (Global Alliance in Management Education) and [[Partnership in International Management|PIM]] (Partnership in International Management).

===== MBA Programs =====
Aalto [[MBA]] and [[Executive MBA]] Programs are organized by [[Aalto University Executive Education]] Ltd. MBA and Executive MBA programs are offered in [[Helsinki]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Poland]] and have tuition fees, unlike the degree programs. The MBA program is taught through two-week modules by visiting faculty from some of the top business schools in the world, including [[Emory University]], [[Rutgers Business School]], [[University of South Carolina]], [[Georgetown University]], [[UCLA]], [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]], [[Queen’s University]], [[Rotterdam School of Management]], [[Indiana University]], [[ESADE]] and [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaltoee.fi/en|title=Valmennusta, kehittämispalveluja ja koulutusta - Aalto EE|author=|date=|website=aaltoee.fi|access-date=2011-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106022249/http://www.aaltoee.fi/en|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/program/business/|title=Aalto University Gets You More Than a Degree|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial Times ranked Aalto University School of Business 78th in Global [[MBA]] programs,&lt;ref name="rankings.ft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/masters-in-management-2013#masters-in-management-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 85th in [[Executive MBA]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/emba-ranking-2013#emba-ranking-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
[[File:Dome planck hfi.jpg|thumb|right|Radio science done with the receiver in the Planck probe reveals the age and composition of the universe.]]
Aalto University has defined four fundamental competence areas: ICT and digitalisation, Materials and sustainable use of natural resources, Global business dynamics and Art and design knowledge building. In addition to these, the university invests in three integrative multidisciplinary themes: Advanced energy solutions, Health and wellbeing, and Human-centred living environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/strengths/|title=Key research areas|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Aalto University have achieved notability in, among other things, [[low temperature physics]] (holding the current world record for the [[Coldest temperature recorded on Earth|lowest temperature achieved]]), the development of devices and methods for [[magnetoencephalography]], mobile communications, [[wood processing]], and neural networks, with professor [[Teuvo Kohonen]] initiating research in [[self-organizing map]]s. Additionally, the first commercialised [[total synthesis]], the synthesis of [[camphor]], was invented by [[Gustaf Komppa]], the first professor of chemistry at TKK&lt;ref&gt;Kemia-lehti. {{cite web|url=http://www.kemia-lehti.fi/pdf/gustafkomppa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140713/http://www.kemia-lehti.fi/pdf/gustafkomppa.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nobel laureate]] (chemistry, 1945) [[Artturi Virtanen]] held a professorship in biochemistry at TKK. More recently, the university has notably invested in the research of nanotechnology, operating the largest [[cleanroom]] facility in Northern Europe&lt;ref name="micronova"&gt;{{cite web | title=VTT inaugurated Microelectronics and Nanotechnology Centre 'Micronova' | accessdate=2009-10-08 | url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw53/linden.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest microscopy clusters in Europe.&lt;ref name="nanomicroscopy"&gt;{{cite web|title=TKK Nanomicroscopy Center |accessdate=2009-10-08 |url=http://nmc.tkk.fi/en/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717004627/http://nmc.tkk.fi/en/ |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MilliLab, a joint laboratory of [[VTT]] and Aalto University, built one of the radio receivers in the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] probe, which maps the [[cosmic microwave background]] for determining the age and composition of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/ulkomaat/2013032116811280_ul.shtml|title=Planck-luotain laittoi käsityksen kosmoksesta uusiksi|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centres of Excellence ===
Aalto University participates in seven Centres of Excellence ({{lang-fi|huippuyksikkö}}), selected by the [[Academy of Finland]] to represent the top research in the country, and receiving separate, fixed-period funding from the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/Centres-of-Excellence-/Aims/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928203831/http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/Centres-of-Excellence-/Aims/ |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the following units are designated Centres of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/fi/research/excellence_in_research/#sa_huippuyksikot|title=Tieteen huiput|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/excellence_in_research/#academy_of_finland_centres_of_excellence|title=Excellence in Research|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campuses ==
The main university campus is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]]. The other two campuses are located in [[Arabia, Finland|Arabia]] and [[Töölö]] in the former premises of TaiK and HSE, respectively, but are set to be gradually moved to Otaniemi.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Main Campus Otaniemi ===
The four Schools of Science and Technology as well as the bachelor programs of the School of Business are based in Otaniemi in Espoo, 10&amp;nbsp;km from the center of Helsinki, on a campus designed by Alvar Aalto. Otaniemi has a high concentration of high technology. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry's joint experimental laboratory KCL, and [[business incubator]]s Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated nearby. It is also directly adjacent to [[Keilaniemi]], with Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as [[Nokia]] and [[Fortum]]. The Otaniemi campus is connected by a 15-minute bus ride to the center of Helsinki. [[Länsimetro|A metro connection]] has just started operating.

The ‘Teekkarikylä’ Student Village, home to over 2,000 students, is also located in Otaniemi. There are over one hundred student organizations on campus which provide a range of opportunities to take part in pastimes of various kinds, from sports to music.

== Culture and student life ==
[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat ({{lang|fi|teekkarilakki}}) photographed on top of a mirror.]]
The Aalto University students are known for active student life.

An integral part of many student traditions play the brightly colored overalls worn to many events. The color of the overall signals what the student studies (e.g. the economy students are recognized from ''dollar green'' overalls). The student community has also organised important charity events. In fact, the name for these events ''tempaus'', has entered common language to describe any carnival-like charity event.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The students of technology ({{lang|fi|teekkarit}}) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft on many occasions (both formal and informal). Technology students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, [[student prank]]s (''jäynä''), similar in principle to [[MIT hack]]s. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of [[Paavo Nurmi]] onto the 300-year-old wreck of [[Regalskeppet Vasa]] just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref name="iltasanomatttkyarchive"&gt;[[Ilta-Sanomat]] 5 July 1961 "Vasan veijarit", scan available at  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html archive.org dump of ttky.fi].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although student traditions vary in between the different constituent schools common activities started to burgeon early after the foundation of Aalto University. The most noticeable student event of the first year of the university was ''Aalto on Tracks'', where a group of 100 students came together to rent a private train which they traveled 10 000&amp;nbsp;km on from Helsinki to the [[Shanghai Expo]] enjoying multidisciplinary talks and workshops on the way.&lt;ref name="aaltoontracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaltoontracks.com/|title=Aalto on Tracks|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was such a success that the follow-up ''Aalto on waves'' is planned to arrange a trip by boat to South America. ''Aalto on Tracks'' also spurred students of [[Tongji University]] to arrange ''Tongji on Tracks'' which essentially takes the journey of ''Aalto on Tracks'' in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&amp;a=detail&amp;id=26&amp;nav_id=47|title=欢迎来到同济大学中芬中心|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aalto Entrepreneurship Society]] is a multi-disciplinary society uniting students and graduates of all disciplines of the University. It aims to encourage high-tech, high-growth, scalable entrepreneurship by arranging get-togethers to spark ideas and innovations and aid start-up initiatives among the Aalto students.

=== Aalto Festival ===
Aalto Festival (formerly known as Masters of Aalto, and the Masters of Arts festival) is an annual event in May where the new professionals of the multidisciplinary university meet the public.

An extensive exhibition showcases a wide array of works: everything from distinguished theses, individual statements, concepts and products arising from commercial collaboration to works of art. For the graduating students, the exhibition is an opportunity to interact with society, future employers, the media and other influential parties.

Aalto Festival offers a varying program with exhibitions, seminars, discussions, films, workshops and guided tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moa.aalto.fi|title=Masters of Aalto University 2014 / MoA'14|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student Union ===
Aalto University Student Union ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopiston ylioppilaskunta}}, AYY in short) is the official student union of Aalto University. Every bachelor's and master's degree student enrolled in Aalto University is a member of the Student Union.

The purpose of AYY is to represent the students, look after their interests, and support the community of 15,000 students. AYY provides its members with a variety of services such as healthcare, recreation and housing. The Student Union is financed by membership fees, investments and profits from student housing.

Aalto University Student Union was formed in the beginning of 2010 through a merger between the respective student unions of the merged universities.

The Aalto University is also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more Nations, a Finnish type of [[Corporation (University)|student corporation]]. AU's only nation is [[Teknologföreningen|Teknologföreningen (TF)]] and its goal is to unite Swedish-speaking students at the university. The nation is housed in its peculiar building called ''Urdsgjallar''. Since 1972, when the corresponding Finnish-speaking nation ''Tekniikan Ylioppilaat'' was abolished, there are no nations for the Finnish-speaking students, though the 15 regional nations at the [[University of Helsinki]], both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking, do welcome AU students as members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml Osakunnat – Nationerna.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502091419/http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml |date=May 2, 2013 }} Osakuntien yhteistyövaliokunta ry.

=== Associations ===
[[File:Retuperän WBK.jpg|thumb|The Retuperä WBK is a student band that parodies a volunteer fire brigade brass band. In this picture Retuperä is performing in central Helsinki on top of their fire truck.]]

In addition to the student union, Aalto university students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. There are more than 150 associations maintained by university students.

==== List of student associations ====

Currently this list includes only the associations known to have English Wikipedia articles.

* [[Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho]]
* [[Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat|Helsinki Academic Male Choir KYL]] ({{lang-fi|Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat}})

=== Student housing ===
The housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as ''Teekkarikylä'' (technology student village), is owned mostly by the student union and partly by [[Foundation for Student Housing in the Helsinki Region|HOAS]] (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing is characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offers housing for approximately 2,600 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Union web pages for the student village |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706062907/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archivedate=6 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ''Teekkarikylä'' |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129041330/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |archivedate=2009-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of bombings by the [[Soviet Union]] itself. The student housing has been used for housing athletes again in e.g. the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.

Some student housing is also available in the vicinity of the other campuses.

The Otaniemi campus also contains the former student union building ''[[Dipoli]]'', named as the second ''Poli'', the successor of the first student union building in downtown Helsinki. Dipoli was designed by [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]] and completed in 1966. In 1993, the building was permanently rented to the university to act as a conference and [[continuing education]] center and later sold due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.

{{main|List of Aalto University people}}
All three constituent schools have played an integral part in educating many of the top names in their respective fields in Finland. After the Second World War Finland's economy grew and Finnish companies became players in the international markets requiring highly educated expertise and leadership. Both the schools of technology and economy catered to this need as the premier schools of their fields in the country. During the latter part of the 20th century the schools had to increase their student intake considerably to meet the demands of growing markets.

{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
'''''American Machinists' Handbook''''' was a [[McGraw-Hill]] reference book similar to Industrial Press's ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]''. (The latter title, still in print and regularly revised, is the one that machinists today are usually referring to when they speak imprecisely of "the machinist's handbook" or "the machinists' handbook".)

The somewhat generic sound of the title ''American Machinists' Handbook'', and the ambiguity of its apostrophe usage, no doubt contributed to the confounding of the two books' titles and identities. It capitalized on readers' familiarity with ''[[American Machinist]]'', McGraw-Hill's popular trade journal. But the usage could have benefited from some branding discipline, because the confusion over whether the title was properly "American Machinist's Handbook" or "American Machinists' Handbook" or "''American Machinist'' 's Handbook" was (and is) considerable. ("''American Machinist'' 's Handbook" would be parallel to the construction of the title "''Machinery's'' Handbook"; perhaps McGraw-Hill's handbook's title was originally conceived as that and later was muddied into "American Machinists' Handbook".)

Although McGraw-Hill's ''American Machinists' Handbook'' appeared first (1908), it is doubtful that Industrial Press's ''Machinery's Handbook'' (1914) was a mere me-too conceived afterwards in response. The eager market for such a reference work had probably been obvious for at least a decade before either work was compiled, and presumably the appearance of the McGraw-Hill title merely prodded Industrial Press to finally get moving on a handbook of its own.

''American Machinists' Handbook'', coedited by [[Fred H. Colvin]] and Frank A. Stanley, went through eight editions between 1908 and 1945. In 1955, McGraw-Hill published ''The new American machinist's handbook. Based upon earlier editions of American machinists' handbook'' (sic; note the apostrophe usage difference within that title), but presumably the book did not compete well enough with ''Machinery's Handbook'', because no subsequent editions were produced. Meanwhile, ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'' has continued to be regularly revised and updated, right up to today, and it is still a "bible of the metalworking industries."

The '''Ancient Monuments Society''' (AMS) is a [[learned society]] and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209605}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1924 "for the study and conservation of ancient monuments, historic buildings and fine old craftsmanship".

==National Amenity Societies==
The Ancient Monuments Society is recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is informed of any application for listed building consent in England and Wales involving any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it plays an important part in shaping the historic environment in England and Wales.

==Partnership with Friends of Friendless Churches==
The Ancient Monuments Society works in partnership with the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]], sharing an office and staff and operating a joint membership scheme. The co-operation came about because Friends of Friendless Churches was set up by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], who was also Secretary and later Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society.

==Publications==
The AMS publishes three newsletters and a volume of ''Transactions'' (scholarly articles on a range of architectural historic topics) annually for its 2,100 members.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">The '''beam propagation method''' ('''BPM''') is an approximation technique for simulating the propagation of [[light]] in [[slowly varying envelope approximation|slowly varying]] [[optical waveguide]]s. It is essentially the same as the so-called [[parabolic equation]] (PE) method in underwater [[acoustics]]. Both BPM and the PE were first introduced in the 1970s. When a wave propagates along a waveguide for a large distance (larger compared with the wavelength), rigorous numerical simulation is difficult. The BPM relies on approximate differential equations which are also called the one-way models. These one-way models involve only a first order [[derivative]] in the variable z (for the waveguide axis) and they can be solved as "initial" value problem. The "initial" value problem does not involve time, rather it is for the spatial variable z.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Integrated Photonics|author=Clifford R. Pollock, Michal. Lipson|year= 2003|publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNJEoypcI6oC&amp;pg=RA1-PA210&amp;lpg=RA1-PA210&amp;dq=%22Beam+propagation+method%22|isbn=978-1-4020-7635-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original BPM and PE were derived from the slowly varying envelope approximation and they are the so-called paraxial one-way models. Since then, a number of improved one-way models are introduced. They come from a one-way model involving a square root operator. They are obtained by applying rational approximations to the square root operator. After a one-way model is obtained, one still has to solve it by discretizing the variable z. However, it is possible to merge the two steps (rational approximation to the square root operator and discretization of z) into one step. Namely, one can find rational approximations to the so-called one-way propagator (the exponential of the square root operator) directly. The rational approximations are not trivial. Standard diagonal Padé approximants have trouble with the so-called evanescent modes. These evanescent modes should decay rapidly in z, but the diagonal Padé approximants will incorrectly propagate them as propagating modes along the waveguide. Modified rational approximants that can suppress the evanescent modes are now available. The accuracy of the BPM can be further improved, if you use the energy-conserving one-way model or the single-scatter one-way model.

==Principles==
BPM is generally formulated as a solution to [[Helmholtz equation]] in a time-harmonic case, 
&lt;ref&gt;Okamoto K. 2000 Fundamentals of Optical Waveguides (San Diego, CA: Academic)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;EE290F: BPM course slides, Devang Parekh, University of Berkeley, CA&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(\nabla^2 + k_0^2n^2)\psi = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
with the field written as, 
:&lt;math&gt;E(x,y,z,t)=\psi(x,y)\exp(-j\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now the spatial dependence of this field is written according to any one [[Transverse mode|TE or TM]] polarizations
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y) = A(x,y)\exp(+jk_o\nu y)
&lt;/math&gt;,
with the envelope 
:&lt;math&gt;A(x,y)
&lt;/math&gt; following a slowly varying approximation,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2( A(x,y) )}{\partial y^2} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Now the solution when replaced into the Helmholtz equation follows,
:&lt;math&gt;
\left[\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2} + k_0^2(n^2 - \nu^2) \right]A(x,y) = \pm 2 jk_0 \nu \frac{\partial A_k(x,y)}{\partial y}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the aim to calculate the field at all points of space for all times, we only need to compute the function
&lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for all space, and then we are able to reconstruct &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the solution
is for the time-harmonic Helmholtz equation, we only need to calculate it over one time period. We can 
visualize the fields along the propagation direction, or the cross section waveguide modes.

==Numerical methods==
Both ''spatial domain'' methods, and ''frequency (spectral) domain'' methods are available for the numerical solution of the discretized master equation. Upon discretization into a grid, (using various [[central difference|centralized difference]], [[Crank–Nicolson method]], FFT-BPM etc.) and field values rearranged in a causal fashion, the field evolution is computed through iteration, along the propagation direction. The spatial
domain method computes the field at the next step (in the propagation direction) by solving a linear equation, whereas the spectral domain
methods use the powerful forward/inverse [[Fast Fourier Transform|DFT]] algorithms. Spectral domain methods have the advantage of stability
even in the presence of nonlinearity (from refractive index or medium properties), while spatial domain methods can possibly become numerically unstable.

==Applications==
BPM is a quick and easy method of solving for fields in integrated optical devices. It is typically
used only in solving for intensity and modes within shaped (bent, tapered, terminated) waveguide
structures, as opposed to scattering problems. These structures typically consist of [[isotropic]] optical materials, but the BPM has also been extended to be applicable to simulate the propagation of light in general [[anisotropic]] materials such as [[liquid crystals]]. This allows one to [http://www.elis.ugent.be/ELISgroups/lcd/research/bpm.php analyze] e.g. the polarization rotation of light in anisotropic materials, the tunability of a directional coupler based on liquid crystals or the light diffraction in LCD pixels.

==Limitations of BPM==
The Beam Propagation Method relies on the [[slowly varying envelope approximation]], and is inaccurate for the modelling of discretely or fastly varying structures. Basic implementations are also inaccurate for the modelling of structures in which light propagates in large range of angles and for devices with high refractive-index contrast, commonly found for instance in [[silicon photonics]]. Advanced implementations, however, mitigate some of these limitations allowing BPM to be used to accurately model many of these cases, including many silicon photonics structures.

The BPM method can be used to model bi-directional propagation, but the reflections need to be implemented iteratively which can lead to convergence issues.

==Implementations==
There are several simulation tools that implement BPM algorithms. Popular commercial tools have been developed by [https://optics.synopsys.com/rsoft/rsoft-passive-device-beamprop.html RSoft Design] and [http://optiwave.com/category/products/component-design/optibpm/ Optiwave Systems Inc.].

'''Brevitas et Facilitas''' means "brevity and simplicity" in English, the [[hermeneutical]] method of [[John Calvin]]. Especially he used this method in the dedication in the Commentary on [[Romans]].
Calvin presented his own distinctive method of the hermeneutics of [[Scripture]] in his Commentary on the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans. It is called the ideal of brevitas et facilitas. Calvin was not satisfied with both [[Philip Melanchthon|Malanchthon]]'s [[loci method]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]]'s [[prolixity]] commentary. He took a [[via media]] approach. Calvin's method was influenced by the rhetoric of [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]] and [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]. Calvin, however, confirmed that his own principle came from [[Scripture]] itself. Calvin showed that the clarity of Scripture was related to the ideal of brevitas et facilitas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/601  Myung Jun Ahn. The Ideal of Brevitas et Facilitas: The Theological Hermeneutics of John Calvin, Verbum et Ecclesia; Skrif en Kerk: Vol 20, No 2 (1999), 270-281]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to John Bolt this means the brevitas et dilucidatio of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bavinckinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Bavinck_RD_outline.pdf The Outline of Bavinck's Reformed Dogmatics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method as Brevitas et Facilitas==
According to Michael Mewborn, Calvin did have a basic approach to Scripture which is often described as brevitas et
facilitas (i.e. in derivative form-brevitas-to be brief and relevant and facilitas-to be simple or
easily understood), brevitas for short. Brevitas is an assent to clear and concise interpretation.
Even though the Latin terminology may paint Calvin’s approach as irrelevant or archaic, the
heart of this method is the basis of evangelical interpretation today. [[Richard Gamble]] writes of
brevitas, “[it] may be understood as an attempt to communicate the message of the biblical
author in as concise, clear, and accurate a manner as possible….”
That brevitas et facilitas is a good summary of Calvin’s exegetical methodology is hardly disputed; Battles, Kraus, Higman, [[David Steinmetz|Steinmetz,]] Girardin, Ganoczy/Scheld, and Parker among others have written recently about it.”
Brevitas describes Calvin’s prevailing disposition toward interpretation.
Calvin used this Method in his Commentaries. [[Richard Muller (theologian)|Richard Muller]] rightly notes that brevitas tended to describe more Calvin’s commentaries
than his sermons. This point is well taken and suggests even more convincingly that brevitas
characterizes Calvin’s approach to exegesis as he discerns biblical meaning in his study, apart
from oratorical influence. Calvin was more apt to say less when writing than when speaking.
Muller writes, “…whereas the commentaries held to the model of brevitas, the sermons tended
toward a more amplificatory model of oratory, often reaching three or four times the length of
the comment on the same text.
But less we assume that Calvin victimized the text or at least his interpretations by
verbalizing in excess of textual warrant or study, Muller notes that during oratory he was,
“drawing on more collateral texts for the sake of broader hortatory, topical, and polemical
development." It is a lesson to the exegete that the Holy Spirit does not dispense textual
understanding only in our study rooms, but that he gives us textual understanding, even when we
are without material aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformedblacksofamerica.org/downloads/Calvin_and_His_Interpretative_Methody_by_Michael_Mewborn.pdf  Michael Mewborn, "Calvin and His Interpretative Method"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source and Mention of Brevitas et Facilitas==

For Calvin Scripture was not complicated, but simple. Scripture was simply the eloquent speech of the Holy Spirit for his simple people. Therefore, to vitiate the simplicity of Scripture was to destroy the whole of 273 THE IDEAL OF Scripture. For Calvin the simplicity of Scripture was immediately connected with his hermeneutical method. This supplied Calvin with the foundation for the principles of brevitas et Jacilitas as his hermeneutical ideal. Calvin believed that Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel employed a simple and easy style in order for ordinary people to understand God's Word more easily. This made him believe that the style of Scripture had its orientation in brevitas et facilitas. Consequently, Calvin, influenced by rhetoricians like Cicero and Quintilian in his ideal of brevitas et facilitas, confirmed that the authors of Scripture demonstrated this ideal. Calvin made this ideal a part of his own hermeneutical method.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20883/Ahn_Ideal%281999%29.pdf?sequence=1 
Myung 1un Ahn , "The Ideal of Brevitas et Facilitas: The Theological Hermeneutics of John Calvin ", ISSN 0257-8891 = SKRIF EN KERK Jrg 20(2) 1999, 273-274&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dedication in the Commentary on Romans published in 1540 to [[Simon Grynaeus]] his friend and Hebrew teacher, John Calvin says

"we both thought that the chief excellency of an expounder consists in lucid brevity. And, indeed, since it is almost his only work to lay open the mind of the writer whom he undertakes to explain, the degree in which he leads away his readers from it, in that degree he goes astray from his purpose, and in a manner wanders from his own boundaries. Hence we expressed a hope, that from the number of those who strive at this day to advance the interest of theology by this kind of labour, some one would be found, who would study plainness, and endeavour to avoid the evil of tiring his readers with prolixity. I know at the same time that this view is not taken by all, and that those who judge otherwise have their reasons; but still I cannot be drawn away from the love of what is compendious. But as there is such a variety, found in the minds of men, that different things please different persons, let every one in this case follow his own judgment, provided that no one attempts to force others to adopt his own rules. Thus it will be, that we who approve of brevity, will not reject nor despise the labours of those who are more copious and diffused in their explanations of Scripture, and that they also in their turn will bear with us, though they may think us too compressed and concise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/calcom38.pdf John Calvin, "THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY JOHN CALVIN TO SIMON GRYNÆUS," Commentary on Romans, Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sentiebat enim uterque nostrum praecipuam interpretis virtutem in perspicua brevitate esse positam. Et sane, quum hoc sit prope unicum illius officium mentem scriptoris quem explicandum sumpsit patefacere, quantum ab ea lecturos abducit, tantundem a scopo suo aberrat, vel certe a suis finibus quodammodo evagatur…unum aliquem exstare qui et facilitati studeret, et simul daret operam ne prolixis commentariis studiosos ultra modum detineret…ego tamen dimoveri non possum ab amore comendii".

[[File:Manglawar Stupa.JPG|thumb|Shakhorai Buddha]]
[[Manglawar]] (or Manglor) valley in Pakistan is situated about 9 Km to North East of [[Mingora]], at the point where a number of side valleys descend from the watershed range to the east. The valley has a number of Buddhist [[Relief sculpture|reliefs]] and sculptures, the best known of which is the Shakhorai Buddha.

== The valley's archaeological importance ==

The Swat Valley contained a large number of monasteries, forming a sacred landscape where images, sculptures and inscriptions welcomed pilgrims as they entered the valley.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1"&gt;(13 July, 2018). [https://tribune.com.pk/story/1756539/1-buddha-statue-restored-swat/ Buddha Statue Restored in Swat]. [[The Express Tribune]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the valley is the site of [[Oddiyana]], a small medieval kingdom that played a crucial role in the development and dissemination of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and the homeland of the sages [[Indrabhuti|Indrabhūti]] and [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;Filigenzi, Anna (2015). [https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/art-and-landscape Buddhist Rock Sculptures of Late Antiqe Swat/Uddiyana]. Pub: VÖAW. {{ISBN|978-3-7001-7241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one enters the sub-valley of Manglawar its importance is immediately revealed with the huge and well known rock relief of the '''Shakhorai Buddha'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci |G. Tucci]], ''Preliminary report on an archelogical survey in Swat,'' East and West, vol. 9, P:306&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of sub-valley Manglawar can be judged from the accounts of [[Aurel Stein|Sir. Aural Stein]], he says:
{{blockquote|Of all the Buddhist relieves found on the rock near Manglawar and miles up the valley the colossal image of a seated Buddha some thirteen feet in height is certainly the most striking. It is carved on the vertical face of a high reddish rock, high above the narrow terrace at its foot, and is a well-executed piece of work. This position, while it had saved the relievo from damage by pious vandals, has at the same time made it distinctly difficult to photograph. The hands of the true believers much often have itched as they saw this benign-faced heathen idol looking down towards Manglawar from its heights of some three hundred feet above Shakhorai hamlet"''”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurel Stein|A.Stein]], ''On Alexender track to Indus'', (1972), P:77-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139923538&amp;cid=CBO9781139923538A018 X - Buddhist Remains about Saidu and Manglawar]  pp. 72-80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This valley has much potential of Buddhist sacred areas, inscriptions and rock reliefs. Four areas were most of reliefs are concentrated have already been reported, among them are:
* Shaldara
* Kalkata
* [[Banjot, Swat|Banjot]]
* Jahanabad
* Nangriyal

This valley has a great potential for archeological antiquities and shows a number of Buddhist sacred areas. Kharosti inscriptions and rock reliefs. However, more numerous are the new discoveries of rock carvings at ''Shaldara'', ''Kalkata'', ''[[Banjot, Swat|Banjot]]'', ''Taghwan'' and of ''Nangriyal'' locations.

== Shaldara ==
The Shaldara sub-valley, enclosed by the surrounding mountains, slowly descends towards the plan of Manglawar. The rock carving is situated on the right side of ''Shaldara Khwar''. It is just below the Boy’s Primary School while the Girls Primary School is on the northeast. Following are the details of the rock engravings.

Shaldara-i depicts a well-preserved figure of ''Padmapani'' in ''lalitasana'' in pensive attitude on high ''asana''. His right leg folded over the seat, while the left one hangs down. His right hand rests on the right thigh while the left one rests on the left thigh holding a lotus stem. The ''asana'' of the [[bodhisattva]] is quite prominent and its lower part is decorated by vertical bands of floral design. The bud of the lotus and its stem is intact. The clinging folds of his costume falling in his front, clearly visible over the seat. The head and face of the relief is chipping off, while a thick layer of patina on the rock has concealed many details.&lt;ref name=BadshahSardar&gt;Badshah Sardar ,''Buddhist Rock Carvings in the Swat Valley'', (1st Edition , 2005), P:103, National fund for cultural heritage Ministry of Culture, Sports and Youth affairs, Government of Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kalkata ==
'''Kalkata''' (often spelled: ''Kalkatta'' or ''Kalkatai''). The scattered houses of Kalkata hamlet are about 2 km to the south east of [[Manglawar]]. Four groups of rock carvings were found in locality of Kalkata. All these sites lie on the right side of the road leading to Banjot Village.

This site is about five meters above the ''Boy’s Primary School of Kalkata''. This border is in situ and is covered by shrubs and thorny bushes. Deserted stupa remains can be seen on the southeast. Kalkata-1 rocks reveals a figure of [[Bodhisattva]] in ''lalitasana'' in pensive attitude on high ''asana''. His right leg is folded over the seat, while the left leg hangs down. His right hand rests on the right thigh and the left hand on the left thigh holding a lotus stem. The lower part of the carving is intact while the upper portion is damaged. No details of dress and jewelry are visible due to thick layer of patina over the rock.

The location is similar to that of ''Kalkata-I''. This square shaped stone block, dislodged from its original place, presently lies at the back of the Boy’s Primary School of Kalkata. According to the local people it has rolled down from the upper hill terraces. The only visible portion if the rock reveals seated ''Padmapani'' on a high throne in ''lalitasana'' in pensive mood. His right hand rests on the right thigh, while the left one on the left thigh holding a lotus stem. The relief is damaged and chipped off at various places.

Kalkata-iv is situated above half a km east of Kalkata-iii on the right side of the road leading to [[Banjot, Swat|Banjot village]]. The rock reveals fifteen (thirteen human &amp; two animal) figures all are in situ, but covered by trees and wild bushes. Most of the artistic details are faded and defaced. The extant remains shows two animals and thirteen human figures. Four are ''dhyani Buddhas'' of different sizes and five are [[Bodhisattvas]] in ''lalitasana'' in pensive attitudes. Two [[Bodhisattvas]] are on ''simhasana''. Four among them are the states of standing figures in different attributes. All the reliefs are defaced and covered with a thick layer of white patina deposited by a water channel running above the rock that has obscured most of the details.

It was truly a holy place marked by a colossal rock image of Buddha, measuring 700 x 500 cm. While the ''asana'' is the Buddha is 120 x 390 cm. The rock reveals a colossal figure of [[Buddharupa]] in deep contemplation on a high ''asana''. The Buddha is fully robed in drapery; the graceful clinging folds of which are visible on his seat. [[File:Manglawar Damaged Stupa.jpg|x150px|thumbnail|left|Jahan Abad Stupa -1 After destruction by extremists]] Both of his hands rest in his lap covered by the folds of the drapery. He wears snail shell curly hairs with an [[Ushnisha]] (wisdom-bump). A prominent [[urna]] (beauty spot) and almond shape half-closed eyes. Apollo face with smiling continuance and long lobs of ears are clearly visible. It represents a most preserve piece of rock carving in the whole the Valley. In style and technique the relief carving may be compared to 7th - 8th century Tang sculpture in central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valleyswat.net/tourism/janabad.html Janabad Seated Buddha], ValleySwat, ''Retrieved: 30 Nov, 2015''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=38,5475,0,0,1,0#.VlyBJXYrLIU ''Will the Taliban unleash another artefact massacre?''], The News, Nov 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[First Battle of Swat|2007]] the Taliban tried to destroy the head of the relief with explosives, although ultimately only the top part of the Buddha’s head was damaged. The carving has since been restored by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Swat. A coating was applied to protect the damaged part of the carving in 2012, and next the face was restored in [[3D reconstruction|3D]] using laser surveys and old photographs. Finally, it was physically restored using parts of the original that had been picked up off the valley floor. The restoration was completed in October 2016, deliberately leaving some of the damage visible.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Ali, Syed (January 24, 2018).

{{Distinguish|DNS cache poisoning}}
'''Cache pollution''' describes situations where an executing [[computer program]] loads data into [[CPU cache]] unnecessarily, thus causing other useful data to be evicted from the cache into lower levels of the [[memory hierarchy]], degrading performance. For example, in a [[multi-core processor]], one core may replace the blocks fetched by other cores into shared cache, or [[Cache prefetching|prefetched]] blocks may replace demand-fetched blocks from the cache.

==Example==
Consider the following illustration:
  
  T[0] = T[0] + 1;
  for i in 0..[[sizeof]](CACHE)
    C[i] = C[i] + 1;
  T[0] = T[0] + C[sizeof(CACHE)-1];

(The assumptions here are that the cache is composed of only one level, it is unlocked, the replacement policy is [[pseudo-LRU]], all data is cacheable, the [[CPU_cache#Associativity|set associativity]] of the cache is N (where N &gt; 1), and at most one [[processor register]] is available to contain program values).

Right before the loop starts, T[0] will be fetched from memory into cache, its value updated. However, as the loop executes, because the number of data elements the loop references requires the whole cache to be filled to its capacity, the cache block containing T[0] has to be evicted. Thus, the next time the program requests T[0] to be updated, the cache misses, and the cache controller  has to request the [[computer bus|data bus]] to bring the corresponding cache block from [[main memory]] again.

In this case the cache is said to be "polluted".  Changing the pattern of data accesses by positioning the first update of T[0] between the loop and the second update can eliminate the inefficiency:

  for i in 0..[[sizeof]](CACHE)
    C[i] = C[i] + 1;
  T[0] = T[0] + 1;
  T[0] = T[0] + C[sizeof(CACHE)-1];

==Solutions==
Other than code-restructuring mentioned above, the solution to cache pollution is ensure that only high-reuse data are stored in cache. This can be achieved by using special [[cache control instruction]]s, [[operating system]] support or hardware support.

Examples of specialized hardware instructions include  "lvxl" provided by [[PowerPC]] [[AltiVec]]. This instruction loads a 128 bit wide value into a register and marks the corresponding cache block as "least recently used" i.e. as the prime candidate for eviction upon a need to [[cache eviction|evict]] a block from its cache set. To appropriately use that instruction in the context of the above example, the data elements referenced by the loop would have to be loaded using this instruction. When implemented in this manner, cache pollution would not take place, since the execution of such loop would not cause premature eviction of T[0] from cache. This would be avoided because, as the loop would progress, the addresses of the elements in C would map to the same cache way, leaving the actually older (but not marked as "least recently used") data intact on the other way(s). Only the oldest data (not pertinent for the example given) would be evicted from cache, which T[0] is not a member of, since its update occurs right before the loop's start. 

Similarly, using operating system (OS) support, the pages in [[main memory]] that correspond to the C data array can be marked as "caching inhibited" or, in other words, non-cacheable. Similarly, at hardware level, cache bypassing schemes&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/24842555/A_Survey_of_Cache_Bypassing_Techniques A Survey Of Cache Bypassing Techniques]", JLPEA, 6(2), 2016&lt;/ref&gt; can be used which identify low-reuse data based on program access pattern and bypass them from cache. Also, shared cache can be partitioned to avoid destructive interference between running applications. The tradeoff in these solutions is that OS-based schemes may have large latency which may nullify the gain achievable by  cache pollution avoidance (unless the memory region has been non-cacheable to begin with), whereas hardware-based techniques may not have a global view of the program control flow and [[memory access pattern]].
&lt;!-- THIS IS REDUNDANT AND DOES NOT ADD ANY VALUE TO THE ARTICLE. Often in real life the cache is composed of more than one level (called the "L1", "L2" etc.). Therefore, "cache pollution" is well-defined only for situations where the term "cache" is unambiguous. Otherwise, it is imperative to specify which level of cache is involved.--&gt;

==Increasing importance==
Cache pollution control has been increasing in importance because the penalties caused by the so-called "[[memory wall]]" keep on growing. Chip manufacturers continue devising new tricks to overcome the ever increasing relative memory-to-CPU latency. They do that by increasing cache sizes and by providing useful ways for software engineers to control the way data arrives and stays at the CPU. Cache pollution control is one of the numerous devices available to the (mainly embedded) programmer. However, other methods, most of which are proprietary and highly hardware and application specific, are used as well.

&lt;!-- THIS IS VERBOSE AND DOES NOT ADD ANY VALUE TO THE MAIN TOPIC OF CACHE POLLUTION. Sometimes, however, even the most evolved and involved software is either insufficient or the very effort of software optimization crosses cost tolerance thresholds or profitability ratios as explained by the [[law of diminishing returns]]. In those cases the ball shifts back to the court of hardware engineers, and the "trick game" starts again. The relatively recent surge of interest in the [[system-on-a-chip]] concept (such as the [[Cell processor]]) is fueled by these issues. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">A '''cross-genre''' (or '''hybrid genre''') is a [[literary genre|genre]] in [[fiction]] that blends themes and elements from two or more different genres. As opposed to the (literary and political) conservatism of most [[genre fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; cross-genre writing offers opportunities for opening up debates and stimulating discussion.

Such hybrid genres are not new but a longstanding element in the fictional process: perhaps the most famous example is [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', with its blend of poetry, prose, and engravings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singer/W. Walker, ''Bending Genre'' (2013) p. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s trilogy [[Poena Damni]] ([[Z213: Exit]], [[With the people from the bridge]], [[The First Death]]) combines fictional prose with drama and poetry in a multilayered narrative developing through the different characters of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/reviews-march/ |title=Reviews: Z213: Exit by Dimitris Lyacos &amp;#124; Write From Wrong Literary Magazine |publisher=Writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic discontinuites==
[[Fredric Jameson]] has highlighted the progressive elements in Third World Literature that defies genre expectations such as [[Xala (novel)|Xala]]; and in [[science fiction]] like ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' with its exploration of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weekes eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 334 and p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Koontz]] considers himself  a cross-genre writer, not a [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer: “I write cross-genre books-suspense mixed with love story, with humor, sometimes with two tablespoons of science fiction, sometimes with a pinch of horror, sometimes with a sprinkle of paprika...”&lt;ref&gt;Koontz, Dean. "Afterword, Lightening", G.P. Putnam's Sons hardcover edition, January 1988. Berkley Publishing Group, mass market edition, May 1989. p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epigenetic theories of homosexuality''' concern the studies of changes in [[gene expression]] or cellular [[phenotype]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA sequence]], and their role in the development of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice WR, Friberg U, Gavrilets S. 2013. Homosexuality via canalized sexual development: A testing protocol for a new epigenetic model. BioEssays 35: 343-368 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice W. R., Friberg U., and Gavrilets S. 2016. Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development. Molecular Ecology 12: DOI: 10.1111/mec.13490 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Epigenetics]] examines the set of chemical reactions that switch parts of the [[genome]] on and off at strategic times and locations in the organism's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. However, epigenetic theories tangle a multiplicity of initiating causes and of resulting final effects and will never lead to a single cause or a single result. Hence, any interpretation of such theories may not focus just one isolated reason of a multiplicity of causes or of effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/evolution/ausbildungskonzepte.html Ausbildungskonzept "Integrated approaches to teach and study the role of evolution for the emergence of biological complexity"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of affecting the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism’s genes to express themselves differently. DNA in the human body is wrapped around [[histone]]s, which are [[protein]]s that package and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with [[chemical tag]]s known as the [[epigenome]], which shapes the physical structure of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/ "The Epigenome at a Glance."] Genetic Science Learning Center. The University of Utah, 2013. Web. 10 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments. 
The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of [[epi-mark]]s buffering [[XY sex-determination system|XX]] [[fetus]]es and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] fetuses from certain [[androgen]] exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and [[gene regulation]] through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, Sabrina. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33773/title/Can-Epigenetics-Explain-Homosexuality-/ "Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality?."] The Scientist. N.p., 1 Jan. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert [[sexual preference]] in individuals without altering [[genitalia]] or [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Geographic Explains the Biology of Homosexuality." YouTube. YouTube, 04 Feb. 2009. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
This research gives support to the [[hypothesis]] that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, [[twin studies]], and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.

== Epigenetic marks ==
{{details|Epigenetics}}

Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are temporary "switches" that control how our genes are expressed during [[gestation]] and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks  are modifications of histone proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthenburg, A., C. Allis, and J. Wysocka. "Methylation of Lysine 4 on Histone H3: Intricacy of Writing and Reading a Single Epigenetic Mark." Molecular Cell 25.1 (2007): 15-30. Print. {{pmid|17218268}} {{doi|10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks are modifications of the [[methyl]] and [[acetyl]] groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function and as a result, alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="Friberg"&gt;William R. Rice, Friberg, Urban and Sergey Gavrilets. "Homosexuality as a Consequence of Epigenetically Canalized Sexual Development." The Quarterly Review of Biology 87.4 (2012): n. pag. Print. {{pmid|23397798}} {{doi|10.1086/668167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks promote normal [[sexual development]] during [[fetal development]]. However, they can be passed on to [[offspring]] through the process of [[mitosis]]. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to [[masculinization]] of female offspring and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] of male offspring.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/25431-gene-regulation-homosexuality.html "Gene Regulation May Explain How Homosexuality Flourishes."] LiveScience.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

== Twin studies ==

[[Identical twin]]s have identical DNA, which leads to the perceived conclusion that all identical twins are either [[heterosexual]] or homosexual. However, it is evident that this is not the case, consequently leaving a gap in the explanation for homosexuality. A "gay" gene does not produce homosexuality. Rather, epigenetic modifications act as temporary "switches" that regulate how the genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; Of the pairs of identical twins in which one twin is homosexual, only twenty percent of the other twins are homosexual, which leads to the hypothesis that even though identical twins share the same DNA, homosexuality is created by something else rather than the genes. Epigenetic transformation allows the on and off switching of certain genes, subsequently shaping how cells respond to androgen signaling, which is critical in sexual development.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;
Another example of epigenetic consequences is evident in [[multiple sclerosis]] in [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After [[gene testing]], it was suggested that DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.&lt;ref&gt;Handunnetthi, Lahiru, Adam Handel, and Sreeram V. Ramagopalan. Contribution of Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Differences to Twin Discordance in Multiple Sclerosis. Ebsco Host. Psyc Info, 2010. Web. {{pmid|20819009}} {{doi|10.1586/ern.10.116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fetal androgen exposure ==

While in the fetal stages, hormonal influences of [[androgen]], specifically [[testosterone]], cause feminine qualities in regard to sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed to high levels of testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks play a critical role in this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Charles, Gerard S. Conway, and Melissa Hines. "Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)." Journal of Sex Research 41.1 (2004): 75-81. Online {{pmid|15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritability ==

New epi-marks are usually produced with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between [[generation]]s. Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the natural disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization can lead to a reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high [[testosterone]], and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks are normally erased and not passed between generations. However, they can sometimes escape erasure and are then transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. When this happens, this may lead to an altered sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that [[gene coding]] for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to same-sex sexual preference in offspring.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The '''''Escadron de transport, d'entraînement et de calibration''''' 00.065 (ETEC 65, "Transportation, training and calibration squadron") is a unit of the [[French Air Force]], under direct command of the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of Defence]], in charge of the transportation of the [[President of France|President]], the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and other French government officials.

==History==
In July 1945, the '''GAEL''' (groupe aérien d'entraînement et de liaison) was created. It was first based at [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Airport]], then relocated to the [[Vélizy – Villacoublay Air Base|Villacoublay Air Base]].

In 1969, the GAEL was split in two units, then in 1984 in three units.

In 1991, the three units were merged again into the l'ETEC 00.065 (escadron de transport, d'entraînement et de calibration), which was still called "GAEL".

In July 1995, the French president [[Jacques Chirac]] decided to disslove the Groupe de Liaisons Aériennes Ministérielles (GLAM). The GLAM's aircraft were transferred to the ETEC.

==Aircraft==
The ETEC uses 
* 1 Airbus [[A330-200]], Registration: F-RARF&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/French%20Air%20Force-active-a330.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 [[Falcon 7X]]
* 2 Falcon 900 (soon to be replaced),
* 2 Falcon 50 (soon to be replaced by 4 [[Falcon 2000|Falcon 2000LX]] ),
* 7 [[TBM 700]],
* 3 [[Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma|Super Puma]] helicopters (VIP-configured).

In 2003, the ETEC provided 673 flight hours for the President, 516 for the Prime Minister, 602 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 318 for the Ministry of Defence. A flight hour typically costs: 
* €4050 for an Airbus, 
* €5750 for a Falcon 900 and 
* €4090 for a Falcon 50.

Flight are identified as  "COTAM 0xy", with the [[callsign]] "[[Cotam 001|COTAM 001]]" ("[[Cotam 001|COTAM Unité]]") being reserved for the President and "[[Cotam 002|COTAM 002]]" for foreign presidents.

The ''fim'' switch in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is the mechanism by which the ''fim'' gene cluster, encoding [[Type I Pili]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two regulatory fim genes, fimB and fimE, control the phase variation of type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli.|journal = The EMBO Journal|date = 1986|issn = 0261-4189|pmc = 1166953|pmid = 2874022|pages = 1389–1393|volume = 5|issue = 6|first = P|last = Klemm}}&lt;/ref&gt; is transcriptionally controlled.

These pili are virulence factors involved in adhesion, especially important in [[Uropathogenic Escherichia coli|uropathogenic ''Escherichia coli'']]. The gene undergoes [[phase variation]] mediated via two [[recombinases]] and is a model example of site specific inversion.

The operon consists of the promoter region ''fim'' S, the main constituent ''fim'' A, its gene product forming a rod like structure and ''fim'' H, coding for an adhesin at the tip, to name just a few important elements. The ''fim'' S region is flanked by 9bp repeats that are mirror images of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An invertible element of DNA controls phase variation of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/82/17/5724|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 1985|issn = 0027-8424|pmid = 2863818|pages = 5724–5727|volume = 82|issue = 17|first = J.

These recombinases can invert the orientation of the  ''fim'' S region and only one orientation allows for 3' to 5' transcription.

''fim'' B "flips" the promoter region both ways, from the "on" position to the "off" position and ''vice versa'', whereas ''fim'' E can only facilitate recombination from "on" to "off". This equilibrium, shifted towards maintaining the "off" position, due to higher ''fim'' E activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative analysis of FimB and FimE recombinase activity|journal = Microbiology|date = Dec 2007|issn = 1350-0872|pmid = 18048927|pages = 4138–4149|volume = 153|issue = Pt 12|doi = 10.1099/mic.0.2007/010363-0|first = Nicola|last = Holden|first2 = Ian C.|last2 = Blomfield|first3 = Bernt-Eric|last3 = Uhlin|first4 = Makrina|last4 = Totsika|first5 = Don Hemantha|last5 = Kulasekara|first6 = David L.|last6 = Gally}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a mode of expressing pili only when adhesion is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6046">In [[structural engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]], '''generalised beam theory (GBT)''' is a one-dimensional theory used to mathematically model how beams bend and twist under various loads. It is a generalization of classical [[Euler–Bernoulli beam theory]] that approximates a beam as an assembly of thin-walled plates that are constrained to deform as a [[Linear combination|linear combination]] of specified deformation [[Normal mode|modes]].&lt;ref name="deMiranda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Miranda|first1=Stefano|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Alejandro|last3=Miletta|first3=Rosario|last4=Ubertini|first4=Francesco|title=A generalized beam theory with shear deformation|journal=Thin-Walled Structures|date=June 2013|volume=67|pages=88–100|doi=10.1016/j.tws.2013.02.012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

Its origin is due to Richard Schardt (1966). Since then many other authors have extended the initial (first-order elastic) GBT formulations developed by Schardt and his co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schardt|first1=Richard|title=Generalised Beam Theory – an adequate method for coupled stability problems|journal=Thin-Walled Strcutures|date=1994|volume=19|issue=2-4|pages=161–180|doi=10.1016/0263-8231(94)90027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=JM|title=Recent research advances in cold-formed steel structures|journal=Journal of Constructional Steel Research|date=2000|volume=55|issue=1-3|doi=10.1016/S0143-974X(99)00089-9|pages=267–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many extensions and applications of GBT have been developed by Camotim ([[Instituto Superior Técnico]], University of Lisbon, Portugal) and collaborators, since the beginning of the 21st century.

== Description ==
The theory can be applied without restrictions to any prismatic thin-walled structural member exhibiting straight or curved axial axis (any [[Structural load|loading]], any [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section geometry]], any boundary conditions).  GBT is in some ways analogous to the [[finite strip method]]&lt;ref name="deMiranda2013" /&gt; and can be a more computationally efficient method than modeling a beam with a full 2D or 3D [[finite element method]] to predict the member structural behavior.

GBT has been widely recognized as an efficient approach to analyzing thin-walled members and structural systems. The efficiency arises mostly from its modal nature – the [[Displacement field (mechanics)|displacement field]] is expressed as a linear combination of cross-section deformation modes whose amplitudes vary continuously along the member length (x axis)  - see Figures 2-3. Due to GBT assumptions inherent to a thin-walled member, only 3 non-null stress components are considered in the formulations (see Fig. 1).

Membrane displacement field (i.e., in the cross-section mid-surface):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u(s,x) &amp; = u_k(s) \zeta_{k,x}(x), \\
v(s,x) &amp; = v_k(s) \zeta_k(x), \\
w(s,x) &amp; = w_k(s) \zeta_k(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:GBT membrane displacement field.png|GBT membrane displacement field]] --&gt;

The GBT modal nature makes it possible to (i) acquire in-depth knowledge on the mechanics of the thin-walled member behaviour and (ii) judiciously exclude, from subsequent similar GBT analyses, those deformation modes found to play no (or negligible) role in the particular behaviour under scrutiny. Eliminating modes that play no role reduces the number of degrees of freedom involved in a GBT analysis and increases its computational efficiency. GBT has proven useful in the understanding of the structural behaviour under analysis as well as in its computational efficiency.&lt;ref name="deMiranda2013" /&gt;

A '''girlfriend experience''' ('''GFE''') is a commercial experience that blurs the boundaries between a financial transaction and a romantic relationship. It ranges from a [[transactional sex]] relationship&lt;ref name=Hoefinger&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Negotiating Intimacy: Transactional Sex and Relationships Among Cambodian Professional Girlfriends|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/3419/|last=Hoefinger|first=Heidi|year=2010|type=Doctoral thesis|publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[John (prostitution)|client]] paying a prostitute to pretend to be his girlfriend during the session.{{sfn|Flowers|2011|p=151}} Within the [[sex industry]], GFE is a common term for a sexual encounter in which both the [[sex worker]] and the client are willing to engage in reciprocal sexual pleasure and some degree of emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|2011|pp=111–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "girlfriend experience" generally involves more personal interaction than a traditional [[call girl]] or [[escort agency|escort]] offers. There is a focus on not just having sex, but also having more of a comprehensive experience. The details vary widely from person to person.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite magazine|title = The real-life girlfriend experience|magazine = [[GQ]]|author=Anka Radakovich|date =29 March 2012 |url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/articles/2010-05/17/gq-girls-anka-radakovich-on-the-girlfriend-escort-experience|accessdate = 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[sex work]], sex workers impart a sense of authenticity in order to make the experience more pleasurable for their customer, as well as to make the outcome more lucrative for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paying for any sexual act, including GFE, is considered to be a form of prostitution regardless of the type of service involved. Because of this the legality of GFE varies from place to place.

If the sex worker is male, the service is called a boyfriend experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weitzer|2007|pp=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Girlfriend experience and prostitution == 
Indoor prostitution, which includes the use of [[massage parlor]]s, saunas, [[brothel]]s, [[strip club]]s and [[escort agencies]],&lt;ref name=Farley&gt;{{harvnb|Farley|2005|p=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more likely than [[street prostitution]] to involve conversation, affection and mutual sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A GFE may start with dinner at a restaurant followed by [[making out]] on the sofa in an apartment and end with non-rushed sex and cuddling. In 2012 the cost of a GFE was typically between £200 and £1,200. Escorts traditionally have a reputation for not kissing their clients&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and it used to be the norm for legal prostitutes to never kiss on the mouth.{{sfn|Albert|2011}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

Some [[ranch (brothel)|ranch brothels]] in the United States advertise themselves as GFE establishments, including [[Dennis Hof|Dennis Hof's]] [[Dennis Hof's Love Ranch|Love Ranch South]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menu - Love Ranch Vegas|url=http://www.loveranch.net/menu---love-ranch-vegas.html|website=loveranch.net|accessdate=1 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031213258/http://loveranch.net/menu---love-ranch-vegas.html|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moonlite BunnyRanch|Moonlite Bunny Ranch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girlfriend Experience|url=https://www.bunnyranch.com/tag/the-girlfriend-experience/|website=Moonlite Bunny Ranch|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kit Kat Ranch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KitKat Ranch home page|url=http://kitkatranch.com|website=KitKat Ranch website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheri's Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheri's Ranch Sex Menu|url=http://www.sherisranch.com/sex-menu/|website=sherisranch.com|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clients or hobbyists==

The term "client" is sometimes used to describe a person who pays prostitutes for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|Kulick|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[escort agency]] code that has grown up around the GFE, clients often call themselves "hobbyists" and refer to a prostitute who provides GFE as a "nice girl".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a GFE situation the client would pay for time spent with the call girl meaning: social interaction, dating, or sexual acts. Clients could come from all different backgrounds (white-collar, blue collar, different races, different ages) therefore there is not a "typical" type of client using the GFE service. Many clients emerge through the need for a feeling of closeness without the commitment of a relationship. To a certain extent it eliminates the feeling of guilt or fear of "addiction" to a relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Southeast Asia==
Research in Cambodia published in 2010 identified a number of waitresses and bartenders who were also working as "professional girlfriends" with "western boyfriends". They relied on these relationships for their livelihood but did not regard themselves as "prostitutes" and often sought love and marriage as well as material comforts. In these relationships there was a performance of intimacy which lay somewhere between the feigned and the genuine.&lt;ref name=Hoefinger/&gt;

In Thailand some independent sex workers are reported to work as "professional girlfriends", providing company and affection to foreign men and middle-class Thai men, and only having sex with their clients occasionally. Their remuneration is provided in the form of things such as clothing and visits to the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last1=Chia|first1=Jasmine|title=Men and their mistresses|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1330319/men-and-their-mistresses|date=24 September 2017|newspaper=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">'''Globe Award''' is an international [[sustainability]] award which aims at encouraging and promoting the corporate and public sector, individual scientists as well as groups of innovator that have excelled in sustainable development in the world. Globe Award is a not-for-profit organisation with focuses on fostering sustainability in societies. Globe Award’s main goal boils down to inspire actors to take responsibility and act globally through awarding great cases within research, innovations, municipalities and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is handed out in 4 categories: ''Sustainability Research, Sustainability Innovation, Sustainable City'' and ''Sustainability Reporting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/globe_award_2011 |title=2011 |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globe Award values==

1. ''Sustainable development''

Driving sustainability by recognising and awarding sustainability champions from around the world is crucial. This is about understanding the consequences of nowadays’s activities and believing in global collaboration to reach solutions to safeguard humanity’s welfare today and in the future.

2. ''Impact''

It is significant to create behavioural change through rewording unique solutions that can be implemented in order to make a change.

3. ''Transparency''

The Globe Award jury groups run the selection process equally independently.

4. ''Innovation''

Honouring tomorrow's leaders develops innovative solutions to the world’s sustainability challenges. Innovative business perspectives are considered as well as people, planet and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/about-globe-award |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted and internationally recognized 4 groups of jury consist of experts in sustainability from all over the world. They select one winner in each category independently and on objective grounds. There is the over-all jury chairman who along with the Globe Award secretariat, keeps that the process and selection of applications is obeyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeaward.org/jury |title=Jury 2011 |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Globe Award is an initiative by Globe Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeforum.com/ |title=Start2011 |publisher=GlobeForum |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

When started in 2007, Globe Award was a Swedish CSR Award. After two years of success in Sweden, Globe Forum decided to go further with Globe Award. Struggling in making a difference and increasing awareness towards sustainable development in all societies, it made sense in creating Globe Award a truly global prize focusing on sustainability, instead of CSR, starting from 2009.
The award ceremony takes place annually in [[Stockholm]]. The initiative is supported by H.R.H. [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden]].
Despite the world-wide edition, there was a national edition in [[Poland]]. It took place in Gdansk in 2009. The Globe Award Polish Edition was handed out in two categories: Sustainability Innovation and Sustainable City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/polish_edition/en/about.html |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Head''''', also known as '''''Tête d'homme''''', or '''''Portrait d'homme''''', is an early [[Cubist]] sculpture created in 1913 by the Hungarian avant-garde sculptor [[Joseph Csaky]]. This black and white photograph from the Csaky family archives (AC.111) shows a frontal view of the original 1913 plaster. ''Head'' was exhibited at Galerie {{Ill|Clovis Sagot|fr}}, 46, rue Laffitte, Paris, 1913-14, and at the 1914 [[Salon des Indépendants]] titled ''Tête d'homme'' (n. 814 or 815). It was subsequently exhibited at Galerie Moos, Geneva, 1920, titled ''Buste''.&lt;ref name="Marcilhac"&gt;Marcilhac, Félix, 2007, ''József Csáky, Du cubisme historique à la figuration réaliste, catalogue raisonné des sculptures'', Les Editions de l'Amateur, Paris, n. 1913-FM.16&lt;/ref&gt; 

The work was published in [[The Sun (New York City)|''The Sun'' (New York City)]], 15 March 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1914-03-15/ed-1/seq-47/ "André Salmon Sings the Praises of "Independant" Painters in Paris", ''The Sun''.

Lib. of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cubism-futurism-press-articles.blogspot.com/ ''Cubism, Futurism, press articles and reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was then reproduced in [[Ricciotto Canudo]]'s Montjoie! ''Montparnasse'', [[André Salmon]], numéro spécial consacré au XXXème Salon, Artistes Indépendants, 3rd issue, 18 March, 1914.&lt;ref name="Montjoie!"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8911448.image.langEN.r=Canudo,%20Ricciotto Montjoie!

The dimensions and whereabouts of ''Tête d'homme'' are unknown, and the work is presumed destroyed.

==Description==
[[File:Joseph Csaky, Robert Delaunay, Henry Ottmann, The Sun (New York), 15 March 1914.jpg|thumb|Joseph Csaky, ''Head'', 1913, plaster lost; other works include [[Robert Delaunay]], ''Hommage à Blériot'', 1914 (Kunstmuseum Basel); [[Henri Ottmann]], ''The Hat Seller'', published in ''The Sun'' (New York), 15 March 1914]]
[[File:Montjoie, Ricciotto Canudo, André Salmon, sculpture by Joseph Csaky, 3rd issue, 18 March, 1914.jpg|thumb|Montjoie! [[Ricciotto Canudo]], [[André Salmon]], ''Head'' by Joseph Csaky, 3rd issue, 18 March 1914]]
''Head'' is a plaster sculpture carved in a vertical format. The work represents the bust of a man in a highly Cubist syntax, in opposition to the softness and curvilinearity of [[Nabis]], [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] or [[Art Nouveau]] forms. 

Csaky's heads of the period partake in the "stylized, hieratic, nonportrait tradition of tribal and ancient art", writes Edith Balas, "in which there is a total lack of interest in depicting psychological traits". ''Head'' is testimony to Csaky's early immersion in the Cubist idiom.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture'', American Philosophical Society]. Reproduced Fig. 6, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The subject is constructed with a grouping of faceted planar forms that together form a tight cohesive structure. The models facial features are simply constructed with only a few surface planes juxtaposed in geometric terms at various angles. Sphericity of the head is broken by angular cuts, forming triangular (ears), rectangles (the nose) and arcs (cheekbones), visible in the photograph. The shoulders and neck form a robust base upon which the head rests. The models hair, while treated almost realistically, are stylized and cut radically at an angle with the forehead. Only one eye is visible.

The treatment of Csaky's ''Tête d'homme'', as other works by the artist executed between 1910 and 1914, suggest, as Albert Edward Elsen notes, that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Edward Elsen, ''Origins of modern sculpture: pioneers and premises'', G. Braziller, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in Csaky's ''[[Groupe de femmes]]'' (1911–12) and ''[[Danseuse (Csaky)|Danseuse]]'' (1912), ''Head'' already shows a new way of representing the human figure, an unwillingness to revert to classical, academic or traditional methods of representation. The complex angular syntax visible in ''Head'' was born out of a growing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of rhythm, balance, harmony and out of the powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, African art, early Cycladic art, Gothic art, of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Cézanne]], all of whom Csaky greatly admired.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

==Salon des Indépendants, 1914==
At the Salon des Indépendants, held in Paris 1 to 30 March 1914, composed of many [[Orphism (art)|Orphist]] works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor of the at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées: [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]] were largely represented.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Csaky exhibited ''Tête d'homme'' (plaster, n. 814 or 815 of the catalog), along with another bust and ''[[Danseuse (Csaky)|Danseuse]]'' (1912), executed in a highly Cubist facture.&lt;ref name="Marcilhac" /&gt; Several years later, [[Marcel Duchamp]], speaking about his own experience during the revolutionary years in the history of art of the 20th century, presented Joseph Csaky as "belonging to a group of sculptors who, before 1914,  imparted a new direction in their work. The theory of Cubism was then a trampoline that permitted the propulsion towards unexplored regions and Csaky, even if influenced by Cubism, developed his own concepts on the treatment of space. His first works appeared more theoretical and intellectual than his later works when he oriented his personal development towards atmospheric structures."&lt;ref name="Marcilhac" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Duchamp, 1958, ''Duchamp du signe, suivi de Notes'', Michel Sanouillet, Paul Matisse, Anne Sanouillet, Paul B. Franklin, Flammarion, 2008, (re-edition) {{ISBN|2080116649}}, 9782080116642&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the 1914 Indépendants in an article entitled ''Le Salon'', published in the periodical ''Montjoie!'' and ''Montparnasse'', [[André Salmon]], who usually considered works the Indépendants 'true mediocrity' of the pupils of ''l'art officiel'', encouraged his readers to visit this years salon to discover 'true modernity'. To justify his claim he reproduce a large photograph Csaky's 1913 ''Head''.&lt;ref name="Montjoie!" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10834">The '''Irish Exhibition of Living Art''' ('''IELA''') was a yearly exhibition of Irish abstract expressionism and avant-garde Irish art that was started in 1943 by [[Mainie Jellett]].&lt;ref name=NYTIMES&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Doherty|first=Brian|title=In Dublin: Pubs, Poets, Painters-Alive, Alive-O|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/116068288/|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 Aug 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===World War II Ireland===
During World War II, Ireland remained mostly uninvolved in the war that swept through most the rest of Europe, known only as "the Emergency" in Ireland.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Caleb|title=That is only war: Irish writers and the emergency|journal=UMI Dissertations Publishing|year=2006|pages=2–4|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304978789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking a "neutral" stance in the war, Ireland did not engage directly in the war on either side and declined to make any kind of established allegiance to the Axis or Allied powers.  As a result, Ireland experienced a period of isolation from the rest of the Western world, with few Irishmen travelling abroad and few foreigners travelling to Ireland.  This period of isolation set in motion a period of criticism and questioning of the fledgling country's national identity and ideals, with various factions unhappy with the status quo in the island nation.   Some of the primary concerns for those unsatisfied with the state of the Ireland at the time included a government unconcerned with the republican ideals the nation was created with, widespread poverty in Ireland, and a general inability for the nation to be a major player on the world stage capable of defending itself.  With these concerns and isolation, the Irish people sought to question the direction Ireland was headed in.  And in this war period and the time that immediately followed, Ireland and its artists also sought to question what constituted "Irish art" and how that would impact Irish identity.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar /&gt;

===Art In Ireland===
Art in Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s still primarily consisted of traditional representational art.  Championed by the Royal Hibernian Academy and the National College of Art, this traditionalist art remained the favored style of visual artistic creation following the Emergency period.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the this sentence and the previous one|date=April 2015}} Many Irish artists rejected the established institutions and sought philosophical inspiration from other fields, particularly that of literature.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency /&gt; Although it was not until the late 1930s that the character of Irish art was to be seriously challenged as Irish artists began seeking an Irish artistic identity.  With artists like Mainie Jellett leading the way, artists of Ireland, who more frequently received no formal education due to some of the institutions more restrictive policies, found an outlet to challenge the traditionalist movements in Ireland through organizations like the IELA.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Roisin|title=The emergency: a turning point for Irish art?|journal=Circa|year=2000|pages=1–2|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1320756901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the opening of the IELA, only one major exhibition took place each year in Dublin, which was the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy.  The RHA, and other major art institutions in Ireland at this time, supported art that accurately portrayed reality.&lt;ref name=LivingArt&gt;{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=John|title=A Painter of Living Art: Jack P. Hanlon 1913-1968|journal=|year=1988|pages=222|doi=10.2307/20492069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And while the established art forums favored traditional representational art, there was some push back from groups of artists in favor of modernist art.  One of the most well-known of these prior to the IELA was known as the [[White Stag Group]] which was formed in the late 1930s.  The White Stag Group, formed by Kenneth Hall and Basil Rakoczi, had middle-class English roots that eventually took hold in Dublin and the rest of Ireland. It wasn't until organizations like the IELA and White Stag Group came about that non-traditional Irish art had a means of being displayed in a way that was accessible and popular.&lt;ref name=Stag&gt;{{cite book|last=Keown, Edwina|first=and Carol Taaffe|title=Irish Modernism|publisher=Peter Lang AG, International Publishers|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iu5qMGrr3QcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the IELA==
The IELA was formed in 1943 after a group of middle-class artists in Ireland sought to oppose the traditional hegemony created by the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) and the National College of Art in Ireland.  Artists in this group included [[Norah McGuinness]], [[Mainie Jellett]], [[Evie Hone]], Fr. [[Jack Hanlon (Priest and Painter)|Jack Hanlon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]], among others.&lt;ref name=IELAbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/irish-exhibition-living-art|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|work=British and Irish Artists of the 20th Century|publisher=Artist Biographies|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all of them subscribed completely to the modernism of the rest of western Europe and the United States, these artists did seek to stray off the path established by Irish art institutions.  Many artists that founded the IELA were influenced by the dissenting Impressionist art circles in Paris who broke away from the French Academy.  Even though they understood this may cause friction with established institutions in Ireland, many of the founders saw the French as an example to be followed.  However, many artists managed to form a delicate balance, seeing as artists who displayed their work in the IELA also displayed pieces through the other traditional institutions such as the RHA.  Nonetheless, the IELA's main goal was to provide a forum for artists who sought to reshape the Irish artistic landscape and provided them the means through which to do that.&lt;ref name=LivingArt /&gt;

The beginnings of the IELA can be traced to an open criticism of the RHA by Jellett which ultimately led to other modernist artists like le Brocquy having their works rejected for exhibitions hosted annually by the RHA.  In response to this, Jellett and other modernist artists established the IELA to create a forum to display the work of artists regardless of what school or style they subscribed to.  Reviews of the IELA's first show in 1943 indicated the division in the art world over artistic identity and creativity.&lt;ref name=IELAhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-exhibition-of-living-art.htm|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA) (1943-1980s)|work=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|publisher=History and Foundation of the IELA|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some instances, this division was deeply entrenched, especially in the National College of Art, which was opposed to modernist movements for some time.  However, this opposition was not felt as strongly in every established institution in the country.  Even though steadfastness for traditional art was common, much of the art world in Ireland remained fairly well connected and eased their opposition to the tide of modernism coming from continent-inspired artists.  Both the modernist and traditionalist camps had their work displayed by the same institutions in some instances.  Ultimately, this coexistence allowed for institutions like IELA to be friendly with organizations such as the RHA, without which the IELA would have no traction in the Dublin art world.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

Not only did the IELA seek to break from the traditional norms of Irish art, it was displayed some progressive trends for its time, whether intentionally or otherwise.  For example, women artists played a critical role in the formation and establishment of the IELA.  The first two presidents of the Exhibition, Mainie Jellett and Norah McGuinness, were women who held the position during the formative years of the Exhibition.  Jellett, who served as the president before her death in 1944, played a key role in its formation, and McGuinness, who served for over 20 years after its foundation, played a critical role in maintaining the direction that the IELA stood for.&lt;ref name=WomenArtists&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayes, Elizabeth, Jeni Rogers, Wanda Ryan-Smolin|title=Irish Women Artists: From the 18th Century to the Present Day|journal=|year=1990|pages=45–49|jstor=1358389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following its conception, the IELA became a fixture in the Irish art world.  However, while they did become established, they did not allow themselves to lose sight of the founding principles of the institution.  True to the spirit of the IELA, the original management stepped down and handed off the Exhibition to a younger generation of artists in 1972.  The IELA continued to influence young artists well into the future.&lt;ref name=HistofIreland&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=J. R.|title=A New History of Ireland, Volume VII: Medieval Ireland 1921-1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=606–607|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfFXarIhGqEC&amp;pg=PT84&amp;lpg=PT84&amp;dq=A+New+History+of+Ireland,+Volume+VII&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=86rx_eRc1m&amp;sig=6b7_13lLlYMHNVISv3W-mEt_Ows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Os0qVcq4AoewggTgvYG4BQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Irish%20Exhibition%20of%20Living%20Art%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, the IELA remains a showcase for contemporary art and has since expanded to include other art forms such as performance, video, and installation art.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;  The IELA has played an enormous role in developing the Irish art scene and providing an outlet through which the artists of Ireland can display their works while also challenging the norm in Irish art, even being called a part of the "birth of Modernism in the visual arts in Ireland."&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Lilliput|first=Dorothy|title=Knowing the difference Brian Kennedy welcomes a 'splendid' history of Irish modern art|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=142626&amp;sr=HLEAD(Knowing%20the%20difference%20Brian%20Kennedy%20welcomes%20a%20%60splendid%20history%20of%20Irish%20modern%20art)%20and%20date%20is%201998|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 Jan 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Exhibition even expanded to include postmodernist art to expose both the public and artists alike to new developing styles.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

The term '''kill chain''' was originally used as a [[military]] concept related to the structure of an [[Offensive (military)|attack]]; consisting of target identification, force dispatch to target, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the destruction of the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cno.navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/04/23/kill-chain-approach-4/ | title=Kill Chain Approach | work=Chief of Naval Operations | date=April 23, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613233413/http://cno.navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/04/23/kill-chain-approach-4/ | archivedate=June 13, 2013 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the idea of "breaking" an opponent's kill chain is a method of [[defense (military)|defense]] or preemptive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/17/breaking-the-kill-chain/ | title=Breaking the Kill Chain | work=Foreign Policy | date=May 17, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Jonathan Greenert | author2=Mark Welsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Lockheed Martin]] adapted this concept to [[information security]], using it as a method for modeling intrusions on a [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How Lockheed Martin's 'Kill Chain' Stopped SecurID Attack | work=DARKReading | date=January 12, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Higgins, Kelly Jackson | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/how-lockheed-martins-kill-chain-stopped-securid-attack/d/d-id/1139125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cyber kill chain model has seen some adoption in the information security community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/leveraging-the-kill-chain-for-awesome/a/d-id/1317810 | title=Leveraging The Kill Chain For Awesome | work=DARKReading | date=December 2, 2014 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Mason, Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acceptance is not universal, with critics pointing to what they believe are fundamental flaws in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/2134037/strategic-planning-erm/the-practicality-of-the-cyber-kill-chain-approach-to-security.html | title=The practicality of the Cyber Kill Chain approach to security | work=CSO Online | date=October 4, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Myers, Lysa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The military kill chain==
===F2T2EA===
One military kill chain model is the "F2T2EA", which includes the following phases:
*Find: Locate the target.
*Fix:  Fix their location; or make it difficult for them to move.
*Track: Monitor their movement.
*Target: Select an appropriate weapon or asset to use on the target to create desired effects.
*Engage: Apply the weapon to the target.
*Assess: Evaluate effects of the attack, including any intelligence gathered at the location.

This is an integrated, end-to-end process described as a "chain" because an interruption at any stage can interrupt the entire process.&lt;ref name=Lockheed&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf Lockheed-Martin Corporation-Hutchins, Cloppert, and Amin-Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains-2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous terminology===
The "Four Fs" is a military term used in the United States military, especially during World War II.

Designed to be easy to remember, the "Four Fs" are as follows:

*Find the enemy – Locate the enemy
*Fix the enemy – Pin them down with suppressing fire
*Fight the enemy – Engage the enemy in combat or flank the enemy – Send soldiers to the enemy's sides or rear
*Finish the enemy – Eliminate all enemy combatants

===North Korean nuclear capability===
A new American military contingency plan called "Kill Chain" is reportedly the first step in a new strategy to use satellite imagery to identify North Korean launch sites, nuclear facilities and manufacturing capability and destroy them pre-emptively if a conflict seems imminent.  The plan was mentioned in a joint statement by the United States and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/asia/pentagon-spy-satellites-north-korea-missiles.html|title=Tiny Satellites From Silicon Valley May Help Track North Korea Missiles|last=Sanger|first=David E.|date=July 6, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kr.usembassy.gov/063017-joint-statement-united-states-republic-korea/|title=06/30/17 - Joint Statement between the United States and the Republic of Korea {{!}} U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in Korea|date=2017-06-30|work=U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in Korea|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack phases and countermeasures===
Computer scientists at Lockheed-Martin corporation described a new "intrusion kill chain" framework or model to defend computer networks in 2011.&lt;ref name=Lockheed/&gt; They wrote that attacks may occur in phases and can be disrupted through controls established at each phase. Since then, the "cyber kill chain™" has been adopted by data security organizations to define phases of cyber-attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3104542/security/why-the-cyber-kill-chain-needs-an-upgradesecurity-pros-need-to-focus-more-on-catching-attackers-aft.html|title=Why the ‘cyber kill chain’ needs an upgrade|last=Greene|first=Tim|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cyber kill chain reveals the phases of a cyber attack:  from early reconnaissance to the goal of data exfiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.varonis.com/the-cyber-kill-chain-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-data-breaches/|title=The Cyber Kill Chain or: how I learned to stop worrying and love data breaches|date=2016-06-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kill chain can also be used as a management tool to help continuously improve network defense. According to Lockheed Martin, threats must progress through several phases in the model, including:

# Reconnaissance: Intruder selects target, researches it, and attempts to identify vulnerabilities in the target network.
# Weaponization: Intruder creates remote access malware weapon, such as a virus or worm, tailored to one or more vulnerabilities.
# Delivery: Intruder transmits weapon to target (e.g., via e-mail attachments, websites or USB drives)
# Exploitation: Malware weapon's program code triggers, which takes action on target network to exploit vulnerability.
# Installation: Malware weapon installs access point (e.g., "backdoor") usable by intruder.
# Command and Control:  Malware enables intruder to have "hands on the keyboard" persistent access to target network. 
# Actions on Objective: Intruder takes action to achieve their goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or encryption for ransom.

Defensive courses of action can be taken against these phases:&lt;ref&gt;http://gauss.ececs.uc.edu/Courses/c6055/pdf/attackpatterns.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Detect: determine whether an attacker is poking around
# Deny: prevent information disclosure and unauthorized access
# Disrupt: stop or change outbound traffic (to attacker)
# Degrade: counter-attack command and control
# Deceive: interfere with command and control
# Contain: network segmentation changes

A U.S. Senate investigation of the 2013 Target Corporation data breach included analysis based on the Lockheed-Martin kill chain framework. It identified several stages where controls did not prevent or detect progression of the attack.&lt;ref name=Senate/&gt;

===Critiques of the cyber kill chain===
Among the critiques of Lockheed Martin's cyber kill chain model as threat assessment and prevention tool is that the first phases happen outside the defended network, making it difficult to identify or defend against actions in these phases. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/a-twist-onthe-cyber-kill-chain-defending-against-a-javascript-malware-attack/a/d-id/1326952 | title=A Twist On The Cyber Kill Chain: Defending Against A JavaScript Malware Attack | work=DARKReading | date=September 21, 2016 | author=Laliberte, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this methodology is said to reinforce traditional perimeter-based and malware-prevention based defensive strategies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/deconstructing-the-cyber-kill-chain/a/d-id/1317542 | title=Deconstructing The Cyber Kill Chain | work=DARKReading | date=November 18, 2014 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Engel, Giora}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that the traditional cyber kill chain isn't suitable to model the insider threat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Reidy-Combating-the-Insider-Threat-At-The-FBI-Slides.pdf | title=Combating the Insider Threat at the FBI | work=BlackHat USA 2013| author=Reidy, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly troublesome given the likelihood of successful attacks that breach the internal network perimeter, which is why organizations "''need to develop a strategy for dealing with attackers inside the firewall. They need to think of every attacker as [a] potential insider''”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oodaloop.com/osint/cyber/2015/02/19/every-cyber-attacker-insider/ | title=Every Cyber Attacker is an Insider | work=OODA Loop| date=February 19, 2015| author=Devost, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Unified Kill Chain==
[[File:The Unified Kill Chain.png|thumb|The Unified Kill Chain consists of 18 unique attack phases that can occur in advanced cyber attacks.]]A unified version of the kill chain was developed to overcome common critiques against the traditional cyber kill chain, by uniting and extending Lockheed Martin’s Kill Chain and MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK framework. The Unified Kill Chain is an ordered arrangement of 18 unique attack phases that may occur in end-to-end cyber attacks, which covers activities that occur outside and within the defended network. As such, the Unified Kill Chain improves over the scope limitations of the traditional kill chain and the time-agnostic nature of tactics in MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK. The unified model can be used to analyze, compare and defend against end-to-end cyber attacks by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csacademy.nl/images/scripties/2018/Paul_Pols_-_The_Unified_Kill_Chain_1.pdf | title=The Unified Kill Chain | date=December 7, 2017 | author=Pols, Paul | publisher=Cyber Security Academy|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural products are not only sources of [[energy]] and nutrients, but also sources of [[fuel]], [[medicine]], [[fiber]], and [[lumber]]. Agriculture as an activity is also the source of livelihood and income for much of the world’s population, especially those living in rural areas. For this reason, agriculture has a considerable, positive impact on health and nutrition.&lt;ref name="HawkesRuel2006"&gt;Hawkes, C. and M. Ruel. 2006. [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/understanding-links-between-agriculture-and-health Understanding the Links between Agriculture and Health]. 2020 Focus 13. Brief 1. Washington D.C.: IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the downside, agriculture has many negative effects on health. Agricultural production, [[trade]], and distribution can negatively affect the environment through pesticide and fertilizer runoff polluting the soil and ground water.&lt;ref name="WDR08FocusH"&gt;The World Bank. 2008. [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2008/Resources/2795087-1192112387976/WDR08_18_Focus_H.pdf The two-way links between agriculture and health]. Focus H of the [http://go.worldbank.org/ZJIAOSUFU0 World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517025442/http://go.worldbank.org/ZJIAOSUFU0 |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO, around 1.1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref name="WHO2010"&gt;World Health Organization. 2010. [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/mdg1/en/index.html Health through safe drinking water and basic sanitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other negative effects include health and environmental risks to producers and laborers by being exposed to bad weather, handling chemical and biological products, working long hours, or using dangerous agricultural machinery.

Conversely, health and nutrition can also influence agriculture. Poor health affects farm productivity and household income, creating a vicious circle of [[poverty]], [[food insecurity]], and ill health.&lt;ref name="HawkesRuel2006" /&gt;

==The Policy Consultation and Conference==

===Rationale===
The goal of the policy consultation is to overcome the isolation of policymakers and practitioners working in the agriculture, nutrition, and health sectors and to leverage the strong interactions and synergies among these sectors. In view of the problems many poor countries face to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) by 2015, the initiative hopes to consolidate information and build consensus for a joint action leveraging agriculture to improve nutrition and health.&lt;ref name="ConceptNote"&gt;[http://2020conference.ifpri.info/files/2010/09/2020anh_conceptnote.pdf Leveraging Agriculture for Improving Nutrition and Health].

ONE, November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process and Events===
The process started in October and November 2010 with three seminars in Washington, DC. Besides the lead-in seminars and the main conference in February 2011 in India, the consultation also includes a youth writing contest in which young people between 14 and 18 years of age can submit thoughts and ideas on how to change agriculture to produce better food and lead to better health.&lt;ref name="ConferenceWebsite" /&gt;

The seminars in October and November 2010 were:

'''Shade-tolerant species''' are species that are able to thrive in the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]], and in the presence of natural competition by other plants. '''Shade-intolerant species''' require full [[sunlight]] and little or no competition. '''Intermediate shade-tolerant''' trees fall somewhere in between the two.

[[File:Logistic-curve.svg|thumb|320px|right|Standard logistic sigmoid function i.e. &lt;math&gt;L=1,k=1,x_0=0&lt;/math&gt;]]

A '''logistic function''' or '''logistic curve''' is a common "S" shape ([[sigmoid function|sigmoid curve]]), with equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where
*''e'' = the [[natural logarithm]] base (also known as [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]]),
*''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = the ''x''-value of the sigmoid's midpoint,
*''L'' = the curve's maximum value, and
*''k'' = the logistic growth rate or steepness of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Pierre-François |last=Verhulst |year= 1838| title = Notice sur la loi que la population poursuit dans son accroissement | journal = Correspondance mathématique et physique |volume = 10| pages = 113–121
|url = https://books.google.com/?id=8GsEAAAAYAAJ
| format = PDF| accessdate = 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For values of ''x'' in the domain of [[real number]]s from −∞ to +∞, the S-curve shown on the right is obtained, with the graph of ''f'' approaching ''L'' as ''x'' approaches +∞ and approaching zero as ''x'' approaches −∞.

The logistic function finds applications in a range of fields, including [[artificial neural network]]s, [[biology]] (especially [[ecology]]), [[biomathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[demography]], [[economics]], [[geoscience]], [[mathematical psychology]], [[probability]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[linguistics]], and [[statistics]].

In general the philosophers and mathematicians of Greece undoubtedly considered it beneath their dignity to treat of this branch, which probably formed a part of the elementary instruction of children."}} The term is unrelated to the military and management term ''[[logistics]]'', which is instead from {{lang-fr|{{wikt-lang|fr|logis}}}} "lodgings", though some believe the Greek term also influenced ''logistics''; see {{slink|Logistics|Origin}} for details.

== Mathematical properties ==
&lt;!--{{move section portions from|Pierre François Verhulst|date=February 2014}} Please see next section--&gt;
The '''{{visible anchor|standard logistic function}}''' is the logistic function with parameters (''k'' = 1, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''L'' = 1) which yields

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\
     &amp;= \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} \\
     &amp;= \tfrac12 + \tfrac12 \tanh(\tfrac{x}{2}) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, due to the nature of the [[exponential function]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, it is often sufficient to compute the standard logistic function for ''x'' over a small range of real numbers such as a range contained in [−6,&amp;nbsp;+6] as it quickly converges very close to its saturation values of 0 and 1.

The logistic function has the symmetry property that:

: &lt;math&gt;1-f(x) = f(-x).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f(x) - 1/2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[odd function]].

The logistic function is an offset and scaled [[hyperbolic tangent]] function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \tfrac12 + \tfrac12 \tanh(\tfrac{x}{2})&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\tanh(x) = 2 \, f(2x) - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This follows from
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tanh(x) &amp; = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x \cdot \left(1 - e^{-2x}\right)}{e^x \cdot \left(1 + e^{-2x}\right)} \\[6pt]
&amp; = f(2x) - \frac{e^{-2x}}{1+e^{-2x}} = f(2x) - \frac{e^{-2x} + 1 - 1}{1+e^{-2x}} = 2f(2x)-1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivative ===
The standard logistic function has an easily calculated [[derivative]]:

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac 1 {1+e^{-x}}= \frac {e^{x}} {1+e^{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \frac{e^{x} \cdot (1+e^{x})-e^{x} \cdot e^{x}}{(1 + e^{x})^2} =  \frac{e^{x}}{(1 + e^{x})^2} = f(x)(1-f(x))&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of the logistic function is an [[even function]]:

: namely, &lt;math&gt;f'(-x)=f'(x)     &lt;/math&gt;

=== Integral ===
Conversely, its [[antiderivative]] can be computed by the [[Integration by substitution|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;u = 1 + e^x&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac {e^{x}} {1+e^{x}} = \frac {u'} {u}&lt;/math&gt;, so (dropping the [[constant of integration]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {e^{x}} {1+e^{x}}\,dx = \int \frac 1 {u}\,du = \log u = \log (1 + e^x)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[artificial neural network]]s, this is known as the ''[[softplus]]'' function, and (with scaling) is a smooth approximation of the [[ramp function]], just as the logistic function (with scaling) is a smooth approximation of the [[Heaviside step function]].

=== Logistic differential equation ===
The standard logistic function is the solution of the simple first-order non-linear [[ordinary differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f(x)(1-f(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

with [[boundary condition]] ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2.  This equation is the continuous version of the [[logistic map]].

The qualitative behavior is easily understood in terms of the [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]]: the derivative is 0 when the function is 1; and the derivative is positive for ''f'' between 0 and 1, and negative for ''f'' above 1 or less than 0 (though negative populations do not generally accord with a physical model). This yields an unstable equilibrium at 0, and a stable equilibrium at 1, and thus for any function value greater than 0 and less than 1, it grows to 1.

&lt;!-- The above equation can be rewritten in the following steps:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f(x)(1-f(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = y(1-y) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = y - y^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} - y = -y^2 &lt;/math&gt; trivial algebraic manipulation--&gt;
The logistic equation is a special case of the [[Bernoulli differential equation]] and has the following solution:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{e^{x}}{e^{x}+C}&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing the constant of integration &lt;math&gt;C=1&lt;/math&gt; gives the other well-known form of the definition of the logistic curve

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}&lt;/math&gt;

More quantitatively, as can be seen from the analytical solution, the logistic curve shows early [[exponential growth]] for negative argument, which slows to linear growth of slope 1/4 for an argument near 0, then approaches 1 with an exponentially decaying gap.

The logistic function is the inverse of the natural [[logit]] function and so can be used to convert the logarithm of [[odds]] into a [[probability]]. In mathematical notation the logistic function is sometimes written as ''expit''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/clusterPower/docs/expit expit documentation for R's clusterPower package]&lt;/ref&gt; in the same form as ''logit''. The conversion from the [[log-likelihood ratio]] of two alternatives also takes the form of a logistic curve.

The hyperbolic tangent relationship leads to another form for the logistic function's derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac d {dx} f(x) = \frac 1 4 \operatorname{sech}^2\left(\tfrac{x}{2} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

which ties the logistic function into the [[logistic distribution]].

===Rotational symmetry about (0, &amp;frac12;)===
The sum of the logistic function and its reflection about the vertical axis, ''f''&amp;thinsp;(&amp;minus;''x'') is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}} + \frac 1 {1+e^{-(-x)}} = \frac{(1+e^x)+(1+e^{-x})}{(1+e^{-x})(1+e^x)} = \frac{2+e^x+e^{-x}}{1+e^x+e^{-x}+e^{x-x}} = \frac{2+e^x+e^{-x}}{2+e^x+e^{-x}} = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

The logistic function is thus rotationally symmetrical about the point (0,&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neural Networks - A Systematic Introduction|author=Raul Rojas|url=http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/chapter/K11.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== In ecology: modeling population growth ===
[[File:Pierre Francois Verhulst.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Pierre-François Verhulst (1804–1849)]]
A typical application of the logistic equation is a common model of [[population growth]] (see also [[population dynamics]]), originally due to [[Pierre François Verhulst|Pierre-François Verhulst]] in 1838, where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. The Verhulst equation was published after Verhulst had read [[Thomas Malthus]]' ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Verhulst derived his logistic equation to describe the self-limiting growth of a [[biology|biological]] population. The equation was rediscovered in 1911 by [[Anderson Gray McKendrick|A. G. McKendrick]] for the growth of bacteria in broth and experimentally tested using a technique for nonlinear parameter estimation.&lt;ref name="McKendric Logistic"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0370164600025426|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume= 31 |date= January 1912|pages= 649–653 |title=XLV.—The Rate of Multiplication of Micro-organisms: A Mathematical Study|author= A. G. McKendricka; M. Kesava Paia1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation is also sometimes called the ''Verhulst-Pearl equation'' following its rediscovery in 1920 by [[Raymond Pearl]] (1879–1940) and [[Lowell Reed]] (1888–1966) of the [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Raymond Pearl]] and [[Lowell Reed]]|title=On the Rate of Growth of the Population of the United States|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/mak/MA565/Pearl_Reed_PNAS_1920.pdf|date=June 1920|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|pages=275|number=6|volume=6|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scientist, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] derived the equation again in 1925, calling it the ''law of population growth''.

Letting ''P'' represent population size (''N'' is often used in ecology instead) and ''t'' represent time, this model is formalized by the [[differential equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=r P \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''r'' defines the [[population growth rate|growth rate]] and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]].

In the equation, the early, unimpeded growth rate is modeled by the first term +''rP''. The value of the rate ''r'' represents the proportional increase of the population ''P'' in one unit of time. Later, as the population grows, the modulus of the second term (which multiplied out is −''rP''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/K'') becomes almost as large as the first, as some members of the population ''P'' interfere with each other by competing for some critical resource, such as food or living space. This antagonistic effect is called the ''bottleneck'', and is modeled by the value of the parameter ''K''. The competition diminishes the combined growth rate, until the value of ''P'' ceases to grow (this is called ''maturity'' of the population).
The solution to the equation (with &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; being the initial population) is

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{K P_0 e^{rt}}{K + P_0 \left( e^{rt} - 1\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty} P(t) = K&lt;/math&gt;.

Which is to say that ''K'' is the limiting value of ''P'': the highest value that the population can reach given infinite time (or come close to reaching in finite time). It is important to stress that the carrying capacity is asymptotically reached independently of the initial value ''P''(0)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and also in the case that ''P''(0)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''K''.

In [[ecology]], [[species]] are sometimes referred to as [[r/K selection theory|''r''-strategist or ''K''-strategist]] depending upon the [[Natural selection|selective]] processes that have shaped their [[Biological life cycle|life history]] strategies.
[[Dimensional analysis|Choosing the variable dimensions]] so that ''n'' measures the population in units of carrying capacity, and ''τ'' measures time in units of ''1/r'', gives the dimensionless
differential equation

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dn}{d\tau} =  n (1-n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Time-varying carrying capacity ====
Since the environmental conditions influence the carrying capacity, as a consequence it can be time-varying: ''K''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, leading to the following mathematical model:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=rP \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P}{K(t)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

A particularly important case is that of carrying capacity that varies periodically with period ''T'':

: &lt;math&gt;K(t+T) = K(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that in such a case, independently from the initial value ''P''(0)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, ''P''(''t'') will tend to a unique periodic solution ''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), whose period is ''T''.

A typical value of ''T'' is one year: In such case ''K''(''t'') may reflect periodical variations of weather conditions.

Another interesting generalization is to consider that the carrying capacity ''K''(''t'') is a function of the population at an earlier time, capturing a delay in the way population modifies its environment. This leads to a logistic delay equation,&lt;ref name="delay carrying"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yukalov | first1 = V. I. | last2 = Yukalova | first2 = E.

=== In statistics and machine learning ===
Logistic functions are used in several roles in [[statistics]]. For example, they are the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[Logistic distribution|logistic family of distributions]], and they are, a bit simplified, used to model the chance a chess player has to beat his opponent in the [[Elo rating system]]. More specific examples now follow.

==== Logistic regression ====
{{Main|Logistic regression}}

Logistic functions are used in [[logistic regression]] to model how the probability ''p'' of an event may be affected by one or more [[explanatory variables]]: an example would be to have the model

: &lt;math&gt;p=f(a + bx)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is the explanatory variable and ''a'' and ''b'' are model parameters to be fitted and ''f'' is the standard logistic function.

Logistic regression and other [[log-linear model]]s are also commonly used in [[machine learning]]. A generalisation of the logistic function to multiple inputs is the [[softmax activation function]], used in [[multinomial logistic regression]].

Another application of the logistic function is in the [[Rasch model]], used in [[item response theory]]. In particular, the Rasch model forms a basis for [[maximum likelihood]] estimation of the locations of objects or persons on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], based on collections of categorical data, for example the abilities of persons on a continuum based on responses that have been categorized as correct and incorrect.

==== Neural networks ====
Logistic functions are often used in [[neural network]]s to introduce [[nonlinearity]] in the model or to clamp signals to within a specified [[Range (mathematics)|range]].  A popular [[artificial neuron|neural net element]] computes a [[linear combination]] of its input signals, and applies a bounded logistic function to the result; this model can be seen as a "smoothed" variant of the classical [[perceptron|threshold neuron]].

&lt;!-- A reason for its popularity in neural networks is because the logistic function satisfies the differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;y' = y(1-y)&lt;/math&gt;.

The right hand side is a low-degree polynomial. Furthermore, the polynomial has factors ''y'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'', both of which are simple to compute. Given ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sig(''t'') at a particular ''t'', the derivative of the logistic function at that ''t'' can be obtained by multiplying the two factors together. --&gt;
A common choice for the activation or "squashing" functions, used to clip for large magnitudes to keep the response of the neural network bounded&lt;ref name="Gershenfeld-1999"&gt;Gershenfeld 1999, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;g(h) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2 \beta h}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is a logistic function.
These relationships result in simplified implementations of [[artificial neural network]]s with [[artificial neuron]]s. Practitioners caution that sigmoidal functions which are [[Odd functions|antisymmetric]] about the origin (e.g. the [[hyperbolic tangent]]) lead to faster convergence when training networks with [[backpropagation]].&lt;ref name="LeCun-1998"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = LeCun, Y.  | author2 = Bottou, L.  | author3 = Orr, G. | author4 = Muller, K. | editor = Orr, G. | editor2 = Muller, K. | year = 1998 | title = Efficient BackProp  | work = Neural Networks: Tricks of the trade  | isbn = 3-540-65311-2 | publisher = Springer | url = http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logistic function is itself the derivative of another proposed activation function, the [[softplus]].

=== In medicine: modeling of growth of tumors ===
{{See also|Gompertz curve#Growth of tumors}}
Another application of logistic curve is in medicine, where the logistic differential equation is used to model the growth of tumors. This application can be considered an extension of the above-mentioned use in the framework of ecology (see also the [[Generalized logistic curve]], allowing for more parameters). Denoting with ''X''(''t'') the size of the tumor at time ''t'', its dynamics are governed by:

: &lt;math&gt;X'=r\left(1 - \frac X K \right)X&lt;/math&gt;

which is of the type:

:&lt;math&gt;X'=F(X)X, \qquad F'(X) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''(''X'') is the proliferation rate of the tumor.

If a chemotherapy is started with a log-kill effect, the equation may be revised to be

:&lt;math&gt;X'=r\left(1 - \frac X K \right)X - c(t)X,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''(''t'') is the therapy-induced death rate. In the idealized case of very long therapy, ''c''(''t'') can be modeled as a periodic function (of period ''T'') or (in case of continuous infusion therapy) as a constant function, and one has that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 T \int_0^T c(t)\, dt &gt; r \to \lim_{t \to +\infty} x(t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. if the average therapy-induced death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate then there is the eradication of the disease. Of course, this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy (e.g. it does not take into account the phenomenon of clonal resistance).

=== In chemistry: reaction models ===
The concentration of reactants and products in [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic reactions]] follow the logistic function.
The degradation of PGM-free ORR catalyst in fuel cell cathode follows the logistic decay function &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Xi |last2=Zelenay |first2=Piotr |title=Kinetic Models for the Degradation Mechanisms of PGM-Free ORR Catalysts |journal=ECS Transactions |date=13 July 2018 |volume=85 |issue=13 |pages=1239–1250 |doi=10.1149/08513.1239ecst}}&lt;/ref&gt;, suggesting an autocatalytic degradation mechanism.

=== In physics: Fermi distribution ===
The logistic function determines the statistical distribution of fermions over the energy states of a system in thermal equilibrium. In particular, it is the distribution of the probabilities that each possible energy level is occupied by a fermion, according to [[Fermi function|Fermi–Dirac statistics]].

=== In material science: Phase diagrams ===
[[Diffusion bonding]].

=== In linguistics: language change ===
In linguistics, the logistic function can be used to model [[language change]]:&lt;ref name="probabilistic linguistics"&gt;Bod, Hay, Jennedy (eds.) 2003, pp. 147–156&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation that is at first marginal begins to spread more quickly with time, and then more slowly as it becomes more universally adopted.

=== In agriculture: modeling crop response ===
The logistic S-curve can be used for modeling the crop response to changes in growth factors. There are two types of response functions:  ''positive''  and ''negative'' growth curves. For example, the crop yield may ''increase'' with increasing value of the growth factor up to a certain level (positive function), or it may ''decrease'' with increasing growth factor values (negative function owing to a negative growth factor), which situation requires an ''inverted'' S-curve.
{| class="wikitable"
|The logistic S-curve can be used to model the relation between crop yield and depth of the '''[[water table]]''' in the soil.&lt;ref name="calc"&gt;Calculator for crop response to changes in growth factors using [[segmented regression]], S-curves and [[Parabola|parabolas]].

|}

=== In economics and sociology: diffusion of innovations ===
The logistic function can be used to illustrate the progress of the [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of an innovation]] through its life cycle.

In ''The Laws of Imitation'' (1890), [[Gabriel Tarde]] describes the rise and spread of new ideas through imitative chains. In particular, Tarde identifies three main stages through which innovations spread: the first one corresponds to the difficult beginnings, during which the idea has to struggle within a hostile environment full of opposing habits and beliefs; the second one corresponds to the properly exponential take-off of the idea, with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=2^x&lt;/math&gt;; finally, the third stage is logarithmic, with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\log(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponds to the time when the impulse of the idea gradually slows down while, simultaneously new opponent ideas appear. The ensuing situation halts or stabilizes the progress of the innovation, which approaches an asymptote.

In the history of economy, when new products are introduced there is an intense amount of research and development which leads to dramatic improvements in quality and reductions in cost.  This leads to a period of rapid industry growth. Some of the more famous examples are: railroads, incandescent light bulbs, [[electrification]], [[cars]] and air travel. Eventually, dramatic improvement and cost reduction opportunities are exhausted, the product or process are in widespread use with few remaining potential new customers, and markets become saturated.

Logistic analysis was used in papers by several researchers at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis ([[IIASA]]). These papers deal with the diffusion of various innovations, infrastructures and energy source substitutions and the role of work in the economy as well as with the long economic cycle. Long economic cycles were investigated by Robert Ayres (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Lynx X-ray Observatory''' is a concept study for the next [[X-ray telescope|X-ray space telescope]] mission.&lt;ref name="Lynx home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwastro.msfc.nasa.gov/lynx |title=Lynx - Revealing the Revealing the invisible Universe |last=Swartz |first=Douglas |work=Marshall Space Flight Center |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still a preliminary concept in formulation, it will be presented to the United States [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey|Decadal Survey]] in 2019 for a possible selection to NASA's [[Large Strategic Science Missions]]. If funded and developed, ''Lynx'' will be able to detect and characterize extremely faint objects and study physical processes in a very wide range of [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] settings.

The name [[lynx]] was chosen because the animal is "a symbol of great insight with the ability to see through solid objects to reveal the true nature of things." &lt;ref name='Status 2017'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170007501.pdf Lynx Mission Concept Status] (PDF).

==Overview==

In 2016, NASA began considering four different [[space telescope]]s to select the next Flagship or [[Large Strategic Science Mission]];&lt;ref name="Sci.Am. 2016"/&gt; they are the [[Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission]] (HabEx), [[Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor]] (LUVOIR), [[Origins Space Telescope]] (OST), and Lynx X-Ray Surveyor.  In 2019 the four teams will turn their final reports over to the [[National Academy of Sciences]], whose independent [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey|Decadal Survey]] committee advises NASA on which mission should take top priority. If funded, it would launch approximately in 2035.&lt;ref name="Sci.Am. 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scoles |first=Sarah |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-considers-its-next-flagship-space-telescope/# |title=NASA Considers Its Next Flagship Space Telescope |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=2017-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Material criticality''' is the determination of which materials that flow through an [[industry]] or [[economy]] are most important to the production process. It is a sub-category within the field of [[material flow analysis]] (MFA), which is a method to [[quantitatively]] analyze the flows of materials used for industrial production in an industry or economy. MFA is a useful tool to assess what impacts materials used in the industrial process have and how efficiently a given process uses them.

Material criticality evaluation criteria consist of three dimensions: supply risk, vulnerability to supply restriction, and environmental implications. Supply risk comprises several components, and changes based on short or long-term temporal outlooks. Vulnerability to supply restriction is dependent on the organizational level (global, national, and corporate).&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; This methodology was developed from a United States National Research Council model, and is intended to help stakeholders make strategic decisions about the materials used in their production process. In the globalized economy, scarcity of essential materials in the industrial supply chain is a growing concern. As a result, nations and other large institutions are increasingly analyzing a material’s criticality and seek to minimize any risk, restriction, or environmental impact associated with the material.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

== Supply risk ==
Supply risk is one of three dimensions that determine a material’s criticality. Supply risk can be evaluated for the medium term (5–10 years, typically most appropriate for corporations and governments) and the long term (multiple decades, usually considered by long-range planners, [[futurists]], and [[sustainability]] scholars). Supply risk consists of three components: [[Geological]], [[Technological]], and [[Economic]]; [[Social]] and [[Regulatory]]; [[Geopolitical]].&lt;ref name="metal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graedal|first=T.E.|author2=Rachael Barr|title=Methodology of Metal Criticality Determination|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|year=2012|volume=46|issue=2|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203534z?mi=sppyl4&amp;af=R&amp;pageSize=20&amp;searchText=Pd+Au|accessdate=13 April 2013|doi=10.1021/es203534z}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first component focuses on the availability of the material’s supply and the last two focus on how access to that supply could be restricted. The components are assessed on a 0-100 scale for both medium and long-term risk with higher values indicating higher risk. The aggregated scores yield a material’s supply risk.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Geological, Technological, and Economic ===

The geological, technological and economic components of supply risk relate to the most basic questions relating to a materials availability; geologically, how much (material) is there; technologically, is it feasible to obtain; and economically, is it practical to do so.  This component comprises two [[Economic indicator|indicator]]s of equal weight.  The first looks at the relative abundance of material resulting in "depletion time" or relatively how much of the material has not been consumed.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;  The second is a percentage of a given material extracted as a companion or trace material extracted as a by-product.  This is used to understand depletion rates of materials consumed as a by-product to extraction.

Quoting Graedel et al., "One should not regard the result as how long it will be until we run out, but rather as a useful relative indicator of the contemporary balance between supply and demand for the metal in question."   &lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Social and Regulatory ===
The social and regulatory components of a materials supply risk can impede or expedite the development of [[mineral resources]].  Regulations can hinder the reliability of mineral resource supply.  Social perceptions towards the negative environmental and [[socioeconomic]] effects on communities typically fuel these regulations.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

Material criticality employs the policy potential index (PPI) and [[human development index]] (HDI) indicators to quantify the social and regulatory components of supply risk evaluation.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Geopolitical ===
The geopolitical component of a material’s supply risk takes into account how governmental decisions and stability can significantly impact a material’s accessibility. For example, politically unstable and war-torn nations pose a greater risk to supply restriction than developed peaceful nations. Material concentration, geographic location, security, [[socio-economic]] distress, and political stability are all analyzed to address what amount the geopolitical component should factor into a material’s supply risk.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Metal scarcity ===
Metals are among the most important materials to the [[industrialized]] world, everything from [[infrastructure]] to personal electronic devices heavily relies on metals for production. As a result, global supply is being increasingly monitored and examined. For example, a recent study analyzed the varying levels of risk to the [[copper]] metals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graedel|first=T.E.|title=Criticality of the Geological Copper Family|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|year=2012|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1071–078|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203535w|accessdate=13 April 2013|doi=10.1021/es203535w}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that increasing metal scarcity could alter typical industrial behavior.&lt;ref name="scarcity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graedel|first=T.E.|author2=L. Erdmann|title=Will metal scarcity impede routine industrial use?|journal=MRS Bulletin|year=2012|volume=37|issue=4|pages=325–331|doi=10.1557/mrs.2012.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also noted that metals heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas, such as [[strontium]] in [[China]] or the [[platinum]] group in [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]]; pose greater risk for supply disruptions.&lt;ref name="scarcity" /&gt;

Since the late 1990s [[China]] has had a near [[monopoly]] on a variety of [[rare-earth metals]] commonly used in every day products. Much to the surprise of the international trade community [[China]] began restricting exports of these metals in 2009.&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=Ambrose|title=Japan Breaks China's Stranglehold on Rare Metals with Sea-mud Bonanza|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9951299/Japan-breaks-Chinas-stranglehold-on-rare-metals-with-sea-mud-bonanza.html|accessdate=13 April 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States|U.S.]] and [[World Trade Organization]] immediately protested however [[China]] has not changed its stance. This is a great example of a geopolitical based supply risk. To combat this supply disruption other countries, such as [[Japan]], are attempting new and innovative methods of [[mining]] these rare-earth metals.&lt;ref name="evans" /&gt;

== Vulnerability to Supply Restriction ==
Vulnerability to Supply Restriction (VSR) is an index that tells us how likely a particular [[Chemical element|element]] is to be restricted due to usage and availability. What evaluates the importance of a particular element at a social, economic and political level can be evaluated at three organizational levels; corporate, national and global levels.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; In total, it comprises eight indicator categories for the Corporate and National level, and 4 for the Global.  VSR is important in evaluating each significant end-use applications of a material separately. The current approach realizes that indicators may be common or be specific for one to two. The three organizational levels use an adjusted 0-100 scale, including 4 bins, each with a range of 25 points. Quantifying the VSR is based on materials importance and substitutability, and an ability to innovate can be included at some organizational levels.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Global ===
VSR at the Global level is focused on the intrinsic value of a material to the society of a country or countries and to what level a substitution is possible.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; It is not a short term evaluation and none of its indicators are evaluated as such. The global levels matrix does not include as many categories as the Corporate and National level VSR evaluations are. They are only evaluated by the Importance and Substitutability.

''1) Importance''
This consists of an indicator labeled percentage of population utilizing.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''2) Substitutability''
This comprises substitute performance, substitute availability, and the environmental impact ratio.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== National ===
Introduce national vulnerability to supply restriction: Looks at importance of an element, but does it through domestic [[industries]] and the country’s [[population]]. It is evaluated on either a short or long term, and can be regarded as more intermediate in time.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''1) Importance''  Composed of two [[Economic indicator|indicator]]s: national economic importance and percentage of population utilizing element.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''2) Substitutability''
Indicators are the same as at the corporate level except for that Price ratio is now labeled Net Importance price ratio.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''3) Susceptibility''
This is no longer labeled “ability to innovate” as it was at the corporate level. It is now “Susceptibility” and its indicator is no longer Corporate Innovation. The focus is now (1) net importance reliance (2) global innovation index.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Corporate ===
At the corporate level VSR is used to find the importance of an element in regards to (1) corporations current product lines (2) corporations Future product lines; with economic considerations each. (3) Ability to innovate. The corporate level is used to reinforce the belief that these innovative corporations are adapting more quickly to supply restriction. Emphasis on economic considerations. There is a development of sets of varied scenarios so that an estimate for how they might evolve is available.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''1) Importance''
Two indicators: national economic importance and percentage of population utilizing.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''2) Substitutability''
Substitutability evaluates (1) Substitute Performance (2) Substitute Availability (3) Environmental Impact Ration (4) Price Ratio. This evaluates the possible implications of an alternative material or metal in case the one at hand has a larger environmental impact or is in short supply.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''3) Ability to Innovate''
A corporation that uses natural resources is dependent upon that resource and a disruption in its supply can impact revenues and market share. A competitor's ability to find a substitute or more efficient means of extraction could overtake a corporation.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

===Toyota vs Ford and Lithium===
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Lithium Ion Battery]]

[[Lithium]] is used in [[Toyota]] and [[Ford]] cars' [[electric car]] batteries. Lithium is an ECE (energy critical elements) and is also a [[non-renewable resource]]. About 100 times more lithium is necessary in an electric car battery as is necessary for a standard laptop battery.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;Koerner. The Saudi Arabia of Lithium https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1124/034.html/&lt;/ref&gt; With new practices of car companies trying to wane off fossil fuel usage, it is important to note the increased demand for lithium for automakers.

At the corporate level, lithium must be evaluated in terms of its importance to the company, and see to what extent a substitute is possible in short term values. It is important to note that both Ford and Toyota's current and most used batteries in Electric cars are [[Lithium-ion]]. Ford Motor company’s senior manager of energy storage research stated, “There are foreseen limits of lithium ion technology,” this was stated in coordination with a graph estimating a diminishing number by 2017. [http://seekingalpha.com/article/158653-the-limits-of-lithium-ion-batteries-according-to-ford]. According to Toyota’s environmental technology corporate strategy, “As Toyota anticipates the widespread use of electric vehicles in the future, we have begun research in developing next-generation secondary batteries with performance that greatly exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries.” &lt;ref&gt;Toyota. Research Progress: Next Generation Secondary Batteries. 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/environmental_technology/next_generation_secondary_batteries.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407033031/http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/environmental_technology/next_generation_secondary_batteries.html |archivedate=2013-04-07 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lithium mine, Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Lithium mine, Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina]]At the National level, one would evaluate a nation in which lithium is in high supply. These include: [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; The high demand of car companies and electric extensive products requiring lithium reserves would bring large revenues into these resource rich nations. Lithium production has a very large incentive for a country. A [[ton]] of lithium can sell for anywhere between $4500 and $5200, and the purer lithium that is used in batteries sells at the upper end of that interval. Bolivia’s current reserve is estimated to be around 100 million tons &lt;ref&gt;Bill Moore. And you thought Peak Oil Was Dead and Buried. 4/14/13 http://evworld.com/blogs.cfm?authorid=209&amp;blogid=1128/&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the current market value of a ton of [[Zinc]] is measured to be $1929.15 &lt;ref&gt;Zinc http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=zinc/&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at the Global level, oftentimes highly developed countries are the ones extracting resources and bringing industry into these poorer countries. In terms of the population utilizing lithium, there is a relatively large amount of people using lithium, with technology encompassing a large percent of our interactions and activities in the world.
With some villages in [[Africa]] operating more cell phones than bathrooms, it is reasonable to estimate a large percent of the world uses lithium, and to predict that the material usage will increase as industrialization and technological dependency grows.&lt;ref&gt;New World. Lithium Facts. A New Age of Mineral Exploration in the Americas. ''New World Resource Corporation''. {{cite web |url=http://www.newworldresource.com/s/AboutLithium.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610040040/http://www.newworldresource.com/s/AboutLithium.asp |archivedate=2013-06-10 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of Toyota and Ford’s lithium usage, it is important to note that as of 2005, global zinc air production could produce enough [[Zinc–air battery|zinc-air batteries]] to power 1 billion electric vehicles, and lithium reserves could only power ten million lithium-ion powered vehicles [http://lithiuminvestingnews.com/4346/electric-vehicles-given-global-initiative/].

== Environmental implication ==
[[File:Falu Gruva2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Copper Mine]]
The burden that various materials impose on the environment is considered in material criticality. There are numerous negative effects that materials can have on the environment due to either their toxicity, the amounts of energy and water used in processing, and their emissions into the air, water and the land. The purpose of including an evaluation of environmental implications is to transfer information on potential impacts of using a specific material to product designers, government officials, and nongovernmental agencies.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

The environmental implication evaluation can use data from a source like the  [http://www.ecoinvent.ch/ Ecoinvent Database]. The ecoinvent database provides a single score for the negative impact to human health and ecosystems on a scale from 0-100. The scope of the score is [[Life-cycle assessment|Cradle to Gate]].&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

Environmental implications can also be reflected in social attitudes that may pose as a barrier to the development of resources in the form of objections to extraction. These objections may arise from a fear of how the new extraction site could potentially negatively impact the surrounding communities and ecosystems.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; This barrier can affect the reliability and security of resources.

Improved technology and infrastructure in the recycling re-use, and more efficient use of materials could mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts associated with them. This could also improve the reliability and security of resources.

An example of environmental implications is the ban on [[lead]] (Pb) in many products. Once government officials and product designers became aware of the dangers of lead government and company policies started prohibiting its use.

== Criticality focus ==
Material criticality is a relatively new area of focus. As global industrial activity continues to increase a wide array of stakeholders are paying more attention to material criticality in order to assess how production processes may be impacted and made more efficient. British Petroleum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Petroleum|url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/e_s_assets/e_s_assets_2010/downloads_pdfs/Materials_March2012.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/pi/office-policy-and-international-affairs/initiatives/department-energy-s-critical-materials|publisher=The Department of Energy|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raw materials|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/raw-materials/critical/|publisher=The European Union|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have all established review procedures to determine material criticality and how it affects their behavior. Additionally, there has been a growing body of academic study in this field, led by Thomas Graedel of Yale. Material criticality is going to be an essential factor in the industrial production process for the foreseeable future.

The '''Palo Alto Mental Research Institute''' (MRI) is one of the founding institutions of [[Brief psychotherapy|brief]] and [[family therapy]].&lt;ref name="Nichols, M. 2005"&gt;Nichols, M., &amp; Schwartz, R. (2005). ''Family Therapy: Concepts and Methods'' (7th Edition), New York City: [[Prentice Hall]].&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Don D. Jackson]] and colleagues in 1958, MRI has been one of the leading sources of ideas in the area of interactional/systemic studies, [[psychotherapy]], and family therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Weakland, J., &amp; Ray, W. (1995). ''Propagations: Thirty years of Influence from the Mental Research Institute'', New York: [[Haworth Press|Haworth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to an article in the ''Psychotherapy Networker'' on [[Jay Haley]] (a  Research Associate at MRI in the 1960s) MRI "became the go-to place for any therapist who wanted to be on the cutting edge of psychotherapy research and practice. Fostering a climate of almost untrammeled experimentalism, MRI started the first formal training program in family therapy, produced some of the seminal early papers and books in the field, and became a place where some of the field's leading figures - [[Paul Watzlawick]], [[Richard Fisch]], Jules Riskin, [[Virginia Satir]], [[Salvador Minuchin]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Irvin D. Yalom]], [[Cloe Madanes]] - came to work or just hang out".&lt;ref&gt;''Psychotherapy Networker'', November/December, 2007, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Brief Therapy Center at MRI presented an innovative model for the comprehensive approach to brief psychotherapy, a model which, in turn, has influenced subsequent brief therapy approaches  throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Nichols, M. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/us/15watzlawick.html Paul Watzlawick, Therapist Behind Rapid Diagnosis Strategy, Dies at 85 - [[New York Times]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Brief Therapy Center at MRI was founded by Dick Fisch, [[John Weakland]], and [[Paul Watzlawick]]. Continuing applied research and theory development have expanded the use of interactional concepts to community, school and business. Thousands of professionals within the U.S. as well as from many countries of the world have attended MRI training programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[www.mri.org MRI website]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Microphone Splitter.jpg|thumb|A microphone splitter]]

A '''microphone splitter''' is a device with an input from a [[microphone]] and multiple outputs. It is also known as a "'''rathouse'''" due to the large amount of cabling involved. A splitter is often used at larger venues to provide feeds from microphones or other sources to both a [[front of house]] [[mixing desk]] and a monitor desk.  This allows the monitor mix to be different from the house mix, so that the musicians may hear a mix with certain instruments emphasized, which can assist in achieving a feeling of "tightness".

In a simple splitter the outputs are connected in [[Parallel circuits | parallel]], with no isolation between outputs.  In cases where each output is connected to a system with a different [[Ground (electricity) | ground potential]], this can cause [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]], a common source of noise in an audio system.  To provide isolation and prevent ground loops, outputs may be connected via a splitting [[transformer]] or a number of [[buffer amplifiers]].  

Each additional output puts additional [[Electrical load | load]] on the source, which can cause signal degradation.  Active splitters with buffer amplifiers (also known as a [[distribution amplifier]]) are the only solution to provide an unlimited number of splits, but are costly.

'''Minimalism''' describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimalist music|music]], where the work is set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts. As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Frank Stella]]. Artists themselves have sometimes reacted against the label due to the negative implication of the work being simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Amy. Styles, Schools and Movements, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002.] "The artists themselves did not like the label because of the negative implication that their work was simplistic and devoid of 'art content'."&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalism is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices.

==Minimal art, minimalism in visual art==
[[File:Tonysmith freeride sculpture.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], ''Free Ride'', 1962, 6'8 x 6'8 x 6'8, [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York City)]]
Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", ''literalist art'' &lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ABC Art''&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cindy Hinant|editor1-last=Meyer-Stoll|editor1-first=Christiane|title=Gary Kuehn: Between Sex and Geometry|date=2014|publisher=Snoeck Verlagsgessellschaft|location=Cologne|isbn=3864421098|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially minimal art appeared in New York in the 60s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at the [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and the [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture''' shown from April 27 - June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine &lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 ''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Systemic+Painting,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NdebCUxYBJ&amp;sig=JLIUKPxFw3KycjSoDwPKLFqRz3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0alTT7m1LcTz0gHhw7y8DQ&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Systemic%20Painting%2C&amp;f=false Lawrence Alloway, ''Systemic Painting'', Google books online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the [[art movement]] called ''minimal art'' emerged.

==History==
[[Jean Metzinger]], following the ''[[Succès de scandale]]'' created from the [[Cubist]] showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], in an interview with Cyril Berger published in ''Paris-Journal'' 29 May 1911, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, "Chez Metzi'', interview by Cyril Berger, published in the ''Paris-Journal'', 29 May 1911, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten: ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, 2008, Document 17, Cyril Berger, ''Chez Metzi'', Paris-Journal, 29 May 1911, pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Kazimir Malevich, 1915, Black Suprematic Square, oil on linen canvas, 79.5 x 79.5 cm, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.jpg|thumb|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1915, oil on canvas, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/378 Malevich, Kazimir Severinovich, ''Black Suprematic Square'', 1915, oil on canvas, 79.5 х 79.5 cm, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140206000538/http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/378 |date=2014-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Metzinger's (then) audacious prediction that artists would take [[abstract art|abstraction]] to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the "primordial white unity", a "completely white canvas" would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto, possibly [[Francis Picabia]], in a publication entitled ''Evolution de l'art: Vers l'amorphisme'', in ''Les Hommes du Jour'' (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt; With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, "''Vers Amorphisme'' may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jj82ZE_ctIoC&amp;pg=PA86 Jeffrey S. Weiss, ''The Popular Culture of Modern Art: Picasso, Duchamp, and Avant-gardism''], Yale University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780300058956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochrome painting was initiated at the first [[Incoherents|Incoherent arts]]' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] entitled "Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel" (''Negroes fight in a tunnel''). In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer [[Alphonse Allais]] proposed seven other monochrome paintings, such as "Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige" (''First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow'', white), or "Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux  apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge" (''Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea'', red).  However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century [[Dada]], or [[Neo-Dada]], and particularly the works of the [[Fluxus]] group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.

In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161-172]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting [[high modernism]], or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of [[aesthetic]] and sociopolitical upheavals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Primary Colors for the Second Time: A Paradigm Repetition of the Neo-Avant-Garde,'' [[Benjamin H.

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 essay  "Last Exit: Painting" [[Artforum]], October: 40-47, minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's &lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this incorrect interpretation of what he said; Greenberg wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.''&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:UntitledGoldBox1964.jpg|thumb|left|[[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], ''Untitled'' (1964), bismuth, chromium, gold, and rhodium on gold-plated brass; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]
In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, Minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], an influential theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1-3", originally published across three issues of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] - "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''[[Artforum]]'', 1969, continuing to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transitions into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.
One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter, [[Frank Stella]], whose early "pinstripe" paintings were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's pinstripe paintings were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used for stretchers, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripe]]s. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, artists including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in ''Arts Yearbook 8'', 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman Brooklynrail.org]&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticised by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In "Art and Objecthood" (published in ''[[Artforum]]'' in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of ''[[Artforum]]''. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing--namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

"The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm interview with Dorothy Strickler] (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words,

"When I brought [[Hans Hofmann|Hofmann]] up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann's reaction was — one of the questions he asked Jackson was, ''do you work from nature?'' There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson's answer was, ''I am nature.'' And Hofmann's reply was, ''Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself.'' To which Jackson did not reply at all." The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;

The '''National Centre for Earth Science Studies'''(NCESS) ([[Malayalam]]: ദേശിയ  ഭൂമി ശാസ്ത്ര പഠന കേന്ദ്രം) is an autonomous research centre to promote scientific and technological research and development studies in the [[earth sciences]]. NCESS pursues problems related to land, sea and atmosphere. It was instituted by the government of Kerala in 1978, at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]]. CESS was the earliest institute in the country to embrace the concept of Earth System Science (ESS). CESS contributions over the years have enhanced knowledge of the geological evolution of south India, the complexity of coastal processes and natural hazards, as well as in proposing mitigatory measures to deal with natural hazards.

CESS carries out studies in [[river]] basin evaluation, [[ground water]] management, coastal [[erosion]], and other special problems. 
CESS does research in [[earth]] system, micro-level watershed planning, [[natural hazards]] management, [[chemical analysis]], CRZ mapping, and studies of air, water, land, [[noise pollution]], etc.

CESS also does [[environmental impact assessment]], coastal and [[estuarine]] management, [[terrain]] analysis, natural resources management, laser applications, river [[sand mining]], and microlevel planning. CESS conducts research courses leading to doctoral degree.

Recognizing the growth potential of CESS, resource constraints of the State Government and the role CESS can play in national development, the government of Kerala proposed the taking over of the institute by the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], Government of India. An expert committee made an assessment of the scientific programs pursued by the institute and deliberated on a long term vision for the institute as a national centre. The committee recommended the taking over of CESS by the MoES and according it the status of an autonomous institute under the [[Ministry_of_Earth_Sciences|Earth System Science Organization]] (ESSO) of MoES. The proposed thrust areas of research will be [[earth's crustal evolution|crustal evolution]] and geodynamics, sedimentology and depositional processes, coastal dynamics and cloud microphysics.

The total estimated budget requirements of CESS will be Rs.128.67 crore for the balance period of the 12th FYP.

== Campus ==
The Centre for Earth Science Studies is housed in a 50,000 sq. ft building constructed in a campus of 19 acres. The development of the CESS campus in 1986 saw the transformation of an abandoned clay mining site to a beautiful green campus within one year. The campus was the vision of the founder Director Prof. C. Karunakaran, realised through the leadership of Dr. H. K. Gupta, the then director and Sri M. Sethumadhavan, the then registrar, and Dr S. Satheeschandran Nair.

The CESS building is constructed on natural gradients, slopes and excavated mining areas in a nature friendly architectural design. Buildings are spread as different blocks. Main building houses Administration, Library, Conference Hall and an auditorium. Four interconnected blocks provide seating spaces for scientists. Laboratory block houses main laboratories of all divisions with a centralised access to scientists of all disciplines. A separate building for canteen and guest house is built away from the main buzz of activity. 

The canteen functions from 9 am to 4:30 pm providing Kerala style breakfast and lunch with snacks and tea and coffee. In 2004 a laboratory block was added over the existing block to house new facilities and provide two smaller meeting and discussion halls.

In [[power engineering]], '''nodal admittance matrix''' (or just '''admittance matrix''') or '''Y Matrix''' or '''Ybus''' is an ''N x N'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] describing a power system with ''N'' [[Bus (power engineering)|buses]].  It represents the nodal [[admittance]] of the buses in a power system.  In realistic systems which contain thousands of buses, the Y matrix is quite sparse. Each bus in a real power system is usually connected to only a few other buses through the [[electric power transmission|transmission line]]s.  The Y Matrix is also one of the data requirements needed to formulate a [[power flow study]].

== Context ==
[[Power engineering|Electric power transmission]] needs optimization in order to determine the necessary real and reactive power flows in a system for a given set of loads, as well as the voltages and currents in the system. Power flow studies are used not only to analyze current power flow situations, but also to plan ahead for anticipated disturbances to the system, such as the loss of a transmission line to maintenance and repairs. The power flow study would determine whether or not the system could continue functioning properly without the transmission line. Only [[computer simulation]] allows the complex handling required in power flow analysis because in most realistic situations the system is very complex and extensive and would be impractical to solve by hand. The Y Matrix is a tool in that domain. It provides a method of systematically reducing a complex system to a matrix than can be solved by a computer program.  The equations used to construct the Y matrix come from the application of Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law to a circuit with steady-state sinusoidal operation. These laws give us that the sum of currents entering a node in the circuit is zero, and the sum of voltages around a closed loop starting and ending at a node is also zero. These principles are applied to all the nodes in a power flow system and thereby determine the elements of the admittance matrix, which represents the admittance relationships between nodes, which then determine the voltages, currents and power flows in the system.


== Construction ==

Starting from the [[One-line diagram|single line diagram]] of a power system, there are three main steps before writing the equations that form the &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; Matrix.  First, the single line diagram is converted to an impedance diagram. Next, all voltage sources are converted to their equivalent current source representations. From here, the impedance diagram is then converted to an admittance diagram. Following these three steps, the admittance matrix can be created in a straightforward manner: For an admittance diagram with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; buses, the admittance between the bus in consideration, ''k'', and another bus, ''i'', connected to ''k'', can be described by &lt;math&gt;y_{ik} = g_{ik} + j b_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;. The term &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; should be introduced here; this term accounts for the admittance of linear loads connected to bus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; as well as the admittance-to-ground at bus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The general mathematical expression follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{ij} = \begin{cases}
  y_{i} + \sum_{k=1, 2, \ldots, N \atop k \neq i} {y_{ik}}, &amp; \mbox{if} \quad i = j \\
  -y_{ij},  &amp; \mbox{if} \quad i \neq j
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that &lt;math&gt;y_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero only where a physical connection exists between two buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCalley|first1=James|title=The Power Flow Equations|url=http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~jdm/ee458_2011/PowerFlowEquations.pdf|website=Iowa State Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration is not seen in the following example because each node is connected to both of the other nodes. Each &lt;math&gt;y_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; defines one element of the &lt;math&gt;N\times{N}&lt;/math&gt; matrix. From the general case where N is greater than 2, it is desirable to solve these equations as a system, namely through matrix algebra. The general matrix appears as follows:
The nodal admittance matrix form:
&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
  Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{1n} \\
  Y_{21} &amp; Y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{2n} \\ 
  \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots \\
  Y_{n1} &amp; Y_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:3 bus network.jpg|400px|thumbnail|The admittance diagram of a three bus network.]]

Once the admittance matrix has been formed, the admittance matrix can be input to solve the matrix form of Ohm's Law--the equation &lt;math&gt;Y*V=I&lt;/math&gt;. In this instance &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;N\times{1}&lt;/math&gt; vector of the voltage at each node and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N\times{1}&lt;/math&gt; vector of corresponding currents. In matrix form, Ohm's Law is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{1N} \\
  Y_{21} &amp; Y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{2N} \\
  \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots \\
  Y_{NN} &amp; Y_{N2} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{NN} \\
\end{pmatrix} *

\begin{pmatrix}
 V_1 \\
 V_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 V_N \\
\end{pmatrix} =

\begin{pmatrix}
 I_1 \\
 I_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 I_N \\
\end{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;
To illustrate this process with the admittance matrix of the three bus network in the figure would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{pmatrix}
  y_{1} + y_{12} + y_{13} &amp; - y_{12} &amp; - y_{13} \\
  -y_{12} &amp; y_{2} + y_{12} + y_{23} &amp; - y_{23} \\
  -y_{13} &amp; - y_{23} &amp; y_{3} + y_{13} + y_{23} \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The Y Matrix diagonal elements &lt;math&gt;Y_{11}, Y_{22}, ..., Y_{nn}&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''self-admittances'' at the nodes, and each equals the sum of all the admittances terminating on the node identified by the repeated subscripts. The other admittances are the ''mutual admittances'' of the nodes, and each equals the negative of the sum of all admittances connected directly between the nodes identified by the double subscripts. The admittance matrix &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is typically a [[symmetric matrix]] as &lt;math&gt;y_{mn} = y_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;.  However, extensions of the line model and models of other components such as transformers may make &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; asymmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Grainger |year=1994 |title=Power System Analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math |isbn=978-0070612938 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-System-Analysis-John-Grainger/dp/0070612935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small transmission systems of about less than 10 nodes or buses, the Y matrix can be calculated manually. But for a realistic system with relatively large number of nodes or buses, say 1000 nodes, a computer program for computing Y is more practical to use.

To help motivate the importance of using a system of equations in matrix form, see the adjacent figure. Not only does it become impractical to calculate the current vector &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; by hand, it becomes necessary to use computational power to form the admittance matrix itself. 


Example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grainger|first1=John|title=Power System Analysis|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math|isbn=978-0070612938|pages=240-241|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two Node Power Flow Diagram.png|thumb|left|Two node power flow diagram courtesy of Grainger and Stevenson]]
To take a look at a generalizable &lt;math&gt;2\times2&lt;/math&gt; matrix, consider the figure of the two-node network. By [[Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_current_law_.28KCL.29|Kirchhoff's Current Law]], it can be shown that :&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} I_m \\ I_n \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} * I_a &lt;/math&gt; since there are no other currents entering or exiting nodes &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage drop across the line can be expressed as :&lt;math&gt; V_a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 * -1 \\ \end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix} V_m \\ V_n \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. Next, use [[Ohm's Law]] with admittance instead of impedance. Using substitution to get :&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} Y_a &amp; -Y_a \\ -Y_a &amp; Y_a \end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix} V_m \\ V_n \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} I_m \\ I_n \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. To reintroduce some generality, &lt;math&gt; Y_{11} = Y_{mm}, Y_{21} = Y_{nm},Y_{12} = Y_{mn},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y_{22} = Y_{nn} &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, this example can be taken as a first step in understanding how to generally construct an &lt;math&gt;NxN&lt;/math&gt; matrix by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6433">'''PCLake''' is a dynamic, [[mathematical model]] used to study [[eutrophication]] effects in shallow [[lake]]s and ponds. PCLake models explicitly the most important [[Biotic component|biotic]] groups and their interrelations, within the general framework of [[nutrient cycle]]s. PCLake is used both by scientist and water managers.

==Background==
Typically, shallow lakes are in one of two contrasting [[alternative stable state]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M, 1993. Alternative equilibria in shallow lakes. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 8: 275–-279&lt;/ref&gt;  a clear state with submerged macrophytes and piscivorous fish, or a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton and benthivorous fish. A switch from one state to the other is largely driven by the input of nutrients ([[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]]) to the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 1997. A model of nutrient dynamics in shallow lakes in relation to multiple stable states. Hydrobiologia 342/343: 1–8&lt;/ref&gt; If the nutrient loading exceeds a critical value, eutrophication causes a switch from the clear to the turbid state. As a result of urban water pollution and/or [[intensive agriculture]] in [[drainage basin|catchment areas]], many of the world’s shallow lakes and ponds are in a eutrophic state with turbid waters and poor ecological quality. In this turbid state, the lake also becomes subject to algal blooms of toxic [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae). Recovery of the clear state however is difficult as the critical nutrient loading for the switch back is often found to be lower than the critical loading towards the turbid state. Lowering the nutrient input thus does not automatically lead to a switch back to the clear water phase. Hence, the system shows [[hysteresis]].

==Application==
PCLake is designed to study the effects of eutrophication on shallow lakes and ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 2005. Model studies on the eutrophication of shallow lakes and ditches. PhD thesis. Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the model is used by scientists to study the general behavior of these ecosystems. For example, PCLake is used to understand the phenomena of alternative stable states and hysteresis, and in that light, the relative importance of lake features such as water depth or [[fetch (geography)|fetch length]].&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH and others, 2008. Critical phosphorus loading of different types of shallow lakes and the consequences for management estimated with the ecosystem model PCLake. Limnologica 38: 2003–2019&lt;/ref&gt; Also the potential effects of climate warming for shallow lakes have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Mooij WM and others, 2007. Predicting the effect of climate change on temperate shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake. Hydrobiologia 584: 443–454&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, PCLake is applied by lake water resource managers that consider the turbid state as undesirable. They can use the model to define the critical loadings for their specific lakes and evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures. For this purpose also a meta-model has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://themasites.pbl.nl/modellen/pclake/&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-model can be used by water managers to derive an estimate of the critical loading values for a certain lake based on only a few important parameters, without the need of running the full dynamical model.&lt;ref&gt;Schep, S. (in Dutch) 2010. Neuraal netwerk PCLake ten behoeve van KRW-verkenner. Witteveen+Bos; rapportnr. UT565-2-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model content==
Mathematically, PCLake is composed of a set of coupled [[differential equation]]s. With a large number of [[state variables]] (&gt;100) and [[parameters]] (&gt;300), the model may be characterized as relatively complex. The main biotic variables are [[phytoplankton]] and [[submerged aquatic vegetation]], describing [[primary production]]. A simplified [[food web]] is made up of [[zooplankton]], zoo[[benthos]], young and adult whitefish and piscivorous fish. The main abiotic factors are transparency and the nutrients phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and silica (Si). At the base of the model are the water and nutrient budgets (in- and outflow). The model describes a completely mixed water body and comprises both the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall nutrient cycles for N, P and Si are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow and [[denitrification]]). Inputs to the model are: lake hydrology, nutrient loading, dimensions and sediment characteristics. The model calculates [[chlorophyll]]-a, transparency, cyanobacteria, vegetation cover and fish biomass, as well as the concentrations and fluxes of nutrients N, P and Si, and oxygen. Optionally, a wetland zone with marsh vegetation and water exchange with the lake can be included.

PCLake is calibrated against nutrient, transparency, chlorophyll and vegetation data on more than 40 European (but mainly Dutch) lakes, and systematic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis have been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH and others, 2010. Estimating the critical phosphorus loading of shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake: sensitivity, calibration and uncertainty. Ecological Modelling 221: 654–665&lt;/ref&gt;
Although PCLake is primarily used for Dutch lakes, it is likely that the model is also applicable to comparable non-[[stratification (water)|stratifying]] lakes in other regions, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made.

==Model development==
The first version of PCLake (by then called PCLoos) was built in the early 1990s at the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM), within the framework of a research and restoration project on Lake Loosdrecht. It has been extended and improved since then. Parallel to PCLake, [[PCDitch]] was created, which is an ecosystem model for ditches and other linear water bodies. The models were further developed by dr. Jan H. Janse and colleagues at the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL), formerly part of the RIVM. Since 2009, the model is jointly owned by PBL and the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, where further development and application of PCLake is taking place, related to aquatic-ecological research.

[[Image:Polar Bear 2004-11-15.jpg|right|180px|thumb|'''[[Polar bear]]''' in [[Manitoba]],  [[Canada]]. November 2004.]]
'''Polar seas''' is a collective term for the [[Arctic Ocean]] (about 4-5 percent of [[Earth|Earth's]] [[ocean]]s) and the southern part of the [[Southern Ocean]] (south of [[Antarctic Convergence]], about 10 percent of Earth's oceans). In the coldest years, sea ice can cover around 13 percent of the Earth's total surface at its maximum, but out of phase in the two hemispheres. The polar seas contain a huge [[biome]] with many [[organism]]s.

Among the species that inhabit various polar seas and surrounding land areas are [[polar bear]], [[reindeer]] (caribou), [[muskox]], [[wolverine]], [[ermine]], [[lemming]], [[Arctic hare]], [[Arctic ground squirrel]], [[whale]], [[harp seal]], and [[walrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ARCTIC WILDLIFE|url = http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Awildlife.html|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064515/http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Awildlife.html|archivedate = 2009-01-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These species have unique adaptations to the extreme conditions. Many might be endangered if they cannot adapt to changing conditions. Contrary to popular opinion, the World Wildlife Fund studies for polar bears show that this species has prospered since 1950, attaining five times the numbers found in 1950. In general, Arctic ecosystems are relatively fragile and slow to recover from serious damage.

==Arctic==
{{see also|Arctic}}
A large amount of the land in the north polar region is part of Earth's [[tundra]] [[biome]]. South of the Arctic tundra, where temperatures are a little less cold, are the vast forests of conifer trees of the [[taiga|taiga biome]]. North of the Arctic tundra are polar bears and the unique marine life of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name=polar-life&gt;{{cite web|title = Life in the Polar Regions: Animals, Plants, and Others in Extreme Environments|url = http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/polar/polar_life_intro.html&amp;edu=elem|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208154932/http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link%3D/earth/polar/polar_life_intro.html%26edu%3Delem|archivedate = 2008-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arctic ocean]] has relatively abundant plant life. Nutrients from rivers along with mixing and upwelling from storms contribute mixed layer nutrients which are essential for Arctic [[phytoplankton]] development. During summer, nearly continuous solar [[insolation]] encourages [[phytoplankton bloom|phytoplankta blooms]].
The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by [[continent]]s and has a few narrow, relatively shallow connections to the large ocean basins to the south. Large amounts of [[river]]ine [[fresh water]] as well as abundant nutrients (gelbstoff) flow into the Arctic basin from Siberian rivers. The widest continental shelf on the planet is found in the Arctic Ocean, extending more than 1000 kilometers outward from Siberia and Alaska. Consequently, much of the basin is very shallow. On the other hand, the Arctic Ocean contains the deepest, slowest spreading [[mid-ocean ridge]] on the planet which, until 2003, was thought to be inactive volcanically. Since then, however, a dozen active volcanoes have been discovered, illustrating the limited information available for the difficult-to-study Arctic Ocean. The numerous Siberian rivers flowing onto the shallow continental shelf freshen the seawater. These rivers have shown increased flow recently, possibly due to increased global rainfall as a result of climate change. A flow increase may raise the level of riverine nutrients. Severe Siberian drought, as experienced in 2010, could, however, decrease flows.
There is an interest in a potential release of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas, from methane clathrates present in the Arctic continental shelf sediments, if sufficient ocean warming were to occur.
As much as 80% of the ocean surface is covered by ice in winter, declining to about 60% in summer; ice cover has been declining at a steady and rapid pace.
A large fraction of the ice is multi-year ice, and in the far North the thickness can be more than 2m. In summer, ice tends to melt at the air-sea interface. Surface melt ponds are formed, increasing the [[albedo]].

==Antarctic==
{{see also|Antarctic}}
Most of [[Antarctica]] is covered with a thick layer of [[ice]], with few species permanently living in the ice-covered areas. There are many species of [[penguin]]s in the south polar region. Almost all animals in Antarctica find their food in the Southern Ocean surrounding the continent, and there is abundant marine life in the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=polar-life/&gt;

Because of the extreme but constant habitats, small disruption or damage could alter the polar systems. Although they are remote from human world, polar seas are not 'pristine' environments. Compared with the Antarctic region, the Arctic has long history of interaction with man. The polar food web structure can be sensitive to man's 'top-down' control especially with the development and growth of industrial fishing.
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that influences life in polar areas. There is observational evidence that the Antarctica climate is a bellwether for climate change in the northern hemisphere, leading by about 1000 years. The study of Antarctic ice, its distribution, changes in ice volume, and other indicators of the continental climate in Antarctica are at an early stage of development and even earlier stage of understanding. Techniques for studying the terrain beneath the ice are just being explored. Lake Vostok, buried under miles of ice, has not been penetrated to date. There is evidence that it has been out of contact with the atmosphere for millions of years, making it a possible treasure trove of information.

Relatively, the Antarctic seas and [[Southern ocean]] surround the highest, driest, coldest and windiest continent on the earth - [[Antarctica]]. Due to the low mean temperature, there is no riverine input into the Antarctic seas. And little input DOM, POC from land. In addition to relatively thin sea ice, thick and extensive ice shelves (floating glaciers) are present in the Antarctic region. More than 90% of the sea ice is first year (annual) ice and less than 2m thick. The first confirmed sighting of [[Antarctica]] can date back to the 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 10 years of Antarctic protection!|url = http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/10_years_of_antarctic_protecti.html|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081222121544/http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/10_years_of_antarctic_protecti.html|archivedate = 2008-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in global climate ==
{{See also|Climate of the Arctic|Global warming in the Arctic}}

The polar seas play an important role in the [[global climate]]:
* Carbon export/[[carbon sequestration]]: Effects concentration of [[carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere]].
* [[Dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP/DMS) production: DMSP/DMS serves as the nucleus in [[cloud formation]] and changes the regional [[albedo]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].
* [[Earth's energy budget]]: clouds increase albedo, sea-ice increases albedo, ice shelves increase albedo etc.
* Formation of deep and bottom waters: the polar areas are the source of ocean deep and bottom cold waters. Due to the sinking of cold and dense saline waters near Greenland, and at the Antarctic Convergence, among other sites, the global ocean circulation is maintained.

Models predict a latitudinal effect in response to climate change. These would be expected to be first obvious in polar and subpolar regions. The decline of arctic ocean summer ice coverage was assumed to be one such sign, however, the reversal of that trend leaves the question open as the origins of the now reversed 30 year trend. In 1979, the cover of Time magazine was illustrated with an image of arctic ice covering and expanding BEYOND the arctic basin, opinion seems to have little value. Real data reveal the trend of ice coverage to be on the increase. If this increase will continue, only time will tell.  Developed nations ceased the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and the atmospheric abundance and consequent ozone depletion are generally on the decrease. [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] Breaking-off of polar ice shelves is a continuing process with increases in Western Antarctica balanced by decreases in Eastern Antarctica. Careful study has revealed that the volume of ice in Western Antarctica was incorrectly estimated and shows no significant change attributable to climate change over the observation period.

== Characteristics ==
Extreme oscillations in irradiance occur in these regions, for months it may be totally dark (in winter) or light (in summer). Because of the existence of polar ice, surface reflectance of sunlight is very high. In addition the solar angle are relatively quite low. So less light can penetrate into water and becomes bio available to the plants in polar water under the ice cover. Water temperatures are low, but do not change much seasonally. The low temperature and low available high irradiance together limit [[primary production]]. Major nutrients (N, P, Si) are often not limiting [[primary production]]. Blooming of [[Phytoplankton]] happens in summer, because of the decreased salinity (sea ice melt-water), lower mixing, higher stratification, higher temperature and more bio available light.

Ice is very important in structuring environment. It regulates the physics, chemistry and biology of the water column, air-sea exchange, and is also an important habitat.

== Development ==
There is an expected rise in the exploration and development of the Polar Seas due to an increasing demand for fuel and commodities. The emergence of China and India's economy is considered one of the main drivers of this phenomenon due to an unprecedented appetite for raw materials and fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arctic Doom, Arctic Boom: The Geopolitics of Climate Change in the Arctic|last=Zellen|first=Barry|publisher=ABC CLIO|year=2009|isbn=9780313380129|location=Santa Barbara|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Presently, there are still no exact figures that define the oil and gas reserves in the Polar Seas. Initial explorations, however, have resulted in the identification of its potential. For example, Canada's explorations discovered gas and oil in several Arctic locations such as Beaufort, High Arctic (Arctic Islands), Labrador, and Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antarctic Treaty System: An Assessment : Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Beardmore South Field Camp, Antarctica, January 7-13, 1985|last=Polar Research Board|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1986|isbn=0309036402|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arctic Islands alone has an estimated 4.3 billion barrels of oil reserve while those locations that fall within the Alaskan continental shelf have potential recoverable reserves worth $18 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Polar Research Board, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are now 46 nations that are parties to cooperation and treaties covering the polar regions. Several of these, either individually or with partners, conduct research and explorations in the Arctic and Antarctic seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Environment Outlook: Environment for Development, GEO 4|last=United Nations Environmental Programme|first=|publisher=UNEP/Progress Press|year=2007|isbn=9789280728729|location=Valetta|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are governed by international environmental protocols. However, countries like China, which faces a future oil shortage, are aggressively exploring the region for the purpose of oil extraction despite an international ban on such activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emerging Politics of Antarctica|last=Brady|first=Anne-Marie|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415531399|location=London|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">'''Postnormal times''' ('''PNT''') is a concept developed by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as a development of [[Post-normal Science]]. Sardar describes the present as "postnormal times", "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|title=Welcome to postnormal times|journal=Futures|date=June 2010|volume=42|issue=5|pages=435–444|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In support of engaging communities of various scope and scale on how to best navigate PNT and imagine preferred pathways toward the future(s), Sardar and Sweeney published an article in the journal ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' outlining The Three Tomorrows method, which fills a gap in the field as "many methods of futures and foresight seldom incorporate pluralism and diversity intrinsically in their frameworks, and few, if any, emphasize the dynamic and merging nature of futures possibilities, or highlight the ignorance and uncertainties we constantly confront."&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar &amp; John A. Sweeney, "The Three Tomorrows of Postnormal Times," Futures 75(2016) 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Sweeney, "Signs of postnormal times," East-West Affairs 1, no. 3/4(2013).''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==
Rakesh Kapoor criticized PNT in 2011 as a Western concept, that does not apply to India and other [[emerging market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh Kapoor, "Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality," Futures 43(2011) 216-220. &lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cole criticised the three C’s of PNT (chaos, complexity and contradictions) as "Alliterative Logic, theorizing through alliterative word-triads that is not based on empirical evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cole, "Alliterative logic: A theory of postnormal times," Futures 43(2011) 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Gray has suggested that PNT is embryonic, needs a more robust framework, and should be extended to include [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling's]] adaptive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Jay E. Gary, "Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to Sardar’s ‘postnormal times,’" Futures 43(2011) 48-51. &lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on complex evolving systems have pointed out that PNT recalls the ‘Long Waves’ of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]’s view of waves of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen and Liz Varga, "Modelling sustainable energy futures for the UK," Futures 57(2014) 28-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

PNT is one of the core areas of research for the Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies at [[East-West University]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, US. A number of articles and editorials on PNT have been published in the journal ''East-West Affairs''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2034">'''Prolation''' is a term used in the theory of the [[mensural notation]] of [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]] to describe its rhythmic structure on a small scale, as opposed to ''tempus'', which described a larger scale. The term "prolation" is derived from the Latin ''prolatio'', first used by [[Philippe de Vitry]] in describing [[Ars Nova]], a musical style that came about in 14th-century France.

Prolation, together with tempus, corresponds roughly to the concept of [[time signature]] in modern music. Prolation describes whether a [[semibreve]] (whole note) is equal in length to two [[minim_(music)|minim]]s (half notes) (''minor prolation'' or ''imperfect prolation''; in Latin ''"prolatio minor"'') or three minims (''major prolation'' or ''perfect prolation''; in Latin ''"prolatio maior"''). Tempus similarly describes the relationship between the [[breve]] and [[semibreve]].

Early medieval music was often structured in subdivisions of three, while the [[note value]]s in modern music are unambiguously subdivided into two parts, meaning that only minor prolation has survived in our time signature system. We now indicate subdivisions of three by modifying note values with dots or triplets. The history of written medieval music shows a gradual shift from major to minor prolation being common.

The equivalent term in the [[Music of the Trecento|Italian notation]] of the fourteenth century is ''"divisio"'', which covers both tempus and prolation.  Italian ''divisiones'', first described by [[Marchetto da Padova]], can also allow four minims within a semibreve.  For instance ''octonaria'' and ''duodenaria'' place eight and twelve minims in a breve respectively divided into two or three "major" semibreves.

'''RAMP Simulation Software for Modelling Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM)''' is a computer software application developed by [[WS Atkins]] specifically for the assessment of the [[Reliability engineering#Reliability modelling|reliability]], [[availability]], [[maintainability]] and [[productivity]] characteristics of complex systems that would otherwise prove too difficult, cost too much or take too long to study analytically.  The name '''RAMP''' is an acronym standing for '''R'''eliability, '''A'''vailability and '''M'''aintainability of '''P'''rocess systems.

RAMP models reliability using failure [[probability distributions]] for system elements, as well as accounting for [[Common-cause and special-cause#In engineering|common mode failures]].  RAMP models availability using logistic repair delays caused by shortages of [[spare part]]s or [[manpower]], and their associated resource conditions defined for system elements.  RAMP models maintainability using repair probability distributions for system elements, as well as [[preventive maintenance]] data and fixed logistic delays between failure detection and repair commencement.

RAMP consists of two parts:

# RAMP Model Builder.  A front-end interactive [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).
# RAMP Model Processor.  A back-end [[discrete-event simulation]] that employs the [[Monte Carlo method]].

== RAMP Model Builder ==
The RAMP Model Builder enables the user to create a [[block diagram]] describing the dependency of the process being modelled on the state of individual elements in the system.

=== Elements ===
Elements are the basic building blocks of a system modelled in RAMP and can have user-specified failure and repair characteristics in the form probability distributions, typically of [[Mean Time Between Failure]] (MTBF) and [[Mean Time To Repair]] (MTTR) values respectively, chosen from the following:

# [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]]: Defined by scale and shape parameters (or optionally 50th and 95th [[percentiles]] for repairs).
# [[Negative exponential distribution|Negative exponential]]: Defined by [[mean average]].
# [[Lognormal]]: Defined by [[median average]] and dispersion (or optionally 50th and 95th percentiles for repairs).
# Fixed ([[Uniform distribution (continuous)|Uniform]]): Defined by a maximum time to failure or repair.
# Empirical (user-defined): Defined by a multiplier.

Elements can represent any part of a system from a specific [[failure mode]] of a minor component (e.g. isolation valve fails open) to major subsystems (e.g. compressor or power turbine failure) depending on the level and detail of the analysis required.

=== Deterministic elements ===
RAMP allows the user to define [[deterministic]] elements which are failure free and/or are unrepairable.  These elements may be used to represent parameters of the process (e.g. purity of feedstock or production demand at a particular time) or where necessary in the modelling logic (e.g. to provide conversion factors).

=== Q values ===
Each element of the model has a user-defined process 'q value' representing a parameter of interest (e.g. mass flow, generation capacity etc.).  Each element is considered to be either operating or not operating and has associated performance values q = Q or q = 0 respectively.  The interpretation of each 'q value' in the model depends on the parameter of interest being modelled, which is typically chosen during the system analysis stage of model design.

=== Groups ===
Elements with interacting functionality can be organised into groups.  Groups can be further combined (to any depth) to produce a Process Dependency Diagram (PDD) of the system, which is similar to a normal [[reliability block diagram]] (RBD) commonly used in [[reliability engineering]], but also allows complex logical relationships between groups and elements to permit a more accurate representation of the process being modelled.  The PDD should not be confused with a [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]] since it describes dependency, not flow.  For example, an element may appear in more than one position in the PDD if this is required to represent the true dependency of the process on that element.  Groups may also be shown in full or may be compressed to allow the screen to show other areas to greater resolution.

=== Group types ===
Each group can be one of eleven group types, each with its own rule for combining 'q values' of elements and/or other groups within it to produce a 'q value' output.  Groups thus define how the behaviour of each element affects the reliability, availability, maintainability and productivity of the system.  The eleven group types are divided into two classes:

Five 'Flow' group types:

# Minimum (M): qM = min[q1, q2,...qn]
# Active Redundant (A): qA = min[Rating, (q1 + q2 + ... + qn)] unless qA &lt; Cut-off, then qA = 0
# Standby Redundant (S): qS = as for Active Redundant, but where the first component is always assumed to be duty equipment.
# Time (T): qT = 0 if component with 'q value' q1 is in a "down" state when time through mission t &lt; t0, otherwise qT = q1 + ... + qm if component with 'q value' q1 is in an "up" state when time t ≥ t0 + (m-1) x Time Delay, where m = 1 to n.
# Buffer (B): if the buffer is not empty qB = q2 else qB = min[q1,q2], where the buffer empties as output if component with 'q value' q2 is in an "up" state with level at time 0 = Initial Level, otherwise level at time t = level at time (t-1) - (q2 - q1), and the buffer fills as input if component with 'q value' q2 is in a "down" state with level at time 0 = Initial Level, otherwise level at time t = Capacity if level at time (t-1) + q1 &gt; C, otherwise level at time t = level at time (t-1) + (q2 - q1). Buffer input and output may also be limited by buffer constraints.

Six 'Logic' group types:

# Product (P): qP = q1 x q2 x ... x qn
# Quotient (Q): pQ = q1 / q2
# Conditionally Greater Than (G): if q1 &gt; q2 then qG = q1 else qG = 0
# Conditionally Less Than (L): if q1 &lt; q2 then qG = q1 else qG = 0
# Difference (D): max[q1 - q2, 0]
# Equality (E): q1 if q1 lies outside the range PA to PB, q2 if q1 lies inside the range PA to PB

Three group types (Active Redundant, Standby Redundant and Time) are displayed in parallel configurations (vertically down the screen).  All others are displayed in series configurations (horizontally across the screen).

Six group types (Buffer, Quotient, Conditionally Greater Than, Conditionally Less Than, Difference and Equality) contain exactly two components with 'q values' q1 and q2. All others contain two or more components with 'q values' q1, q2 to qn.

=== Element states ===
An element may be in one of five possible states and its 'q value' is determined by its state:

# Undergoing [[preventive maintenance]] (''q'' = 0).
# Being repaired following failure, including queueing for repair (''q'' = 0).
# Failed but undetected, dormant failure (''q'' = 0). (e.g. standby equipment unavailable in the event of failure of duty equipment.  Thus a problem may not be apparent until a failure of the duty equipment occurs.)
# Up but passive, available but not being used (''q'' = 0). (e.g. standby equipment available in the event of failure of duty equipment.)
# Up and active, being used (''q'' = ''Q'' &gt; 0). (i.e. operating as intended.)

Occurrence of a state transition for an element is determined largely by the user-defined parameters for that element (i.e. its failure and repair distributions and any preventive maintenance cycles).

=== Element resource and repair conditions ===
There is often a time delay between an element failing and the commencement of repair of the element. This may be caused by a lack of spare parts, the unavailability of manpower or the element cannot be repaired due to dependencies on other elements (e.g. a pump cannot be repaired because the isolating valve is defective and cannot be closed). In all of these cases, the element must be queued for repair.  RAMP allows the user to define multiple resource conditions per element, all of which must be satisfied to allow a repair to be commenced.  Each resource condition is one of five types:

# Repair Trade: a specified number of a repair trade must be available.
# Spare: a specified number of a spare part must be available.
# Group Q Value: a specified group must satisfy a condition regarding its 'q value'.
# Buffer Level: a specified buffer must satisfy a condition regarding its level.
# Element State: a specified element must satisfy a condition regarding its state.

==== Repair trades repair condition ====
Repair trades can be specified for the repair of any element, and they represent manpower in the form of a set of skilled maintenance workers with a particular trade.  A repair trade can be used for the duration of an element repair (i.e. logistic delay plus a time value drawn from the element repair distribution).  On completion of the repair, the Repair Trade becomes available to repair another element.  the number of repairs which can be performed simultaneously for elements requiring a particular repair trade depends on the number of repair trade resources allocated and the number of that repair trade specified as a requirement for the repair.

==== Spares repair condition ====
If a spare part is required for an element repair, then the spare part is withdrawn from stock at the instant the repair commences (i.e. as soon as the element leaves the repair queue).  The maximum number of spare parts of each type that may be held in stock is user-defined.  The stock may either be replenished periodically at a user-defined time interval, or when the stock falls below a user-defined level, in which case RAMP allows a user-defined a time delay that must occur between reordering and the actual replenishment of the stock.

==== Group Q value repair condition ====
RAMP allows the user to specify that an element cannot be repaired until the 'q value' of a nominated group satisfies one of six conditions (&gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.  These conditions may be used to model certain rules in a system (e.g. a pump cannot be repaired until a tank is empty).

==== Buffer level repair condition ====
Specifying a buffer level constraint means that preventive maintenance of an element can be restricted until the buffer level of a nominated buffer group satisfies one of six conditions (&gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.  These conditions may be used to model certain rules in a system (e.g. it may be a requirement for maintenance of a submersible pump that the tank it is in should be empty before repair work commences).

==== Element state repair condition ====
RAMP allows the user to specify that an element cannot be repaired until the state of another nominated element satisfies one of six conditions (&gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.

=== Repair policy ===
Each element has user-defined parameters that can affect how it is repaired:

# Logistic repair delay: A time period that must elapse before a repair can start on an element.  It is a fixed time that is added to the repair time sampled from the user-defined repair probability distribution for the element.  Typically, it represents a combination of the time taken for the repair team to reach the site of failure, time to isolate the failed item, and time taken to obtain the required spare part from store.
# Repair 'good-as-new' or 'bad-as-old': Refers to the failure rate of an element rather than its 'q-value'.  By default an element is restored to 'good-as-new' following repair, but there is an option to toggle a 'bad-as-old' state that simulates a quick-fix equivalent to restoring the element to the beginning of the wear-out phase of a Weibull bathtub curve, should a Weibull probability distribution with shape greater than one be used for repairs.
# Repair priority: Used only if element resource and repair conditions are specified (i.e. it is only used if an element has to queue for repair rather than going directly for repair).  The purpose of this field is to help determine the sequence in which elements are drawn from the repair queue as resources become available for element repair.  Elements are repaired according to their repair priority, where 1 is highest priority, 2 is next highest, and so on.  Elements with the same priority are repaired on a 'first come first served' basis.

In addition, each element in a Standby Redundant group has more parameters that can affect how it is repaired:

# Passive failure rate factor: Factor by which the element failure rate is multiplied when operating in the passive state as opposed to the active state.  By default this factor will be one and typically between zero and one, indicating a lower passive failure rate than active failure rate.
# Probability of switching failure: Percentage probability that the element will fail when switched from the passive state into the active state.  If such a switching failure occurs, the element must be repaired in the normal way before it can be used again.
# Startup delay: Startup of the element going from a passive state to an active state is delayed by a specified time.

==== Preventive maintenance ====
RAMP allows the user to model preventive maintenance for each system element by cycles expressed using the three parameters 'up-time'. 'down-time' and 'down-time' start time.  RAMP also has an option to toggle 'intelligent preventive maintenance' on each system element, which attempts to improve system performance by doing preventive maintenance when the element is already in 'down-time' for other reasons.

=== Common mode failures ===
Common mode failures (CMFs) that cause a number of elements to fail at the same time (e.g. due to the occurrence of a fire or some other catastrophic event, or the failure of a power supply that provides power to several separately defined elements).  RAMP allows the user to define CMFs by stating the set of affected elements and the frequency distribution for occurrences of the CMF.  When a CMF occurs, any elements which are affected by that particular CMF are placed in the failed state and must be repaired, being queued for repair if necessary. Any elements failed by a CMF will be repaired according to the repair distribution defined for that element.  Elements which are already being repaired, are in the repair queue, or are undergoing preventive maintenance remain unaffected by the occurrence of an associated CMF.

=== Criticalities ===
The criticality of an element is a measure of how much the element has affected the 'q value' (i.e. performance) of the group to which it belongs.  Elements with a high criticality cause more 'down-time' or unavailability on average and are thus critical to the performance of the group.  The criticality of an element may vary according to the level of the group (e.g. a motor failure may have a very high criticality for a group that contains failure modes for one pump, but a very low criticality for a group that contains several redundant pumps).

=== Time units ===
RAMP allows the user to set the time unit of interest, according to scale and fidelity considerations.  The only requirement is that time units should be used consistently across a model to avoid misleading results.  Time units are expressed in the following input data:

# Element failure probability distributions.
# Element repair probability distributions.
# Element logistic delay times (before repair).
# Element preventive maintenance 'up-times', 'down-times' and start points.
# Common mode failure probability distributions.
# Percentile times in empirical probability distributions (for failure or repair).
# Delay times in Time groups.
# Spare part replenishment intervals or re-order delay times.
# Rolling average span and increment.
# Histogram 'down-times'.
# Simulated time period of interest.

=== Element types ===
Elements that are assumed to have the same failure and repair characteristics and share a common pool of spare parts can be assigned the same user-defined element type (i.e. pump, motor, tank etc.).  This allows for faster construction of complex systems containing many elements that are similar in function since the entry of element data does not need to be repeated for such elements.

=== Import functionality ===
Previously built systems can be imported as subsystems of the system currently displayed.  This allows for faster construction of complex systems containing many subsystems since they can be constructed in parallel by multiple users before being imported into a common system.

== RAMP Model Processor ==
The RAMP Model Processor mimics the system operating over the time period of interest - known in RAMP as a mission - by sampling failure and repair times from probability distributions (with probabilities drawn from a [[pseudo-random number generator]]) and combining with other data defined in the RAMP Model Builder to determine state transition events for each element in the model.  The simulation uses discrete events that are queued in chronological order with each event being processed in turn to determine the states and thus the 'q values' of every element in the model at that discrete point in time.  Group combination rules are used to determine the 'q values' at successively higher levels of groups, culminating in 'q values' of the outermost groups that when averaged over the events of the simulation typically provide performance measures of the system, which are output in model results in terms of the chosen parameters of interest.

By running enough missions over the same time period of interest (different possible histories from the same starting point), RAMP can be used to generate [[statistically significant]] results that establish the likely distribution of the user-defined parameters of interest and thus objectively assess the system, with the confidence bands on the results dependent on the number of missions simulated.  On the other hand, by running a mission length that is long in comparison with the failure frequencies and repair times, and simulating only one mission, RAMP can be used to establish the [[steady-state]] performance of the system.

== History of RAMP ==
RAMP was originally developed by Rex Thompson &amp; Partners Ltd. in the mid-1980s as an availability simulation program, primarily used for plant and process modelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://rams.chez.com/TOOL_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The ownership of RAMP was transferred to T.A. Group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epsilon-research.com/valuation-multiples/it-services/ws-atkins/advantage-business-group-former-ta-group?dealId=18344&lt;/ref&gt; upon its founding in January 1990,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enre.umd.edu/tools/rmp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and then to [[Fluor Corporation]] when it acquired T.A. Group in April 1996,&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.fluor.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=124955&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=14654&amp;highlight=&lt;/ref&gt; before passing to the Advantage Technical Consulting business of parent company Advantage Business Group Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22400278&lt;/ref&gt; formed in February 2001 by a management buy-out of the consulting and information technology businesses of Fluor Corporation, operating in the transport, defence, energy and manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Railways/Fluor-Global-Services-Consulting-United-Kingdom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  RAMP is currently owned by [[WS Atkins|Atkins]] following its acquisition of Advantage Business Group Ltd. in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epsilon-research.com/valuation-multiples/it-services/ws-atkins/advantage-business-group-former-ta-group?dealId=18344&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive redevelopment by Atkins of the original RAMP application for [[DOS]] has produced a series of RAMP applications for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform, with the RAMP Model Builder written in [[Visual Basic]] and the RAMP Model Processor written in [[FORTRAN]].

== Uses of RAMP ==
Due to its inherent flexibility, RAMP is now used to optimise system design and support critical decision making in many sectors&lt;ref&gt;Reliability, Maintainability and Risk: 7th Edition. Elsevier. David J. Smith BSc PhD CEng FIEE FIQA HonFSaRS MIGasE.&lt;/ref&gt;  RAMP provides the capability to model many factors that may affect a system such as changes in specification or procurement contracts, 'what if' studies, [[sensitivity analysis]], [[Redundancy (engineering)|equipment redundancy]], [[Criticality matrix|equipment criticality]], delayed failures, as well as allowing the generation of results that can be exported for failure mode, effects and criticality analysis ([[FMECA]]) and [[cost-benefit analysis]].

Similarly, a '''relictual taxon''' is a taxon (e.g. species or other lineage) that is the sole surviving representative of a formerly diverse group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habel|first1=Jan C.|last2=Assmann|first2=Thorsten|last3=Schmitt|first3=Thomas|last4=Avise|first4=John C.|editor1-last=Habel|editor1-first=Jan Christian|editor2-last=Assmann|editor2-first=Thorsten|title=Relict species: Phylogeography and Conservation Biology|date=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540921608|pages=1–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vMTCbd_7qWUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Relict Species: From Past to Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A relict (or relic) plant or animal is a [[taxon]] that persists as a remnant of what was once a diverse and widespread population. Relictualism occurs when a widespread habitat or range changes and a small area becomes cut off from the whole. A subset of the population is then confined to the available hospitable area, and survives there while the broader population either shrinks or [[Divergent evolution|evolves divergently]]. This phenomenon differs from [[endemism]] in that the range of the population was not always restricted to the local region. In other words, the species or group did not necessarily arise in that small area, but rather was stranded, or insularized, by changes over time. The agent of change could be anything from [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from other organisms, [[continental drift]], or [[climate change]] such as an [[ice age]].

==Examples==
A notable example is the [[thylacine]] of Tasmania, a relict [[marsupial]] carnivore that survived into modern times on an island whereas the rest of its species on mainland Australia had long ago gone extinct.&lt;ref name = "Quammen"&gt;{{Cite book

However, a relict need not be currently living. An evolutionary relict is any organism that was characteristic of the flora or fauna of one age and that persisted into a later age, with the later age being characterized by newly evolved flora or fauna significantly different from those that came before.

An example from the fossil record would be a specimen of [[Nimravidae]], an extinct branch of [[Carnivora|carnivore]]s in the mammalian evolutionary tree, if said specimen came from Europe in the [[Miocene]] epoch. If that was the case, the specimen would represent, not the main population, but a last surviving remnant of the nimravid lineage. These carnivores were common and widespread in the previous epoch, the [[Oligocene]], and disappeared when the climate changed and woodlands were replaced by savanna. They persisted in Europe in the last remaining forests as a relict of the Oligocene: a relict species in a relict habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An example of divergent evolution creating relicts is found in the shrews of the islands off the coast of Alaska, namely the [[Pribilof Island shrew]] and the [[St. Lawrence Island shrew]].  These species are apparently relicts of a time when the islands were connected to the mainland, and these species were once conspecific with a more widespread species, now the [[cinereus shrew]], the three populations having diverged through [[speciation]].&lt;ref name = "Smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite book

In [[botany]], an example of an ice age relict plant population is the [[Snowdon lily]], notable as being precariously rare in Wales. The Welsh population is confined to the north-facing slopes of [[Snowdonia]], where climatic conditions are apparently similar to ice age Europe.

Another example is the [[Relict leopard frog]] once found throughout [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]] but now only found at [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area]] in Nevada and Arizona

==Relevance==
The concept of relictualism is useful in understanding the ecology and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status of populations that have become insularized, meaning confined to one small area or multiple small areas with no chance of movement between populations. Insularization makes a population vulnerable to forces that can lead to [[extinction]], such as disease, [[inbreeding]], [[habitat destruction]], competition from [[introduced species]], and [[global warming]]. Consider the case of the [[white-eyed river martin]], a very localized species of bird found only in Southeast Asia, and extremely rare, if not already extinct. Its closest and only surviving living relative is the [[African river martin]], also very localized in central Africa. These two species are the only known members of the subfamily Pseudochelidoninae, and their widely disjunct populations suggest they are relict populations of a more common and widespread ancestor. Known to science only since 1968, it seems to have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Studies have been done on relict populations in isolated mountain and valley habitats in western North America, where the [[basin and range]] topography creates areas that are insular in nature, such as forested mountains surrounded by inhospitable desert, called [[sky island]]s. Such situations can serve as [[Refugium (population biology)|refuges]] for certain [[Pleistocene]] relicts, such as [[Townsend's pocket gopher]],&lt;ref name = "Smithsonian"/&gt; while at the same time creating barriers for [[biological dispersal]]. Studies have shown that such insular habitats have a tendency toward decreasing [[species richness]]. This observation has significant implications for conservation biology, because [[habitat fragmentation]] can also lead to the insularization of stranded populations.&lt;ref name = "Quammen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4499">'''Resource justice''' (also referred to as "'''resource equity'''" or "'''resource governance'''") is a term in [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental ethics]]. It combines elements of [[distributive justice]] and [[climate justice]] and is based on the observation that many countries rich in [[natural resource]]s such as [[mineral]]s and other [[raw material]]s nevertheless experience high levels of poverty. This [[resource curse]] is one of the main ethical reasons to demand resource justice, that is, a globally fair distribution of all natural resources.

== Factors leading to resource injustice ==

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|500px| Countries' income inequality according to their [[Gini coefficient]] – red = high, green = low inequality (World Bank, 2014)]]
The term resource justice as a subcategory of distributive justice was first developed following the repeated observation that natural resources that, supposedly, are a blessing for local populations, turn out to be a curse. This can manifest itself in a number of ways – and for a number of reasons, some of which occur in isolation but more often arise together. Some examples are:
* [[Surface mining|Mining]] or [[Oil well|oil drilling]] result in severe damage to the environment, for example through [[oil spill]]s, [[environmental degradation]], or [[Pollution|contamination]].
* The extraction of resources leads to extreme forms of [[exploitation of labour]] and / or creates very [[Work accident|hazardous working conditions]].
* Resources are being controlled by a small elite that makes or embezzles all the profits. This often goes along with [[corruption]].
* People are forced off their land to make place for resource extraction or for large [[Monoculture|monocultural]] plantations.
* Resources in the developing world are being extracted by companies from industrialised countries, with most of the profits going to the latter.
* Companies extract genetic material, which is then commercially farmed or bred – and often [[Biological patent|patented]].

== Approaches towards greater resource justice ==

[[Capacity building]] and external support in order to empower "communities affected by oil, gas, and mining operations" so that they themselves  are able to determine how local resources are being used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/campaign/natural-resource-justice/ Natural Resource Justice], [[Oxfam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://namati.org/lawyers-for-resource-justice/ Lawyers for Resource Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mechanisms have to be developed to make sure that finite resources are distributed in an equitable way so that poor nations' right to development is not denied.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books/about/Fair_Future.html?id=_l9U7olOSA0C Wolfgang Sachs, Tilman Santarius, Fair Future: Limited Resources and Global Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The memorandum Resource Politics for a Fair Future, published by the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] lists three criteria for a "fair and sustainable Resource Politics", namely:
* to "secure the rights of people and nature over markets and profits" and empower them to demand their rights;
* to return the "control over natural resources, financial capital and technologies (...) into the hands of the people;
* to "transform production, consumption and livelihoods" in ways that enable people to live in a world of glbal equity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/resource-politics_for-a-fair_future.pdf Resource Politics for a Fair Future, p.12-13], PDF, Berlin 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29336">'''Science, technology, society and environment''' ('''STSE''') '''education''', originates from the [[Science and technology studies|science technology and society (STS)]] movement in [[science education]]. This is an outlook on science education that emphasizes the teaching of scientific and technological developments in their cultural, economic, social and political contexts. In this view of science education, students are encouraged to engage in issues pertaining to the impact of science on everyday life and make responsible decisions about how to address such issues (Solomon, 1993 and Aikenhead, 1994)

==Science technology and society (STS)==

[[File:ScienceOlympiad.jpg|200 px|right]]
The STS movement has a long history in science education reform, and embraces a wide range of theories about the intersection between science, technology and society (Solomon and Aikenhead, 1994; Pedretti 1997). Over the last twenty years, the work of Peter Fensham, the noted Australian science educator, is considered to have heavily contributed to reforms in science education. Fensham's efforts included giving greater prominence to STS in the school science curriculum (Aikenhead, 2003). The key aim behind these efforts was to ensure the development of a broad-based science curriculum, embedded in the socio-political and cultural contexts in which it was formulated. From Fensham's point of view, this meant that students would engage with different viewpoints on issues concerning the impact of science and technology on everyday life. They would also understand the relevance of scientific discoveries, rather than just concentrate on learning scientific facts and theories that seemed distant from their realities (Fensham, 1985 &amp; 1988).

[[File:pollution de l'air.jpg|200 px|left]]

However, although the wheels of change in science education had been set in motion during the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that STS perspectives began to gain a serious footing in science curricula, in largely Western contexts (Gaskell, 1982). This occurred at a time when issues such as, [[animal testing]], [[environmental pollution]] and the growing impact of technological innovation on social infrastructure, were beginning to raise ethical, moral, economic and political dilemmas (Fensham, 1988 and Osborne, 2000). There were also concerns among communities of researchers, educators and governments pertaining to the general public's lack of understanding about the interface between science and society (Bodmer, 1985; Durant ''et al.'' 1989 and Millar 1996).  In addition, alarmed by the poor state of [[scientific literacy]] among school students, science educators began to grapple with the quandary of how to prepare students to be informed and active citizens, as well as the scientists, medics and engineers of the future (e.g. Osborne, 2000 and Aikenhead, 2003). Hence, STS advocates called for reforms in science education that would equip students to understand scientific developments in their cultural, economic, political and social contexts. This was considered important in making science accessible and meaningful to all students—and, most significantly, engaging them in real world issues (Fensham, 1985; Solomon, 1993; Aikenhead, 1994 and Hodson 1998).

==Goals of STS==

The key goals of STS are:

[[File:waste dumping in a slum of Cap-Haitien.jpg|200 px|right]]

*An interdisciplinary [[Historical institutionalism|HI]] approach to science education, where there is a seamless integration of economic, ethical, social and political aspects of scientific and technological developments in the science curriculum.
*Engaging students in examining a variety of real world issues and grounding scientific knowledge in such realities. In today's world, such issues might include the impact on society of: [[global warming]], [[genetic engineering]], [[animal testing]], [[deforestation]] practices, [[nuclear testing]] and environmental legislations, such as the [[Waste legislation#EU waste legislation|EU Waste Legislation]] or the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
*Enabling students to formulate a critical understanding of the interface between science, society and technology.
*Developing students’ capacities and confidence to make informed decisions, and to take responsible action to address issues arising from the impact of science on their daily lives.

==STSE education==

[[File:canal-pollution.jpg|150 px|right]]

There is no uniform definition for STSE education. As mentioned before, STSE is a form of STS education, but places greater emphasis on the environmental consequences of scientific and technological developments. In STSE curricula, scientific developments are explored from a variety of economic, environmental, ethical, moral, social and political (Kumar and Chubin, 2000 &amp; Pedretti, 2005) perspectives.

At best, STSE education can be loosely defined as a movement that attempts to bring about an understanding of the interface between science, society, technology and the environment. A key goal of STSE is to help students realize the significance of scientific developments in their daily lives and foster a voice of active citizenship (Pedretti &amp; Forbes, 2000).

===Improving scientific literacy ===
Over the last two decades, STSE education has taken a prominent position in the  science curricula of different parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, the UK and USA  (Kumar &amp; Chubin, 2000). In Canada, the inclusion of STSE perspectives in science education has largely come about as a consequence of the ''Common Framework of science learning outcomes, Pan Canadian Protocol for collaboration on School Curriculum (1997)''[http://www.cmec.ca/science/framework]. This document highlights a need to develop scientific literacy in conjunction with understanding the interrelationships between science, technology, and environment.  According to Osborne (2000) &amp; Hodson (2003), scientific literacy can be perceived in four different ways:

*'''Cultural''': Developing the capacity to read about and understand issues pertaining to science and technology in the media.
*'''Utilitarian''': Having the knowledge, skills and attitudes that are essential for a career as scientist, engineer or technician.
*'''Democratic''': Broadening knowledge and understanding of science to include the interface between science, technology and society.
*'''Economic''': Formulating knowledge and skills that are essential to the economic growth and effective competition within the global market place.

However, many science teachers find it difficult and even damaging to their professional identities to teach STSE as part of science education due to the fact that traditional science focuses on established scientific facts rather than philosophical, political, and social issues, the extent of which many educators find to be devaluing to the scientific curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/ihpst07/proceedings/IHPST07%20papers/117%20Pedretti.pdf] - Promoting Issues-based STSE Perspectives in Science Teacher Education: Problems of Identity and Ideology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale and goals===
In the context of STSE education, the goals of teaching and learning are largely directed towards engendering cultural and democratic notions of scientific literacy. Here, advocates of STSE education argue that in order to broaden students' understanding of science, and better prepare them for active and responsible citizenship in the future, the scope of science education needs to go beyond learning about scientific theories, facts and technical skills. Therefore, the fundamental aim of STSE education is to equip students to understand and situate scientific and technological developments in their cultural, environmental, economic, political and social contexts (Solomon &amp; Aikenhead, 1994; Bingle &amp; Gaskell, 1994; Pedretti 1997 &amp; 2005).  For example, rather than learning about the facts and theories of weather patterns, students can explore them in the context of issues such as global warming. They can also debate the environmental, social, enconomic and political consequences of relevant legislation, such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. This is thought to provide a richer, more meaningful and relevant canvas against which scientific theories and phenomena relating to weather patterns can be explored (Pedretti ''et al.'' 2005).

In essence, STSE education aims to develop the following skills and perspectives (Aikenhead, 1994; Pedretti, 1996; Alsop &amp; Hicks, 2001):

*Social responsibility
*Critical thinking and decision making skills
*The ability to formulate sound ethical and moral decisions about issues arising from the impact of science on our daily lives
*Knowledge, skills and confidence to express opinions and take responsible action to address real world issues

===Curriculum content===
Since STSE education has multiple facets, there are a variety of ways in which it can be approached in the classroom. This offers teachers a degree of flexibility, not only in the incorporation of STSE perspectives into their science teaching, but in integrating other curricular areas such as history, geography, social studies and language arts (Richardson &amp; Blades, 2001). The table below summarizes the different approaches to STSE education described in the literature (Ziman, 1994 &amp; Pedretti, 2005):

===Summary table: Curriculum content===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Approach'''
! '''Description'''
! '''Example'''
|-
| '''Historical'''
|A way of humanizing science. This approach examines the history of science through concrete examples, and is viewed as way of demonstrating the fallibility of science and scientists.  
|Learning about inventions or scientific theories through the lives and worlds of famous scientist. Students can research their areas of interest and present them through various activities: e.g. drama-role play, debates or documentaries. Through this kind of exploration, students examine the values, beliefs and attitudes that influenced the work of scientists, their outlook on the world, and how their work has impacted our present circumstances and understanding of science today.
|-
| '''Philosophical'''
|Helps students formulate an understanding of the different outlooks on the nature of science, and how differing viewpoints on the nature and validity of scientific knowledge influence the work of scientists—demonstrating how society directs and reacts to scientific innovation.
|Using historical narratives or stories of scientific discoveries to concretely examine philosophical questions and views about science. For example, “The Double Helix” by [[James D. Watson]] is an account of the discovery of DNA. This historical narrative can be used to explore questions such as: “What is science? What kind of research was done to make this discovery? How did this scientific development influence our lives? Can science help us understand everything about our world?”  Such an exploration reveals the social and historical context of philosophical debates about the nature of science—making this kind of inquiry concrete, meaningful and applicable to students’ realities. 
|-
|'''Issues-based'''
|This is the most widely applied approach to STSE education. It stimulates an understanding of the science behind issues, and the consequences to society and the environment. A multi-faceted approach to examining issues highlights the complexities of real-life debates. Students also become aware of the various motives for decisions that address environmental issues.
|Real life events within the community, at the national or international level, can be examined from political, economic, ethical and social perspectives through presentations, debates, role-play, documentaries and narratives. Real life events might include: the impact of environmental legislations, industrial accidents and the influence of particular scientific or technological innovations on society and the environment.

===Opportunities and challenges of STSE education===

Although advocates of STSE education keenly emphasize its merits in science education, they also recognize inherent difficulties in its implementation. The opportunities and challenges of STSE education have been articulated by Hughes (2000) and Pedretti &amp; Forbes, (2000), at five different levels, as described below:

'''Values &amp; beliefs:''' The goals of STSE education may challenge the values and beliefs of students and teachers—as well as conventional, culturally entrenched views on scientific and technological developments. Students gain opportunities to engage with, and deeply examine the impact of scientific development on their lives from a critical and informed perspective. This helps to develop students' analytical and problem solving capacities, as well as their ability to make informed choices in their everyday lives.

As they plan and implement STSE education lessons, teachers need to provide a balanced view of the issues being explored. This enables students to formulate their own thoughts, independently explore other opinions and have the confidence to voice their personal viewpoints. Teachers also need to cultivate safe, non-judgmental classroom environments, and must also be careful not to impose their own values and beliefs on students.

[[File:waldkindergarten.jpg|200px|right]]

'''Knowledge &amp; understanding:''' The interdisciplinary nature of STSE education requires teachers to research and gather information from a variety of sources. At the same time, teachers need to develop a sound understanding of issues from various disciplines—philosophy, history, geography, social studies, politics, economics, environment and science. This is so that students’ knowledge base can be appropriately scaffolded to enable them to effectively engage in discussions, debates and decision-making processes.

This ideal raises difficulties. Most science teachers are specialized in a particular field of science. Lack of time and resources may affect how deeply teachers and students can examine issues from multiple perspectives. Nevertheless, a multi-disciplinary approach to science education enables students to gain a more rounded perspective on the dilemmas, as well as the opportunities, that science presents in our daily lives.

'''Pedagogic approach:''' Depending on teacher experience and comfort levels, a variety of [[pedagogic]] approaches based on [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] can be used to stimulate STSE education in the classroom. As illustrated in the table below, the pedagogies used in STSE classrooms need to take students through different levels of understanding to develop their abilities and confidence to critically examine issues and take responsible action.

Teachers are often faced with the challenge of transforming classroom practices from task-oriented approaches to those which focus on developing students' understanding and transferring agency for learning to students (Hughes, 2000). The table below is a compilation of pedagogic approaches for STSE education described in the literature (e.g. Hodson, 1998; Pedretti &amp; Forbes 2000; Richardson &amp; Blades, 2001):

==Projects in the field of STSE==

===Science and the City===

STSE education draws on holistic ways of knowing, learning, and interacting with science. A recent movement in science education has bridged science and technology education with society and environment awareness through critical explorations of place. The project Science and the City, for example, took place during the school years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 involving  an intergenerational group of researchers: 36 elementary students (grades 6, 7 &amp; 8) working with their teachers, 6 university-based researchers, parents and community members. The goal was to come together, learn science and technology together, and use this knowledge to provide meaningful experiences that make a difference to the lives of friends, families, communities and environments that surround the school. The collective experience allowed students, teachers and learners to foster imagination, responsibility, collaboration, learning and action. The project has led to a series of publications:

'''Science and the City: A Field Zine'''

One collective publication, authored by the students, teachers and researchers together is that of a community zine that offered a format to share possibilities afforded by participatory practices that connect schools with local-knowledges, people and places.

===STEPWISE===

'STEPWISE' is the acronym for 'Science and Technology Education Promoting Wellbeing for Individuals, Societies and Environments.' It is a research and development project based on the STEPWISE framework, which integrates major categories of learning outcomes - including STSE - and relates all of them to 'WISE Activism.' In WISE Activism, students use their literacy in science and technology to try to bring about improvements to the 'wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments' (WISE). Students might, for example, use their knowledge about nutrition and issues relating to for-profit food manufacturing, along with data from their own inquiries into eating habits of students in a school cafeteria, to lobby the school administration to improve the nutritional value of foods on offer in the school.

The STEPWISE framework implements some important educational principles, including:
* Educate all students to the best of their ability;
* Address relationships among different learning domains (e.g., Skills and NoST Education);
* Encourage student self-determination (e.g., via student-led science inquiry &amp;/or technology design projects);
* Provide students with an apprenticeship that enables them to develop expertise for knowledge construction, dissemination and use in addressing important personal, social and environmental problems;
* Educate students about negative, as well as positive, aspects of the nature of science and technology and relationships between them and societies and environments; and,
* Encourage and enable students to take actions to address socioscientific issues; which implies that they use their literacy in science and technology (re: elements of STEPWISE) for improving the wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments.

An important research goal/finding is that:
* educators should help students to develop expertise for knowledge construction, dissemination and use in the context of WISE Problems [http://www.lbencze.ca/WISE_Problems.html] (i.e., problems regarding the wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments);
* doing the above may encourage and enable students to conduct science inquiry and/or technology design projects that explore possible WISE Problems;
* findings from students' WISE-oriented projects may serve as great motivation for addressing WISE Problems; more so than from STSE Education, since student-led science inquiry and/or technology design projects provide students with personal engagement in 'phenomena &lt;----&gt; representation' dialectical relationships.

You can learn more about STEPWISE, including how to get involved in it, at: [http://www.stepwiser.ca].

A forum for discussing STSE (socioscientific) issues and actions is at: [http://www.wepaste.org]. This forum contains a 'community-reviewed' journal; that is, the Journal for Activist Science &amp; Technology Education.

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone STSE education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—STSE coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, so students are not paid for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8104">[[File:SIDS map en.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the Small Island Developing States.]]
'''Small Island Developing States''' ('''SIDS''') are a group of small [[island countries]] that tend to share similar [[sustainable development]] challenges, including small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to [[natural disaster]]s, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on [[international trade]], and fragile environments. Their growth and development is also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and [[infrastructure]] due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create [[economies of scale]].

The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in June 1992. The [[Barbados Programme of Action]] was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts. The [[United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States]] (UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states.

==Embracing sustainability==

Many SIDS now recognise the need to move towards low-carbon, [[Climate resilience|climate resilient]] economies, as set out in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) implementation plan for climate change-resilient development. SIDS often rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, spending an ever-larger proportion of their GDP on energy imports.  Renewable technologies have the advantage of providing energy at a lower cost than fossil fuels and making SIDS more sustainable. Barbados has been successful in adopting the use of solar water heaters (SWHs). A 2012 report published by the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] showed that its SWH industry now boasts over 50,000 installations. These have saved consumers as much as US$137 million since the early 1970s. The report suggested that Barbados's experience could be easily replicated in other SIDS with high fossil fuel imports and abundant sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/resource/cdkn-inside-story-seizing-the-sunshine-barbados-thriving-solar-water-heater-industry/?loclang=en_gb ''Seizing the sunshine – Barbados’ thriving solar water heater industry''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of SIDS ==
Currently, the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] lists 57 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the [[Caribbean]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caribbean|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1522|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Pacific]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pacific|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1523|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Africa]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[South China Sea]] (AIMS).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIMS|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1521|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Associate Members of the Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the [[United Nations]] system. The [[UNCTAD]] website states that "the UN never established criteria to determine an official list of SIDS" but it maintains a shorter, unofficial list on its website for analytical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD´s unofficial list of SIDS|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/aldc/Small%20Island%20Developing%20States/UNCTAD%C2%B4s-unofficial-list-of-SIDS.aspx|publisher=UNCTAD|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
SCCWRP is located in [[Costa Mesa, California]].  SCCWRP's original location (in 1969) was Westwood, California, with subsequent offices in El Segundo, Long Beach and Westminster before moving to the present location in 2007.

==Research==
SCCWRP’s research foci include collaborative regional environmental monitoring, development of assessment tools to characterize environmental conditions, and modeling and analysis to answer relevant environmental management questions. Significant research topics include regional monitoring of the [[Southern California Bight]], beach [[water quality]], [[hydromodification]], [[wetlands]], [[eutrophication]], [[marine debris]], and [[contaminants]] of emerging concern.&lt;ref&gt;Panel on Southern California Bight of the Committee on a Systems Assessment of Marine Environmental Monitoring (1990).

''Waste disposal in the oceans: minimizing impact, maximizing benefits.'' Boulder, CO: [[Westview Press]]. {{ISBN|0-86531-966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also works to transition new technologies to the user community, and foster communication among different stakeholder sectors, including regulatory agencies, [[wastewater]] dischargers, [[stormwater]] managers, academic researchers, [[nonprofit]] groups, technology developers, and industries affected by aquatic and marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/clean-beach-measuring-to-improve|title=Eye on the Environment: Clean beach measuring to improve|first=Bram |last=Sercu|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|date= July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SCCWRP was formed in 1969, at about the time when California’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act was passed, to prepare an integrative report about the effects of wastewater and other discharges on the Southern California coastal marine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Mearns|first1=Alan J |first2=M James |last2=Allen|first3=Michael D |last3=Moore|year=2001|title=The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project - 30 years of environmental research in the Southern California Bight|url=ftp://ftp.sccwrp.org/pub/download/DOCUMENTS/AnnualReports/1999AnnualReport/01_ar01.pdf|format=PDF|pages=2-26 |editor1=S.B.

SCCWRP's original member agencies in 1969 included the five largest southern California metropolitan sanitation agencies ([[City of San Diego]], [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]] Sanitation District, [[Orange County Sanitation District]], and [[Ventura County]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kennish, Michael J (1998). ''Pollution Impacts on Marine Biotic Communities.'' Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]. p. 151-152. {{ISBN|0-8493-8428-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, additional member agencies were added to the JPA. 

These include water quality regulatory agencies added in 1990 ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Region IX; [[California State Water Resources Control Board]]; Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board; Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board; and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board) and the largest southern California stormwater management agencies added in 2003 (Ventura County Watershed Protection District, Los Angeles County Flood Control District, Orange County Public Works, and [[County of San Diego]]). The most recent addition was the California Ocean Protection Council, which was added in 2007 to enhance interactions with the [[California Resources Agency]].

'''Stenohaline''' describes an organism, usually [[fish]], that cannot tolerate a wide fluctuation in the [[salinity]] of [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.uky.edu/wkrec/VertebrateFishEvolution.htm Wurts, W. Why can some fish live in freshwater, some in salt water, and some in both? World Aquaculture 29(1):p.65.]&lt;/ref&gt; Stenohaline is derived from the words: "''steno''" meaning narrow, and "''haline''" meaning salt.  Many [[fresh water]] fish, such as [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus''), tend to be stenohaline and die in environments of high [[salinity]] such as the [[ocean]]. Many marine fish, such as [[Melanogrammus aeglefinus|haddock]], are also stenohaline and die in water with lower salinity.  

Alternatively, fish living in coastal [[estuaries]] and [[tide pools]] are often [[euryhaline]] (tolerant to changes in salinity) as are many species which have [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] requiring tolerance to both fresh water and [[seawater]] environments such as [[salmon]] and [[herring]].

A '''stormwater detention vault''' is an underground structure designed to manage excess [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] on a developed site, often in an urban setting.  This type of [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]] may be selected when there is insufficient space on the site to [[infiltration basin|infiltrate]] the runoff or build a surface facility such as a [[detention basin]] or [[retention basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of Transportation. Federal Highway Administration|place=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/ultraurb/3fs6.htm |title=Stormwater Best Management Practices in an Ultra-Urban Setting: Selection and Monitoring|work=Fact Sheet – Detention Tanks and Vaults|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detention vaults manage stormwater ''quantity'' flowing to nearby [[surface water]]s. They help prevent [[flood]]ing and can reduce [[erosion#Water|erosion]] in rivers and streams.  They do not provide treatment to improve [[water quality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Atlanta Regional Commission|place=Atlanta, GA|url=http://documents.atlantaregional.com/gastormwater/GSMMVol2.pdf|title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. Section 3.4.3: Underground Detention|date=August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some are attached to a [[media filter]] bank to remove pollutants.

==Design and installation==
Underground stormwater detention allows for high volume storage of runoff in a small footprint area.  The storage vessels can be made from a variety of materials, including corrugated metal [[pipe (material)|pipe]], aluminum, steel, plastic, fiberglass, [[Precast concrete|pre-cast]] or poured-in-place [[concrete]].&lt;ref name="Duluth"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City of Duluth, Minnesota|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/stormwater/toolkit/underground.html|title=Tools for Stormwater Management: Underground Storage|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vault is typically buried under a [[parking lot]] or other open land on the site.  In the latter case, this underground vault may be preferable to a surface [[detention pond]] if other uses are intended for the land (e.g. a pedestrian plaza or park).  In other situations, a vault is used because installing a pond might pose other problems, such as attracting unwanted [[waterfowl]] or other animals.  In some sites, a vault may be installed in the basement of a building, such as a parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/mtb/runoff.pdf|title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: On-Site Underground Retention/Detention|date=September 2001|id=EPA-832-F-01-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnels may be bored to serve as detention vaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wfpl.org/a-sewer-tunnel-and-a-brief-geologic-history-of-louisville/|title=MSD's New Sewer Tunnel Offers A Brief Geologic History Of Louisville|last=Velzer|first=Ryan Van|date=2018-08-15|work=89.3 WFPL News Louisville|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnels may be cheaper than basins, as they do not require pumps to move the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2018/07/30/louisville-msd-cancels-basin-project-near-cherokee-park/862392002/|title=MSD was digging a huge basin near Jim Porter's but has abandoned the plan|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outlet is generally a restricted-flow drain from the detention vessel, with a weir for containing detritus.&lt;ref name="Duluth"/&gt; Detention vessels delay water's delivery downstream, and possibly creates a later water level peak post-rainfall.  It is important to consider timing of water release and the types of reservoirs feeding a waterway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://documents.atlantaregional.com/gastormwater/GSMMVol1.pdf | title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual | publisher=Atlanta Regional Commission | date=August 2001 | accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taxonomy''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wiktionary:τάξις|τάξις]]'' ([[taxis]])|arrangement||''[[wiktionary:νόμος|-νομία]]'' ([[:wikt:-nomy|-nomia]])|[[Scientific method|method]]}}) is the [[science]] of defining and naming groups of biological [[organism]]s on the basis of shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped together into [[taxon|taxa]] (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a [[taxonomic rank]]; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super-group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]] (division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum), [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] and [[species]]. The Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as [[Linnaean taxonomy]] for categorization of organisms and [[binomial nomenclature]] for naming organisms.

With the advent of such fields of study as [[phylogenetics]], [[cladistics]], and [[systematics]], the Linnaean system has progressed to a system of modern biological classification based on the [[evolution]]ary relationships between organisms, both living and extinct.

==Definition==
The exact definition of taxonomy varies from source to source, but the core of the discipline remains: the conception, naming, and classification of groups of organisms.&lt;ref name=Wilkins2011&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilkins |first=J. S. |url=http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |title=What is systematics and what is taxonomy? |date=5 February 2011 |access-date=21 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827124330/http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |archivedate=27 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As points of reference, recent definitions of taxonomy are presented below:

#Theory and practice of grouping individuals into species, arranging species into larger groups, and giving those groups names, thus producing a classification.&lt;ref name="Judd"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Judd |first1=W. S. |last2=Campbell |first2=C. S. |last3=Kellogg |first3=E. A. |last4=Stevens |first4=P. F. |last5=Donoghue |first5=M. J. |date=2007 |chapter=Taxonomy |title=Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach |edition=3rd |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A field of science (and major component of [[systematics]]) that encompasses description, identification, nomenclature, and classification&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant Systematics|last=Simpson|first=Michael G.|publisher=Academic Press|date=2010|isbn=978-0-12-374380-0|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 1 Plant Systematics: an Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The science of classification, in biology the arrangement of organisms into a classification&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W., Stalpers, J.A. eds. (2008) "Taxonomy". In ''Dictionary of the Fungi'', 10th edition. CABI, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"The science of classification as applied to living organisms, including study of means of formation of species, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Walker |editor-first=P. M. B.|date=1988|title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Science and Technology|publisher=W. R. Chambers Ltd. and Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"The analysis of an organism's characteristics for the purpose of classification"&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence |first=E.|date=2005|title=Henderson's Dictionary Of Biology|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131273849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PLgy6DWe0wC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"[[Systematics]] studies phylogeny to provide a pattern that can be translated into the classification and names of the more inclusive field of taxonomy" (listed as a desirable but unusual definition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Quentin D. Wheeler |last=Wheeler |first=Quentin D. |date=2004 |chapter=Taxonomic triage and the poverty of phylogeny |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |title=Taxonomy for the twenty–first century |editor=H. C. J. Godfray &amp; S. Knapp |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=571–583 |pmid=15253345 |pmc=1693342 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The varied definitions either place taxonomy as a sub-area of systematics (definition 2), invert that relationship (definition 6), or appear to consider the two terms synonymous. There is some disagreement as to whether [[biological nomenclature]] is considered a part of taxonomy (definitions 1 and 2), or a part of systematics outside taxonomy.&lt;ref name="Herbarium"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://herbarium.usu.edu:80/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123030604/http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |archive-date=23 November 2016 |date=2005 |title=Nomenclature, Names, and Taxonomy |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, definition 6 is paired with the following definition of systematics that places nomenclature outside taxonomy:&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt;

*''Systematics'': "The study of the identification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of organisms, including the classification of living things with regard to their natural relationships and the study of variation and the evolution of taxa".

A whole set of terms including taxonomy, [[systematic biology]], systematics, [[biosystematics]], scientific classification, biological classification, and [[phylogenetics]] have at times had overlapping meanings – sometimes the same, sometimes slightly different, but always related and intersecting.&lt;ref name=Wilkins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Small1989&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Small |first=Ernest |date=1989 |title=Systematics of Biological Systematics (Or, Taxonomy of Taxonomy) |jstor=1222265 |journal=Taxon|volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=335–356 |doi=10.2307/1222265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadest meaning of "taxonomy" is used here. The term itself was introduced in 1813 by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|de Candolle]], in his ''Théorie élémentaire de la botanique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Gurcharan |date=2004 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C&amp;pg=PA20 |via=Google Books |title=Plant systematics: An integrated approach |publisher=Science Publishers |isbn=978-1578083510 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monograph and taxonomic revision ===
A '''taxonomic revision''' or '''taxonomic review''' is a novel analysis of the variation patterns in a particular [[taxon]]. This analysis may be executed on the basis of any combination of the various available kinds of characters, such as morphological, anatomical, palynological, biochemical and genetic. A [[Monograph#In biology|monograph]] or complete revision is a revision that is comprehensive for a taxon for the information given at a particular time, and for the entire world. Other (partial) revisions may be restricted in the sense that they may only use some of the available character sets or have a limited spatial scope. A revision results in a conformation of or new insights in the relationships between the subtaxa within the taxon under study, which may result in a change in the classification of these subtaxa, the identification of new subtaxa, or the merger of previous subtaxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Nigel|last= Maxted|year= 1992|title= Towards Defining a Taxonomic Revision Methodology|journal= Taxon|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 653–660|jstor= 1222391|doi= 10.2307/1222391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpha and beta taxonomy ===
{{distinguish|Alpha diversity}}
The term "'''alpha taxonomy'''" is primarily used today to refer to the discipline of finding, describing, and naming [[taxon|taxa]], particularly species.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; In earlier literature, the term had a different meaning, referring to morphological taxonomy, and the products of research through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosselló-Mora|first=Ramon|last2=Amann|first2=Rudolf|date=1 January 2001|title=The species concept for prokaryotes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00571.x/abstract|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=25|issue=1|pages=39–67|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00571.x|pmid=11152940|issn=1574-6976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Bertram Turrill]] introduced the term "alpha taxonomy" in a series of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy.&lt;ref name=Turrill&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turrill |first=W. B. |date=1938 |title=The Expansion Of Taxonomy With Special Reference To Spermatophyta|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=13|issue=4|pages=342–373|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1938.tb00522.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; … there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetical colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable … Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated "alpha", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an "omega" taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a "beta" taxonomy.&lt;ref name=Turrill/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turrill thus explicitly excludes from alpha taxonomy various areas of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy (pp.&amp;nbsp;365–366).

Later authors have used the term in a different sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steyskal |first=G. C. |date=1965 |title=Trend curves of the rate of species description in zoology |journal=Science |volume=149 |issue=3686 |pages=880–882 |pmid=17737388 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3686.880|bibcode=1965Sci...149..880S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; Thus, [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1968 defined '''beta taxonomy''' as the classification of ranks higher than species.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Role of Systematics in Biology: The study of all aspects of the diversity of life is one of the most important concerns in biology |author-link=Ernst Mayr |first=Ernst |last=Mayr |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3815/595.short |date=9 February 1968 |volume=159 |issue=3815 |pages=595–599 |doi=10.1126/science.159.3815.595 |pmid=4886900 |bibcode=1968Sci...159..595M |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142036/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3815/595.short |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species is even more important for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as '''beta taxonomy'''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Microtaxonomy and macrotaxonomy===
{{main|Species problem}}
How species should be defined in a particular group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that are referred to as the [[species problem]]. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674364462 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC |chapter=Chapter 6: Microtaxonomy, the science of species}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1508|title=Result of Your Query|date=|website=www.biological-concepts.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170414/http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1508|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/taxonomy/taxonomy-meaning-levels-periods-and-role/32373|title=Taxonomy: Meaning, Levels, Periods and Role|date=27 May 2016|work=Biology Discussion|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073645/http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/taxonomy/taxonomy-meaning-levels-periods-and-role/32373|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher [[taxonomic rank]]s, from subgenus and above only, than species.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt;

==History==
While some descriptions of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms did not occur until the 18th century. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. There are a number of stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called "artificial systems", including Linnaeus's system of sexual classification. Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as "natural systems", such as those of [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), de Candolle (1813) and [[Bentham and Hooker]] (1862–1863). These were pre-[[evolution]]ary in thinking. The publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) led to new ways of thinking about classification based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of [[phyletic]] systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of [[August Eichler|Eichler]] (1883) and [[Adolf Engler|Engler]] (1886–1892). The advent of [[molecular genetics]] and statistical methodology allowed the creation of the modern era of "phylogenetic systems" based on [[cladistics]], rather than [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] alone.{{sfn|Datta|1988}}{{sfn|Stace|1989}}{{sfn|Stuessy|2009}}

===Pre-Linnaean===

====Early taxonomists====
Naming and classifying our surroundings has probably been taking place as long as mankind has been able to communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group.

====Ancient times====
{{further|Aristotle's biology#Classification}}

Organisms were first classified by [[Aristotle]] ([[Greece]], 384–322 BC) during his stay on the [[Lesbos|Island of Lesbos]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, E. (1982) ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Belknap P. of Harvard U.P., Cambridge (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palaeos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palaeos.com/taxonomy/history.html|title=Palaeos : Taxonomy|date=|website=palaeos.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331022648/http://palaeos.com/taxonomy/history.html|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy" /&gt; He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms ''attributes'', such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied.&lt;ref name="Roanoke"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/genomics_course/roanoke/bio101ch20.htm|title=Biology 101, Ch 20|date=23 March 1998|website=www.cbs.dtu.dk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628023508/http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/genomics_course/roanoke/bio101ch20.htm|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; Some of his groups of animals, such as ''Anhaima'' (animals without blood, translated as [[invertebrate]]s) and ''Enhaima'' (animals with blood, roughly the [[vertebrate]]s), as well as groups like the [[shark]]s and [[cetacean]]s, are still commonly used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=384–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student [[Theophrastus]] (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]''. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized can be traced back to Theophrastus, such as ''[[Cornus (genus)|Cornus]]'', ''[[Crocus]]'', and ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]''.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;

====Medieval====
Taxonomy in the [[Middle Ages]] was largely based on the [[Aristotelian system]],&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; with additions concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the [[Great chain of being]] in the Western [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition,&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, due to the lack of microscope at the time,&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy" /&gt; as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the ''scala naturae'' (the Natural Ladder).&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; Advances were made by scholars such as [[Procopius]], [[Timotheos of Gaza]], [[Demetrios Pepagomenos]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;

====Renaissance and Early Modern====

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], and the Enlightenment, categorizing organisms became more prevalent,&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;
and taxonomic works became ambitious enough to replace the ancient texts. This is sometimes credited to the development of sophisticated optical lenses, which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. One of the earliest authors to take advantage of this leap in technology was the Italian physician [[Andrea Cesalpino]] (1519–1603), who has been called "the first taxonomist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino|title=Andrea Cesalpino {{!}} Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075220/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''De Plantis'' came out in 1583, and described more than 1500 plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/deplantislibrixv00cesa |title=De plantis libri XVI |last1=Cesalpino |first1=Andrea |last2=Marescotti |first2=Giorgio |date=1583 |location=Florence |publisher=Apud Georgium Marescottum |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino#ref130098|title=Andrea Cesalpino {{!}} Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075220/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino#ref130098|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two large plant families that he first recognized are still in use today: the [[Asteraceae]] and [[Brassicaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=International Edition Vegetables I: Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae (Handbook of Plant Breeding) |last=Jaime |first=Prohens |isbn=978-1441924742|date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the 17th century [[John Ray]] ([[England]], 1627–1705) wrote many important taxonomic works.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy|title=taxonomy {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075451/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably his greatest accomplishment was ''Methodus Plantarum Nova'' (1682),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Ray|date=1682|title=Methodus plantarum nova|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/84226#page/7/mode/1up|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929060003/http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/84226#page/7/mode/1up|archivedate=29 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he published details of over 18,000 plant species. At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. The next major taxonomic works were produced by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] (France, 1656–1708).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Pitton-de-Tournefort |title=Joseph Pitton de Tournefort {{!}} French botanist and physician |date= |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075951/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Pitton-de-Tournefort |archivedate=5 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work from 1700, ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'', included more than 9000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student.&lt;ref name=Manktelow /&gt;

===The Linnaean era===
{{main|Linnaean taxonomy}}
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', Leiden, 1735]]
The Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778)&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; ushered in a new era of taxonomy. With his major works ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' 1st Edition in 1735,&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1735) ''Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species''. Haak, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753,&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1753) ''Species Plantarum''. Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|''Systema Naturae'' 10th Edition]],&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1758) ''Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species'', 10th Edition. Haak, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species,&lt;ref name="Britannica - Linnaean"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/The-Linnaean-system|title=taxonomy - The Linnaean system {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405074215/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/The-Linnaean-system|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, and&amp;nbsp;species, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Linnaean" /&gt; Thus the [[Linnaean system]] was born, and is still used in essentially the same way today as it was in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Linnaean" /&gt; Currently, plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the "starting point" for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donk|first=M. A.|date=December 1957|title=Typification and later starting-points|journal=Taxon|volume=6|issue=9|pages=245–256|jstor=1217493|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop018-019.pdf|doi=10.2307/1217493|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091529/http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop018-019.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names published before these dates are referred to as "pre-Linnaean", and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in ''[[Svenska Spindlar]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Carl |first=Clerck |last2=Carl |first2=Bergquist |last3=Eric |first3=Borg |last4=L. |first4=Gottman |last5=Lars |first5=Salvius |date=1757 |title=Svenska spindlar |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209583#page/7/mode/1up |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201181959/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209583#page/7/mode/1up |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean.&lt;ref name=Manktelow/&gt;

==Modern system of classification==
{{Main|Evolutionary taxonomy|Phylogenetic nomenclature}}

[[File:Cladogram vertebrata.jpg|thumb|right|The same relationship, expressed as a [[cladogram]] typical for [[cladistics]]]]

Whereas Linnaeus aimed simply to create readily identifiable taxa, the idea of the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] as translating into a sort of [[dendrogram]] of the animal and plant [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] was formulated toward the end of the 18th century, well before ''On the Origin of Species'' was published.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy" /&gt; Among early works exploring the idea of a [[transmutation of species]] were [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s 1796 ''[[Zoonomia|Zoönomia]]'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' of 1809.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; The idea was popularized in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', published anonymously by [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Secord |first=James A. |date=2000 |title=Victorian Sensation: The Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14098.ctl |isbn=978-0-226-74410-0 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224806/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14098.ctl |archive-date=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Darwin's theory, a general acceptance quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="Britannica - since Linnaeus"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Classification-since-Linnaeus|title=taxonomy - Classification since Linnaeus {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075916/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Classification-since-Linnaeus|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tree of life (science)|Tree of life]] representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was [[birds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-05-fossil-world-earliest-modern-bird.html|title=Fossil of world's earliest modern bird could help us understand the extinction of dinosaurs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170159/https://phys.org/news/2015-05-fossil-world-earliest-modern-bird.html|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the then newly discovered fossils of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and ''[[Hesperornis]]'', [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by [[Richard Owen]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T.

The [[cladistic]] method has emerged since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Britannica - since Linnaeus" /&gt; In 1958, [[Julian Huxley]] used the term clade.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical [[evolutionary tree]], ignoring ranks.&lt;ref name="Britannica - since Linnaeus" /&gt; A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form.&lt;ref name="Mike Taylor"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/faq/s-class/phyletic/|title=What do terms like monophyletic, paraphyletic and polyphyletic mean?|last=Taylor|first=Mike|date=|website=www.miketaylor.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801072310/http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/faq/s-class/phyletic/|archivedate=1 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncse.com/book/export/html/2206|title=Polyphyletic vs. Monophyletic|date=|website=ncse.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170039/https://ncse.com/book/export/html/2206|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. [[dinosaurs]], with birds as offspring group) are termed [[paraphyletic]],&lt;ref name="Mike Taylor" /&gt; while groups representing more than one branch from the tree of life are called [[polyphyletic]].&lt;ref name="Mike Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCSE" /&gt; The ''[[PhyloCode|International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature]]'' or ''PhyloCode'' is intended to regulate the formal naming of [[clade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/|title=The PhyloCode|last=Queiroz|first=Philip D.

===Kingdoms and domains===
[[File:Biological classification L Pengo vflip.svg|thumb|right|The basic scheme of modern classification. Many other levels can be used; domain, the highest level within life, is both new and disputed.]]
{{Main|Kingdom (biology)}}
Well before Linnaeus, plants and animals were considered separate Kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/biology/kingdom-classification-of-living-organism/5542|title=Kingdom Classification of Living Organism|date=2 December 2014|work=Biology Discussion|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073641/http://www.biologydiscussion.com/biology/kingdom-classification-of-living-organism/5542|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the physical world into the plant, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five and six-kingdom systems being the most common.

[[Domain (biology)|Domains]] are a relatively new grouping. First proposed in 1977, [[Carl Woese]]'s [[three-domain system]] was not generally accepted until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igb.illinois.edu/about/archaea|title=Carl Woese {{!}} Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology|date=|website=www.igb.illinois.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428163950/http://www.igb.illinois.edu/about/archaea|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called [[Monera]]),&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification" /&gt; with the [[Eukaryota]] for all organisms whose cells contain [[Nucleus (biology)|a nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cracraft, Joel and Donaghue, Michael J. (eds.) (2004). ''Assembling the Tree of Life''. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195172345}}. pp. 45, 78, 555&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification" /&gt;

[[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], who has published extensively on the classification of [[protist]]s, has recently proposed that the [[Neomura]], the clade that groups together the Archaea and [[Eukaryote|Eucarya]]&lt;!--yeah, Woese used a 'c' here--&gt;, would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from [[Actinobacteria]]. His 2004 classification treated the [[archaeobacteria]] as part of a subkingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, i.e. he rejected the three-domain system entirely.&lt;ref name="CavalierSmith2004"/&gt; Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five "dominion" system, adding [[Prion]]obiota (acellular and without nucleic acid) and [[Virus]]obiota (acellular but with nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.&lt;ref name=Luketa2012&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Luketa |first=S. |title=New views on the megaclassification of life |journal=Protistology |date=2012 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=218–237 |url=http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num7_4/luketa_protistology_7-4.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150257/http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num7_4/luketa_protistology_7-4.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent comprehensive classifications===
Partial classifications exist for many individual groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available; however, comprehensive treatments of most or all life are rarer; two recent examples are that of Adl et al., 2012,&lt;ref name="Adl-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adl |first1=S.

Biological taxonomy is a sub-discipline of [[biology]], and is generally practiced by biologists known as "taxonomists", though enthusiastic [[Natural history|naturalists]] are also frequently involved in the publication of new taxa.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Because taxonomy aims to describe and organize [[life]], the work conducted by taxonomists is essential for the study of [[biodiversity]] and the resulting field of [[conservation biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=London|publisher=Natural History Museum|title=What is taxonomy?|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/taxonomy-systematics/what-is-taxonomy/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152618/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/taxonomy-systematics/what-is-taxonomy/index.html|archive-date=1 October 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McNeely |first=Jeffrey A. |date=2002 |title=The role of taxonomy in conserving biodiversity |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b06/e3d09692ef9f2b464fbfb7807ff32a35ce47.pdf |journal=J.

===Classifying organisms===
{{main|Taxonomic rank}}
Biological classification is a critical component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): [[Domain (biology)|Domain]], [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]], [[Phylum]], [[Class (biology)|Class]], [[Order (biology)|Order]], [[Family (biology)|Family]], [[Genus]], [[Species]], and [[Strain (biology)|Strain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mnemonic-device.com/biology/taxonomy/domain-kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species/|title=Mnemonic taxonomy / biology: Kingdom Phylum Class Order...|date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606171902/https://www.mnemonic-device.com/biology/taxonomy/domain-kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species/|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This ranking system can be remembered by the mnemonic "Do Kings Play Chess On Fine Glass Sets?"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomic descriptions===
{{see also|Species description}}
[[File:Nepenthes smilesii type specimen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Type specimen for ''[[Nepenthes smilesii]]'', a tropical [[pitcher plant]].]]
The "definition" of a taxon is encapsulated by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set rules governing the definition of taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules.&lt;ref name="Herbarium" /&gt; In [[zoology]], the [[nomenclature]] for the more commonly used ranks ([[Superfamily (taxonomy)|superfamily]] to [[subspecies]]), is regulated by the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN Code'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/loadcachedpage?url=animalbase-code.html|title=ICZN Code|date=|website=www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[botany]], [[phycology]], and [[mycology]], the naming of taxa is governed by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICN'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|date=|website=www.iapt-taxon.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111104255/http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|archivedate=11 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial description of a taxon involves five main requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |title=How can I describe new species? |url=http://iczn.org/content/how-can-i-describe-new-species |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133052/http://iczn.org/content/how-can-i-describe-new-species |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The taxon must be given a name based on the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet (a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] for new species, or uninomial for other ranks).
#The name must be unique (i.e. not a [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]).
#The description must be based on at least one name-bearing [[Type (biology)|type]] specimen.
#It should include statements about appropriate attributes either to describe (define) the taxon or to differentiate it from other taxa (the diagnosis, ''ICZN Code'', Article 13.1.1, ''ICN'', Article 38). Both codes deliberately separate defining the content of a taxon (its [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]) from defining its name.
#These first four requirements must be published in a work that is obtainable in numerous identical copies, as a permanent scientific record.

However, often much more information is included, like the geographic range of the taxon, ecological notes, chemistry, behavior, etc. How researchers arrive at their taxa varies: depending on the available data, and resources, methods vary from simple [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] comparisons of striking features, to elaborate computer analyses of large amounts of [[DNA sequence]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Evaluating-taxonomic-characters|title=taxonomy – Evaluating taxonomic characters {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405080431/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Evaluating-taxonomic-characters|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author citation===
{{main|Author citation (botany)|Author citation (zoology)}}
An "authority" may be placed after a scientific name.&lt;ref name="AJE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aje.com/en/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/|title=Editing Tip: Scientific Names of Species {{!}} AJE {{!}} American Journal Experts|date=|website=www.aje.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021714/http://www.aje.com/en/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/|archivedate=9 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority is the name of the scientist or scientists who first validly published the name.&lt;ref name="AJE" /&gt; For example, in 1758 Linnaeus gave the [[Asian elephant]] the scientific name ''Elephas maximus'', so the name is sometimes written as "''Elephas maximus'' Linnaeus, 1758".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/carolus-linnaeus-classification-taxonomy-contributions-to-biology.html|title=Carolus Linnaeus: Classification, Taxonomy &amp; Contributions to Biology – Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|date=|website=Study.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021600/http://study.com/academy/lesson/carolus-linnaeus-classification-taxonomy-contributions-to-biology.html|archivedate=9 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of authors are frequently abbreviated: the abbreviation ''L., for Linnaeus,'' is commonly used. In botany, there is, in fact, a regulated list of standard abbreviations (see [[list of botanists by author abbreviation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biocyclopedia.com/index/biological_classification.php|title=Biological Classification|last=Biocyclopedia.com|first=|date=|website=www.biocyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514164313/http://www.biocyclopedia.com/index/biological_classification.php|archivedate=14 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system for assigning authorities differs slightly between [[Author citation (botany)|botany]] and [[Author citation (zoology)|zoology]].&lt;ref name="Herbarium" /&gt; However, it is standard that if a species' name or placement has been changed since the original description, the original authority's name is placed in parentheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annelida.net/zootax-tutor.html|title=Zoological nomenclature: a basic guide for non-taxonomist authors|website=Annelida.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316112709/http://www.annelida.net/zootax-tutor.html|archivedate=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenetics==
{{Main|Phenetics}}
In phenetics, also known as taximetrics, or numerical taxonomy, organisms are classified based on overall similarity, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; It results in a measure of evolutionary "distance" between taxa. Phenetic methods have become relatively rare in modern times, largely superseded by cladistic analyses, as phenetic methods do not distinguish common ancestral (or [[plesiomorph]]ic) traits from new common (or apomorphic) traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/classification/classification16.htm|title=Classification|last=|first=|date=|publisher=North Carolina State University|access-date=27 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414163250/https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/classification/classification16.htm|archivedate=14 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain phenetic methods, such as [[neighbor joining]], have found their way into cladistics, as a reasonable approximation of phylogeny when more advanced methods (such as [[Bayesian inference]]) are too computationally expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/mcdgloss.html|title=Molecular Marker Glossary|date=|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610123503/http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/McDGloss.html|archivedate=10 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Databases==
{{main|Taxonomic database}}
Modern taxonomy uses [[database]] technologies to search and catalogue classifications and their documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Dylan|last2=King|first2=Margaret|last3=Landis|first3=Drew|last4=Courtney|first4=William|last5=Wang|first5=Runtang|last6=Kelly|first6=Ross|last7=Turner|first7=Jessica A.|last8=Calhoun|first8=Vince D.|date=26 August 2014|title=Harnessing modern web application technology to create intuitive and efficient data visualization and sharing tools|journal=Frontiers in Neuroinformatics|volume=8|pages=71|doi=10.3389/fninf.2014.00071|issn=1662-5196|pmc=4144441|pmid=25206330}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no commonly used database, there are comprehensive databases such as the ''[[Catalogue of Life]]'', which attempts to list every documented species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/about/|title=About – The Plant List|date=|website=www.theplantlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue listed 1.64 million species for all kingdoms as of April 2016, claiming coverage of more than three quarters of the estimated species known to modern science.&lt;ref name="About the Catalogue of Life"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Catalogue of Life: 2016 Annual Checklist |url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/about |work=Catalogue of Life |publisher=[[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]] (ITIS) |access-date=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515032942/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/about |archivedate=15 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">The skull and bones of a man buried between 9,800 and 10,200 years ago on [[San Miguel Island]], in California's [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]], were exposed by beach erosion and discovered and preserved in 2005 by [[University of Oregon]] archaeologists. The remains were dated by way of radiocarbon dating and evaluation of artifacts which had been intentionally buried with him. They were analyzed, but it was not possible to extract the Tuqan Man's DNA, though increasingly better testing techniques and methods became available and were utilized over the 12 years that passed after his original discovery. The remains were studied before their return to the island, which was delayed by resolution of tribal identification and ownership issues contingent on resolution of the precedent-setting [[Kennewick Man]] case from Washington State. Analysis of the bones indicated that he was in his forties when he died, and had spent time some distance east of what is now the Santa Barbara coastal region. Under procedures in accordance with the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), in May, 2018, they were restored to the claiming Chumash tribe, for reburial on the island. The [[Chumash people]] had long occupied the island before the arrival of the first European explorers, and the find was given the place name of the island in the [[Chumash language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/special-reports/outdoors/2018/06/13/ancient-remains-discovered-reburied-san-miguel-island-tuqan-man-channel-islands-santa-ynez-chumash/670609002/ Tuqan Man, human remains buried 10,000 years ago, found on the Channel Islands], ''[[Ventura County Star]]'', Cheri Carlson, June 13, 2018.

Archaeological research has shown that San Miguel Island was first settled by humans at least 12,000 years ago, when San Miguel was still part of the larger Santarosae Island that connected the northern Channel Islands when sea levels were lower near the end of the Last Glacial period. Because the northern Channel Islands have not been connected to the adjacent mainland in recent geological history, the Paleo-Indians who first settled the island clearly had boats and other maritime technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Erlandson, J.M., T.C.

Science 441:1181-1185.&lt;/ref&gt; San Miguel was occupied by the ancestors of today's [[Chumash people]] for many millennia. They had developed a complex and rich maritime culture based on ocean fishing, hunting, and gathering. They called the island Tuquan in the Chumash language. For many centuries, they built and used sophisticated canoes, called [[tomol]]s, made from sewn planks caulked with [[asphaltum]] (bitumen). In tomols, they fished and hunted in island waters and participated in active trade with their neighbors on the other islands and the mainland.

The '''virgin cleansing myth''' (also referred to as the '''virgin cure myth''', '''virgin rape myth''', or simply '''virgin myth''') is the belief that having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with a [[virgin]] [[girl]] cures a man of [[HIV/AIDS]] or other [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Rape of individuals with disability: AIDS and the folk belief of virgin cleansing | journal = The Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9422 | year = 2004 | pages = 1663–1664 | author = Groce, Nora E. | author2 = Trasi, Reshma | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604162880 | accessdate = 2011-12-29 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16288-0 | pmid=15158626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala says the [[myth]] is a potential factor in [[infant rape]] by HIV-positive men in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Leclerc-Madlala 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = On The Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine | journal = African Journal of AIDS Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | pages = 87–95 | author = Leclerc-Madlala, Suzanne | url = http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/Health/Aids/LeclercMadlala-S_Virgin_cleansing_myth_HIV-AIDS_ethnomedicine.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-29 | doi=10.2989/16085906.2002.9626548| pmid = 25871812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to young girls, who are presumed to be virgins because of their age, people who are "blind, deaf, physically impaired, intellectually disabled, or who have mental-health disabilities" are sometimes raped under the erroneous presumption that individuals with disabilities are sexually inactive and therefore virgins.&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004" /&gt;

==History==
The myth was first reported in 16th century [[Europe]] and gained prominence in 19th century [[Victorian England]] as a cure for [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]] among other sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Earl-Taylor 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = HIV/AIDS, the stats, the virgin cure and infant rape | journal = Science in Africa: Africa's First On-Line Science Magazine | year = 2002 | author = Earl-Taylor, Mike | url = http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120115094218/http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm | archive-date = 2012-01-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin is unknown, but historian [[Hanne Blank]] writes that the idea may have evolved from [[Christian]] legends of [[Consecrated virgin|virgin]]–[[Christian martyrs|martyrs]], whose purity served as a form of protection in battling [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Blank 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Virgin: The Untouched History | author = Blank, Hanne | year = 2007 | publisher = Bloomsbury USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-59691-010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
People all over the world have heard this myth, including in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Asia]], Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004" /&gt;

A survey by the [[UNISA|University Of South Africa (UNISA)]] in South Africa found that 18 percent of laborers thought that having sex with a virgin cures HIV/AIDS. An earlier study in 1999 by sexual health educators in [[Gauteng]] reported that 32 percent of the survey participants believed the myth.&lt;ref name="IRIN 2002"&gt;{{Cite news | title = SOUTH AFRICA: Focus on the virgin myth and HIV/AIDS | author = IRIN | year = 2002 | publisher = IRIN | url = http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=39838 | accessdate = 2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Betty Makoni of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, the myth is perpetuated by traditional healers advising HIV-positive men to cure their disease by having sex with virgin girls.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2006"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Staging sex myths to save Zimbabwe's girls | author = Vickers, Steve | publisher = BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6076758.stm | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | date=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zimbabwe, some people also believe that the blood produced by raping a virgin will cleanse the infected person's blood of the disease.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2006" /&gt;

In 2002, psychologist Mike Earl-Taylor wrote that the virgin cure myth may explain the staggering rise in child or infant rapes in [[South Africa]], which is facing an HIV/AIDS [[epidemic]].&lt;ref name="Earl-Taylor 2003" /&gt; [[UNICEF]] has attributed the rape of hundreds of girls to the virgin cleansing myth.&lt;ref name="CNN 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Child rape survivor saves 'virgin myth' victims | author = CNN | publisher = CNN | url = http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-04/living/cnnheroes.betty.makoni_1_young-girls-raped-youngest-girl?_s=PM:LIVING | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | date = 2009-10-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120127030305/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-04/living/cnnheroes.betty.makoni_1_young-girls-raped-youngest-girl?_s=PM%3ALIVING | archive-date = 2012-01-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is unknown exactly how common the myth is and to what degree rapes happen because of the belief in it. The claim that the myth drives either HIV infection or [[child sexual abuse]] in Africa is disputed by researchers [[Rachel Jewkes]] and Helen Epstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61858-4/fulltext |title=The myth of the virgin rape myth |date=2009-10-24  |accessdate=2013-09-21 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61858-4 |volume=374 |issue=9699 |journal=The Lancet |page=1419|last1=Epstein |first1=Helen |last2=Jewkes |first2=Rachel }} "In the current South African case, this claim is predicated on racist assumptions about the amorality of African men..."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by research on convicted sex offenders in Malawi, where no evidence was found to support the idea that the virgin cleansing myth prompted any rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mtibo C, Kennedy N, Umar E |title=Explanations for child sexual abuse given by convicted offenders in Malawi: no evidence for "HIV cleansing" |journal=Child Abuse Negl |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=142–6 |year=2011 |pmid=21353703 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.10.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of education==
Ignorance with regards to HIV and AIDS infection serves as a barrier to prevention in numerous African nations.&lt;ref name="Connor 1999"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Focus AIDS: The myth that sex with a virgin can cure HIV | author = Connor, Steve | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/focus-aids-the-myth-that-sex-with-a-virgin-can-cure-hiv-1116662.html | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | location=London | date=1999-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has helped women such as [[Betty Makoni]] speak out against the myth and attempt to dissuade people from believing the virgin cleansing myth.&lt;ref name="Mullins 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'Virgin Myth' Behind Zimbabwe Child Rapes | author = Mullins, K.J. | year = 2009 | publisher = Digital Journal | url = http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/273698 | accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Silver Linings: One Woman Takes On The 'Virgin Myth.'

According to UNICEF, culture-based gender roles that prize innocence and ignorance in girls and that accept [[sexual licentiousness]] in men promote this myth.  Other cultural factors, such as girls being married to older men, increase the likelihood of  HIV [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] {{Citation needed|reason=Who says, what in particular.  Age differential increases HIV percentages?|date=April 2017}}. The stigma attached to AIDS also stops many people from seeking information or [[health services]] to shield their [[Social status|status]], contributing to further transmission.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2003"&gt;{{Cite report | title = Faith-Motivated Actions on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care for Children and Young People in South Asia: A Regional Overview | author = UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia | date = 2003 | publisher = UNICEF | url = http://www.unicef.org/rosa/Faith.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017210410/http://www.unicef.org/rosa/Faith.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-17 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The virgin cleansing myth is referenced in the Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. The minor character Mattumbo is stopped from raping a baby based on the belief that sex with a virgin will cure his AIDS. During the song "Making Things Up Again", Elder Cunningham tells Mattumbo that raping babies is against God's will, and invents a passage in the [[Book of Mormon]] in which God tells [[Joseph Smith]] to instead have sex with a frog to cure his AIDS.

'''Work measurement''' is the application of techniques which is designed to establish the time for an average worker to carry out a specified manufacturing task at a defined level of performance.&lt;ref&gt;Groover, M.P. (2007). ''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with the duration of time it takes to complete a work task assigned to a specific job.it means the time taken to complete one unit of work or operation it also that the work should completely complete  in a complete basis under certain circumstances which take into account of accountants time

== Usage ==
Work measurement helps to uncover non-standardization that exist in the workplace and non-value adding activities and waste. A work has to be measured for the following reasons:
#To discover and eliminate lost or ineffective time.
#To establish standard times for performance measurement.
#To measure performance against realistic expectations.
#To set operating goals and objectives.

==Techniques==
*[[Time study]]
*[[Predetermined motion time system]]s
*Synthesis from elemental data
*[[Work sampling]]
+[[Analytical estimating]]

==Purpose==

Work Measurement is a technique for establishing a Standard Time, which is the required time to perform a given task, based on time measurements of the work content of the prescribed method, with due consideration for fatigue and for personal and unavoidable delays. 
Method study is the principal technique for reducing the work involved, primarily by eliminating unnecessary movement on the part of material or operatives and by substituting good methods for poor ones. Work measurement is concerned with investigating, reducing and subsequently eliminating ineffective time, that is time during which no effective work is being performed, whatever the cause.
Work measurement, as the name suggests, provides management with a means of measuring the time taken in the performance of an operation or series of operations in such a way that ineffective time is shown up and can be separated from effective time. In this way its existence, nature and extent become known where previously they were concealed within the total.To see how much work has been done by the worker and how much salaries is given to him

==Uses==

Revealing existing causes of ineffective time through study, important though it is, is perhaps less important in the long term than the setting of sound time standards, since these will continue to apply as long as the work to which they refer continues to be done. They will also show up any ineffective time or additional work which may occur once they have been established.

In the process of setting standards it may be necessary to use [[Performance Rating (Work Measurement)|work measurement]]:

To compare the efficiency of alternative methods. Other conditions being equal, the method which takes the least time will be the best method.
To balance the work of members of teams, in association with multiple activity charts, so that, as nearly as possible, each member has a task taking an equal time to perform.
To determine, in association with man and machine multiple activity charts, the number of machines an operative can run.

The time standards, once set, may then be used:

To provide information on which the planning and scheduling of production can be based, including the plant and labour requirements for carrying out the programme of work and the utilisation of available capacity.
To provide information on which estimates for tenders, selling prices and delivery promises can be based.
To set standards of machine utilisation and labour performance which can be used for any of the above purposes and as a basis for incentive schemes.
To provide information for labour-cost control and to enable standard costs to be fixed and maintained.
It is thus clear that work measurement provides the basic information necessary for all the activities of organising and controlling the work of an enterprise in which the time element plays a part. Its uses in connection with these activities will be more clearly seen when we have shown how the standard time is obtained.

==Techniques of work measurement==

The following are the principal techniques by which work measurement is carried out:

1. Time study

2. Activity sampling

3. [[Predetermined motion time system]]s

4. Synthesis from standard data

5. Estimating

6. Analytical estimating

7. Comparative estimating

Of these techniques we shall concern ourselves primarily with time study, since it is the basic technique of work measurement. Some of the other techniques either derive from it or are variants of it.

1. Time study

Time Study consists of recording times and rates of work for elements of a specified job carried out under specified conditions to obtain the time necessary to carry out a job at a defined level of performance.

In this technique the job to be studied is timed with a stopwatch, rated, and the Basic Time calculated.

1.1 Requirements for effective time study

The requirements for effective time study are:

a. Co-operation and goodwill
b. Defined job
c. Defined method
d. Correct normal equipment
e. Quality standard and checks
f. Experienced qualified motivated worker
g. Method of timing
h. Method of assessing relative performance
i. Elemental breakdown
j. Definition of break points
k. Recording media

One of the most critical requirements for time study is that of elemental breakdown. There are some general rules concerning the way in which a job should be broken down into elements. They include the following. Elements should be easily identifiable, with definite beginnings and endings so that, once established, they can be repeatedly recognised. These points are known as the break points and should be clearly described on the study sheet. Elements should be as short as can be conveniently timed by the observer. As far as possible, elements – particularly manual ones – should be chosen so that they represent naturally unified and distinct segments of the operation.

1.2  Performance rating

Time Study is based on a record of observed times for doing a job together with an assessment by the observer of the speed and effectiveness of the worker in relation to the observer's concept of Standard Rating.

This assessment is known as rating, the definition being given in BS 3138 (1979):

The numerical value or symbol used to denote a rate of working.

Standard rating is also defined (in this British Standard BS3138) as:

"The rating corresponding to the average rate at which qualified workers will naturally work, provided that they adhere to the specified method and that they are motivated to apply themselves to their work. If the standard rating is consistently maintained and the appropriate relaxation is taken, a qualified worker will achieve standard performance over the working day or shift."

Industrial engineers use a variety of rating scales, and one which has achieved wide use is the British Standards Rating Scale which is a scale where 0 corresponds to no activity and 100 corresponds to standard rating. Rating should be expressed as 'X' BS.

Below is an illustration of the Standard Scale:

Rating walking pace

0 no activity
50 very slow
75 steady
100 brisk (standard rating)
125 very fast
150 exceptionally fast
The basic time for a task, or element, is the time for carrying out an element of work or an operation at standard rating.

Basic time = observed time x observed rating

The result is expressed in basic minutes – BMs.

The work content of a job or operation is defined as: basic time + relaxation allowance + any allowance for additional work – e.g. that part of contingency allowance which represents work.

1.3  Standard time

Standard time is the total time in which a job should be completed at standard performance i.e. work content, contingency allowance for delay, unoccupied time and interference allowance, where applicable.

Allowance for unoccupied time and for interference may be important for the measurement of machine-controlled operations, but they do not always appear in every computation of standard time. Relaxation allowance, on the other hand, has to be taken into account in every computation, whether the job is a simple manual one or a very complex operation requiring the simultaneous control of several machines. A contingency allowance will probably figure quite frequently in the compilation of standard times; it is therefore convenient to consider the contingency allowance and relaxation allowance, so that the sequence of calculation which started with the completion of observations at the workplace may be taken right through to the compilation of standard time.

Contingency allowance

A contingency allowance is a small allowance of time which may be included in a standard time to meet legitimate and expected items of work or delays, the precise measurement of which is uneconomical because of their infrequent or irregular occurrence.

Relaxation allowance

A relaxation allowance is an addition to the basic time to provide the worker with the opportunity to recover from physiological and psychological effects of carrying out specified work under specified conditions and to allow attention to personal needs. The amount of the allowance will depend on the nature of the job. Examples are:

Personal 5–7%
Energy output 0–10%
Noisy 0–5%
Conditions 0–100%
e.g. Electronics 5%

Other allowances

Other allowances include process allowance which is to cover when an operator is prevented from continuing with their work, although ready and waiting, by the process or machine requiring further time to complete its part of the job. A final allowance is that of Interference which is included whenever an operator has charge of more than one machine and the machines are subject to random stoppage. In normal circumstances the operator can only attend to one machine, and the others must wait for attention. This machine is then subject to interference which increased the machine cycle time.

It is now possible to obtain a complete picture of the standard time for a straightforward manual operation.

2. Activity Sampling

Activity sampling is a technique in which a large number of instantaneous observations are made over a period of time of a group of machines, processes or workers. Each observation records what is happening at that instant and the percentage of observations recorded for a particular activity or delay is a measure of the percentage of time during which the activity or delay occurs.

The advantages of this method are that

It is capable of measuring many activities that are impractical or too costly to be measured by time study.
One observer can collect data concerning the simultaneous activities of a group.
Activity sampling can be interrupted at any time without effect.
The disadvantages are that

It is quicker and cheaper to use time study on jobs of short duration.
It does not provide elemental detail.
The type of information provided by an activity sampling study is:

     a.  The proportion of the working day during which workers or machines are producing.
     b.  The proportion of the working day used up by delays. The reason for each delay must be recorded.
     c.  The relative activity of different workers and machines.

To determine the number of observations in a full study the following equation is used:

Where:

3. [[Predetermined motion time system]]

A predetermined motion time system is a work measurement technique whereby times established for basic human motions (classified according to the nature of the motion and the conditions under which it is made) are used to build up the time for a job at a defined level of performance.

The systems are based on the assumption that all manual tasks can be analysed into basic motions of the body or body members. They were compiled as a result of a very large number of studies of each movement, generally by a frame-by-frame analysis of films of a wide range of subjects, men and women, performing a wide variety of tasks.

The first generation of PMT systems, MTM1, were very finely detailed, involving much analysis and producing extremely accurate results. This attention to detail was both a strength and a weakness, and for many potential applications the quantity of detailed analysis was not necessary, and prohibitively time -consuming. In these cases "second generation" techniques, such as Simplified PMTS, Master Standard Data, Primary Standard Data and MTM2, could be used with advantage, and no great loss of accuracy. For even speedier application, where some detail could be sacrificed then a "third generation" technique such as Basic Work Data or MTM3 could be used.

4. Synthesis

Synthesis is a work measurement technique for building up the time for a job at a defined level of performance by totaling element times obtained previously from time studies on other jobs containing the elements concerned, or from synthetic data.

Synthetic data is the name given to tables and formulae derived from the analysis of accumulated work measurement data, arranged in a form suitable for building up standard times, machine process times, etc. by synthesis.

Synthetic times are increasingly being used as a substitute for individual time studies in the case of jobs made up of elements which have recurred a sufficient number of times in jobs previously studied to make it possible to compile accurate representative times for them.

5. Estimating

The technique of estimating is the least refined of all those available to the work measurement practitioner. It consists of an estimate of total job duration (or in common practice, the job price or cost). This estimate is made by a craftsman or person familiar with the craft. It normally embraces the total components of the job, including work content, preparation and disposal time, any contingencies etc., all estimated in one gross amount.

6. Analytical estimating

This technique introduces work measurement concepts into estimating. In analytical estimating the estimator is trained in elemental breakdown, and in the concept of standard performance. The estimate is prepared by first breaking the work content of the job into elements, and then utilising the experience of the estimator (normally a craftsman) the time for each element of work is estimated – at standard performance. These estimated basic minutes are totalled to give a total job time, in basic minutes. An allowance for relaxation and any necessary contingency is then made, as in conventional time study, to give the standard time.

7. Comparative estimating

This technique has been developed to permit speedy and reliable assessment of the duration of variable and infrequent jobs, by estimating them within chosen time bands. Limits are set within which the job under consideration will fall, rather than in terms of precise capital standard or capital allowed minute values. It is applied by comparing the job to be estimated with jobs of similar work content, and using these similar jobs as "bench marks" to locate the new job in its relevant time band – known as Work Group.

== Balayla model – work measurement in the service sector ==
The work measurement concept has evolved from the manufacturing world but has not been fully adopted yet to the global shift to the service sector. Certain factors create inherent difficulties in determining standard times for labor allocation in service jobs: (a) wide variation in Time Between Arrivals and Service Performance Time; (b) the difficulty of assessing the damage done to the organization by long customer Waiting Times for service. This difficulty makes it hard to calculate the Break-Even Point between raising worker output, which minimizes labor costs but increases customer Waiting Times and reduces service quality. 
Dr. Isaac Balayla &amp; Professor Yissachar Gilad from the Technion, Israel, developed the Balayla (Balaila) Model which overcomes most of the above-mentioned difficulties, by taking a multi-domain approach: 1) The model deploys a series of indicators for a correlation between output and Waiting Times. The indicator values are affected by service level of urgency. 2) the model determines the best Break-Even point by comparing the operational cost of an additional worker with the economical benefit caused by the decrease in WT. Thus, the model finds the best balance between worker output and service quality.
